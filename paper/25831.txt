Pigou Creates Losers: On the Implausibility of Achieving Pareto Improvements from Efficiency-
Enhancing Policies

                                           ABSTRACT

Economic theory predicts that efficiency-enhancing policy changes can be made to benefit
everyone through the use of lump-sum transfers that compensate anyone initially harmed by the
change. Precise targeting of compensating transfers, however, may not be possible when agents
are heterogeneous and the planner faces constraints on the design of transfers. In this paper, I
derive a necessary condition for an efficiency-enhancing policy to create a Pareto improvement
that can be tested directly with data. The condition relates the size of efficiency gains to the
degree of predictability between initial burdens and variables used to determine a transfer
scheme. The main empirical application is to a gasoline tax to correct carbon emissions, with
related results for other sin taxes also presented. Results indicate that it is infeasible to create a
Pareto improvement from the taxation of these goods, and moreover that plausible policies are
likely to leave a large fraction of households as net losers. The paper argues that the existence of
these losers is relevant to policy design and may help explain the political challenges faced by
many efficient policies. The paper concludes with several extensions related to this political
economy motivation.

1     Introduction

Why do efficient policies so often fail to gain political traction? Many policies are widely
viewed as desirable by economists but unpopular with the public and unsuccessful in the
policy process. Examples range from the pricing of pollution to repeal of the mortgage
interest tax deduction to free trade. Several factors may lead to unpopularity of such policies,
one of which regards the distribution of burdens they induce. Distributional concerns come
in two varieties. In one, a policy is disliked because it is regressive and disproportionately
affects low-income households. In the other, a policy imposes a substantial burden on a
particular firm, set of firms, or group of voters who mobilize to block the policy.
    In either case, economic theory provides a potential reply, which is that any such losers
can be compensated. Any efficiency-enhancing policy, by definition, creates enough new
surplus to compensate all losers. That is, any Kaldor-Hicks efficiency gain can be made into
a Pareto improvement, if the right transfers are made in the background. A regressive tax
could be combined with tax reform so as to preserve the desired income distribution, or any
firms facing lost profits can be made whole.
    The task of designing and implementing the right background transfers or reforms, how-
ever, may often be impossible when a planner is constrained to design a transfer function
that is based on only some of the factors that determine initial policy burdens or their
proxies. Constraints on the design of transfers could be due to information (e.g., preference
heterogeneity is unobserved), demands for parsimony, administrative feasibility, or other
factors.
    This paper asks under what conditions is it possible to fully compensate losers from
efficiency-enhancing policies via feasible lump-sum transfers. That is, when can efficiency-
enhancing policies truly make everyone better off? In terms of theory, I derive a necessary
condition that must be met for a Pareto improvement to be possible. This condition can
be taken directly to data. Empirically, I test this condition for the case of externality-
correcting taxes in the US, with a focus on motor fuels, when transfers are based on household

                                               2
demographics, income and geography. I find that the necessary condition fails and that a
substantial fraction of households will be made net losers from externality-correcting policies.
In brief, Pigouvian taxes create losers.
   The basic idea is best illustrated via example. Consider a tax that increases efficiency
by correcting an unpriced externality in the tradition of Pigou (1932). This policy creates a
heterogeneous initial distribution of burdens across individuals depending on their taste for
the taxed good. In most settings, the planner has enough revenue collected from the tax in
order to compensate everyone for their loss through lump-sum transfers. But, compensating
everyone will require giving back the transfers in a targeted way. Targeting directly on
consumption of the good itself will undo the desired corrective incentives, so the transfer
must be based on factors like demographics, geography or income that are relatively inelastic
and feasible for the planner. If the transfer function is not rich enough to precisely target
transfers, then the planner will run out of available funds before fully compensating everyone.
In this sense, the failure to create a Pareto improvement is due to a prediction problem; lump-
sum transfers can only undo the distribution of burdens if they can be targeted precisely.
   Summary of the paper: The paper proceeds by first laying out a theoretical framework
that derives a necessary condition for it to be possible to turn an efficiency enhancing policy
into a Pareto-improvement through transfers. I show that, for a Pareto improvement to be
feasible, the variables that are used to determine the transfer scheme must precisely predict
initial policy burdens, with the degree of precision related in a very simple way to the size
of the average surplus gain created from the efficiency-enhancing action.
   This condition can be directly tested with data, with the data requirements dependent
on the policy in question. For a marginal increase in an externality-correcting tax, the initial
burdens are measured directly by baseline consumption of the good, and the average welfare
gain depends on an estimate of marginal external damages and a demand derivative. Thus,
to check the condition for an externality-correcting tax, one needs (1) an estimate of the
distribution of baseline consumption of the good, (2) knowledge of the correlation between


                                               3
baseline consumption and covariates that can be used in a transfer scheme, (3) an estimate
of the own-price derivative, and (4) an estimate of the size of the externality.
   To take the theory to data, I use the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) to estimate
the distribution of consumption of externality-creating goods and the correlation between
consumption and covariates that could be used in transfer schemes. I combine this with
estimates from the literature of the size of externalities and price derivatives. I initially
focus on a gasoline tax used to correct carbon-related externalities. There is wide dispersion
in consumption of gasoline across households, and only a modest fraction of this variation
is correlated with variables that are likely to influence a transfer scheme, namely household
structure, geographic location and income. Only about one-third of intrahousehold variation
in annual gasoline expenditures is predictable by those variables, based on OLS and lasso
models. Using conventional estimates of the externality gain achieved by a carbon tax, I
conclude that the transfer scheme is nowhere close to precise enough to create a Pareto
improvement (i.e., the necessary condition does not hold). Instead, in the most saturated
model, I find that more than one-third of households are still net losers.
   Additional variation can be explained with correlated endogenous variables. Specifically,
vehicle ownership variables predict some of the remaining variation in gasoline expenditures,
as one would expect. Conditioning transfers to recycle the gasoline tax on vehicle ownership
is clearly problematic in terms of incentives, but even using these variables only pushes the
explanatory power up by a modest amount and leaves a large number of losers. (The preferred
schemes involving demographics and income create incentive effects, as those characteristics
will, to varying degrees, respond to the transfer scheme. In abstracting from these distortions,
I am painting an optimistic picture for targeting, which still falls far short of creating a
Pareto improvement. Below I discuss a second-best scheme that takes these distortions into
account.)
   I then show that the degree of predictability is no better for other externality-causing
goods measured in the CEX, namely natural gas, electricity, alcohol and tobacco. I interpret


                                               4
this as evidence that it will be infeasible to create a Pareto improvement from corrective
taxes on these goods, even when a planner uses an implausible amount of information to
create an unrealistically flexible lump-sum transfer scheme.
   Contributions and relationship to the literature: The theory and prediction exer-
cise in this paper are focused on the narrow question of whether it is possible to compensate
all losers from a corrective tax. But I also aim to make a broader point about how an
empirical prediction problem lies at the heart of traditions in public finance that suggest
efficiency and distributional concerns can be separated in policy analysis. The final section
of the paper offers several related extensions.
   A tradition in economics going back at least to Musgrave (1959) suggests that efficiency
and equity concerns can often be conceptually divided. Given tools that can tilt the balance
between rich and poor, like a progressive income tax, a policymaker should ensure market
efficiency, and then simply dial up (or down) the levers that determine the income distribution
to achieve the desired resource allocation in society. This is an extremely useful modeling
device, and it is favored by many who study second-best tax design (e.g., Kaplow 2004). A
literature in public finance explores the separability of efficiency-enhancing policies, including
Pigouvian taxes, in second-best constrained environments (e.g., Gauthier and Laroque 2009;
Kaplow 2012). This theoretical literature has noted that preference homogeneity is a critical
assumption in their models, but little empirical work follows up by asking how these ideas
can be implemented when there is some heterogeneity. Closely related is a seminal result of
optimal tax theory that the distributional implications of a commodity tax are irrelevant in
the presence of a nonlinear income tax (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976). This likewise requires
preference homogeneity (Saez 2002). This paper comments on these theoretical traditions by
(1) deriving theoretical conditions that demonstrate when Pareto improvements are possible
in the presence of some preference heterogeneity, (2) empirically testing the degree to which
transfers can be adequately targeted so as to undo the initial distributional burdens of a
class of policies, and (3) demonstrating the relationship between heterogeneity and empirical


                                                  5
prediction in achieving separation.
   This paper bears an apparent relationship to several strains of literature in the theory of
taxation, but it ultimately deals with different concerns. First, in being concerned with the
correlation of tax burdens with covariates, the paper is related to the literature on tagging
and targeting that follows Akerlof (1978), which considers how observable characteristics can
be used to reduce distortionary tax incentives. Second, in being driven by a root information
problem, this paper bears some relation to the literature begun by Mirrlees (1971), in which,
if the planner could directly observe everyone’s ability level, the optimal tax system would be
nondistortionary. In my setting, if the planner could directly observe preference heterogene-
ity (and all other primitives that determine consumption of the externality-causing good),
then Pareto improvements will be straightforward. Third, in considering optimal tax and
transfer schemes to correct externalities, this paper is related to a literature—starting with
the seminal work of Sandmo (1975) and with key contributions including Bovenberg and van
der Ploeg (1994); Cremer, Gahvari, and Ladoux (1998, 2003); Jacobs and de Mooij (2015)—
that derives second-best taxes on externality-creating commodities in order to maximize
social welfare.
   All three of these literatures are focused on how to derive second-best policies that min-
imize distortions caused by tax and transfer systems. My objective is different, at least
proximately. My goal is to characterize the ways that imperfect information, which results
in imperfect targeting/tagging, limits the planner’s control over the final distribution of out-
comes induced by an efficiency-enhancing reform. My empirical exercise is closer to the
literature on targeting on observables prominent in the development literature, where the
goal is to use readily measured proxies for wealth to target social programs. (See Coady,
Grosh, and Hoddinott (2004) for a review.) The question at hand in designing the lump-sum
transfer schemes is not maximization of social welfare (though that is the deeper reason why
efficiency-enhancing policies are undertaken to begin with), but rather how to compensate
the losers from the efficient scheme, with an eye on political economy, as explained next.


                                               6
   Should we be concerned about creating a Pareto improvement, or is it a red herring?
Pareto efficiency vis-à-vis the status quo is quite distinct from social welfare maximization.
If one begins with the objective of maximizing social welfare, there is no reason to prioritize
the status quo resource allocation in society, so fussing over Pareto improvements is largely
a distraction. The motivation for seeking Pareto improvements in this paper is instead a
practical one. The political process tends to favor the status quo over changes, and as such,
effecting change requires satisfying a great many people. That is, a utilitarian planner would
gladly accept a policy that benefits most people, but causes modest harm to the remainder.
But, in practical terms, even small numbers of losers can create substantial political obstacles,
consistent with the logic of collective action (Olson 1965, 1982). Empirically, this paper
suggests that even implausibly well-designed schemes will leave large fractions of households
as net losers. With this in mind, the final section of this paper suggests several ways that
an empirical prediction problem can be adapted so as to inform the design of a “politically
optimized” transfer scheme that accompanies a Pigouvian tax. This perspective focuses on
the popularity of a policy based on its final distribution of impacts. Of course, popular
policies need not be adopted, and a vast literature in political science and political economy
studies various reasons why elected officials may behave differently from the desire of voters.
I make no attempt to trace out all of this here. My claim is simply that the final distribution
of impacts of a policy among individuals is a relevant, but not the only, factor in the policy-
making process.
   The paper’s core negative result about Pigouvian taxes begs the question of whether a
conceptually different approach to solving the problem of externalities would have better
characteristics in terms of Pareto improvements relative to the status quo. If externalities
are resolved via private negotiation as suggested by Coase (1960), then all parties must
be made better off. But, the same information problems at issue here will often confound
Coasian solutions. With asymmetric information about heterogeneity, private bargaining is
subject to well known inefficiencies; some surplus improving trades will not take place. For


                                               7
non-excludable externalities affecting large numbers of actors as considered here, Coase’s so-
lution is also subject to free-riding problems. Overcoming free-riding requires the design of a
collaboration mechanism, which will be hampered by private information about heterogene-
ity. Solutions may be possible in some situations (Ostrom 1990), but transaction costs likely
limit the efficacy of this approach for large environmental problems like greenhouse gases.
Below, I also argue that traditional mechanism design solutions, like Vickrey-Groves-Clarke
mechanisms or implementation schemes following Varian (1994), do not solve the Pareto
improvement conundrum.
   In terms of the empirical application, this paper contributes to an existing literature on
the distributional impacts of gasoline taxes (e.g., Poterba 1991; West 2004) and carbon taxes
(e.g., Hassett, Mathur, and Metcalf 2009; Grainger and Kolstad 2010; Dinan 2012; Mathur
and Morris 2014; Metcalf 2009; Burtraw, Sweeney, and Walls 2008; Williams, Gordon, Bur-
traw, Carbone, and Morgenstern 2015). That work has been overwhelmingly focused on
measuring average progressivity/regressivity of taxes, whereas this paper is sharply focused
on heterogeneity in policy burdens conditional on income and the degree to which that
heterogeneity can be controlled via a transfer scheme.
   A smaller recent literature does quantify heterogeneity in policy burdens conditional on
income. Rausch, Metcalf, and Reilly (2011) use the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX)
to characterize the overall progressivity of carbon pricing, accounting for both consumption
and income channels. Pizer and Sexton (2019) analyze the CEX and similar data from the
United Kingdom and Mexico to show box plots that depict the range of energy consump-
tion within income deciles. Fischer and Pizer (2019) explore how attention to horizontal
equity influences a comparison between energy-pricing schemes and a performance standard.
Cronin, Fullerton, and Sexton (2019) link the CEX to income tax data to explore a variety
of revenue recycling mechanisms and quantify the variation in burdens that remains, taking
into account fine-grained differences in income sources. Davis and Knittel (2019) show the
heterogeneity in policy impacts of fuel-economy standards across different households in the


                                              8
same income decile in what is otherwise a study of average progressivity.1
       These papers provide several initial results that are important for the development of a
full analysis of heterogeneity in the incidence of energy policies. All demonstrate that there is
significant heterogeneity in baseline energy consumption within households that have similar
income, which are consistent with the descriptive facts I document here. Only Cronin,
Fullerton, and Sexton (2019) link their study of heterogeneity to revenue redistribution
schemes. They model several realistic schemes for revenue redistribution using detailed
administrative tax records to show how the distribution of burdens depends on the use of
revenue. I complement their approach first by modeling alternative transfer schemes that are
explicitly designed to reduce heterogeneity in burdens, and second by providing a theoretical
framework that demonstrates under what conditions revenue redistribution could plausibly
achieve a Pareto improvement.
       Many prior studies have discussed compensation schemes from externality-correcting
taxes, and careful writers do sometimes note that schemes that achieve average redistribu-
tional goals will nevertheless create some losers (e.g., Metcalf 2018, p.98). Cronin, Fullerton,
and Sexton (2019) and Fischer and Pizer (2019) both conjecture that, when there is a great
deal of heterogeneity in baseline energy usage, it will be impossible to design transfer schemes
to make everyone better off. My model offers a way to confirm their conjectures, and to show
how much heterogeneity can exist before true Pareto transfers become infeasible.2 I turn
now to a description of that model.
   1
     Some of this literature invokes the concept of horizontal equity. This concept has come under criticism
as a normative criterion (Kaplow 1989). Here, I am concerned with horizontal equity, but not for normative
reasons. This paper’s argument is that horizontal equity matters for preventing the creation of losers and
thereby improving political acceptability.
   2
     Another related strand of literature focuses on compensating producers who are harmed by environmental
regulation (Bovenberg and Goulder 2001; Bovenberg, Goulder, and Gurney 2005; Goulder, Hafstead, and
Dworsky 2010). Most of that literature focuses on average impacts by sector or consumer group and does
not delve into the heterogeneity that is the core of this study, though Burtraw and Palmer (2008) do consider
individual power plants in an examination of the impacts on the electricity sector.

2        A model of Pareto transfers

I begin with a treatment of the problem of achieving a Pareto improvement from a generic
efficiency-enhancing policy. I then interpret the model for the case of an externality-correcting
tax. My goal is to derive a necessary condition that must be met for a Pareto improvement
from efficiency-enhancing policies to be possible that can be taken directly to data.
        Costs, benefits and revenue: Consider some policy action that will create heteroge-
neous burdens, produce efficiency gains, and raise some revenue. Let heterogeneous agents
indexed i = 1, ..., N be the ones who bear initial burdens from the policy. Burdens are
                 P
denoted ci , with i ci = C so that C > 0 is the total initial cost of the policy. The set of
agents who bear direct policy burdens are referred to as in the market.
        The action yields efficiency gains of value G > 0. The gains enjoyed by agents who bear
the policy burden are denoted gi . Some fraction η of total gains go to the agents who bear
                                         P
the burden of the policy so that ηG =       i gi . Gains are assumed to be weakly positive

(gi ≥ 0). This assumption is not intended to be economically substantive, but it is used in
the algebraic proofs below. It is convenient to characterize the welfare gains per agent, so I
use ḡ = ηG/N to denote the average welfare gain enjoyed by agents in the market.3
        The policy raises some revenue, denoted R > 0. Revenue can be redistributed through a
transfer scheme based on exogenous covariates, Xi . The transfer scheme is denoted T (Xi ).
The budget constraint requires that total transfers given out to agents is no greater than
       P
revenue i T (Xi ) ≤ R. Note that T (Xi ) can be negative—that is, the transfer can be a tax
for some individuals. As discussed below, it is straightforward to accommodate the use of
additional revenue that might be available to fund transfers.
        The average funding gap is the per person difference between revenue raised and cost,
        ¯ ≡ (C − R)/N . This gap can be positive, negative or zero. A positive gap implies
denoted ∆
    3
     Below, it is assumed the gains accruing outside the market—which are equal to (1 − η)G—cannot be
taxed and used to compensate those in the market. Practically, this restriction can be relaxed by simply
scaling up η: i.e, assuming that η = 1 is tantamount to assuming all gains accruing outside the market can
be captured by the planner.



                                                   10
that the policy imposes costs that exceed revenue.
   A Pareto improvement: For an efficiency-enhancing policy, total costs must be less
than total benefits plus revenue: C < R + G. A Pareto improvement occurs when the
analogous condition holds at the individual level for each individual, not just on average.
Thus, including the budget constraint, a Pareto improvement occurs when:

                                                      X
                           ci < T (Xi ) + gi ∀i and         T (Xi ) ≤ R.
                                                        i


   To achieve a Pareto improvement, one must design a transfer scheme that delivers bigger
transfers to those with bigger initial burdens. Intuitively, the goal will be to target transfers
to offset burdens. Accordingly, I refer to the gap between initial burdens and the transfer
ci − T (Xi ) as the targeting error. A Pareto improvement requires that the targeting error
be smaller than the efficiency gains (ci − T (Xi ) < gi ) for all agents.
   The main result: Condition 1 is a necessary condition for a Pareto improvement to
be possible. That is, when the condition fails, a Pareto improvement is impossible. The
condition directly motivates empirical analysis.

Condition 1. Let ci be the private burdens from a policy, N be the number of agents in
                                          ¯ the average funding gap, and ḡ be the average
the market, T (Xi ) be a transfer scheme, ∆
efficiency gain accruing to those in the market. A Pareto improvement is not possible if the
average absolute targeting errors exceed twice the average efficiency gain in the market minus
the average funding gap; i.e., if

                                    1 X                        ¯
                                        |ci − T (Xi )| > 2ḡ − ∆
                                    N i

then a Pareto improvement is not possible.

   Intuitively, condition 1 illustrates the relationship between the size of the surplus gain
and the ability of a policy to precisely target transfers based on initial burdens. The left-


                                                11
hand size of the inequality is the average size of targeting errors. These must be sufficiently
small for a Pareto improvement to be possible. How small depends on the amount of surplus
flowing to those in the market ḡ, as well as the size of the budget relative to the total amount
                                           ¯ As efficiency gains are larger, the “budget”
of burdens created, which is summarized in ∆.
for targeting errors goes up. As the funding gap is larger, the margin of error shrinks.
   The proof of condition 1 is in the appendix. The basic idea is that any targeting scheme
will create some winners and losers. The condition asks whether there is enough efficiency
gains ηG in the market to cover all of these losses, if by happy coincidence gains are distributed
perfectly so as to offset losses net of the transfers. This is why the condition is necessary,
but not sufficient, for a Pareto improvement to be possible.
   Taking the condition to data: This condition is designed to be empirically testable
with information that may be feasible to obtain for important policies. Other alternative
conditions exist that require different information. The terms on the right hand side of the
inequality in condition 1 are market averages and do not require individualized data. In
particular, condition 1 makes no assumption about the distribution of gains gi , except that
all are nonnegative. Testing the necessary condition does not require information about how
the gains are distributed. What is required is a measure of the initial welfare burdens from
a policy ci . In some cases, for example in the case of marginal tax increases on commodities
described next, it is straightforward to estimate this distribution from available data.
   The condition is relevant for any arbitrary transfer scheme T (Xi ). The empirical portion
of this paper will try to predict initial burdens ci with a set of covariates Xi . Such a
prediction exercise can then be mapped into a targeted transfer scheme. For any proposed
transfer scheme, one can calculate the average absolute errors and check if the necessary
condition is met. If a regression approach that minimizes the size of absolute errors (median
regression) fails to generate an average absolute error small enough to satisfy the condition,
then it is concluded that no feasible (i.e., based on the available covariates) transfer scheme
can achieve a Pareto improvement.


                                               12
   In sum, condition 1 illuminates how the design of a Pareto improving transfer scheme
is inherently a prediction problem. If the variation in policy burdens can be predicted
accurately enough with the set of variables included in X, then a Pareto improvement might
be possible. What is “accurate enough” depends on the size of surplus gains—where surplus
gains from a policy intervention are small, either because the externality is small or because
quantities are not very sensitive to price, the accuracy window will be tight.
   To illustrate further and to link the theory directly to the empirical analysis, I now discuss
an interpretation of this model when the policy in question is an externality-correcting tax.
Before proceeding, note that there are related necessary conditions that can be derived that
might be useful for other types of policies. I.e., in some cases, one might know the distribution
of gi and wish to derive a condition that is agnostic about the distribution of ci .


2.1    Pareto transfers for externality-correcting taxes

I consider now the specific case where the policy action in question is a marginal increase
in an externality-correcting tax. In that case, the initial policy burdens ci are the consumer
surplus losses from increased prices. For marginal taxes starting from zero, revenue raised
will equal burdens C = R, and burdens will be equal to observed baseline consumption,
which means that only data on initial consumption is needed to measure the distribution of
ci . The average efficiency gains ḡ require only an estimate of the demand derivative for the
good and an estimate of the marginal external damages.
   A few additional details and assumptions are useful to explicate.
   The economy: Consider an economy with a good q that causes a negative externality
and a quasi-linear numeraire. The agents in the market have exogenous and potentially
heterogeneous incomes and heterogeneous utilities over q. Consumers are “small”—they
assume their actions have no impact on aggregate outcomes. Preferences and income result
in demand curves written qi (p + t), where p is the market price and t is any tax levied on
the consumption of the good. The supply of q is assumed to be perfectly elastic, so the full


                                               13
burden of any tax is thus borne by buyers. Demand for qi is assumed to be nonnegative.
Denote the baseline consumption of the good (demand when taxes are zero) as q̃i ≡ q(p).
   The externality: The externality is global, homogenous and linear, so that the total
                                                                                     P
social damages depend on only the aggregate consumption of q, which is written as Q ≡ i qi .
Marginal damages per unit of Q are the sum of marginal damages to each individual, denoted
                                                          P
φi . The aggregate marginal harm of the externality is Φ ≡ i φi . The total externality in
the economy is thus ΦQ. This notation assumes that all of the externality gains are in the
market, but this is not essential.
   The tax: In this setting, the first-best outcome can be achieved through a standard
Pigouvian tax on consumption equal to t = Φ. Rather than that tax, I model here the
introduction of an infinitesimal positive tax, starting from zero. As discussed further below,
this is conservative towards finding a potential Pareto improvement because it implies that
∆ = 0 (by the envelope theorem, R = C). The same steps used below can be followed for a
“small” tax using standard triangle approximations.
   The effects of the tax: The higher price of q causes each consumer to lose private
surplus. These losses are the policy burdens ci . For an infinitesimal tax, this loss is equal to
baseline consumption, ci = q̃i , by Roy’s identity.
   The tax also raises revenue from each consumer, denoted ri . For an infinitesimal tax, the
revenue raised is equal to the burden, so that total revenue R = C.
   Finally, the tax creates a welfare gain equal to Φ i qi0 ≡ ΦQ0 , where qi0 is the derivative of
                                                     P

demand with respect to price for each consumer and Q0 is the aggregate demand derivative.
Each consumer experiences gains from the externality reduction, denoted gi = −φi Q0 .
   The transfer function: Revenue is recycled in a transfer scheme T that is assumed to
be lump-sum and based on a vector of covariates Xi . The idea is that a transfer function will
depend on some characteristics (age, income, etc.). The transfer function cannot be tailored
to each individual, but instead can only be targeted based on those variables. I focus on the
                                           P
case where all revenue is recycled, so that i T (Xi ) = R. Alternatives are discussed below.


                                               14
In order to match the empirical application, I assume that T (Xi ) is linear in parameters.
   It is possible to compensate losers perfectly in this framework by simply rebating tax
revenue according to the initial expenditure levels. That is, if X includes baseline con-
sumption itself, then perfect prediction is possible. But, assuming agents understand the
transfer scheme, this will eliminate (or at least dampen) the incentive to correct the exter-
nality and is thus self defeating. In the exposition, the covariates in X are assumed to be
exogenous, but I discuss in the next section how the framework can be modified to account
for transfer-induced behavioral responses among the covariates.


2.2    Discussion of the modeling assumptions for the case of a Pigou-

       vian tax

The model makes a number of assumptions to deliver a tidy result. Most are easy to relax
and are biased against the paper’s main findings. I discuss them here before proceeding to
the empirical analysis. Larger extensions, including some cases where a Pareto improvement
might be easier to obtain, are discussed in section 5.
   Starting from a pre-existing tax: The derivation assumes a zero marginal tax. This
ensures that the initial consumer burdens are exactly offset (on average) by the revenue raised
(C = R). Suppose instead that a tax exists, but that the tax is below marginal damages so
that an increase is efficiency enhancing. The analysis can proceed by simply reinterpreting
the externality gain as the difference between marginal damages and the existing tax rate
(i.e., the uncorrected portion of the externality). The only difference is that, in this case,
a marginal increase in the tax will create initial consumer burdens that are in excess of
revenue raised (C > R). This just raises the funding gap ∆, which makes achieving a Pareto
improvement even more difficult.
   A non-marginal tax: The derivation assumes a marginal tax. For a non-marginal tax
increase, burdens will exceed cost, which will again increase the funding gap ∆, without
otherwise changing the problem, thus making a Pareto improvement more difficult.

                                              15
   Heterogeneity in behavioral response: For a non-marginal tax or when the initial
tax is above zero, the behavioral response (the own price demand elasticity for the good)
will figure into the burden calculation (i.e., the envelope condition does not apply). Where
demand derivatives are homogenous, no new information is required to conduct an empirical
test in these cases. But, if demand derivatives are heterogeneous, then information about
the joint distribution of baseline consumption and demand derivatives is needed to calculate
the distribution of burdens. This complicates empirical tests of the condition, but just as
significantly, it greatly magnifies the real world task of compensating losers. It will frequently
be easier to measure baseline consumption than to also estimate behavioral responses. Where
the initial burden of a policy is harder to measure, the task of identifying and compensating
losers will be even more difficult.
   Incidence (partial equilibrium): The model assumes complete pass through of prices
to consumers and assumes that welfare can focus on only consumers. Where producers of
the good also bear the burden, pass-through estimates are needed to divide up gains and
the planner must consider targeted allocations on both sides of the market. The problem is
otherwise the same. (Note that heterogeneity in pass through (for an example of which, see
Stolper (2018)) would further raise information requirements.)
   Incidence (general equilibrium): Corrective taxes can create burdens through a va-
riety of general equilibrium effects and other channels (Fullerton 2011). For example, a
carbon tax will affect factor prices. These general equilibrium effects may be substantial and
heterogenous across groups (see, e.g., Goulder, Hafstead, Kim, and Long 2018). The partial
equilibrium focus in this paper is motivated in part by practicality, but to the extent that
the exercise is motivated by political economy concerns, this limited partial equilibrium view
is likely the important one. If voters are unable to anticipate general equilibrium incidence
effects, it is plausible that they heavily discount them in forming their judgments about how
a policy will affect them. The immediate impact on prices and any promised transfer scheme
are likely the dominant considerations for the empirical applications.


                                               16
       Measuring burdens and gains: This last point segues to a broader point that the full
benefits (as well as the costs) of any externality correcting tax are difficult to measure. This
is a challenge for the econometrician, but the challenge is just as great for the planner and
the voter, which reinforces the core point of this paper. When the planner cannot measure
the benefits or costs, it is no more possible to control the final distributional effects. And,
when benefits and costs are difficult for the voter to perceive, it will be difficult to convince
everyone that they are in fact benefitting. (Of course, if they can be fooled, then perhaps
the political problem can be solved through deception rather than targeted transfers.)
       Additional revenue used: The model assumes that the revenue used for transfers is
equal to the revenue increase created by the policy. If additional revenue is available that
is costless to acquire, then this can be introduced into the model simply by changing ∆ to
account for this supplementary revenue. In this case, the condition holds as written.
       Revenue, however, is not costless to acquire. In terms of the question at hand, either
this revenue is being taken from someone else outside the market who would thus require
compensation, thereby defeating the broader goal of a Pareto improvement; or the burdens of
raising additional revenue comes from market participants, perhaps through some other form
of taxation. In this case, the use of the supplementary instrument aids Pareto compensation
only if the revenue raised from the supplementary instrument exceeds its private welfare
costs; i.e., if the marginal cost of public funds is below 1. In general we assume the opposite,
which suggests supplementary taxation is unlikely to help.4
       Distortionary transfers: The model is described assuming that the covariate vector
X is fully exogenous. Relaxing this assumption implies that the transfer scheme may create
behavioral responses to X, which raises several issues. As an example, suppose that T (X) is
   4
    To Psee this, assume some instrument raises supplementary
                                                     P            revenue from individuals equal to si with
1/N × i si = s̄ at welfare cost wi with 1/N × i wi = w̄. In terms of the model, the revenue from
this additional instrument will just change ∆ (the funding gap), so that C − R + S = ∆. We can remain
agnostic about the distribution of welfare costs, and will simply subtract them from the efficiency gains in
the derivation,P so that the net gain from the policy suite is gi − wi . Then, the inequality in condition 1
                                             ¯ − s̄). One immediately sees that the introduction of s and w
becomes: 1/N i |ci − T (Xi )| > (ḡ − w̄) − (∆
makes the right-hand side of the condition smaller (harder to satisfy) as long as w̄ > s̄, that is, as long as
private costs exceed revenue raised (the marginal cost of public funds exceeds 1).


                                                     17
rising in income (this is the case in the empirical examples below). Then the transfer scheme
acts like an income subsidy. This may have efficiency benefits that can be incorporated
into the analysis because it reduces the pre-existing tax on labor supply. Note, however,
that to the extent that the transfer function exactly offsets the tax burden across the income
distribution none of these incentives are an issue. In that case, the tax and transfer combined
leave unchanged labor supply incentives so labor supply is unchanged, as argued in Kaplow
(2004).
   When the transfer function does not offset the tax burden exactly, it may create incentives
(distortionary, or beneficial). Empirically, the slope of the empirical transfer functions and
the plausible range of price elasticities on the variables used in the analysis—income, family
structure, age and state of residence—imply that these feedback channels are economically
insignificant.
   This is not necessarily true, however, were covariates to include close proxies for the
externality that might be highly elastic. For example, suppose one included vehicle fuel
economy and commuting distance in a transfer scheme predicting burdens from the gasoline
tax. Those variables would likely have large coefficients in the predictive transfer scheme
T (X), and they are probably as responsive as gasoline consumption itself. Basing transfers
on these variables would obviously erode the efficiency potential of the gasoline tax (assuming
agents understand the incentives). Empirically, I experiment with variables available in the
CEX and find that they do not add much predictive power, suggesting that the issue is moot
in the empirical cases below. Theoretically, I discuss the design of a second-best transfer
scheme that trades-off greater prediction against these distortions in section 5.4.
   Mechanism design: The core problem in this setup is incomplete information. If the
planner knew the full set of root factors, including taste, that determined baseline con-
sumption, then the planner could design precisely targeted transfers so as to achieve full
compensation. This begs the question of whether a mechanism design approach would not
yield a more favorable outcome. That is, might a mechanism be created that would cause


                                              18
each agent to honestly reveal the unpredictable portion of their heterogeneous demand for
the good?
    Consider first the case where the tax rate is imposed and initial burdens are created, and
the mechanism in question pertains only to the allocation of the revenue through the transfer
scheme. This problem is just dolling out transfers in a zero-sum fashion, so implementation
theory will not be able to create incentives for honest revelation.
    Instead, a mechanism design approach would have to involve more than just the transfer,
such as a scheme where there are alternative tax rates on the good as well as a transfer
scheme. Mechanism design solutions tend to leave some efficiency on the table in the form of
rents to some types. Moreover, the imposition of budget balance consistent with the setup
here is typically constraining in such settings.
    For example, suppose there was simply an opt-out option where agents could avoid the
tax but would not be eligible for a transfer. As long as the transfer in those schemes is based
on the same covariates X, this scheme will necessarily create winners and losers in the same
way as any scheme analyzed in the framework above. Thus, if it creates losers, those losers
would opt out. If anyone opts out, this will reduce revenue, shrinking the transfers of the
remaining people, which leads to an unraveling. One could support a pooling equilibrium
(everyone opts in) by imposing a penalty on those who opt out, but this is just creating
losers by another name.
    With all of this discussion about the setup in mind, we are now ready to move to the
empirical analysis, which begins with a discussion of the data.



3     Consumption data on externality-generating goods

This paper uses data from the interview portion of the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX),
which is a nationally representative sample of U.S. households, from 1996 to 2016. The
CEX defines a unit of observation as a consumer unit, which is a set of individuals who

reside together and are either related by blood or marriage, or who make financial decisions
together.
   Interviews consist of retrospective questions that ask about the consumer unit’s total
expenditures on various items over the prior three months. Units are interviewed four times,
once each quarter, but not all units complete all four rounds of interviews. For the analysis
below, expenditure categories are averaged over however many interviews are completed by
a consumer unit, and then scaled to represent annual consumption amounts.
   Table 1 shows summary statistics on expenditures. Key for this paper is that there is
wide variability in the consumption of all variables. For example, average consumer unit
expenditures on motor fuels is $1,820, but the standard deviation is nearly as large as the
mean, at $1,716.
   There are two important caveats to be kept in mind regarding the use of the CEX in
this study. First, the analysis is concerned with variance and predictability of consumption
levels across households. The survey response may mismeasure true consumption either
because of sampling variability or because of inaccuracies in self-reported responses. For a

discussion of CEX data quality, see Meyer, Mok, and Sullivan (2015). Throughout the paper,
I winsorize all expenditure variables at 1% in order to trim the influence of outliers. Data
quality remains a concern, but it turns out that the expenditure data reported here implies
almost exactly the same mean gallons per year estimates as the 2009 National Household
Travel Survey (NHTS), which provides some reassurance. Further comparisons of CEX data
to data on gasoline consumption from the the data and home energy expenditures from the
Residential Energy Consumption Survey are included in appendix B.
   Second, the CEX reports expenditures, not quantities. Externality-correcting policies
are typically specific taxes (per unit) not ad valorem. To model an ad valorem tax on a
product, only the total expenditure is required. Corrective taxes, however, will often take
the form of a specific (per unit) tax. For example, a carbon tax will raise the price of gasoline
by a constant amount per gallon. Thus, to model the impact of a carbon tax on gasoline
consumption, we need to estimate the gallons of gasoline consumed by a household, based
on their reported expenditure and prices.
   For gasoline and diesel fuels, I use data from the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) on the sales-weighted, tax-inclusive, retail price of all grades of each fuel type at the
closest available geographic match to the consumer unit. That is, where the CEX identifies
a consumer unit’s metropolitan statistical area and the EIA has city-specific prices, the
consumer unit is assigned prices in the past quarter that are the average EIA price for that



                                               21
city. In other cases, matches must be made at the state or PADD level.
    For other goods, determining the price paid by consumers is more challenging. Consider
alcohol. Prices will vary widely if a consumer unit is purchasing low cost beer or high-end
Scotch. As a result, for goods other than motor fuels, I focus on predicting expenditures
directly (rather than predicted tax burdens), which translates directly to taxes under an ad
valorem tax, recognizing that this is not how a true Pigouvian tax would be designed.
    The core empirical task in the paper is to determine the degree to which demographic
variables that might plausibly be used in a transfer function are able to predict variation
in expenditures across consumer units. Table 2 summarizes the key variables used for this
purposes, which are measures of income, household size and location.



4     A gasoline tax creates losers

The primary empirical application of this paper is a gasoline tax, which is modeled here
as an efficient carbon-correcting policy. This is an important policy in its own right, and
also has advantages in terms of modeling and measurement with the CEX. The conceptual
goal of this analysis is to analyze an optimally designed Pigouvian tax. I thus focus on the
gasoline tax as a well-targeted policy for correcting carbon externalities, but I discuss the
implications of other driving-related externalities in the robustness section below.
    In this section, I calculate the relative magnitude of welfare gains as compared to rev-
enue raised from a motor fuel tax, and then demonstrate the degree to which demographic
variables can predict motor fuel consumption. Specifically, I model a small tax increase of
10 cents on motor fuels (both gasoline and diesel) under the assumption that the carbon
externality from motor fuel consumption is not corrected at all prior to the tax. That is,
I am interpreting existing gasoline and diesel taxes as having been motivated by consider-
ations about the optimal way to raise revenue, irrespective of a carbon externality. These
assumptions are designed to be conservative against my findings, as they will maximize the



                                             22
implied welfare gains from carbon taxation.


4.1       What are the carbon externality gains from motor fuel taxa-

          tion?

As described in the model, the welfare gain from a small tax on gasoline will be equal to
the change in gasoline consumption induced by the tax times the externality per gallon. I
assume that in the long run a gasoline tax will be borne completely by consumers so that
prices will rise by 10 cents per gallon.5
       The gasoline demand literature typically estimates elasticities, so I translate the 10 cent
gasoline hike into a percentage price change using the average retail gasoline price facing the
consumer unit at the time of the survey in its geographic location. I then use a gasoline
price elasticity of -0.4, which is interpreted as a long-run price elasticity, to translate this
price change into a change in gallons of fuel consumed.6 By its very nature, it is challenging
to estimate the long-run price elasticity of gasoline. I experiment with alternative values
below.7
       I use the EPA’s conversion factor to determine the tons of carbon emitted per gallon of
gasoline consumed (17.6 pounds per gallon / 2205 pounds per metric ton for E10, or 22.5
pounds per gallon / 2205 pounds per metric ton for diesel) and then multiply by $40 for the
   5
      Existing studies find evidence of high pass through rates for state gasoline taxes, with many studies
consistent with full pass through Chouinard and Perloff (2004, 2007); Doyle and Samphantharak (2008);
Marion and Muehlegger (2011). Fewer studies consider the federal gas tax, perhaps because it has changed
much less often, which impedes econometric investigation. (Chouinard and Perloff 2004) conclude that only
half of a federal tax increase is borne by consumers. If true, it would be important to consider the incidence
on U.S. households through the producer side in interpreting the estimates. I return to this issue when
discussing the empirical results.
    6
      Small and Van Dender (2007) estimate long-run elasticities closer to half this magnitude. Hughes,
Knittel, and Sperling (2008) conclude that the elasticity has been declining over time, finding preferred
estimates well below -0.4. Espey (1998) finds a range of estimates that extend well beyond -0.4 in magnitude,
but this is based on a variety of studies with varying credibility of empirical strategy. There is some suggestion
that demand might respond more to gasoline taxes than price variation (Davis and Kilian 2011; Li, Linn,
and Muehlegger 2014), though these estimates, taken from monthly changes in consumption, may be due
inflated estimates due to consumers pre-buying in anticipation of price changes (Coglianese, Davis, Kilian,
and Stock 2017). This difference seems unlikely to persist in the long run.
    7
      I assume a homogeneous elasticity. Simple back of the envelope calculations make clear that allowing
for heterogeneity will have unimportant impacts on the qualitative results because the tax is small.


                                                       23
social cost of carbon.
   All of the assumptions here are designed to be generous in favor of creating larger ex-
ternality benefits, and using the global social cost of carbon is foremost in that generosity.
Climate benefits are largely realized in the future, and the majority of benefits will be re-
alized outside of the U.S. Indeed, the current administration advocates use of a domestic
social cost of carbon ranging from $1 to $6 in rule making. Thus, while there is vigorous
debate about the right estimate of the social cost of carbon, it is exceedingly likely that $40
per ton exaggerates the benefits that accrue to current U.S. drivers.


4.2    Externality gains are much smaller than the initial burden and

       revenue raised

Because I am modeling a small gasoline tax, the initial burden (loss of consumer surplus
from the higher price) will be approximately equal to the revenue, both of which are sim-
ply the price increase times the number of gallons of gasoline consumed by the consumer
unit. But, to be more precise, I use the elasticity estimate to calculate the final quantity
consumed, and use that to calculate revenue. The welfare loss is calculated using a linear
approximation. Specifically, revenue raised from each household is equal to 10 cents times
the new consumption level, which is equal to the current observed level of consumption (from
data) minus the elasticity (-0.4) times the implied change in price (current price plus 10 cents
divided by the current price, all minus 1). The initial private welfare loss is calculated as
the new consumption level (as described above), plus the triangle, which is the change in
consumption (as described above) times 1/2 times the tax (10 cents).
   Table 3 shows these calculations for the estimation sample. The externality gains are
$8.3 per consumer unit per year on average, while the revenue raised is $90 per consumer
unit per year. Average costs imposed on consumers is slightly higher, at $91. The revenue
raised is an order of magnitude larger than the externality gain. This has an important
implication for the ability of the planner to create a Pareto improvement because, as shown

                  revenue of a 10 cent gasoline tax, assuming an elasticity of -0.4.



by the theory, the externality gains represent the “error budget” available. A large amount of
revenue needs to be reallocated via a transfer function, and the error budget is small relative
to the revenue raised.


4.3      Most variation in burdens is not predictable

The key suggestion of the theoretical model is that the degree to which the initial (pre-
transfer) burden of the corrective tax can be predicted by variables that are used in the
transfer function will determine whether a Pareto improvement is technologically feasible.
Simple regression of the household level burden on variables that constitute the transfer
function thus provides the required estimates. Below, I present results where the left-hand
side variable is the estimated household level initial burden of a 10 cent gas tax.8 All values
are inflation adjusted to 2015.
      The theory involves non-squared errors, so I present least absolute deviation (LAD)
regressions that will minimize non-squared errors. But, I also present parallel specifications
from OLS because the properties of OLS and the R2 goodness of fit statistic is most familiar.
Note that LAD will, by definition, yield lower absolute errors, but OLS, by definition, will
maximize the R2 .

    Because I am assuming a homogenous elasticity across households, this is equivalent to using initial
baseline consumption (in gallons) as the left-hand side variable.


                                                  25
   Table 4 presents the primary estimates from this exercise, with the top panel reporting
OLS results. All regressions include year of sample fixed effects, which account for any
time trends, though it turns out that excluding them has almost no impact on the results.
Designing a transfer scheme that depends on any variables that are not strictly exogenous will
create distortionary incentives. As a result, I focus attention first on the “most exogenous”
variables that are likely components of a tax scheme, which are demographic indicators for
household structure and geographic indicators for state and urban versus rural. Specifically,
regressions include state dummies, an urban indicator, and dummy variables for the number
of people in the household, as well as the number of minors, and the number over age 60.
These variables predict just under 30% of the variation in gasoline tax burdens.
   Column B adds a linear income control, followed by a non-parametric function of income
(dummies in five-year bins) in column C. These provide a modest boost in the explanatory
power, with the R2 bumping up to .331 and .356, respectively. For reference, income by
itself, without any demographic or geographic variables, explains only about 15% of variation
(results not shown). Column C is my preferred specification. It is based on characteristics
that are already part of the tax system, and could plausibly be used to design a tax reform
or transfer scheme that accompanies an externality-correcting tax.
   The unexplained variation in this specification is far too large to achieve a Pareto im-
provement. The average absolute error allows for direct comparison with the welfare gains
from the externality. The residuals are around $45 per household. This compares to the
$8.25 welfare gain. This is directly related to Condition 1: as long as the absolute average
error exceeds twice the welfare gain, a Pareto improvement is not possible. Moreover, it is
not just a matter of a few people being left as net losers. The best fitted scheme leaves more
than one-third of households as net losers, even with the generous assumptions employed
throughout.
   Column D adds some clearly endogenous variables that would create significant distor-
tions and are thus likely problematic variables for inclusion in a transfer scheme, including

and dummies for the number leased. These variables do provide an additional boost to ex-
planatory power, but even with vehicle ownership variables included, the variables explain
less than half of the variation.

absolute error for identical specifications, but only by a very small amount.

all households are rebated an equal share of the revenue. A similar fraction of households are

implies a welfare loss. Results for equal per household transfer in transparent. Solid green indicates results
for transfer scheme based on specification C in Table 4. The net impact is the private welfare loss, net of
the targeted transfer scheme, net of the externality gain, which is assumed to be equal to each household.


net losers under both of these scenarios, but targeting radically reshapes the distribution.
    The variables chosen here are the ones that are most likely to be used for a transfer
scheme that operates through the tax code. The tax code is essentially a function of income
and demographic structure of the household. As such, I interpret the results of Table 4 as
demonstrating that gasoline expenditures are not predicted well enough to come remotely
close to enabling a Pareto improvement. A Pareto improvement is not feasible.
    It is worth restating the nature of the prediction dilemma at this point. Given informa-
tion directly on baseline fuel consumption, the planner could simply rebate every household
exactly the burden imposed on it. But, if households understand this, then it completely
(or at least significantly) undoes the price incentive—gasoline is not more expensive because
the tax increase is rebated back, so there will be no externality gain. The thought experi-
ment here is whether exogenous variables, like demographics and location of residence, are

sufficient predictors. Of course even these variables are manipulable over time and not truly
exogenous. I say more about how to think about that issue and how to incorporate interme-
diate variables (things that are likely responsive to a transfer scheme but are not gasoline
expenditures itself) in section 5.4.


4.4    Machine learning marginally improves prediction

The problem posited here is fundamentally a prediction problem. It is thus a natural ap-
plication for machine learning. A simple version is pursued here to see if initial steps can
dramatically improve prediction.
   Table 5 reports results of lasso regressions that predict the variation in tax burdens. The
first column repeats column C from Table 4 for reference. The second column reports results
from a lasso regression on the same variables to check for overfitting in the main specification.
The specification uses a 10-fold cross validation and experiments with a range of lasso penalty
parameters. Results suggest minimal overfitting. Lasso chooses a zero coefficient on 29 out
of 166 variables, but this results in economically insignificant changes to prediction accuracy.

                                                  29
   The third column introduces several thousand additional variables and uses the same 10-
fold cross validation to select variables for inclusion, with the lasso penalty parameter chosen
endogenously by the optimizer. Because the main specification includes predominantly bi-
nary dummy variables, the focus is on interactions, rather than higher order polynomials.
The third column includes interactions of every income category and income linearly with
year, state dummies, urban indicator, family size dummies, number in household under 18
dummies, number in household over 64 dummies, and a dummy for marital status. State by
year fixed effects are also included. Despite selecting over 1,800 variables for inclusion, the
improvement in prediction is minimal, and, from the point of view of achieving a Pareto im-
provement, barely perceptible. Additional experimentation with other interactions of these
core variables produced similar results.
   This is only a basic attempt to introduce prediction methods, but the lack of significant
improvement from broader specification searches suggests that the variation in the burdens in
the CEX is not predictable with the set of cross-sectional measures (household demographics,
location of residence, and income) that is most plausibly usable as part of the tax code.


4.5    Robustness to parameter choices

In this section, I present results that alter three assumptions about the data. First and
most simply, I increase the number of data points that are winsorized. Second, I modify the
elasticity of gasoline consumption from -0.4 to -0.6 and then -0.8, to reflect higher estimates
from the literature. Greater elasticities are important because they will lead to greater
welfare gains, which aids the elimination of losers. Third, I greatly increase the externality
per gallon of gasoline consumed, from around $0.31 to $2.
   The higher latter number is based on accounting for non-greenhouse gas emissions from
motor fuel consumption. Harrington, Parry, and Walls (2007) survey the literature and
conclude that greenhouse gas emissions externalities are quite modest compared to accident
and congestion externalities. A gas tax is a very poor instrument for targeting congestion,

           as listed in the first three columns.



and a mediocre at best instrument for targeting accidents or local air pollution. Nevertheless,
I now show cases where the gas tax could have much larger benefits in order to compare
results.
   In arriving at a $2 per gallon externality, I modify the values from Harrington, Parry,
and Walls (2007) to account for a higher accident externality, at $0.91 per gallon based on
Anderson and Auffhammer (2014), but interpret the carbon benefits as negligible. I then
subtract off the sales-weighted average gas tax in the US of $0.48. In terms of the literature
on second-best gasoline taxes, however, note that this is still a generous interpretation in
that it ignores fiscal interactions that exacerbate labor market distortions. Parry and Small
(2005), for instance, argue that the second-best tax is only around 60% of marginal damages
due to fiscal interactions.
   Table 6 uses targeted transfers from specification C from Table 4, under alternative as-
sumptions, to calculate the number of households that are net losers. Dramatically increasing
the interpreted externality gain per mile roughly halves the number of households who are
net losers from a gasoline tax. Increase the elasticity of gasoline consumption to much higher
rates further drives down the fraction of losers. In this scenario, the number of net losers is
driven down to 6%. This is a modest number, but it should be kept in mind that there are
many generous assumptions deployed in this case, so it should be interpreted as a frontier



                                                    31
possibility rather than a realistic point estimate. Even in this case, some households are net
losers. Finally, taking all of the prior assumptions and also winsorizing a full 10% of the
data drives down the number of losers to 3%.


4.6    Other externality-correcting taxes are similar

The focus of this paper empirically is on a gasoline tax, but the CEX enables me to make
quick assessment of the degree of predictability of other consumption categories that might
be the focus of sin taxes. A gas tax has the advantage that it is relatively easy to translate
expenditure data into quantities using gasoline price information, and hence to estimate the
impact of a specific (per gallon) gasoline tax. The impact of other sin taxes is more difficult
to determine because the goods are more heterogenous (e.g., there are many types of alcohol)
and are subject to non-linear prices (e.g., two-part tariffs for electricity and natural gas).
   Nevertheless, a broad picture of heterogeneity and predictability can be gained by simply
regressing total expenditures in these categories on the demographic variables to see how
much of the baseline expenditure variation is predictable. This exercise would exactly mimic
the burden of an ad valorem sin tax, and they likely come close to mimicking the scale effect
of sin tax levied per unit of the sin good in question.
   Note that Table 1 shows that electricity has a similar coefficient of variation with motor
fuels, but that other categories have even larger variability. OLS regressions in Table 7 shows
the same pattern in terms of predictability. Electricity consumption is very similar in its
predictability to motor fuels, but other sin goods are substantially harder to predict.
   This analysis is incomplete, as it does not account for the welfare gains and is based
on an ad hoc assumption about how a corrective tax would impact prices. But, the results
suggest that a gasoline tax is likely the easiest place to achieve broad gains, and that the
other externality-creating goods are likely to create even larger numbers of losers because of
the greater inability to predict variation in baseline expenditures.

5         Constructive next steps

The thesis of this paper is fundamentally negative. Not all losers can be compensated. This
is an important observation, but it is also an unsatisfying place to stop. Several questions
suggest themselves as next steps. I explore a few in this section, beginning with a discussion
of several situations in which a Pareto improvement might be possible.


5.1        When might a Pareto improvement be achievable?

Benefits taxes: Intuitively, it should be easier to create a Pareto improvement where the
welfare gains gi are tightly correlated with the burdens ci . Benefits taxes, for example, are
intended to have this feature. Relatedly, Hall (2018) argues that congestion pricing can
create a Pareto improvement. This possibility is due in part to the fact that the efficiency
gains are closely tied to burdens; those paying a toll are paying directly for the benefit of
reduced congestion.9 Similarly, alcohol, cigarettes and sugary beverages are goods that may
lead to externalities, but are often assumed to also be the source of internalities, such that
the welfare improvements are concentrated among the heaviest users of the products.10
        A close correlation between burdens and efficiency gains will imply that the net distri-
bution of costs is less dispersed, which will compress the distribution of losses. Even so,
Condition 1 is derived for a generic distribution of gains gi , so the result holds regardless of
how tight is the correlation between ci and gi .
        Historical baselines: Another approach is to try to use historical baseline consumption
to form the transfer scheme, which is the normal method in pollution permit allocations for
firms (Schmalensee and Stavins 2017). This is harder to envision for households, though not
impossible. It must accommodate entry and exit of households into the economy. It must
    9
      The Pareto result in that paper hinges, however, on a claim that congestion actually reduces total
throughput, which engenders a partial pooling equilibrium where some can opt out without leading to
unraveling.
   10
      Allcott, Lockwood, and Taubinsky (2018) analyze optimal corrective tax policy in the presence of het-
erogeneous internalities. The internality argument is sometimes said to hold for energy-consuming goods
if consumers undervalue efficiency, though the evidence of significant behavioral biases is not clear (Allcott
and Greenstone 2012).

also maintain a credible initial baseline that is not updated.
   Broader policy packages: The focus of this paper is on considering a single corrective
tax and the transfers that can be created with the revenue raised. If such a policy struggles
to create a Pareto improvement, it begs the question of whether a broader set of policies
considered together can yield a different result (i.e., fewer losers). This is related to the issue
of logrolling. Here the question is whether multiple taxes taken together may create a less
diffuse (or more predictable) distribution of burdens, which will occur for corrective taxes if
the consumption of various goods are negatively correlated across agents. The fact that the
combined raw energy expenditures are more predictable than each of the categories taken
separately hints that this possibility may have empirical relevance.
   Distributional implications of tax reductions or public expenditures: Another
issue is that the revenue could be spent on public goods and services, rather than returned
lump sum. Or, it could be used to lower particular taxes. These alternatives would further
alter the distribution of burdens. It could be that this creates greater concentration of
burdens, but it seems more likely that it creates further dispersion, as found in Cronin,
Fullerton, and Sexton (2019) for the case of carbon taxes, thereby only making the problem
harder.


5.2    Characterizing the trade-off between losses and revenue

This paper focuses on schemes where the budget available for transfers to compensate losers
is equal to the revenue raised from the tax. The motivation is that this clearly isolates the
possibility of a Pareto improvement, as compared to an identical economy with no corrective
tax. In reality, there is no requirement that transfers use all of the revenue, nor is there a
prohibition against using extra revenue taken from general funds.
   In fact, efficiency dictates that all revenue from a corrective tax should be used to lower
preexisting distortionary taxes (e.g., see Goulder 1995). Using revenue to compensate losers
thus comes at a cost. As such, a policymaker might want to characterize the trade-off

between loser compensation and revenue outlays. I describe one way of doing that here.
       Specifically, I assume that the transfer function would be targeted so as to minimize
typical losses for the case where outlays equal tax revenue, and that to scale outlays up
or down, the transfer function for all households is scaled proportionally. I.e., consider an
estimate of the targeting function, T (Xi ) that would be used if all revenue were reallocated
                                                                                P
to consumers. Then write the total outlays as a fraction of revenue as θ = i T (Xi )/R.
When θ = 1, all revenue is spent on transfers. When θ = 2, the outlay is double the revenue
brought in by the tax.
       I assume that individual transfers are all scaled proportionately, so that the transfer
to consumer i is θT (Xi ). Under this assumption, it is straightforward to characterize the
number of losers, the average loss among losers, the variance in loss among losers, or other
statistical moments that a decision maker might find useful in deciding how much revenue
should be spent on compensation.11
       Figure 2 plots the fraction of households who are net losers from the ten-cent gas tax
modeled above as a function of the targeted transfer scheme and the outlay ratio θ. The

     Proportional scaling may not be the optimal scheme, depending on the rationale for being concerned
with losers. It is, however, an intuitive assumption and it is employed here to provide a tractable summary
of information that a policymaker might use to make decisions. I discuss optimal transfers further below.

solid line shows results assuming that the targeting function is based on the predicted values
from the specification in column C of table 4. For comparison, the dashed line shows the
same fraction of losers under the assumption that all revenue is returned equally to each
household. For either scheme, as expected, the fraction of losers sharply declines as outlays
increase. Interestingly, there is little difference between the fraction who are losers between
the targeted and untargeted schemes.
   The value of targeting is more readily apparent when looking at the distribution of losses
among losers as a function of revenue, which is plotted in figure 3. The left panel shows
the average loss (conditional on a household being a net loser). Average losses among losers
decline significantly as outlays increase, and they are much lower under targeting. The same
is true for the standard deviation in losses (conditional on a household being a net loser),
which is shown in the right panel.
   Comparing the dashed and solid lines illustrates to the policymaker the value of targeting,
and the slopes of the lines capture the trade-off between valuable revenue and compensating
losers. For a decision maker concerned with achieving some degree of compensation, these
types of statistics can convey valuable information. To fully evaluate alternative transfer
schemes and decide how much revenue is worth dedicating to compensation, one requires a
model of optimal loser compensation, which I turn to next.


5.3    Towards a politically optimized transfer scheme

This paper is fundamentally an exploration of how targeted transfers can alter the political
prospects of efficiency-enhancing policies. The point of this paper is that one easy and
appealing political solution—to say that everyone gains—will often be infeasible. Instead,
transfer schemes will create winners and losers.
   A next step would be to describe the “politically optimal” transfer allocation to accom-
pany a Pigouvian tax (i.e., what is the transfer scheme that maximizes political support for
a given tax?). A full investigation of this question is beyond the scope of his paper, but I


                                              38
make a few initial observations here.
       Political targeting: First, note that a targeting scheme is well suited to the task of
neutralizing political blocs. If a targeting scheme is based on predicted damages, the inclusion
of any variable in the targeting equation would ensure that consumers with that characteristic
are not losers on average. Thus, to the extent that a group of voters or stakeholders are
deemed critical to the political survival of a policy, putting that variable into the transfer
prediction equation immediately creates a balance between winners and losers.
       Perhaps the most obvious example is geography. If a transfer function, for example,
includes state dummy variables, then winners and losers will not be concentrated among
any state. More precisely, the average residual within each state will be zero, so that, for
example, no senators would have constituents who lose on average.12
       Alternative loss functions: If the goal was to minimize the number of losers, a planner
would begin with a different loss function (neither OLS nor LAD). The LAD loss function is
the correct one for checking a necessary condition for a Pareto improvement, but if the true
motivation for the exercise is a political economy one, then it might be the case that the
planner wishes to limit the number of losers to some politically acceptable number or more
generally to control the distribution of losses.
       A loss function that minimizes the number of losers is easy to program mathematically,
but it will have impractical properties. A loser minimizing program would likely take the
richest person in the sample and take all of their money in the form of a negative lump sum
transfer so as to enhance the budget available for others. Some other restrictions are needed
to yield useful results.
       As a suggestive next step, I explore two alternative loss functions and show how op-
timizing against them changes the final distribution of burdens, as compared to an OLS
benchmark. One way of capturing the notion of a desire to minimize losses, as opposed to
  12
    This statement relates to the case where revenue outlay is equal to initial private burden, ignoring
the distribution of gains. If gains are concentrated among groups, the prediction equation can be done on
estimated net burdens to restore the result.



                                                   39
simply accurately predict damages, is to introduce an asymmetry in the loss function. For
example, a planner might not care at all about winners, but instead cares only about mini-
mizing losers, but with a quadratic loss function for losses. Mathematically, this example is
expressed with the following objective function, where the revenue constraint is included:

                                    X                                   X

Figure shows distribution of net losses (positive vales) and gains (negative values) for baseline symmetric loss
function (OLS), and for the asymmetric loss function in expression 1. Targeting is based on same covariates
that are included in column C, table 4.

    The optimal linear in parameters transfer function for expression 1 can be solved numer-
ically. Note that even though the objective function does not value minimizing gains, the
budget constraint implies a penalty for gains, so the results may not differ dramatically from
OLS. Results are displayed in Figure 4 which plots the distribution of net gains for two poli-
cies that satisfy the same revenue constraint and target based on the same set of covariates
(those used in column C of Table 4). The green histogram represents the distribution of net
losses produced by OLS, where the white histogram represents the distribution of net losses

                                                          40
from the asymmetric loss function.
   The differences are subtle. The asymmetric loss function somewhat reduces the right tail
(the most extreme losers), and has a less peaked distribution. Even so, a regression of one
set of residuals on the other produces an R2 of 0.95 with a slope very close to one, suggesting
that differences in the final outcome are small.
   A second way of modifying the loss function to care more about losers is to change the
exponent on the loss function.Median regression is less sensitive to outliers than is OLS.
Here, we might be interested in being more sensitive to outliers, so that the transfer scheme
is skewed more towards attempting to “reach” the biggest losers.
   A parsimonious way to capture this idea is to specify a class of objective functions that
minimize the absolute value of residuals raised to a power, denoted ρ:

                               X                             X
                         min       |ci − T (Xi )|ρ    s.t.       T (Xi ) ≤ R.              (2)
                           T
                               i                             i


This loss function nests OLS (ρ = 2) and median regression (ρ = 1). When ρ > 2, the loss
function will put more weight on reducing the extreme outcomes, as compared to OLS.
   To explore the sensitivity of final outcomes to this alternative objective function, I es-
timate a series of regressions for values of ρ ranging from 1 to 4, using a common set of
covariates (those used in column C of table 4). As in the case of the asymmetric loss func-
tion, the distribution of net losses that emerges from numerical optimization differs only
modestly across specifications. The distribution of losses is right skewed, and the most
notable change across specifications is in the right tail (the biggest losers).
   Figure 5 summarizes the impact on the right tail of the distribution by plotting the 90th,
95th and 99th percentiles of the net loss distribution, along with the skewness of the net
loss distribution, as a function of ρ. These extreme data points decline as ρ increases, as
expected, though the differences do not seem dramatic from an economic standpoint.
   In brief, preliminary exploration of two alternative loss functions show the potential to

think about optimizing the transfer scheme according to alternative criteria. They also,
however, suggest that differences in the final distribution may be small. The magnitude
of differences are due in part to the limited ability of the available covariates to predict
consumption losses. Intuitively, with better predictability, the distribution of optimal net
losses should differ more across specifications.
    A more general model: Here I briefly describe a more general problem that posits
some mapping between net outcomes and an individual’s political support from a policy and
then asks how the transfer program would be designed to maximize the popularity of the
policy.
    Let the function P P I map net burdens (ci − T (Xi )) into support for the policy. Then,
a planner who wishes to maximize aggregate (summed) support from the policy will solve:

                               X                                    X
                         max         αi P P I(ci − T (Xi )) s.t.          T (Xi ) ≤ R,
                           T
                                 i                                    i


where αi are the possibly heterogenous influence weights of each individual. With an esti-
mated or calibrated P P I function, one can solve this problem in order to characterize the
transfer scheme that maximizes popularity for the policy.13
    With an estimated or calibrated P P I function, one can solve this problem numerically.
The mapping P P I could be asymmetric in losses and gains, it might level out, and it might
have particularly steep regions. Regardless, the setup suggests how this paper’s key insight
about prediction would carry forward—regardless of the exact shape of the P P I function,
the planner’s ability to accurately predict burdens with variables in the transfer function will
determine the level of control the planner enjoys over the final distribution of net burdens.
Better prediction will thus lead to higher values of the sum of the P P I function.
  13
     This is distinct from other ways of making the policy more politically successful, including altering the
externality-correcting tax itself. It is also distinct from principal-agent problems in the policymaking process.

5.4    Second-best transfer schemes with endogenous covariates

Until now, this paper has not discussed efficiency trade-offs because the efficiency-enhancing
policy (the Pigouvian tax) is taken as given and the transfer assumption is assumed to
be based on exogenous covariates. Allowing for endogeneity in the covariates introduces
trade-offs between loser compensation and efficiency, and it offers a distinct perspective on
second-best transfer design. I discuss two versions of this trade-off, explained via the example
of the gasoline tax.
   Proxy targeting: The exercise in this paper is premised on the idea that a planner
cannot simply return tax revenue back to households based directly on their consumption of
gasoline because this would effectively undo the incentive to reduce consumption. That is,
gasoline consumption itself cannot be a covariate in X.
   Even so, it might be possible to base the transfer scheme on inputs or close proxies
that sacrifice some efficiency in externality mitigation (G shrinks) in exchange for improved
targeting. I call this proxy targeting. For example, several factors determine a household’s
gasoline consumption, including the fuel economy of their vehicles, commuting distance,
driving style and transit options. The efficiency appeal of a Pigouvian tax on gasoline is
that it creates incentives for substitution along all of these margins.
   The idea in proxy targeting is to condition transfers on some factors that determine the
externality. This will dampen (or eliminate) the mitigation that comes through that margin
and induce distortions along that margin, which sacrifices some efficiency gains, but perhaps
in exchange for improved targeting. If some factor is highly correlated with consumption
but not very responsive to a Pigouvian tax, it is a candidate factor. Commuting distance,
for example, might explain a lot of the residual variation in consumption but represent a
small part of the welfare gains, as it is probably quite inelastic.
   In terms of achieving a Pareto improvement, one can see directly from Condition 1 that
adding any variable that lowers G and lowers the average absolute error will make the
condition easier to meet if and only if the reduction in the average welfare externality gain


                                               44
is less than half the reduction in the average absolute targeting error. Adding a proxy or
input that has that characteristic would make achieving a Pareto improvement easier.
       Orthogonal distortions: The other issue is the possible distortion of markets other
than the externality-creating good itself. When the covariates in X are endogenous, the
introduction of a transfer that is based on these covariates can induce distortions in the
choice of X.14 In this discussion, I assume that any distortions in the X variables has no
effect on G, and thus label this issue orthogonal distortions.
       The framework can be generalized to take account of such distortions by positing that
a planner solves a weighted combination of a targeting problem and the deadweight loss
induced by behavioral distortions from the transfer scheme. Conceptually, a planner would
solve an optimization problem of the form:

                         X                                              X
                   min        |ci − T (Xi )| + κDW L(T (X)) s.t.              T (Xi ) = R,                 (3)
                     T
                          i                                               i


where DW L is the excess burden created by behavioral responses to tax rates, and κ is some
scalar parameter that represents how much weight the planner puts on improved targeting
versus excess burden. Intuitively, the transfer scheme will put larger taxes (or subsidies) on
attributes in X as they are more valuable (conditional) predictors of ci and as they induce
less distortion.15
       To gain more intuition, I make some highly simplifying assumptions that simplify the
excess burden calculation. This transforms the problem in equation 3 into a combination of
a well known tax problem and an empirical prediction problem that when combined map
directly into the statistical problem of penalized regression.
       Denote the covariates in X as X1 , ..., Xj , ...XJ . Above, these elements could include
various nonlinear transformations of a variable of interest (e.g., income category fixed effects).
  14
     Empirically, the implicit taxes from the gasoline tax modeled above are small and the factors included
are quite inelastic, suggesting that this is not likely a major factor in the empirical application as modeled.
  15
     In practice, this will be similar to a standard welfare maximization scheme that introduces some form
concern for horizontal equity (e.g., Auerbach and Hassett 2002) or that accounts for status quo allocations
(e.g., Saez and Stantcheva 2016).


                                                      45
Here, assume that each thing that is chosen by a household (e.g., income, number of children)
is included only in a linear way in T (Xj ). In this case, the slope of the transfer function
with respect to variable j, denoted βj , will be the implicit tax (or subsidy) to the good (or
choice) j. Assume that T (X) is linear in parameters and can be written as T (Xi ) = β 0 Xi ,
where β without a subscript is the vector of coefficients and βj is one element.
   Assume there are no pre-existing distortions (e.g., other taxes) on any Xj before the
transfer scheme is introduced. Assume, for now, that there is no cross-price substitution
between the variables in Xj . Then, a standard linear approximation of excess burden (DW L)
indicates that the welfare cost of the implicit tax is DW Lj ≈ (∂Xj /∂βj )βj2 , where the
derivative here denotes an aggregate response across all i. Because there are no cross effects,
total DW L will be the sum of DW Lj across j.
   Lastly, I switch from a problem focused on minimizing absolute errors to one that min-
imizes squared errors, which might be consistent with the politically optimized scheme de-
scribed in section 5.3. I make this switch here to allow a direct corollary with familiar
properties of OLS. In this case, the planner’s problem can be written as:

                        X                         X ∂Xj                  X
                  min       (ci − β 0 Xi )2 + κ             βj2   s.t.       T (Xi ) = R.   (4)
                   β
                        i                         j
                                                      ∂βj                i



In this formulation, the planner chooses the transfer slopes (implicit taxes) β to minimize
a weighted sum of the sum of squared residuals and deadweight loss. The first term in the
objective function is the familiar OLS problem (minimizing the sum of squared residuals),
and the second term is a the familiar problem of minimizing deadweight loss from optimal
commodity tax theory, which has been studied since Ramsey (1927).
   Empirically, the objective function in 4 is identical to the objective function used in
penalized regression, like lasso and ridge. Here, the penalty parameters depend on the
price-responsiveness of each variable, so this problem is just a form of ridge regression with
covariate-differentiated penalties. (Standard statistical software, like glmnet in R, allow for



                                                      46
such differentiation.) This suggests a method of numerically solving for second-best transfer
schemes, and it offers a link between optimal tax models and regression problems that extends
the observations in Jacobsen, Knittel, Sallee, and van Benthem (Forthcoming).
   One can ask both which covariates j should be included in the transfer function, and what
should be their slopes. To answer the first question, suppose that all variables are entered
with their OLS coefficients β OLS . Adding a covariate j will reduce the sum of squared
residuals by the partial-R2 of j times the variance of ci . It will increase deadweight loss by
≈ (∂Xj /∂jOLS )(βjOLS )2 . Which is larger, accounting for the scale parameter κ, will determine
whether variable j should be added.
   The optimal slope coefficient, however, will not be simply the OLS coefficient. One can
see intuitively from the problem (and by analogy to penalized regression) that as a variable
is more elastic its coefficient will be attenuated away from the OLS benchmark. This is
analogous to the familiar inverse elasticity rule in optimal commodity taxation. The core
intuition is that variables that are more elastic will be penalized more, and their βs will be
attenuated to reduce excess burden.
   The discussion here makes a number of simplifications to produce some basic intuition.
When there are pre-existing distortions, implicit taxes or subsidies can have different impacts
on deadweight loss, including cases where a subsidy to a factor is welfare improving because
it offsets pre-existing distortions. When the variables have cross-price effects, the impact on
deadweight loss of a greater factor loading will have effects through related goods, making
the problem analogous to the more general version of optimal Ramsey taxes on commodities.
In addition, the discussion above abstracts from the fact that the targeting accuracy of a
transfer function in fact changes as a result of changes in covariates. Thus, a proper solution
to the empirical problem requires some fixed point in which the projected X vector is the
equilibrium one. Numerical solutions are likely to be challenging, but the fact that this
problem can be cast as a known form of penalized regression suggests a viable path.

6     Conclusion

This paper uses theory and data to argue that policies like Pigouvian taxes—which improve
social efficiency but create heterogeneous costs and benefits—will inevitably create some
losers because transfers targeting the losers will tend to be imprecise.
    The theory demonstrates how one’s ability to compensate losers depends on the pre-
dictability of heterogeneous policy burdens and the size of efficiency gains. The theory
delivers a specific test that can be taken directly to data. Empirically, the case of a gasoline
tax is considered, and the possibility of a Pareto improvement is soundly rejected. Prelim-
inary evidence on other externality creating goods suggests the same conclusion. In short,
Pigouvian taxes create losers.
    This is an important conclusion as it suggests the need for nuance in a range of important
policy debates. Economists sometimes argue that efficiency-enhancing policies, at least in
principle, can be paired with targeted transfers so as to rationalize completely abstracting
from distributional implications and judging policies purely on efficiency grounds. This paper
argues for more caution in this line of reasoning. The fact that a policy creates losers is not
in and of itself a reason to reject the policy, but it does point out one reason why efficiency
enhancing policies may not prevail in the policy-making process.
    It is worth stating again that a concern with compensating losers is not born of the ob-
jective of maximizing social welfare. Standard social welfare maximization does not give any
special consideration to the status quo allocation, and gains and losses per se are irrelevant.
The informal motivation of this paper and its concern with compensating losers is about the
political process. Pockets of losers who are particularly harmed by a policy may organize
to obstruct it. If one takes the view that efficiency-enhancing policies are in fact desirable,
then the fact that not all losers can be compensated should shift attention to the question
of how many losers must be compensated, and by how much, in order to enable an efficient
policy to prevail.
    The final portion of the paper is intended as a first step in that direction. It demonstrates

                                               48
the value of targeting in compressing the distribution of winners and losers as a function of
total revenue expended, and it experiments with alternative objective functions that aim
to prevent especially large losses from occurring. A deeper exploration of these alternative
targeting plans could further aid in the constructive design of policy packages that pre-
serve economic efficiency while satisfying political constraints generated by distributions of
burdens.

A      Appendix: Proofs
Condition 1. Let ci be the private burdens from a policy, N be the number of agents in
the market, T (Xi ) be a transfer scheme, ∆ ¯ the average funding gap, and ḡ be the average
efficiency gain accruing to those in the market. A Pareto improvement is not possible if the
average absolute targeting errors exceed twice the average efficiency gain in the market minus
the average funding gap; i.e., if
                                    1 X                        ¯
                                        |ci − T (Xi )| > 2ḡ − ∆
                                    N i

then a Pareto improvement is not possible.
    The proof proceeds by stating the total size of all losses (initial burdens net of transfer,
excluding the surplus gains) among losers as an algebraic expression of the average absolute
error and the average funding gap. If the total losses among losers exceeds the total surplus
gains enjoyed by participants in the market, then it is not possible that these surplus gains
are distributed so as to compensate all losers.
    For any transfer regime T (Xi ) and distribution of costs ci , partition the data into losers
(anyone with ci − T (Xi ) > 0) and winners (anyone with ci − T (Xi ) ≤ 0). Denote the set of
losers as i ∈ L, with their number being NL . Denote the set of winners as i ∈ W , with their
number being NW .
    Having partitioned the data into winners and losers, one can define the total losses among
losers (which will be positive by construction), denoted ZL and the total losses (which will
be negative by construction) among winners as ZW :

                         X                                      X
                  ZL ≡         (ci − T (Xi )) > 0        ZW ≡         (ci − T (Xi )) < 0.
                         i∈L                                    i∈L

     The sum ZLPis the total amount of loss among losers. If this loss exceeds the total
efficiency gains i gi , then it is impossible to achieve a Pareto improvement, because even if
those gains are distributed in the most favorable way among all losers, there are not enough
gains to compensate all losers. The goal now is to redefine ZL in terms of the average
absolute error among all i (because this relates to an empirically estimable object) and the
average funding gap.
     The funding gap is the amount by which initial costs exceed  P revenue available for trans-
fers, ∆ = R − C, with the budget constraint implying that i T (Xi ) = R. The funding
P is equal to the sum of ZL and ZW : ∆ = ZW + ZL . (To see this: ∆ = C − R =
gap
   i (ci − T (Xi )) = ZL + ZW , with the latter equality true because ZL and ZW just partition
the full set.) We will want to relate absolute values and will want an expression to substitute
out ZW . Because ZW is always negative and ZL is always positive:


                                           |ZW | = |ZL | − ∆                                 (5)

    For notational convenience, denote the average absolute error as |ci −T (Xi )| = |ε|. Denote

the average absolute error among all individuals by ||,
average absolute error of losers and winners respectively. The average absolute errors are
equal to Z divided by N for each group:


                                                |ZL |                                   |ZW |
            |¯L | =                                  and |¯W | =
                       X                                           X
                             |ci − T (Xi )| =                          |ci − T (Xi )| =       .   (6)
                       i∈L

    The average absolute value of all of the data is simply the sample-size weighted average

Substituting for |ZW | using (5) yields:

Rearrange to solve for an expression of |ZL |, which is positive by construction:

                                                             N ¯    ∆

This is an expression for the total loss among losers. If this loss exceeds the sum of efficiency
gains, then a ParetoPimprovement is not possible. I.e., a Pareto improvement is not possible

B     Appendix: Data comparisons
The CEX was chosen as the primary data source for this analysis because it includes a rich
set of demographic covariates and a measure of gasoline expenditures, and because it is the
standard data source in the most closely related literature. Gasoline expenditures, however,
are based on self-reports and may be subject to mismeasurement. If there is a lot of noise
in the expenditure data, this will make prediction more difficult. This section attempts to
establish some sense of the reliability of CEX data by comparison to other surveys.
    Of course, at the very highest level, problems of measurement do not challenge the key
thesis of this paper. Instead, these problems reinforce it. If the best available data on
expenditures are noisy measures of true burdens, it only makes it more difficult to design an
accurate targeting scheme and thereby to compensate losers.

The National Household Travel Survey
An alternative measure of motor fuel consumption can be taken from the National Household
Travel Survey, which is a nationally representative survey performed most recently in 2001,
2009 and 2017. That survey gathers a measure of annual vehicle miles traveled and then
divides by the EPA estimated fuel economy of a vehicle to arrive at an estimate of annual
fuel consumed. This is multiplied by average gasoline prices from the Energy Information
Administration to impute expenditures. In contrast, the CEX asks consumers directly about
expenditures.
    The 2009 version of the NHTS is the most recent survey in which the miles traveled
variable was based on two odometer readings (the survey respondent is asked to look at
their odometer), rather than a retrospective self report. I compare the motor fuels expen-
diture data from that survey to the CEX from 2009. Figure 7 shows that fuel expenditure
distribution from the two surveys for different samples. The top panel shows all households.
This shows that the NHTS has higher expenditures on average, with a substantially longer
right tail.

Table compares 2009 CEX to 2009 NHTS. Dependent variable is annualized gasoline expenditures. Base
controls include income, Census regions, urban dummy, family size and number of persons over 18. The
additional variable is total number of vehicles in the household.



the CEX is broken into smaller consumer units than the household definition used in the
NHTS. Differences persist, however, when comparing households with the same number of
members. The bottom two panels of Figure 7 compare households with one vehicle (on the
left) and with two vehicles (on the right). In particular for the one vehicle households, the
distributions do fit better. Nevertheless, the two data sources do show non-trivial differences
in this fundamental measure.
    Though there are some advantages to the measure of fuel expenditure in the NHTS, it
has the disadvantages of requiring imputation of fuel economy and gasoline prices. Gasoline
prices vary significantly across locations and time. Fuel economy varies substantially with
where a vehicle is driven. Thus, it is not obvious which survey measure is more reliable.
Regardless, the fact that there are substantial differences suggests that mismeasurement
could be important.
    Ultimately for the purposes of this paper, what matters is predictability. To compare
predictability across the surveys I identify a set of demographic variables that appear to be
defined consistently in both surveys: income, Census region, an urban indicator, family size
and number of persons over 18. Table 8 reports the R2 for parallel regressions of gasoline
expenditures on these controls, varying the set of controls and whether the regressions using
sample weights.
    For the base set of controls, the CEX and NHTS show very levels of predictability as
summarized by the R2 . This is true regardless of weighting. In additional specifications (not
shown), the results change very little when using dummies for the household size variables
or adding state dummies instead of Census regions. The one difference that did emerge in
a specification search was that the total number of vehicles owned by the household has a
stronger explanatory power in the NHTS, and in particular when weighting, this variable
notably increases prediction accuracy. The NHTS collects mileage information (from which
expenditures are imputed) for each car, ensuring a mechanical connection. Table 8 reports
the weighted and unweighted versions of these regressions showing the greater impact of
vehicle controls in the NHTS.
    Overall, the comparison of the CEX with the NHTS suggests that there are some notable
differences in estimated gasoline expenditure, though in most cases there is not a large


                                                57
difference in predictability within the two samples. While mismeasured expenditures in the
CEX may imply that the R2 is artificially low as compared to some theoretical baseline, it is
worth emphasizing a final time that trouble measuring consumption (and hence the burden
of a tax) actually makes targeting transfers accurately more difficult.

The Residential Energy Consumption Survey
This paper focuses on gasoline taxes, but it also briefly presents results on home energy
consumption. The data quality of the home energy consumption variables in the CEX can
be explored by comparison with the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS), which
is most recently available in 2009 and 2015. The RECS has the key advantage that electricity
and natural gas expenditures are validated against billing records, so the data quality are
much better for those variables than in most surveys.
    Figure 7 shows the distribution of electricity and natural gas expenditures in the CEX
and RECS, pooled for 2009 and 2015. Overall, the similarity in the distributions is broadly
encouraging, but there are differences. The CEX shows more observations with low con-
sumption, especially for gas. It also has a longer right tail. This may be in part because the
CEX consumer units are on average smaller, but it may also be evidence of mismeasurement.

Left panel is for households with one vehicle. Right panel is for households with two vehicles. Both are from
2009 surveys.

     The primary concern with mismeasurement for the core purposes of this study is that it
might artificially deflate the degree of predictability. Table 9 shows the R2 from regressions
with the overlapping common set of covariates between the RECS and CEX. The RECS
does show a somewhat higher R2 . The data are not winsorized in these regressions. In other
specifications (not shown), truncating the right tail of the distribution for high values has
little effect on the R2 . Again, the high level point that consumption will be hard to measure
and predict is reinforced if the CEX has measurement problems, though it certainly opens
the possibility of using better measured surveys to design the transfer system.
