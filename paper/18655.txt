The Surprisingly Swift Decline of U.S. Manufacturing Employment

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper finds a link between the sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing employment beginning in 2001
and a change in U.S. trade policy that eliminated potential tariff increases on Chinese imports. Industries
where the threat of tariff hikes declines the most experience more severe employment losses along
with larger increases in the value of imports from China and the number of firms engaged in China-U.S.
trade. These results are robust to other potential explanations of the employment loss, and we show
that the U.S. employment trends differ from those in the EU, where there was no change in policy.

1      Introduction

U.S. manufacturing employment uctuated around 18 million workers between 1965
and 2000 before plunging 18 percent from March 2001 to March 2007. In this paper,
we nd a link between this sharp decline and the U.S. granting of Permanent Normal
Trade Relations (PNTR) to China.
    Conferral of PNTR was unique in that it did not change the actual import tar-
i rates the United States applied to Chinese goods over this period.                 U.S. imports
from China had been subject to the relatively low NTR tari rates reserved for WTO
members since the 1980s.           But for China, these low rates required annual renewals
that were uncertain and politically contentious. Without renewal, U.S. import taris
on Chinese goods would have jumped to the higher non-NTR tari rates assigned to
non-market economies and originally established under the Smoot-Hawley Tari Act
of 1930. PNTR  and the subsequent December 2001 accession of China to the WTO
 eliminated the uncertainty associated with these annual renewals by permanently
setting U.S. duties on Chinese imports to NTR levels.
    Ending the possibility of sudden spikes in Chinese import taris likely strength-
ened import competition and suppressed U.S. employment growth. For example, the
decline in uncertainty and expected taris associated with PNTR may have increased
U.S. rms' incentives to incur the sunk costs associated with opening a plant in China
or establishing a relationship with an existing Chinese supplier. Likewise, PNTR may
have provided Chinese producers with greater incentives to invest in entering or ex-
panding into the U.S. market, putting further price pressure on U.S. producers. PNTR
also may have reduced U.S. manufacturing employment by inducing U.S. producers to
invest in capital- or skill-intensive production technologies or less labor-intensive mixes
of products that are more consistent with U.S. comparative advantage. Intuition for
these responses comes in part from models of investment under uncertainty, where rms
are more likely to undertake irreversible investments as the ambiguity surrounding their
                               1
expected prot decreases.
    The nature of the policy change provides a straightforward measure of its potential
eect.    We refer to this measure as the NTR gap and dene it as the dierence
between NTR tari rates (which average 4 percent across industries in 1999), and the
non-NTR rates to which they would have risen if annual renewal had failed (which
average 36 percent in 1999). NTR gaps exhibit substantial variation across industries:
in 1999, their standard deviation is 15 percentage points.
    Our dierence-in-dierences identication strategy exploits this variation in the
NTR gap to test whether employment loss in manufacturing industries with higher
NTR gaps (rst dierence) is larger after PNTR has been instituted, relative to employ-
ment changes in the pre-PNTR era (second dierence). Because PNTR was granted
near the 2001 business cycle peak, we compare employment growth after 2001 to em-

    1 Dixit and Pindyck (1994) provide a general overview of investment under uncertainty. See Handley
and Limao (2012) for one of the rst applications to international trade.

ployment changes after the previous peak, in 1990.       One attractive feature of this
approach is its ability to isolate the role of the change in policy.   While industries
with high and low gaps are not identical, comparing outcomes within industries across
peaks isolates the dierential impact of China's change in status. At the same time,
comparison of employment changes across similar intervals of the business cycle helps
control for manufacturing's inherent cyclicality.
   Our estimates reveal a negative and statistically signicant relationship between
the change in U.S. policy and subsequent employment growth in manufacturing. This
relationship is also economically signicant: for an industry with the average NTR gap,
the shift in U.S. policy reduces employment growth from 2001 to 2002 by an additional
-3 to -4 percentage points compared with the same interval after the 1990 peak. Six
years after the 2001 peak, the implied dierence grows to -12 to -16 percentage points.
   Transaction-level U.S. import data provide circumstantial evidence that these changes
in employment are driven in part by oshoring.       We nd that U.S. imports of the
goods most aected by the policy change increase substantially after 2001, and that
this growth is driven by imports from China. Furthermore, we show that this jump in
trade value is mediated by a relative expansion in the number of U.S. rms importing
from China, the number of Chinese rms exporting to the United States, and the num-
ber of U.S.-China importer-exporter pairs.     This relative growth along the extensive
margin of U.S. and Chinese trading rms is consistent with greater policy-driven in-
centives to invest in new trade relationships, and shows that U.S. imports from China
surge in the same industries that experience the largest reductions in employment.
   As part of its accession to the WTO, China agreed to institute a number of policy
changes which also might have inuenced U.S. manufacturing employment, including
a reduction in import taris, the phasing out of export licensing requirements and
production subsidies, and the elimination of barriers to foreign investment. Using data
from a variety of sources, including rm-level microdata from China's National Bureau
of Statistics, we show that while these policies also are related to employment outcomes
in the United States, their implied contribution is small relative to PNTR. We also nd
that our results are robust to other U.S. economic developments contemporaneous with
PNTR, such as the bursting of the 1990s information technology bubble, the expiration
of the global Multi-Fiber Arrangement governing Chinese textile and clothing export
quotas, and declining union membership in the United States.       Finally, we compare
the U.S. experience to that of the European Union, which gave China the equivalent
of PNTR in 1980. In contrast to the United States, we nd no relationship between
post-2001 manufacturing employment and the U.S. NTR gap in the EU.
   We pursue several extensions of our baseline ndings. First, we decompose industry
employment growth along gross margins of adjustment and show that both elevated job
destruction and suppressed job creation make sizable contributions to the overall im-
plied impact of the change in U.S. policy. Second, we show that industries most aected
by PNTR exhibit increases in skill intensity. Third, examining outcomes at the plant
level, we nd that the change in U.S. policy is associated with declining employment
within continuing establishments as well as a higher probability of establishment death.


                                           3
Finally we investigate the extent to which PNTR's eects are transmitted via up- and
downstream industries and nd that exposure along both dimensions is associated with
greater probability of plant death.
    The paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 outlines our contribution to existing re-
search; Sections 3 and 4 describe our data and empirical strategy; Sections 5 through
8 present our results; and Section 9 concludes. An online appendix provides additional
empirical results.




2        Related Literature

This paper makes several contributions to a large body of research spanning interna-
tional trade, labor and macroeconomics.              First, we show that a substantial portion
of the loss of U.S. manufacturing employment since 2001 is related to a discrete and
                                                                                              2
easily identiable change in policy  the U.S. conferral of PNTR on China.                        While
others, including most recently Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2012), have highlighted a
negative relationship between low-wage country imports and U.S. employment, our
research points to a specic policy change in the United States as the cause for the
acceleration of Chinese imports, and relates it to a wide range of outcomes across both
                                   3
U.S. and Chinese producers.            In particular, we show that the largest relative declines
in employment in the years after 2001 are concentrated in industries that experienced
the largest declines in uncertainty and expected taris as a result of PNTR, and that
these industries also experience relatively large increases in Chinese import value, as
                                                                          4
well as the number of U.S. importers and Chinese exporters.
    Second, our examination of rms' reactions to the elimination of uncertainty over
tari rates rather than actual reductions in taris contributes to the literature analyzing
investment under uncertainty (e.g.           Dixit and Pyndick 1994; Bloom, Bond and Van
Reenen (2007)), as well as its application to international trade. Our eort is closely
related to the work of Handley (2012) and Handley and Limao (2012, 2013), who show

    2 Early research on import competition by Freeman and Katz (1991) and Revenga (1992) documents
a negative relationship between growth in U.S. manufacturing employment and either imports or
changes in import prices at the industry level. Subsequent research focuses on the impact of imports
from low-wage countries across industries (e.g., Sachs and Shatz 1994) and establishments (Bernard
et al.   2006).   More recent papers investigate the eect of China on manufacturing employment in
a range of countries, including Belgium (Mion and Zhu 2013), the EU (Bloom et al. 2012), Mexico
(Utar and Torres Ruiz 2013) and the United States (Ebenstein et al. 2011, Autor et al. 2012, and
Autor et al. 2013).
    3 In focusing on the impact of a particular policy, this paper is closest to Bloom et al. (2012), who
show that employment losses across EU apparel and textile manufacturers coincide with the removal
of import quotas on Chinese exports of these goods, and to Utar and Torres Ruiz (2013), who nd
a reduction in employment at Mexican maquiladoras associated with China's accession to the World
Trade Organization.
    4 Models of importing also provide insight into the potential impact of PNTR. Groizard, Ranjan
and Rodriguez-Lopez (2012), for example, show that a decline in import taris raises the demand for
foreign inputs and thereby reduces domestic employment.




                                                    4
that if uncertainty regarding either the timing or the magnitude of tari changes in a
destination market falls, exporting to that market rises as relatively low-productivity
rms lose their incentive to wait and see how taris will change before absorbing the
sunk costs associated with entry. Here, we demonstrate the strong and wide-ranging
eects on both the exporting and importing country of perhaps the most signicant
change in import-tari uncertainty since the turn of the century  the granting of
                   5
PNTR to China.         Our nding that PNTR is associated with increases in the number
of U.S. importers, Chinese exporters and importer-exporter pairs is evidence that rms
reacted to the policy change by making irreversible investments of the type discussed
in these models. In addition, our examination of how plants subsequently adjust their
capital and skill intensity in response to PNTR is related to Bloom, Draca and Van
Reenen's (2012) research on trade-induced technical change.
   Third, our analysis of employment changes along gross margins of adjustment pro-
vides evidence of a link between international trade and the joblessness of the 2001
recovery in manufacturing. Several papers, including Baily and Lawrence (2004) and
Mankiw and Swagel (2006) have found that international trade plays a small role in
this phenomenon. We expand on these analyses by considering the eect of PNTR on
both job creation and job destruction, as well as its impact on upstream and down-
stream industries and nd that trade is directly and indirectly associated with the
large and long-lasting decline in U.S. manufacturing employment after 2001.                More-
over, our nding that PNTR has a more profound eect on production workers than
non-production workers relates to recent research by Jaimovich and Siu (2012), which
shows that the increasing joblessness of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing
recoveries in recent decades is driven by the disproportionate loss of jobs that perform
routine tasks during recessions. Here, we show that PNTR magnies these losses in
manufacturing in the years following the 2001 peak.
   Finally, our research contributes to a growing literature on supply-chain co-location
by relating employment loss to exposure to PNTR via upstream and downstream in-
dustries. Baldwin and Venables (2012), for example, consider dierent forms of supply
chains that emerge in response to the forces that encourage (e.g., transport costs) or
discourage (e.g., variation in factor costs) co-location. A key implication of their model
is that oshoring may jump discretely if a change in trade costs triggers a relatively
large portion of a supply chain to move abroad. Relatedly, Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr
(2010) show that proximity to input suppliers and nal customers is the most impor-
tant factor in the agglomeration patterns of U.S. manufacturing industries.               In this
paper, we use the NTR gap to identify employment loss associated with potential
increased competition from China in an establishment's own industry. In addition, we
calculate upstream and downstream NTR gaps using input-output tables to explore
the extent to which PNTR's eects are transmitted via the supply chain.

   5 Handley and Limao (2013) examine the eect of the elimination of trade policy uncertainty as-
sociated with China's accession to the WTO using product-level international trade data but do not
consider its eects on U.S. employment.

3      Data

3.1 Measuring the Eect of PNTR: The NTR Gap
According to U.S. law, imports from non-market economies such as China are, in
principal, subject to relatively high tari rates originally set under the Smoot-Hawley
Tari Act of 1930. These rates, known as non-NTR or column 2 taris are typically
substantially larger than the NTR or column 1 rates the U.S. oers fellow members
of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
    The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to grant NTR tari rates to non-
market economies on a temporary basis subject to Congressional approval. U.S. Pres-
idents began granting waivers to China in 1980. While these waivers kept the actual
tari rates applied to Chinese goods low, the need for annual approval by Congress
created uncertainty about whether the low taris would continue, particularly after
the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989.             In fact, the U.S. House of Representatives
attempted to revoke China's temporary NTR status every year from 1990 to 2001.
While these votes succeeded in 1990, 1991 and 1992, China's status was not over-
turned because the U.S. Senate failed to act on the House's votes. From 1990 to 2001,
                                                                          6
the average House vote against NTR renewal was 38 percent.
    The U.S. Congress passed a bill granting permanent NTR status to China in Oc-
tober 2000, which became eective upon China's accession to the WTO in 2001. The
change in China's PNTR status had two eects. First, it ended the uncertainty asso-
ciated with annual renewals of U.S. NTR status, thereby eliminating any option value
of waiting for U.S. or Chinese rms seeking to incur sunk costs associated with greater
U.S.-China trade.
                     7
                         Second, it led to a substantial reduction in         expected   U.S. import
                              8
taris on Chinese goods.
    We measure the impact of PNTR on industry               i   as the dierence between the non-
NTR and NTR tari rates.            We refer to this measure as the NTR gap,and expect

    6 Table A.1 of the online appendix summarizes the House and Senate votes by year. Both the House
and Senate passed legislation placing human rights conditions on re-approval in 1991 and 1992, but
they were vetoed by President Bush (Dumbaugh 2001). Heightened uncertainty continued through
the 1990s, with substantial opposition in annual House votes and increasing legislative activity focused
on China's human rights practices. From 1998 to 2001, the number of Representatives voting against
renewed NTR status reached were 166, 170, 147 and 169 out of 435.
    7 While our discussion treats the October 2000 PNTR vote as the date of the policy change, there
were several milestones in China-U.S. trade policy over a relatively short period, most notably the
China-U.S. bilateral agreement governing China's eventual accession to the WTO in November 1999
and China's actual accession to the WTO in December 2001.          Though each of these events likely
contributed to the overall reduction in policy uncertainty, we are unable to identify their separate
contributions given the annual frequency of our establishment-level employment data.
    8 To our knowledge, no other U.S. trade policy generates similar uncertainty with respect to China.
For example, while the the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 requires the U.S. Trea-
sury Secretary to provide semiannual reports indicating whether any major trading partner of the
United States is manipulating its currency, such a designation only requires the Secretary to initiate
negotiations to have the exchange rate adjusted promptly (Treasury 2012).




                                                   6
that industries with larger gaps are more likely to be aected by the change in U.S.
policy.We measure the impact of PNTR on industry                 i   as the dierence between the
non-NTR and NTR tari rates. We refer to this measure as the NTR gap and dene
it as follows:
                       N T R Gapi = N on N T R Ratei â N T R Ratei .                              (1)

We expect that industries with larger gaps are more likely to be aected by the change
in U.S. policy.    One attractive feature of this measure is its plausible exogeneity to
employment growth after 2001. Eighty-nine percent of the variation in the NTR gap
across industries arises from variation in non-NTR rates, set 70 years prior to passage of
PNTR. This feature of non-NTR rates eectively rules out reverse causality that would
arise if non-NTR rates could be set to protect industries with declining employment.
Furthermore, to the extent that NTR taris were set to protect industries with declining
employment prior to PNTR, these          higher   NTR rates would result in      lower   NTR gaps,
biasing our results away from nding an eect of PNTR. Moreover, the main results
of the paper are robust to calculation of the NTR gap using the NTR rate from 1989,
which is unaected by employment conditions in 2001.
    We compute NTR gaps using tari data provided by Feenstra, Romalis and Schott
(2002), henceforth FRS. FRS report the             ad valorem    equivalent NTR and non-NTR
tari rates for each year from 1989 to 2001. Both types of taris are set at the eight-
digit Harmonized System (HS) level, also referred to as tari lines.                We compute
industry-level NTR gaps using concordances provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA); the gap for industry         i   is the average NTR gap across the eight-digit
                                                  9
HS tari lines belonging to that industry.
    Figure A.1 of the online appendix plots the distribution of the NTR gap in each
year across the constant set of manufacturing industries captured in our regressions,
which is dened in the next section.          As indicated in the gure, where lighter lines
represent later years, the distributions are relatively stable across time.              The largest
change is a shift toward somewhat higher NTR gaps in the mid 1990s. There are two
reasons for this shift.      The rst is that tari reductions negotiated in the Uruguay
Round are implemented beginning in 1997; by pushing down some NTR rates, these
reductions raise their associated NTR gaps.               The second cause for the shift in the
distributions over time is technical: changes to the HS system in 1997, which included
retiring some older HS codes and introducing some newer ones, changed the mix of
underlying goods associated with certain HS codes and therefore their NTR and non-
             10
NTR rates.        Though we use the NTR gaps for 1999  the year before passage of
PNTR in the United States  in our regression analysis below, we note that our results
are robust to using the NTR gaps from any available year. Furthermore, in some of our
specications we explicitly control for changes in NTR rates over our sample period.
In 1999, the average NTR gap across industries is 0.32 with a standard deviation of

   9 Further detail on the construction of NTR gaps is provided in Section A of the online appendix.
  10 As discussed further in Section B of the online appendix, non-NTR taris for HS codes not subject
to revision do not change.

0.15. The corresponding statistics are 0.04 and 0.05 for the NTR rate and 0.36 and
0.15 for the non-NTR rate.
   Table 1 summarizes the relationships between the 1999 NTR gap and other industry-
level variables using a series of bi-variate OLS regressions, where bold type indicates
statistical signicance at the 10 percent level. We discuss how these variables can be
used to account for alternate explanations of the decline in U.S. manufacturing employ-
ment in Section 6. Their sources, as well as details associated with their construction,
are summarized in Section C of the online appendix.
   The industry attributes considered in Table 1 are: 1999 capital intensity; 1999 skill
intensity; Nunn's (2007) measure of contract intensity, dened as the share of inter-
mediate inputs requiring relationship-specic investments in 1997; changes in Chinese
import taris from 1996 to 2005; changes in the Chinese production subsidies per to-
tal sales from 1999 to 2005; the share of Chinese rms eligible to export in 1999; an
indicator for industries where Chinese textile and clothing export quotas were relaxed
from 2001 to 2005; the share of U.S. workers belonging to a union in 1999; an indicator
for industries containing advanced technology products; an indicator for industries in
which U.S. rms led countervailing duty (CVD) or anti-dumping (AD) claims against
Chinese rms from 2001 to 2007; employment growth in the industry prior to PNTR,
from 1997 to 2000; and the 1999 NTR and non-NTR rates in levels. For reference, the
nal two rows of the table report the mean and standard deviation of each of these
covariates. We use those statistics to interpret the economic signicance of some of our
regression results in Section 6.
   As indicated in the table, the 1999 NTR gap has negative and statistically signif-
icant relationships with capital intensity, union membership, and changes in Chinese
production subsidies. It has positive and statistically signicant associations with con-
tract intensity, the share of Chinese rms eligible to export under Chinese licensing
constraints, and the indicators for industries aected by quota relaxation and contain-
ing advanced technology. The share of variation in the NTR gap explained by each of
these regressors is generally low, and does not exceed 0.21 (for capital intensity).



3.2 U.S. Manufacturing Employment
We track annual U.S. manufacturing employment using the U.S. Census Bureau's Lon-
gitudinal Business Database (LBD), assembled and updated annually by Jarmin and
Miranda (2002).        The LBD tracks the employment and major industry of virtually
every establishment with employment in the non-farm private U.S. economy annually
                  11
as of March 12.        In these data, establishments correspond to facilities in a given
geographic location, such as a manufacturing plant or retail outlet, and their major

  11 The LBD denition of employment includes both full- and part-time workers; in Section 8.3
we show that our main employment results are robust to examining production hours instead of
employment.   While the use of stang services by manufacturing rms was increasing during the
2000s, Dey, Houseman and Polivka (2012) show that this trend does not account for the steep decline
in manufacturing employment after 2001.



                                                8
industry is dened as the four-digit Standard Industrial Classication (SIC) or six-digit
North American Industry Classication System (NAICS) category representing their
largest share of shipments. Information from Census's Company Organization Survey
is used to map establishments to rms, and longitudinal identiers in the LBD allow
establishments and rms to be followed over time. With these identiers, we can deter-
mine the births and deaths of establishments and rms and thereby decompose changes
in industry employment along gross intensive and extensive margins of adjustment.
    We augment the data in the LBD with detailed establishment-level characteristics
from Census's quinquennial Census of Manufactures (CM), conducted in years end-
ing in 2 and 7.          For every manufacturing establishment, the CM provides more
detailed employment data, including a breakdown of workers between production and
non-production roles, production hours and the capital stock (book value). Nominal
data are deated using industry-level price indexes in the NBER-CES Manufacturing
Industry Database from Becker, Gray and Marvakov (2013).
    The long time horizon considered in this paper presents two complications to ana-
lyzing the evolution of manufacturing employment. The rst complication is that the
industry classication scheme used to track establishments' major industries' changes
from the SIC to the NAICS in 1997. Moreover, some activities (e.g., parts of printing
and publishing) are re-classied out of manufacturing in the SIC to NAICS tran-
sition.   To account for these changes, we use the algorithm developed in Pierce and
Schott (2012) to create families of four-digit SIC and six-digit NAICS codes that
collect similar manufacturing activities within and across the SIC and NAICS indus-
                                 12
try classication systems.            We then drop from our analysis any families that contain
SIC or NAICS industries that are not considered part of manufacturing during this
period. The second complication associated with examining changes in manufacturing
employment is that establishments may switch into or out of manufacturing over time.
To prevent such changes from aecting our results, we drop all establishments whose
major industry code changes between manufacturing and non-manufacturing over any
particular time interval we examine. Neither of these drops has a material impact on
the general trend of manufacturing employment over the past several decades.
    Figure A.2 of the online appendix displays annual employment in our constant
manufacturing sample against the manufacturing employment series available publicly
                                                  13
from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.              As expected, given the procedure outlined
above, the constant manufacturing sample accounts for less employment than the
BLS series. Despite this level dierence, the LBD exhibits a similarly stark drop in

appendix. All references to industry in this paper refers to these families unless otherwise noted.
  13 Series CEU3000000001, available at www.bls.gov. As the BLS series is NAICS-based, manufac-
turing employment prior to 1997 excludes SIC industries that do not map into NAICS manufacturing
industries. As noted above, our sample is SIC-NAICS-based, meaning that we also drop NAICS in-
dustries not classied as manufacturing under the SIC. For further detail on construction of the BLS
series, see Morisi (2003).

employment after 2001.
     While the loss of U.S. manufacturing employment after 2001 is dramatic, we note
that it is not accompanied by a similarly steep decline in value added.                      Indeed, as
illustrated in Figure 1, real value added in U.S. manufacturing as measured by the
BEA continues to increase after 2001, though at a slower rate (2.8 percent) compared
                                                              15
with the average from 1948 to 2000 (3.7 percent).



3.3 U.S. Imports
We use transaction-level U.S. import data from the Census Bureau's Longitudinal
Foreign Trade Transaction Database (LFTTD) to investigate the relationship between
PNTR and U.S. trade. As described in greater detail in Bernard, Jensen and Schott
(2009), the LFTTD tracks all U.S. international trade transactions by U.S. rms from
1992 to 2008. For each import transaction we observe the ten-digit Harmonized System
(HS) product traded, the U.S. dollar value and quantity shipped, the shipment date
and the origin country. In addition, the data contain codes identifying both the U.S.
importer and the ultimate foreign supplier of the imported product. These rm-level
identiers allow us to examine the behavior U.S. and Chinese rms engaged in this
trade, including their entry and exit into trade.




4       Empirical Strategy

We estimate the eect of PNTR on U.S. manufacturing employment using an OLS
dierence-in-dierences (DID) specication that examines whether employment losses
in industries with higher NTR gaps (rst dierence) are larger after the imposition of
PNTR than during a pre-PNTR period (second dierence). As noted in Section 3.1,
the fact that non-NTR rates were set during the 1930s renders the NTR gap plausibly
exogenous to employment growth after 2001. Given the proximity of PNTR to the 2001
business cycle peak, we choose the years following the previous peak, in 1990, as the
appropriate pre-PNTR period to control for uctuations in employment associated
                              16
with the business cycle.
     Our approach has the standard attributes of DID estimation. That is, while indus-
try employment growth after PNTR may vary with industry characteristics as noted

    14 As indicated by the roughly sideways movement of manufacturing employment from mid-1960s
through 2000, the share of manufacturing employment in total private employment was declining for
some time prior to PNTR, a trend discussed in Edwards and Lawrence (2013).
    15 Houseman, Kurz, Lengermann and Mandel (2011) argue that gains in manufacturing value-added
in the later years of Figure 1 may be overstated as purchases of low-cost foreign materials are not fully
captured in input price indexes. The authors also note that two thirds of the overall growth in manu-
facturing value added between 1997 and 2007 occurred in the computer and electronics manufacturing
industry, which accounted for roughly one tenth of overall manufacturing value added.
    16 We consider an alternate dierence-in-dierences specication in section 7.2 that is not tied to an
explicit comparison of growth across business cycle peaks.

in Section 3.1, comparing outcomes within industries before and after PNTR elimi-
nates biases associated with any time-invariant industry attributes. Likewise, the use
of peak-year xed eects controls for aggregate shocks that aect both sets of indus-
tries equally.     Moreover, all specications include industry capital intensity and skill
intensity to account for two time-varying industry characteristics closely associated
with U.S. comparative advantage.
     Figure 2, based on publicly available employment data from the NBER-CES Man-
ufacturing Industry Database, oers simple, initial support for our empirical approach.
Breaking all U.S. six-digit NAICS manufacturing industries into two groups according
to whether their NTR gaps in 1999 were above or below the median across all indus-
tries, the gure shows that employment evolves similarly from 1981 to 2001, consistent
with the parallel trends assumption inherent in dierence-in-dierences analysis. After
PNTR, the series diverge, with employment in high-gap industries falling more sharply
                                                  17
than employment in low-gap industries.
     Figure 3 oers similar evidence with respect to U.S. imports. We divide all U.S.
import products contained in publicly available U.S. import data from Schott (2008) by
the median NTR gap in 1999, and then by country of origin, aggregating imports from
all countries but China into a rest-of-world category. As indicated in the gure, U.S.
imports from China increase dramatically in the post-PNTR period, with the largest
gains recorded in products with high NTR gaps. This pattern is not present for U.S.
                                             18
imports from other trading partners.
     We provide more formal examinations of the validity of our DID approach in Section
7.1 below.




5       Baseline Results

In this section we report baseline results showing that employment losses and the
growth of imports from China are larger in industries where the threat of tari hikes
declined the most.



5.1 PNTR and U.S. Manufacturing Employment (LBD)
We compare employment (E ) growth                 d   years after 2001 (the post-PNTR period) to
employment growth         d   years after the prior NBER peak, in 1990 (the pre-PNTR pe-
riod), within industries with dierent NTR gaps. We estimate the following equation
separately for intervals of increasing length, from           d=1    to   d = 6,   to examine how the
eect of PNTR evolves over time:
    17 Both series exhibit declining employment after PNTR as all industries are aected by the policy
change, with larger eects expected in industries with higher NTR gaps.
    18 If anything, U.S. imports of high-NTR gap products from the rest of the world increase at a slower
rate than those of low-gap products, potentially due to the shifting of production from other countries
to China.

The dependent variable is the cumulative percent change in industry                    i's   employment
between year    t = {1990, 2001}    and year    t + d.    The rst variable on the right-hand-
side of the equation is the DID term, an interaction of an indicator variable for the
post-PNTR period with industries' NTR gaps in 1999. Recall that NTR gaps vary by
industry but not by year     t or elapsed years d. Xit    is a vector of industry characteristics
in year t; in our baseline specication, these are restricted to industry capital intensity
and skill intensity. We measure capital intensity as the log of the ratio of real book value
of capital to total employment,      ln(K/Eit )   and skill intensity as the log of the ratio of
non-production workers to total employment,          ln(N P/Eit ) using data from the NBER-
CES Manufacturing Industry Database, as these attributes are unavailable in the LBD.
Industry and peak-year xed eects are represented by             Î´id   and   Î´td ,   respectively, and
control for time-invariant dierences between industries and common aggregate shocks.
     Table 2 reports the results of estimating equation 2 using data from the LBD. Each
column displays regression results for a dierent value of          d.   Column 1, for example,
compares employment growth from 2001 to 2002 to growth from 1990 to 1991.                           All
estimates of   Î¸d   are negative and statistically signicant at the 10 percent level (noted
with bold-faced type), indicating that employment declines are higher in industries
with higher NTR gaps. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes of the coecients rise with
d,   from -0.104 for   d = 1   to -0.482 for   d = 6,    indicating that the eect of PNTR is
persistent and increases over time.      We report the implied impact of PNTR and its
standard error in the last row of Table 2 by multiplying the estimated DID coecients
in the rst row by the average NTR gap across industries (0.32, as noted in Section
3). These implied impacts are substantial, reducing the relative employment growth
of the average industry by -3.4 percentage points (-0.104*0.32) after one year.                    This
dierence expands to -15.6 percentage points (-0.482*0.32) after six years.
     Coecients for capital and skill intensity are mostly positive and negative, respec-
tively, indicating that higher capital intensity is associated with higher employment
growth, while higher skill intensity is associated with lower employment growth. These
coecients, however, are generally statistically insignicant at conventional levels. For
a sense of their economic signicance, note that a one standard deviation increase in
capital intensity (0.82, from the last row of Table 1) is associated with a 13.9 percentage
point increase in relative employment growth six years after PNTR. A one standard
deviation increase in skill intensity (0.40), on the other hand, corresponds to a decline
in relative employment growth of -4 to -6 percentage points 2 to 3 years after PNTR.



5.2 PNTR and U.S. Imports (LFTTD)
PNTR may have aected U.S. employment growth by making U.S.-China trade more
attractive and by raising U.S. rms' incentives to adopt labor-saving technologies. In


                                                12
this section we use rm-level U.S. import data from the LFTTD to investigate the
relationship between PNTR and China-U.S. trade. As the LFTTD is unavailable prior
to 1992, we amend our DID specication to compare outcomes across trading partners
from 2001 to 2005 (the post-PNTR period) versus 1997 to 2001 (the pre-PNTR period),
rather than across business cycle peaks:

âZch,t:t+4 = Î± + Î¸1{c = China} Ã 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã N T R Gaph,1999            (3)

           + Î³1 1{post â P N T Rt } + Î³2 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã N T R Gaph,1999
           + Î³3 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã 1{c = China} + Î³4 1{c = China} Ã N T R Gaph,1999
           + Î´c + Î´h + Îµch
The left-hand side variable     âZch,t:t+4 represents the change in one of several dimensions
of U.S. import activity over the pre- or post-PNTR period, measured at the eight-digit
HS product (h) by source country (c) level, and where                t = {1997, 2001}.19           These
dimensions are import value, the number of U.S. rms importing product                           h    from
country c, the number of country c rms exporting product h to the United States, and
the number of importer-exporter pairs involved with U.S. imports of product h from
country c. The rst term on the right-hand side of equation 3 is a triple interaction of an
indicator for the post-PNTR period, an indicator for China, and the 1999 NTR gap for
product   h.   The coecient    Î¸   captures the relative post-PNTR increase in import value
(or number of rms, etc.) for products more aected by the policy change for China
versus all other U.S. trading partners. The next four variables control for additional
interactions needed to estimate the triple-dierence coecient              Î¸ . Î´c   and   Î´h   represent
country and product xed eects that control for unobserved time-invariant country
and product attributes.
    As product-country trade data exhibit an abundance of zeros, we use the normalized
growth rate introduced by Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) for the dependent
                                           1
variable, âZch,t:t+4 = (Zch,t+4 â tch,t ) / (Zch,t+4 + Zch,t ) , which is bounded by 2 and -2
                                           2
                                                                                                 20
and equals those values for observations that start or end at zero, respectively.
    Results are reported in Table 3. Coecient estimates for the DID term are positive
and statistically signicant for all four dimensions of U.S. importing. Our estimates
imply that a product with the average NTR gap (0.32) exhibits growth in import
value from China between 2001 and 2005 that is 14 normalized percentage points
higher than the growth in import value across all other U.S. trading partners relative
to the pre-period. The relative growth rates for the numbers of U.S. importers, Chinese
exporters and importer-exporter pairs are 12, 12 and 11 normalized percentage points,
               21
respectively.

  19 As with SIC and NAICS industries, the eight-digit HS product codes are linked to time-invariant
families using the concordance from Pierce and Schott (2012).
  20 We obtain qualitatively similar results when growth is measured as the log dierence and the
analysis is limited to trade ows that are present in both the beginning and end years.
  21 As reported in Section E of the online Appendix, we nd similar growth in the number of Chinese
rms exporting to the United States relative to other countries using transaction-level trade data from
China.



                                                  13
     Together, the results in Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate that U.S. imports from China
surge in precisely the set of goods where domestic employment loss is concentrated.
                                                                                      22
This link provides indirect evidence that PNTR encouraged oshoring.                       Further-
more, the relative increase in U.S. and Chinese rms engaging in China-U.S. trade is
consistent with models of investment (e.g., Handley 2012, Handley and Limao 2012,
2013), in which reductions in trade policy uncertainty increase rms' incentives to sink
investment in new trade relationships.




6       Considering Alternate Explanations

Plausible alternate explanations for the sharp decline in U.S. manufacturing employ-
ment and concomitant increase in U.S. imports from China must explain two empirical
facts. The rst relates to timing: alternate explanations need to account for why the
sharp decline in employment and surge in Chinese imports occur at the same time as
PNTR and yet are unrelated to the policy change.                The second fact is variation in
outcomes across industries within manufacturing: alternate explanations must explain
why the largest declines in employment and sharpest surges in imports occur in in-
dustries most exposed to PNTR via the NTR gap and yet are unrelated to the policy
change.
     In this section we consider a range of potential alternate explanations and assemble
data to account for them empirically. We then generalize the empirical specication in
equation 2 as follows:


       âEi,t:t+d
                 = Î± + Î¸d 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã N T R Gapi,1999                                 (4)
         Eit
                   X                                 X
                 +    Î³1d 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã Xi +    Î²1d 1{post â P N T Rt } Ã Xit
                      p                                     p

                  + Î²2d Xit + Î´id + Î´td + Îµitd .

The rst interaction on the right-hand side of equation 4 is the same DID estimator
employed in equation 2 above. The next two terms are interactions of a post-PNTR
indicator with the time-invariant (Xi ) and time-varying (Xit ) industry attributes as-
sociated with the potential alternate explanations, which are discussed in detail in the
remainder of this section.       In cases where these attributes are time-varying, so that
their coecients can be identied separately from the industry xed eects (Î´id ), they
are also included in levels (fourth term). The interactions of industry attributes with
the post-PNTR indicator yield a highly exible DID specication in that it not only
controls for proxies of alternate explanations of our baseline results, but also allows for

    22 Our ndings are in line with those of Harrison and McMillan (2011) who show that, in general,
oshore employment in low wage countries is a substitute for domestic employment among U.S.
manufacturers. Ebenstein, Harrison and McMillan (2013) nd that oshoring and increased import
competition are associated with wage declines for workers in exposed occupations.




                                                   14
the relationship between these proxies and employment growth to dier between the
pre- and post-PNTR periods.
   Before continuing, we note that consideration of potential alternate explanations
does not materially change the implied impact of PNTR on manufacturing employment
growth.   As indicated in the last row of Table 4, even with the exible specication
in equation 4 we continue to nd a substantial eect of PNTR: relative employment
growth from   d=1     to   d=6   years after the change in policy is -4.1 to -11.8 percent,
compared with -3.4 to -15.6 percent in the last row of Table 2. The remainder of the
section presents potential alternate explanations for our results, describes proxies for
each of these candidate explanations and reports the relationship between those proxies
and U.S. employment growth.



6.1 Changes in Chinese Policy
As part of its accession to the WTO, China agreed to ease formal and informal re-
strictions on foreign investment, reduce import barriers, and eliminate export licensing
requirements and production subsidies (WTO 2001). China's entry into the WTO also
eliminated quotas on certain apparel and textile exports that already had been relaxed
for other developing economies (Brambilla et al. 2009). These WTO-related reforms,
like PNTR, may have inuenced both manufacturing employment in the United States
and China-U.S. trade. We discuss each of these Chinese policy changes in turn.
   Barriers to Investment :   In joining the WTO, China agreed to treat foreign enter-
prises no less favorably than domestic rms. This reduction in barriers to investment
may have reduced the xed and variable costs associated with oshoring, providing
U.S. rms with a greater incentive to relocate some or all of their production to China.
As direct evidence of these reforms is unavailable, we examine whether U.S. employ-
ment losses are concentrated in industries most likely to benet from changes in the
institutional environment, i.e., industries in which contracting over inputs is more im-
portant. To account for this potential relationship, we add to our baseline regression
an interaction of a post-PNTR dummy and Nunn's (2007) measure of industries' con-
tract intensity, which rises with the share of intermediate inputs requiring relationship-
specic investment.    We expect a negative point estimate:       assuming investment in
China became easier after WTO accession, it should have the largest impact on U.S.
employment in industries where contracting is more important. As indicated in Table
4, the relationship is statistically insignicant in all years.
   Tari Barriers :   China reduced import taris on a number of products both before
and after its accession to the WTO. Reductions in Chinese import taris might be
expected to boost U.S. exports to China and thereby raise U.S. employment. On the
other hand, by lowering the cost of foreign inputs and thereby making China a more
attractive location for manufacturing, they may have had the opposite eect. Using
Chinese tari data from Brandt et al. (2010), we include an interaction of a post-PNTR
dummy with the change in Chinese import taris from 1996 to 2005. As indicated in
Table 4, we nd a generally positive relationship that is statistically signicant in years


                                             15
4 and 5, suggesting the second explanation dominates. The coecient estimates for
those two years imply that a one standard deviation decline in Chinese tari barriers
(0.07, from Table 1) reduces relative employment growth in the United States ve years
after 2001 by about 2 percentage points.
    Export Licensing :    As discussed in detail in Bai et al. (2013), China agreed to phase
out export licensing requirements by 2003. Because export licenses had formerly been
more dicult to obtain in some industries than others, their removal may have led to
a surge in Chinese exports and subsequent decline in U.S. manufacturing employment
                                                               23
in the industries where licensing was most binding.                 To account for this potential
inuence, we include in our regression an interaction of a post-PNTR indicator with
the share of rms eligible for export licenses in 1999 from Bai et al. (2013). As indicated
in Table 4, this coecient is statistically insignicant in all years.
    Production Subsidies :     Some have argued that the rapid expansion of China's man-
ufacturing sector was driven by subsidies, which may aect some industries more than
others (Haley and Haley 2013). We follow Girma et al. (2009) and Aghion et al. (2012)
and use rm-level data published by China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to
compute industry-level changes in the subsidy-per-sales ratio from 1999 to 2005, and
interact this variable with an indicator for the post-PNTR period. Here, a negative
relationship indicates rising subsidies are associated with falling employment. As indi-
cated in Table 4, we nd a negative but statistically insignicant relationship between
this covariate and employment growth in all years.
    Under the assumption that rising subsidies induce U.S. rms to le countervailing
duty (CVD) claims against Chinese producers, we also use data from Bown (2012) to
construct an indicator variable for industries in which either CVD or anti-dumping
(AD) claims have been led between 1990 and 1996 (pre-PNTR period) and 2001
through 2007 (post-PNTR period). We consider both CVD and AD lings because,
under U.S. trade policy, CVD claims could not be led against Chinese rms until
        24
2006.
    As indicated in Table 4, results for the interaction are negative and are statistically
insignicant except for years 5 and 6 (when CVD lings were permitted). Together, the
level and interaction coecient estimates for these years imply that industries in which
CVD or AD lings occur experience relative employment declines of approximately -4
percentage points.
    Finally, some suspect China of subsidizing a reallocation of production towards
products with higher levels of technology, which we measure using an indicator that
picks out industries identied by the U.S. Census Bureau as containing products with
advanced technology.        As indicated in the table, coecient estimates for the in-
teraction of this variable with the post-PNTR dummy are negative but statistically
insignicant at conventional levels.

  23 Khandelwal et al.   (2013) show that the allocation of export licenses in the apparel industry
restricted the exports of its most productive producers.
  24 Obviously, to the extent that employment losses are required to demonstrate injury in CVD and
AD investigations, this variable could be subject to reverse causality.



                                                  16
   Textile and Clothing Quotas :    During the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, the
United States, the EU and Canada agreed to eliminate quotas on developing country
textile and clothing exports in four phases starting in 1995 (Brambilla et al. 2009).
China was not eligible for these reductions until its accession to the WTO. We use data
provided by Khandelwal et al. (2013) to identify industries where the majority of HS
products experience relaxed quotas starting in 2001, and include an interaction of this
variable with a post-PNTR dummy variable. As indicated in Table 4, we nd a positive
and generally statistically signicant relationship between this interaction and job loss
after PNTR. This coecient reects the fact (evident in Table A.4 below) that while
job loss continued in these industries during the 2000s, losses were relatively greater in
the 1990s, when MFA quotas began being phased out for developing countries other
than China.



6.2 Shocks to U.S. Comparative Disadvantage Industries
As documented in Table 1, NTR gaps are negatively related to industry capital inten-
sity, with that attribute explaining 21 percent of the variation in the NTR gap across
industries. Assuming the U.S. has a comparative disadvantage           vis a vis   China in the
production of labor-intensive goods, an alternate explanation of the results in Section
5 is a post-2001 decline in the U.S. competitiveness of labor-intensive industries for
some reason unrelated to PNTR, e.g. a general movement towards oshoring perhaps
                                                                                      25
encouraged by the 2001 recession, or a positive productivity shock in China.
   While the baseline results presented in Section 5.1 already control for capital and
skill intensity, interactions of these attributes with a post-PNTR dummy allow the
relationship between factor intensity and employment growth to be dierent after 2001.
As indicated in Table 4, for capital intensity we nd that the interactions are negative
and statistically signicant in years 3 and 4, while the coecient on the level is not
statistically signicant.   Together, the interaction and level coecient estimates for
year 4, for example, imply that industries with capital intensity that is one standard
deviation larger have employment growth that is 3.1 percentage points higher in the
post-PNTR period.
   For skill intensity, the coecients for the level are negative and statistically signif-
icant in all years, while coecients for the interactions are positive and statistically
signicant after year 2. Together, the interaction and level coecient estimates across
all years imply that industries with skill intensity that is one standard deviation larger
have employment growth that is -1.4 (year 5) to -6.5 (year 3) percentage points lower
in the post-PNTR period.

 25 In fact, we show in Section F of the online appendix that China's TFP growth is uncorrelated
with the NTR gap.




                                              17
6.3 Union Resistance
Given the negative association between the NTR gap and union membership displayed
in Table 1, an alternate explanation of our results might be that all manufacturing
rms desired to reduce employment after 2001, but that unions impeded reductions in
some industries. We account for this potential explanation by including the level of
union membership in each peak year in our regressions. We also include an interaction
of this variable with a post-PNTR dummy to determine if the relationship between
union membership and employment growth changes after 2001.
   As indicated in Table 4, we nd a negative but generally statistically insignicant
relationship between union membership and employment growth, but nd that this
relationship becomes less negative after PNTR. The level and interaction estimates for
d=5   imply that a one standard deviation increase in union membership is associated
with a reduction in employment growth ve years after 2001 of -0.4 percentage points.



6.4 The IT Boom-Bust
The information technology (IT) sector experienced a well-known boom and bust
around the time that PNTR was implemented.          More generally, sectors that expe-
rience greater employment growth leading up to a peak may suer greater declines
after it, or may continue to grow at faster rates. We account for these potential ex-
planations of our results in two ways.    First, we include in our regression a variable
measuring industries' employment growth in the three years before each peak, 1997
to 2000 and 1988 to 1990 for the post- and pre-PNTR periods, respectively, as well
as interactions of this variable with a post-PNTR dummy. As indicated in Table 4,
coecients for the level are generally positive while coecients for the interaction are
generally negative. Together, the statistically signicant coecients for years 3, 4 and
5 indicate that industries with prior growth that is one standard deviation higher (0.12,
from Table 1) are associated with relative changes in employment growth of 0.2, -1.2
and -2.0 percentage points.
   The interaction of an indicator for advanced technology products and a post-PNTR
dummy variable discussed in Section 6.1 also provides information about the behavior
of the IT sector.   As noted there, coecient estimates are negative but statistically
insignicant at conventional levels.



6.5 The U.S. NTR Rate
Some of the variation in post- versus pre-PNTR U.S. manufacturing employment
growth may be driven by changes to U.S. NTR tari rates over our sample period.
To control for such changes, the results in Table 4 include a measure of the change
in U.S.   ad valorem   equivalent NTR tari rates from 1990 to 2001 interacted with an




                                           18
                                                26
indicator for the post-PNTR period.                  This interaction allows for the possibility that
reductions in U.S. taris over that period had a dierential impact on U.S. employment
before and after the 2001 peak. Coecient estimates for the eect of changes in the
NTR rate are not statistically signicant.



6.6 Non-PNTR-Induced Technical Change
Another explanation for our results is that they are driven by labor-saving technical
changes, such as automation, which are spuriously correlated with the NTR gap. While
technical change unrelated to PNTR is dicult to measure, several of the variables
discussed above  including indicators for advanced technology products (ATP) and
measures of industry skill and capital intensity  serve as useful proxies for where it
might show up. Coecient estimates for these variables, however, do not provide much
evidence in favor of technical change that is independent of the change in U.S. trade
policy.
         Moreover, we show in the next section that there is no relationship between the
U.S. NTR gap and the growth of manufacturing employment in the EU. If labor-saving
technological innovations unrelated to PNTR were spuriously correlated with the U.S.
                                                                                                 27
NTR gap, their impact also should be manifest in other developed economies.




7          Robustness

In this section we examine the validity of our DID assumptions, consider an alternate
DID specication, and compare manufacturing employment loss in the United States
to that of the European Union, which was not subject to the policy change experienced
in the United States.



7.1 Placebo DID Regressions
We consider two placebo regressions to assess the validity of our DID estimator. First,
we estimate the relationship between employment growth and the NTR gap in the
pre-PNTR and post-PNTR periods separately. As indicated in Table A.4 of the online
appendix, we nd no eect of the NTR gap on employment growth in the pre-PNTR
period, but nd that a higher NTR gap is associated with lower employment growth
in the post-PNTR period.
         Second, we apply the the same DID specication used above to an earlier period
that did not contain the policy change. Specically, we estimate equation 4 to examine

    26   Ad valorem equivalents of specic import taris are not available after 2001. Nonetheless, we note
that most of the changes in NTR taris driven by the Uruguay round had been implemented by 2001,
and that separate analysis of the      ad valorem and specic taris in the U.S. tari schedule indicates
few changes to U.S. NTR taris between 2001 and 2007.
    27 In contrast, we do nd evidence for trade-induced technical change that is associated with PNTR,
as discussed in section 8.2 below.



                                                       19
the relationship between the NTR gap and employment growth after the two NBER
peaks prior to PNTR, 1990 versus 1981. As shown in Table A.5 of the online appendix,
the DID coecient is statistically insignicant at conventional levels in this regression,
providing further support for our empirical strategy.



7.2 An Alternate DID Specication
Next, we re-estimate the eect of PNTR using an alternate DID specication that
makes use of annual employment data from 1990 to 2007:


                     2007
                     X                                                  2007
                                                                        X
ln(Eiy ) = Î± +                 Î¸j 1{j = y} Ã N T R Gapi,1999 +                  Î³j 1{j = y} Ã Xi + Î´i + Î´y + Îµiy .
                    j=1991                                             j=1991
                                                                                                                 (5)

This specication regresses log industry employment in year                       y on interactions of the full
set of year dummies and the NTR gap (the rst summation term), interactions of year
dummies and the industry characteristics discussed in Section 6 (second summation
                                                                  28
term), and both year and industry xed eects.                          In contrast with equation 2, this
specication allows for a dierent relationship between the NTR gap and employment
in each year of the sample period, as well as a dierent relationship between all of the
additional industry characteristics and employment in each year.
      Estimates of        Î¸j   are reported in Table 5, where the results in the rst column are
from a regression that omits the interactions of year xed eects with                               Xi   while the
results in the second column are from a regression that includes them. (Estimates of
Î³j    are omitted from column 2 to conserve space, but are available upon request.)
      Three aspects of the results stand out.                  First, estimates of        Î¸j   are negative and
statistically signicant in the post-PNTR period, consistent with our earlier nding
that PNTR is associated with lower manufacturing employment. Second, estimates of
Î¸j   are not statistically signicant in the pre-PNTR period, indicating that losses in the
post-PNTR period are not part of a pre-existing trend. Third, the implied impact of
PNTR on relative employment growth after six years (i.e, from 2001 and 2007 versus
1990 to 1996) is 15.3 percentage points in column 1 and 18.1 percentage points in
column 2, versus 15.6 and 11.8 percentage points in the nal rows of Tables 2 and
                     29
4, respectively.           This robust relationship between the NTR gap and manufacturing
                                                                                                                  30
employment is particularly compelling given the highly exible nature of equation 5.

     28 For industry attributes that are time-varying, e.g., capital intensity,      Xi   is dened as the level in
the rst year of the sample, 1990.
     29 Employment growth        d   years after 1990 or 2001 is computed in three steps. First, multiply the
coecient estimates in either column of Table 5 by 0.32, the average value of the NTR gap from
Section 3. Second, exponentiate this product and subtract 1. Third, for growth                  d   years after 2001,
subtract the growth up to that year from the result in step 2. The estimated changes in employment
from 1990 to 1996 are -1.3 (column 1) and 2.5 (column 2) percent. The corresponding growth rates
for 2001 to 2007 are -16.6 and -15.6 percentage points.
     30 While this alternate DID specication is highly exible, its long sample period renders it suscep-



                                                          20
7.3 A Comparison With the EU
In this section, we compare manufacturing employment growth in the United States to
the European Union. In contrast to the United States, the European Union granted
permanent most-favored-nation status to China in 1980 (Casarini 2006). China's acces-
sion to the WTO, therefore, had little eect on either actual or expected taris in the
EU, and imports from China were not subject to the annual potential tari increases
                                  31
present in the United States.
    We compare U.S. and EU outcomes using data on manufacturing employment at
the four-digit International Standard Industrial Classication (ISIC) level available
                32
from UNIDO.          As these data are available only for the years 1997 to 2005 (with 2003
missing for the United States), we make use of a DID specication similar to that
described in the previous sub-section,



                               2005
                               X
             ln(Eiy ) = Î± +            Î¸j 1{j = y} â N T R Gapi,1999 + Î´i + Î´y + Îµiy .           (6)
                              j=1998

The variables associated with the summation represent interactions of the full set of
year dummies with the NTR gap, while             Î´i   and   Î´y   are industry and year xed eects,
respectively. Table 6 reports the results of estimating this equation separately on EU
versus U.S. employment. As shown in the rst column of the table, the DID coecients
for the EU are statistically insignicant at conventional levels in all years. By contrast,
results for the United States, in column 2, are consistent with those reported in Table
5: coecients for interactions of the NTR gap with year dummies are both negative
                                                                                 33
and statistically signicant starting in 2001, after PNTR is enacted.
    These results have two implications. First, they indicate that employment declines
associated with the NTR gap in the United States do not appear to be correlated with
an unobserved shock aecting manufacturing employment globally. For example, if the

tible to biased standard errors associated with serial correlation (Bertrand, Duo and Mullainathan
2003). For that reason, and because equation 2 is more amenable to decomposition by gross margins
in Section 8.1, equation 2 remains as our preferred specication.
  31 China was a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) beneciary in the EU before and after
its accession to the WTO. According to European Commission (2003), Chinese import taris under
the EU GSP program did not change when it joined the WTO. The EU renews GSP every decade
and conducts annual revisions to their rates.   These changes are generally made on a product-by-
product rather than country-by-country basis, suggesting that they are not biased towards China.
Nevertheless, we note that the majority of the EU's GSP rate changes in recent years involve products
in which Chinese exporters are active.
  32 See section G of the online appendix for additional information regarding the UNIDO data.
  33 The four-digit ISIC industries across which employment is reported are more aggregate than
either the SIC and NAICS industries across which U.S. employment data is reported by the Cen-
sus, accounting for some of the variation between the results for the United States in this and
the preceding section.   We aggregate NTR gaps to the six-digit HS level and then map them to
the four-digit ISIC level using publicly available concordances from the World Bank, available at
www.wits.worldbank.org/wits/product_concordance.html.



                                                  21
trends in U.S. employment were due to a technology shock in industries that happen
to be high gap, or to a productivity shock in China, we would expect to see similar
eects in the EU, another large developed economy. The lack of a relationship between
the NTR gap and employment in the EU is further evidence against these explana-
tions. Second, these results conrm the relationship between employment declines and
the NTR gap in the United States using an entirely dierent dataset and industrial
classication system for employment.




8       Additional Eects of PNTR

8.1 Job Creation versus Job Destruction
In this section we decompose the implied impact of PNTR on overall industry employ-
ment growth by the gross margins of job creation (JC) versus job destruction (JD).
Job creation is the change in employment due to expansion at continuing plants, the
birth of plants within continuing rms and the birth of new rms. Job destruction is
the change in employment due to contraction at continuing plants, the death of plants
                                                                  34
within continuing rms and the death of existing rms.
     Using equation 4, we estimate a separate regression for each gross margin                   m =
{JC, JD}      and interval   d,   where the dependent variable is the cumulative change in
employment along the margin as a percent of initial            industry   employment,


                                   âEi,t:t+d   (Eim,t+d â Eimt )
                                             =                   .                                 (7)
                                     Eit              Eit
This variable is designed so that the sum of the changes across margins equals the
                                            P
overall change from equation 4, i.e.,  m âEim,t:t+d /Eit = âEi,t:t+d /Eit .
     To conserve space, we summarize the results of these regressions in Figure 4, which
displays the respective contributions of JC and JD to the overall implied impact of
PNTR reported in the last row of Table 4. As can be seen in the gure, both margins
are inuential in overall employment loss, with elevated job destruction accounting for
approximately three quarters of the overall cumulative relative decline between 2001
and 2007, and anemic job creation accounting for the remaining quarter.
     These results suggest a role for trade policy in trends that have been associated with
the joblessness of the 2001 recovery in manufacturing. Faberman (2012), for example,
points out that the sluggishness of that recovery coincides with a decline in job creation
rates and an increase in job destruction rates in the manufacturing sector starting in

    34 A plant is coded as being born within an incumbent rm if it appears in the data for the rst
time during the noted interval and is associated with an already present rm identier. A plant is
classied as dying within a continuing rm if it is part of the rm at the beginning of the interval
but is no longer present afterward. A rm is classied as being born during an interval if none of its
plants are present in the LBD before that interval. A rm is classied as dying if all of its plants no
longer appear in the data after the interval.




                                                  22
the late 1990s. Our results show that PNTR is associated with employment loss along
each of these margins of adjustment.



8.2 Other Industry Outcomes
In this section we employ data from the CM to examine the eects of PNTR on a rich
set of industry characteristics  including disaggregations of employment by type of
worker, as well as capital and skill intensity  that are not reported in the LBD. The
DID specication we use for this analysis takes the same general form as equation 2,
but because the CM is conducted only in years ending in 2 and 7, the pre-PNTR period
is dened as the decade around the 1990 peak, 1987 to 1997, while the post-PNTR
period is dened as the decade around the 2001 peak, 1997 to 2007.
   We begin by estimating the relationship between the NTR gap and several cate-
gories of employment. Results are reported in Table 7. The negative and statistically
signicant coecient in the rst column implies that PNTR reduced total employment
growth by -19.5 percentage points from 1997 to 2007 versus the prior decade. Results
in columns 2 and 3 reveal that the implied impact of PNTR is roughly twice as large
for production workers (-23.4 percentage points) as for non-production workers (-11.2
percentage points). The estimates in column 4 indicate that PNTR also had a substan-
tial (-18.7 percentage points) negative eect on the growth rate of production hours,
conrming that the decline in employment can not be solely attributed to an increase
in the number of hours worked per employee.
   Next, we examine the association between PNTR and changes in the factor intensity
of the production process. The results in column 5 show that capital declines less than
overall employment (-15.3 versus -19.5 percentage points) and, as a result, column 6
reports an increase in capital intensity associated with PNTR, although the estimated
eect is not statistically signicant. In terms of the labor composition of production,
the results in column 7 indicate that PNTR is associated with a statistically signicant
increase in skilled labor intensity.
   These results on the relationship between PNTR and factor intensity complement
recent research in international trade and macroeconomics in three ways. First, to the
extent that non-production workers embody higher levels of human capital than pro-
duction workers, they suggest increases in skill intensity consistent with those reported
by Bloom, Draca and Van Reenen (2012) for the United Kingdom. Second, they are
also in accord with research by Bernard et al. (2006), Khandelwal (2010) and Schott
(2008) that shows that rms in high-wage countries like the United States alter their
product mix towards goods more consistent with comparative advantage in response to
competition from low-wage countries. Third, to the extent that production workers are
more likely to engage in routine tasks, they relate to Jaimovich and Siu's (2012) nding
that jobs focusing on such tasks were more likely to disappear following recessions.

8.3 Plant Outcomes
In this section, we examine the impact of PNTR on outcomes at the plant level. This
analysis is useful for several reasons. First, it provides information on the extent to
which the industry-level results estimated in the previous section can be attributed
to changes within continuing plants, versus those arising from plant birth and death.
Second, it allows us to investigate whether plant attributes moderate the estimated
                        35
aects of PNTR.              Lastly, we can use information from the CM on the set of products
produced by each plant to analyze the relationship between plant outcomes and a
plant-specic measure of the NTR gap, which we calculate as the weighted-average
                                                                           36
NTR gap across all of the industries in which the plant is active.              We rst estimate the
relationship between these gaps and the log growth in outcomes (O ) among continuing
plants:

                âln(Op,t:t+10 ) = Î± + Î¸1{P ost â P N T Rt } Ã N T R Gapp,1999                     (8)

                                + Î³1 1{P ost â P N T Rt } Ã Xpt + Î³2 Xpt + Î´t + Î´p + Îµpt
As in the previous section, there are two observations for each plant (p) corresponding
to growth ten years after           t = {1987, 1997}. Xpt    is a matrix of plant characteristics
in year     t   that includes capital and skill intensity, age and total factor productivity
           37
(TFP).          As with our industry-level regressions, we allow the relationship between
the dependent variables and plant attributes to vary across the pre- and post-PNTR
periods. Regressions also include plant (Î´p ) and period          t (Î´t ) xed eects to control for
unobserved, time-invariant plant attributes and aggregate shocks that aect all plants
equally.
    The results reported in the rst seven columns of Table 8 yield implied eects that
are qualitatively similar to those found at the industry level (Table 7), though larger
in absolute magnitude.            The rst column reveals that the implied impact of PNTR
on continuing plants' relative employment growth is substantial, at -23.9 percentage
points. Results in the next two columns show that PNTR again has roughly twice the
impact on production workers (-30.7 percentage points; column 3) as non-production

  35 Holmes and Stevens (2013), for example discuss how increased import competition from China can
have heterogeneous eects among plants within an industry, with the biggest negative eect observed
at large plants producing standardized goods, while small plants producing specialty goods are less
aected.
  36 Bernard et al. (2010) provide a detailed discussion of these data.
  37 We measure TFP with an index number approach in which output is measured as the logarithm of
deated revenue and inputs  cost of materials, production employment, non-production employment
and book value of capital  weighted by the average cost share for each input, at the industry level.
While we deate revenue with industry-level price deators from Becker et al. (2013) to obtain our
measure of output, we note that productivity measures constructed from revenue information may be
biased due to establishment-level variation in prices. These prices reect variation in demand shocks
or markups, which can also be aected by changes in trade policy (Pierce 2011 and De Loecker,
Goldberg, Khandelwal and Pavcnik 2012).        For a detailed discussion of the properties of this TFP
measure, as well as the limitations of revenue-based forms of productivity, see Foster, Haltiwanger
and Syverson (2008).



                                                   24
workers (-15.8 percentage points; column 2).          Here, however, the implied impact on
continuing plants' skill intensity (column 7), like capital intensity (column 6), is sta-
tistically insignicant at conventional levels. Finally, the results in column 4 indicate
that the implied impact of PNTR on production hours (-27.0 percentage points) is
roughly the same as on production employment, suggesting no substantial change in
hours worked per employee. The similarity of the plant- and industry-level estimates
have two implications. First, they indicate that the eects of PNTR are not due solely
to plant birth and death. Second, they conrm a role for PNTR even when controlling
for variation in plant attributes within industries.
     To investigate the impact of PNTR on the extensive margin of plant death, we
amend equation 8 by dening the dependent variable to be one if a plant exits between
year   t   and year   t + 10,   and zero otherwise. The relationship between PNTR and plant
death is then estimated in a linear probability model, where the independent variables
are identical to those in equation 8. Results are displayed in the nal column of Table
8.   We nd that PNTR is associated with a higher probability of plant death, with
plants in the average industry being 9.2 percent (0.288*0.32) more likely to die relative
to the pre-period. These ndings provide additional evidence of a link between PNTR
and oshoring by demonstrating that higher NTR gaps are associated with greater
probability of exit as well as greater declines in employment and larger increases in
imports from China.



8.4 Input-Output Linkages
In this section, we explore whether the eects of PNTR are transmitted through input-
output linkages by computing up- and downstream NTR gaps that reect the exposure
of each plant to PNTR via its supply chain.            To the extent that lower-cost inputs
benet plants in downstream industries there may be a positive relationship between
employment in plant        p and its upstream NTR gap.    On the other hand, there may be a
negative relationship between employment and the downstream gap if PNTR adversely
aects plants' customers. Furthermore, if greater exposure to PNTR induces plant         p's
up- or downstream industries to relocate to China, it may increase the probability that
plant   p also exits the United States, since proximity to the supply chain is an important
determinant of the location of manufacturing activity (Ellison, Glaeser and Kerr 2010).
     As we do not have information on the industries from which individual plants
buy and to which they sell, we approximate plants' up- and downstream NTR gaps
using industry-level information from U.S. input-output tables. We calculate the up-
stream NTR gap for a plant in six-digit NAICS industry             i (U pstream N T R Gapi )
as the weighted average NTR gap across all six-digit NAICS industries used to pro-
duce    i,   employing IO coecients from the BEA's 1997 total requirements table as
weights. However, given that plants often produce a range of goods within the same
sector (Bernard et al. 2010), we set the weights for any six-digit NAICS input within
i's three-digit NAICS root to zero. We compute industry i's downstream NTR Gap
(DownstreamN T RGapi ) analogously. Using the concordances referenced in Section 3,


                                                 25
we then map these NAICS-based up- and downstream NTR gaps to the major industry
                  38
of each plant.         These gaps are then incorporated into equation 8.
      Before continuing, we note that our measures of supply chain linkages to PNTR have
several weaknesses. First, the upstream and downstream gaps are based on industry-
level IO relationships and therefore do not take into account the substantial hetero-
geneity across plants in the industries from which they source inputs and to which
they sell outputs.        In particular, some plants may produce inputs that other plants
source from an upstream industry. Second, the own, upstream and downstream gaps
are highly related, with correlations of 0.46 and 0.24 for own versus upstream and own
                                       39
versus downstream, respectively.            These high correlations likely reduce the precision
of our estimates by inating the associated standard errors.                Finally, supply chains
linkages need not be uni-directional (Baldwin and Venables 2012), since it is possible
for plants in one industry to both purchase inputs from and sell outputs to plants in
another industry. Given these caveats, results based on the up- and downstream NTR
gaps should be interpreted with some caution.
      We report results for continuing plants' total employment growth as well as plant
death in Table 9. As indicated in the rst column of the table, the coecient estimate
for a plant's own-industry NTR gap on employment growth continues to be negative
and statistically signicant, and of a similar magnitude to the estimate in Table 8
(-0.701 versus -0.748).       The coecients for plants' up- and downstream NTR gaps,
however, are not statistically signicant at conventional levels, suggesting little role
for our measures of PNTR's supply chain eects in explaining employment growth at
continuing plants. Summing the eects of the own, upstream and downstream NTR
gaps, we nd that PNTR lowered relative employment growth at continuing plants
by -26.3 (-0.701*.32+-0.556*.11+0.200*.11) percentage points, slightly larger than the
-23.9 percentage point eect attributed to the own-industry NTR gap alone in Table
8.
      In contrast with the results for employment growth at continuing rms, however,
we do nd evidence of PNTR having eects via the supply chain when examining the
probability of plant death. As shown in the second column of Table 9, a higher own-
industry NTR gap continues to be associated with a higher probability of death, as in
the last column of Table 8. Here, however, we nd that the coecient estimates for the
up- and downstream NTR gaps are both positive and statistically signicant, indicating
that plants are more likely to die when industries either up or down their supply chain
have greater exposure to PNTR. This increase in the probability of plant death due
to up- and downstream exposure to PNTR may reect pressure to exit and relocate if
the policy change induces a large segment of the U.S. supply chain to move oshore, as
argued in Baldwin and Venables (2012). Aggregating the eects of the own, upstream
and downstream NTR gaps on the probability of plant death, we estimate that a plant

     38 The mean and standard deviation of the upstream NTR gap is 0.11 and 0.04. For the downstream
NTR gap, they are 0.11 and 0.08, respectively.
     39 The correlation between the up- and downstream NTR gaps is -0.03.




                                                  26
in the average industry is 15.4 (0.149*0.32+0.570*0.11+0.393*0.11) percent more likely
to die as a result of PNTR, versus 9.2 percent in the nal column of Table 8.




9    Conclusion

This paper documents a strong relationship between the sharp decline in U.S. manu-
facturing employment beginning in 2001 and the United States' conferral of permanent
normal trade relations on China, a policy that is notable for eliminating the possibility
of future tari increases rather than reducing the taris actually applied to Chinese
goods.
    We measure the eect of PNTR as the gap between the low NTR rates that were
made permanent by PNTR and the higher non-NTR rates to which they would have
risen if an annual renewal of NTR had failed. Using a dierence-in-dierences speci-
cation, we show that industries with higher NTR gaps experience larger employment
declines, along with disproportionate increases in U.S. imports from China, the num-
ber of U.S. rms importing from China, the number of Chinese rms exporting to the
United States, and the number of U.S.-China importer-exporter pairs. These results
are robust to inclusion of variables proxying for a wide range of alternate explana-
tions for the observed trends in employment and trade.       Moreover, we demonstrate
that the pattern of employment losses in the United States  which experienced the
policy change  are not present in the European Union, which had granted China the
equivalent of PNTR status in 1980.
    Having established a strong link between the change in trade policy and U.S. em-
ployment outcomes, this research raises several important, but challenging questions.
To what extent can PNTR explain the diverging trends of value-added and employ-
ment in the U.S. manufacturing sector? What impact did PNTR have on U.S. prices
and consumption patterns? To what extent did U.S. rms change the composition of
their output in response to PNTR, and how large were the associated transition costs?
We hope to bring additional data to bear on these questions in future research.

text were computed, as well as additional empirical results referenced in the main text.




A     Constructing NTR Gaps

Computation of the NTR gap for each NAICS industry takes four steps. First, NTR
gaps are computed at the eight-digit HS level as the dierence between the non-NTR
and NTR import tari rates described in the next section. Second, using the concor-
dance developed by Pierce and Schott (2012b), we match all HS import codes used by
the United States between 1989 and 2001 to a time-invariant set of eight-digit HS code
families. This step ensures that NTR gaps from HS codes added or deleted over time
are incorporated in all years for which we may want to compute an NTR gap. Without
this step, NTR gaps might be available for a dierent number of NAICS industries
across the years 1989 to 2001, if HS codes matched to certain NAICS industries appear
in some years but not others.          Third, we match these time consistent HS codes to
NAICS industries using an HS-NAICS concordance from the U.S. Bureau of Economic
                  40
Analysis (BEA).         Fourth, we compute the NTR gap for each NAICS industry as the
average NTR gap across all time-consistent HS codes matched to that NAICS industry.
    We calculate the upstream NTR gap for NAICS industry                       i as the weighted average
NTR gap across all industries used to produce i, using the coecients from the BEA's
                                                                                               41
industry-by-industry total requirements input-output matrix as weights.                             Likewise,
the downstream NTR gap for NAICS industry                 i is the weighted average NTR gap of all
industries supplied by industry        i,   again using the total requirements table coecients
as weights. In computing both weighted averages, we set the IO weights to zero for
up- and downstream industries within industry                  i's   three-digit NAICS sector. We do
this in recognition of the fact that U.S. manufacturing establishments often produce
clusters of products within the same three-digit NAICS sector (Bernard et al. 2010).

B     U.S. Trade Policy Towards China

B.1 Statutory U.S. Import Taris
As noted in the main text, we use the   ad valorem   equivalent NTR and non-NTR tari
rates from Feenstra, Romalis and Schott (2002) to compute the NTR gaps by industry
and year. This section describes the distribution of NTR and non-NTR tari rates by
eight-digit HS tari line and year.
    Non-NTR tari rates, which can contain      ad valorem,   specic and other compo-
nents  exhibit little change from 1989 to 2001.      Indeed, 92 percent of the 13,700
unique tari lines that appear in the Feenstra et al. (2002) dataset exhibit no change
in their underlying ad valorem component over the years for which they are used.
Even fewer tari lines  55 and 2, respectively  exhibit changes to their specic or
other components. Furthermore, we nd that more than 95 percent of the changes
to the ad valorem component of the non-NTR rates occur in 1997, indicating they
likely are related to changes triggered by the revision of HS codes in that year. For
further detail, Pierce and Schott (2012) provide a detailed discussion of these changes.
    NTR tari rates exhibit greater variation than non-NTR tari rates. Of the 13,700
tari lines used during the 1989 to 2001 period, 6,127, 1,164 and 11 exhibit variation in
their underlying ad valorem, specic and other components, respectively, during
this period. These changes generally are implemented from 1995 to 1999, indicating
they are related to the tari reductions negotiated during the Uruguay Round of the
GATT.



B.2 Annual Renewals of NTR Status
The U.S. House of Representatives voted to overturn the Presidential waiver on Chinese
import taris every year from 1990 to 2001. Table A.1 records the share of votes against
renewal during these years.




C     Data Sources

This section describes the sources for the non-U.S.-Census data used in the main text.


    â¢ Chinese Import Taris :   Brandt et al.   (2012) report Chinese import taris by
      eight-digit Chinese HS code for 1996 to 2005, though data for some HS codes are
      missing. We aggregate these taris up to the six-digit HS level and then from the
      six-digit HS level to U.S. NAICS codes using concordances developed by Pierce
      and Schott (2012a). For each U.S. industry-year, this aggregation is the simple
      average of the taris of the six-digit HS codes encompassed by the industry. We
      then calculate the change in Chinese import tari rates over the maximum span
      for which taris are available  1996 to 2005  and refer to this variable as the
      change in Chinese import taris.



                                           42
â¢ Chinese Production Subsidies :   We use condential data from the Annual Report
  of Industrial Enterprise Statistics compiled by China's National Bureau of Statis-
  tics (NBS), which reports the subsidies provided to responding rms. Following
  Girma et al. (2009) and Aghion et al. (2012), we use the variable subsidy in
  this dataset to compute subsidy per sales ratios for each four-digit China Indus-
  try Classication (CIC) and year. We then concord the CICs to ISIC and then
  U.S. SIC industries using concordances provided by Dean and Lovely (2010). The
  NBS data encompass a census of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and a survey
  of all non-SOEs with annual sales above 5 million Renminbi (~$600,000). The
  version of the NBS dataset available to us from Khandelwal et al. (2013) spans
  the period 1998 to 2005.


â¢ Chinese Export Eligibility :   Prior to their phasing out by 2003, export licenses
  were more dicult to obtain in some Chinese industries than others.         Bai et
  al.   (2013) use the features of this policy to determine the share of Chinese
  producers in each four-digit CIC industry that were eligible to export in 1999.
  We concord these shares to ISIC and then U.S. SIC industries using concor-
  dances provided by Dean and Lovely (2010) and the United Nations, available at
  http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regot.asp.


â¢ Quotas on Chinese Textile and Clothing Exports to the United States :   We identify
  industries in which quotas on Chinese exports of textiles and clothing are relaxed
  from 2001 to 2007 using data reported by Khandelwal et al. (2013). These data
  list the HS codes for which quotas are relaxed. Here, we match these HS codes
  to industries using concordances developed by Pierce and Schott (2012a).


â¢ Industries' Contract Intensity :   Nunn (2007) uses the 1997 U.S. input-output
  tables to develop a measure of the portion of industries' intermediate inputs
  that require relationship-specic investments. Industries with higher shares (e.g.,
  automobiles) are assumed to be harder to contract over than industries with lower
  shares (e.g., poultry processing). These data are available from Nunn's website
  at http://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/pages/data-0.


â¢ U.S. Union Membership :    The website www.unionstats.com  assembled by Hirsch
  and Macpherson (2003)  publishes information on the share of workers that are
  members of a union by Current Population Survey (CPS) industry classication
  and year. We match CPS industries to SIC codes using the concordances posted
  at unionstats.com.


â¢ Advanced Technology Products (ATP) :       The U.S. Census Bureau identies prod-
  ucts  dened at the ten-digit HS level  that contain advanced technology in
  ten areas: biotech, life sciences, opto-electronics, IT, electronics, exible manu-
  facturing, advanced materials, aerospace, weapons and nuclear technology. We
  match these HS codes to NAICS industries using concordances developed by



                                        43
        Pierce and Schott (2012a).        The Census ATP classication can be downloaded
        from http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/reference/codes/atp/.


     â¢ U.S. Anti-dumping (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) Filings :                     We identify
        industries that received AD and CVD protection using datasets assembled by
                                                                                        42
        Bown (2012), which list AD and CVD actions by HS code and year.                      We match
        these HS codes to industries using concordances developed by Pierce and Schott
        (2012a). The AD and CVD data are available online at http://data.worldbank.org/data-
        catalog/temporary-trade-barriers-database.




D        Creating a Constant Manufacturing Sample

As noted in the main text, we use the algorithm developed in Pierce and Schott (2012b)
to create a constant manufacturing sample over which employment changes can be
analyzed.      This algorithm creates families of four-digit SIC and six-digit NAICS
codes that group related SIC and NAICS categories together over the 1977 to 1997
and 1997 to 2007 periods over which SIC and NAICS codes were used, respectively.
     For example, if an SIC code splits into several NAICS codes between 1997 and
2002, the SIC code and its NAICS children would be grouped into the same family.
If one of those NAICS codes later matches with an updated NAICS code whose family
history includes a broader set of SIC, those subsequent NAICS and SIC codes join the
original family.
     Given this process, it is easy to see that some families can grow to be quite large. For
this reason, we have created several concordances that limit the inclusion of children
that do not account for some threshold level of their parents' activity.                     (Industry-
to-industry concordances generally specify both paternity and the share of activity
 in terms of output or employment  which they inherit.)                    These limits create a
tradeo.     Higher thresholds generate a larger number of families with more closely
related underlying SIC and NAICS codes. Lower thresholds lead to a smaller number of
families, most of which are likely to include both manufacturing and non-manufacturing
codes.
     In all of the results contained in the main text, we use a threshold of 50 percent
                      43
to create families.        This threshold works as follows. First, sort all children industries
j   that match to parent industries       i in descending order according to their importance
in value terms to parent industry         i. Keep all children matches j until the cumulative
    42 The United States led 165 anti-dumping cases against China between 1980 and 2012, of which
65 were led between 1999 and 2007. U.S. rms were unable to le CVD cases against Chinese rms
until 2006. The number of CVD cases in the years from 2006 to 2011 are 1, 7, 5, 10, 3, 4, and 2,
respectively. We note that CVD investigations led in 2006 and 2007 are in industries in which AD
cases also were led in those years.
    43 However, we note that the main results in the paper are qualitatively identical to those obtained
when we dene industries at the standard six-digit NAICS level, indicating that the results are not
driven by our denition of industry families.

for the overwhelming majority of parent i s overall value.




E     Chinese Exporters

In the main text, we use an identier in the U.S. trade data to count the number of
Chinese rms exporting to the United States. In this section, we use the transaction-
level trade data from China's National Bureau of Statistics, provided by Khandelwal
et al. (2013), to examine the relative growth of Chinese rms exporting to the U.S.
market versus other markets. Given the short sample period  data are available from
2000 to 2005, we employ a variant of the DID specication used in Section 7:



                                       2005
                                       X

                              j=2001
                               2005
                               X
                         +             Î³3j 1{j = y}
                              j=2001

The left-hand side variable represents the log of the number of Chinese rms exporting
six-digit HS product      h   to country        c   in year   y.   The rst set of covariates on the right-
hand side of the specication represent the DID terms of interest, i.e., interactions of
the 1999 U.S. NTR gap, an indicator for exports to the United States and an indicator
for the year. The remaining terms on the right-hand side of the equation are all possible
interactions of these three covariates.
    Results for   Î¸j   are reported in Table A.2. As indicated in the table, coecients are
positive in all years and statistically signicant at the ten percent level for 2002 to
2005. The coecients for the 2002 and 2005 interactions indicate that the number of
Chinese rms exporting to the U.S. was 9.7 and 35.2 percent larger, respectively, for
                                                       44
an industry with the average NTR gap.

  44 These magnitudes are calculated by multiplying the coecient estimates reported in Table A.2
by the average NTR gap, 0.323, exponentiating the product and then subtracting 1.

F       Chinese Productivity Growth

We use the rm-level Chinese production data described in Section C of this online
appendix to investigate the relationship between productivity growth in Chinese in-
dustries and the U.S. NTR gap.            Following Khandelwal et al.       (2013), we dene the
total factor productivity for rm     f   as   ln(T F Pf ) = ln(vaf )âÎ±f ln(wf )â(1âÎ±f ) ln(kf ),
where  vaf , wf , and kf denote rm value added, wages and xed assets (net of depre-
ciation) and Î±f is the rm's share of wages in total value added. Wages are dened as
reported rm wages plus employee benets (unemployment insurance, housing subsi-
dies, pension and medical insurance), and capital is dened as reported capital stock at
                                                               45
original purchase price less accumulated depreciation.              We aggregate these productiv-
ity measures to the industry level by taking weighted averages using rms' employment
as weights. Next, we use concordances provided by Brandt et al. (2013) to match HS-
level NTR gaps for the United State to the four-digit Chinese Industry Classication
(CIC) codes used in the NBS data.
    Table A.3 reports the results of industry-level OLS regressions of Chinese TFP on
year xed eects, industry xed eects and interactions of year xed eects and the
U.S. NTR gap. Coecient estimates for all but the interaction terms are suppressed.
As indicated in the table, the association between TFP and the NTR gap is statistically
insignicant at conventional levels in all years.




G       U.S. and E.U. Employment Data from UNIDO

Our comparison of the relationship between the NTR gap and manufacturing employ-
ment in the United States and the European Union in Section 7.3 uses data from the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization's (UNIDO) INDSTAT 4 database
                    46
for 1997 to 2005.        This database contains information on a number of industry char-
acteristics, including employment, at the four-digit International Standard Industrial
Classication (ISIC) Revision 3 level.            Manufacturing industries in the ISIC begin
with two digit codes from 15 to 37.            We exclude industries that begin with 22 from
our denition of manufacturing as they include publishing, which was classied as
manufacturing under the SIC, but not the NAICS. Our denition of the European
Union is based on the current set of 28 EU members, available at europa.eu/about-
eu/countries/member-countries. Because of instances of missing data, our sample in-
cludes only industry-country pairs for which data are present in every year. Lastly, we
note that data for the U.S. are unavailable in 2003.
  45 This approach assumes revenue-based TFP reveals variation in physical eciency, an assumption
whose limitations are discussed in Section 8.3 of the main text.
  46 See www.unido.org/resources/statistics/statistical-databases/indstat4-2013-edition.html.

H     U.S. Business Cycle Peaks

Figure A.3 compares economic activity around the 2001 and two prior NBER peaks.
As illustrated in the gure, the 1981 recession stands out in terms of both GDP and
Industrial Production Index (IP) declines. Peak to trough, IP falls 8.6 percent during
the 1981 recession versus less than half that amount during the 1990 and 2001 reces-
sions. Loss of manufacturing employment, by contrast, is far more severe following the
2001 recession than the 1981 and 1990 recessions.
