            The Level arid Volatility of Interest Rates in the
             United States: The Roles of Expected Inflation,
                          Real Rates, and Taxes


                                 ABSTRACT

     This paper attempts to demonstrate a need to expand the simple
Fisherian view whereby changes in interest rates are explained largely
by changes in expected inflation. It presents and tests a model of
expected, after—tax real interest rate behavior which, together with
a group of explanatory variables suggested by a structural model, takes
full account of implications of a broad range of U.S. tax code provisions
for behavior of interest rates. Determinants of interest rate volatility
are also investigated.

     The model and results of empirical testing suggest: (1) why the
measured impact on interest rates of changes in anticipated inflation
has been below levels anticipated by many investigators; (2) how the
measured impact on interest rates of explanatory variables is conditional
on tax rates which may change over time; (3) larger than expected fiscal
deficits have a moderate positive impact on interest rates (40 basis
points per 100 billion annual rise for three—month Treasury bills) while
lower than expected money growth may also raise interest rates (as iri the
second quarter of 1981 when it did so by an estimated 24 basis points);
(4) inflation uncertainty produces no significant impact on interest
rates due to the econometric effect of including a measure of excess
capacity; (5) an unexpected rise in money demand may be responsible for
persistently higher interest rates during the first half of 1982 but
during most of the 1960—82 period money supply shocks had a more powerful
impact on interest rates.

                             I.    Introduction

     This paper analyzes the major forces affecting the behavior of

interest rates, with particular emphasis on the unusually high ieves

and variability of rates in recent years. The approach is eclectic

in the sense that strong prior views are not allowed to rule Out consid-

eration of any possible avenue of investigation that might hel. to

explain unusual interest rate movements.

     As Irving Fisher theorized a long time ago, the market interest rate

(hereafter, the interest rate) on a security maturing in flt" periods

of time is approximately the sum of an expected real rate (hereafter,

the real rate) and the level of inflation expected over "t" periodE.

A change in the level or the volatility of interest rates should thus

arise from (a) a change in the level or the volatility of the real rate;

(b) a change in the level or the volatility of expected infl'tion; c'

(c) a change in the impact that unit changes in either or both of these

variables has on interest rates.

     In fact, it has been difficult to explain fully the behavior of

interest rates for two reasons. First, econometric models estimated

for a particular sample period have tended to perform poorly outside

of the sample period. Second, since both expected inflation and the

real rate are unobservable variables, attribution of movements in

interest rates to either of these components has depended crucially on

the use of proxies to represent their behavior. The latter problem has

been highlighted recently, when efforts to slow money growth at a time

when actual and expected fiscal deficits are growing, have resulted in

higher real rates, slowdowns in economic activity and in currency

appreciation. Furthermore, contrary to a considerable body of economic

theory, it appears that the real rate may be quite responsive over more

than the very short run (say, one quarter) to monetary and fiscal policy

actions and/or to fluctuations in economic activity.

     The possible relationship between the configuration of monetary and

fiscal policy and the real rate has had a significant impact on analysis

of costs attributed to measures aimed at controlling inflation (see

Makin, 1982b). Based on conventional macroeconomic theory, it would be

considered unusual to hear calls for tax increases or cuts in government

spending in the midst of a serious recession. Yet such calls have been

heard with increasing frequency since the onset of the U.S. recession

in the summer of 1981, and, indeed, in the summer of 1982 there was a

major tax increase in the United States. The usual arguments for pump—

priming measures aimed at ending recessions have become less convincing

amid widespread concern that fiscal deficits, both actual and projected,

have been responsible for the high real rates that have depressed U.S.

expenditure on new plant and equipment, housing, and durables. The
                                  —3—


possible "crowding—out" of private investment by large government

borrowing requirements to finance large fiscal deficits is at the core

of the ongoing debate over the effects of a tight—money, loose—fiscal

configuration of macropolicy.

     Another element to be considered in the investigation of interest

rate movements is the role played by taxes. Changes in actual or

perceived tax rates on interest income from financial instruments,

relative to tax rates on incomes from alternative assets, should affect

the relationship between nominal interest rates and real interest rates,

given the level of expected inflation. This means that when actual or

perceived marginal tax rates change, empirical models estimated over a

given sample period may break down outside of that period even when the

other variables needed to explain interest rates are identified and

accurately predicted.

     Empirical investigations of interest rate behavior through the

mid—1970s by Tanzi (1980a) and Levi and Makin (1979) suggest that

investors tended to adjust interest rates to insulate, to a large extent,

real rates from the effects of expected inflation but not of income

taxes. This "fiscal illusion" (Tanzi, 1980a) may be expected to have

disappeared for several reasons. First, the high rates of inflation in

recent years would inevitably make the effect of taxes on real rates

obvious to most investors. These effects are far less obvious when

inflation is low. Second, these tax effects were discussed In several

well—known articles, such as those by Darby   (1975),   Feldstein (1976),

and Tanzi (1976). ThIrd, as inflation rates climbed, a combination of
                                   —4—

"bracket—creep" and higher interest rates tended to enlarge the absolute

gap between before—tax and after—tax real interest income, while simul-

taneously enhancing the attractiveness of returns on reai assets that

may be subject to only low capital gains tax rates (and only upon

realization) or to no tax at all, as is true for many collectibles and

antiques (Tanzi, 1982a and 1982b). As expected inflation rose, expected

after—tax real interest rates quickly became negative when allowance was

made for t.axation of nominal interest earning.

     Section II of this paper briefly describes a framework for proximate

analysis of interest rate behavior. Section III considers in more detail

the role of expected inflation. A theoretical framework for analysis of

real rates is developed in Section IV. Section V presents results of

some empirical tests. Section VI discusses remaining puzzles concerning

behavior of interest rates. Section VII presents some concluding remarks

and summarizes suggestions for future investigation.


            II. Proximate Sources of Interest Rate Movements

     The Fisher equation describing an interest rate, i, in terms of

a real rate, r, and expected inflation    is written as 1/

                  =   rt   +                                    (1)

where the subscript t indicates time. When taxes are considered, the

aim is to define as the investor's objective an after—tax real rate,

r*, written as

                  =            —                                (2)
                      i(l—T)

  1/ The interaction term rtlTt is ignored here, since it is rela-
tively small in the United States.
                                      —5—


where t    is   the perceived marginal tax rate on nominal interest income.

Transposing equation (2) to place i on the left—hand side,

                         (J_) [r +
                          1— t
                                                                   (3)

        Equation (3) summarizes the proximate determinants of the interest
rate discussed earlier. Movements in i can be decomposed into move—

inents in after—tax real returns, changes in expected inflation, and/or

changes in tax rates that alter the impact on I of given changes in r*

or T.     These three sources of movements in I, together with some

modifications that arise from more detailed consideration of determinants

of the after—tax real rate, will be explored in turn. It is, however,

immediately evident from equation (3) that, for a given level of expected

inflation, the provisions of the U.S. Ecopomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981

will elevate observed interest rates, since accelerated depreciation

allowances should raise the expected after—tax real returns on      invest-
ment projects. However, the impact of such a rise in r* would be

somewhat diminished by reduced marginal individual income tax rates,

particularly in higher tax brackets, which will lower T.

        As for interest rate volatility, an expression for the variance of

interest rates based on equation (3) is given by

            =
                [1/(l.r)]2 Y* + [l/(l-t)]2                        (4)

                + 2[l/(l—T)]2 Pr* °r*it

where       denotes the variance of anticipated inflation,        the

variance of the after—tax real rate and )r*v is the coefficient
                                             —6—

of correlation between r* and IT.            Notice    that, when taxes are ignored

as in equation (1), the variance of i is written as
           2    2       2
                    +       + 2Pr*    ar*                                      (5)
                                    it

         The effects of considering tax rates are evident ihen equations (4)

and (5) are compared. Ignoring the effects of possible correlation

between r* and it       (Pr*   =   0 for now), the volatility of after—tax

real rates unambiguously produces more volatility in i, since for any

it    > 0 [11(1—it)]2 > 1.     [Given it   = 0.35,    [11(1—it)]2 =   2.37].
Given an average tax rate of 35 per cent on interest income, a rise of 1

per cent in the variance of the after—tax real rate raises the variance

of i by 2.37 times the effect of a rise in the variance of the real rate

when taxes are ignored as in equation (5). urthermore, the higher is

it,    the greater will be the volatility of i, ceteris paribus. Of
course, this argument assumes that there is no fiscal illusion, so that

tax effects are fully recognized by investors. 1/ Uncertainty over

future tax polIcy can have a powerful Impact on the observed v.1atilIty

of I. Equation (4) suggests also that the effects of a rise in the

variance of expected inflation on the observed variance of I will be

magnified.

         It will be seen in the detailed discussion of real rates that

theoretical considerations (the Mundell—Tobin effect) suggest a

negative correlation between expected inflation and the real rate


  1/ Thus If it is true that in the past two to three years fiscal
illusion has disappeared, equation (4) would go a long way toward
explaining the greater volatility of interest rates that has prevailed
in this period relative to earlier periods.
(r      0).    Strong evidence for this effect is found in Fama and

Gibbons (1982) and Makin (1983). Such an effect produces some damping

of the effect of changes in the variance of real rates and variance of

expected inflation in both tax and nontax cases, but the damping effect

is reduced by consideration of tax effects for almost any conceivable

value of relevant parameters. 1/

     Consideration of the proximate sources of interest rate movements

suggests a number of avenues for an explanation of high and volatile

interest rates. These include determinants of inflationary expectations,

after—tax real rates, and possible changes in actual or perceived

marginal tax rates on financial assets and alternative assets.

                   III. Behavior of Expected Inflation

     Survey data on inflationary expectations provide a rich source

of information on the outlook regarding the level .nd stability of the

value of nominal contracts whose prices determine interest rates. As

already discusèed, the level of expected inflation is a major determi—

nant of the level of interest rates. Since expectations aboit inflation

are of necessity predictions, it is also relevant to consider the

implications for interest rate behavior of the dispersion of such views

about their mean value as well as of the symmetry of such dispersion

above and below the mean. It is useful to consider the variance and

skewness of expected inflation as well as its mean.

     The variance across expectations of inflation held by survey

respondents may either be taken at face value as an index of the cisper—

sion of views on the outlook for inflation or as a measure of uncertthty

about inflation. The latter concept relates to the uncertainty attached

to the single—valued forecast given by a respondent who is asked simply

to describe his expectation regarding some future price level relative

to today's. An individual may give the same response, say i shown

in Figure 1, at two points in time. However, distribution A in Figure 1

represents a forecast given with more certainty, hence with a higher

probability, A, attached to     than does distribution B. There the

probability attached to , which remains as in distribution A the

most likely outcome, falls to

      Uncertainty ;.out inflation both across survey respondents and by

Individual investors may be linked as follows. If investors form their

own   expectations   regarding inflation by sampling the outlook of fore-

casters, as does the Livingston survey of inflationary expectations,

they will be more uncertain as to the outlook for Inflation as they

discover an increase In the dispersion of outlooks across forecasters.

Based on this reasoning, we shall employ the variance of the Livingston

survey of inflationary expectations as a measure of the uncertainty

about inflation.

      The sign of the impact of changes in inflation uncertainty on

observable Interest rates is not clear. It operates through an impact

on the equilibrium after—tax real rate which adjusts to equilibrate real

saving and investment. 1/ A rise In uncertainty about inflatIon will

cause risk—averse investors, contracting to pay money to finance

projects, to reduce investment because of elevated uncertainty sur-

rounding the real value of contractual payments. Cukierman and

Wachtei (1982) have shown that relative price uncertainty tends to rise

with inflation uncertainty; this result, in turn, will reduce real

Investment, which after all represents a commitment to a given expected

set of relative prices. Downward pressure on real Investment schedule will,

ceteris paribus, cause the expected after—tax real rate to fall. At the

same time, however, on the other side of the market, risk—averse savers

contracting to receive dollars, will, because of elevated uncertainty

regarding the real value of contractual receipts, reduce the supply of

funds at given levels of income and real balances. This will, ceteris
paribus, cause the expected after—tax real rate to rise. The net impact

on the expected after—tax real rate          the netive shift 1;. real

investment and real saving schedules is uncertai           f the negative

impact on investment dominates, higher uncertair::y about inflation

depresses the equilibrium after—tax real rate -id thereby the nominal

rate. The reverse holds true if the negative impact of uncertainty

about inflation on saving dominates. Results reported below, although

statistically weak, suggest tnat higher :-itrtainty about inflation

tends to depress short—term nominal interest rates, suggesting that the

negative impact on investment dominates the negative impact on saving. 1/



  1/ Hartman and Makin (1982) employ a utility—maximizing framework in
a two—period model to develop an alternative rationale for the proposi-
tion that uncertainty about inflation has a negative impact c'-' the
nominal rate. The approach yields a definition of the after—tax real
rate:

                      it(l—t) —   t   + a2               (2a)

which implies:

                       +              —                  (lUa)
                                          x2(mct_imP

             —                               time + V]
                 (l+X3) a + X4X —      ®X2

      In equation (lOa) the coefficient on a is negative even if A3
is negative and less than unity in absolute value with the impact of t2
on saving dominating that on investment. In short, though the expectation
of a negative impact of a2 on I is enhanced, it may not be due to te
impact on savings versus investment but rather to the alternative defini-
tion of the after—tax real rate given by equation (2a).
                                   — 11 —



     It   is also possible that the asymmetry (skewness) of views about

the outlook for inflation may affect the level of interest rates.

Suppose that the probability distribution for a typical respondent

X is as described by A in Figure 2; in other words, the respondent

considers 1T]C as the most likely outcome, but he also considers that

outcomes that imply expectations lower than x are more likely than

those implying expectations higher than i. Assume that while the

most likely outcome remains n,, the shape of the probability distribu-

tion changes from A to B, from negatively skewed to positively skewed,

so that outcomes implying inflation higher than ir, become more likely.

Although the reply that the respondent will give to the pollster would

remain unchanged (and equal to       his    attitude as a lender or

borrower would certainly change. As a lender, he will now expect to

receive a higher rate of interest to compensate him for the higher risk.

As a borrower, he will be willing to pay a higher rate. The net effect

will be an increase in the market rate of Interest. Therefore, given

the average level and variance of expected inflation, the more positively

skewed are such expectations the higher is the rate of interest likely

to be. 1/

     Since 1981, two important considerations have been paramount in the

minds of sophisticated investors. First, as the money supply was being

expanded at a slower pace, the expectation was for the rate of inflation

to fall. Second, as a growing fiscal deficit loomed large on the horizon,

one significant probability was that the Federal Reserve would, at some


  1/ See also Fama (1976).
                                    — 12 —




point,   reverse its policy in order to accommodate the fiscal deficit

with monetary expansion. Under these circumstances, it seems safe to

assume that, for many observers, while the point estimate of inflation

(' in Figure 2) was falling, that fall was accompanied by a positive

change in the skewness of the probability distribution describing expected

inflation represented by the change from A to B. As a consequence, a

lower observed it   might not be accompanied by as great a fall in the
nominal rate of interest, as we would have expected. Therefore, this

effect would be reflected in a higher real rate. Unfortunately, we do

not have data that would permit an empirical verification of this effect,

and it will have to be left in the realm of theoretical speculation. 1/

     While we do not have information about the skewness of the proba-

bility distribution for each of the respondents in the Livingston sample,

we do have information about the variance across survey respondents on

expected inflation. Table 1 reports the mean level and standard deviation

of inflation forecasts from 1973 through the end of 1981 in the Livingston

survey. The December 1981 forecast, of course, covers the first half of

1982. The steady rise of the mean until mid—1980 is consistent with

steady upward pressure on the level of interest rates until that time.

After that time, and particularly during 1981, the 3.5 per cent drop in

the mean level of expected inflation clearly suggests that, if real

(after—tax) rates had remained constant, by December 1981 short—term

interest rates should have been between about 3.5 per cent and 5.5 per


  1/ Furthermore, the argument is likely to be more important for
financial assets of longer maturity than for those of short maturity.

cent below the levels of December 1980. In fact, the rate on six—month
Treasury bills fell by about 2.5 per cent over that period, implying

that after—tax real rates rose considerably during J.98l. Overall, the

behavior of the level of anticipated inflation suggests that, ceteris

paribus, interest rates should have come down during 1981 by more than

they actually did. Further, the rise in rates early in 1982 would be

somewhat at variance with the slowing of actual inflation rates and

appearance of further survey data suggesting a drop in longer—term

expected inflation. 1/

     Table 1 also suggests that the volatility of expected inflation

over time has been considerably higher since mid—1979 than during the

period of comparable length from mid—1976 through the end of 1978. The

standard deviation of expected inflation rates during the later period

was 1.46 per cent, or more than twice the level of 0.66 per cent for the

earlier period. This rise may well have contributed to the rise in the

volatility of interest rates since 1979.     The rise ifl the volatility

of expected inflation likely reflects the rise in the volatility of U.S.

money growth rates since October 1979, when new operating procedures

were adopted by the Federal Reserve Board.




  1/ During February 1982, Manufacturer's Hanover Trust reported a
drop since late 1981 of about 2 per cent in expected inflation
over the coming five years from the 9 per cent range to the 7 per cent
range.
       In the second half of 1982 rates on short—term Treasury bills
fell to a level broadly consistent with a tax—adjusted Fisher hypothesis.

     It   is also clear from Table 1 that cross—sectional uncertainty

about expected inflation has risen steadily since 1977. This phenomenon,

as discussed above, may be linked to a rise or fall in after—tax real

rates.


              IV. Behavior of the Expected Real Interest Rate

     A strict version of the - :sherian relationship between interest

rates and inflation assumes that the rate of interest rises par passu

with the rate of inflation. In other words, ft assumes that the real

rate of interest is constant. This version received a strong boost

when a particularly influential study by Fiia (1973) failed to reject

the joint hypothesis of constancy of the real rate and rationality of

inflation forecasts. A later study by Nelson and Schwert (1977) argued

that Fama's test of that joint hypothesis was not sufficiently powerful.

After applying more powerful tests, these authors concluded that the

data permitted rejection of the constant real rate hypothesis. Mishkin

(1981) argued that Fama's failure to reject constancy of the real rate

might alternatively be viewed as an artifact of the sample period he

employed (first quarter 1953 through second quarter 1973).

     The recent behavior of interest rates is difficult to explain

without recourse to the hypothesis that the real rate has fluctuated

considerably. A relevant question then becomes how to explain movements

in the real rate. Those movements have been substantial, particularly

since 1979 (see Figure 3).

     Studies by Levi and Makin (1979), Makin (1982b), Mishkin (1981),
Peek (1981), Tanzi (1980a), and others have singled Out many factors

that may cause, at least in the short run, changes in the after—tax

real rate of interest. Among these, the following deserve specific

mention: (a) expected inflation itself; (b) the stage of the business

cycle; (c) unanticipated changes in the fiscal deficit; (d) taxes;

(e) unanticipated changes in the money supply; and (f) uncertainty

about the level of inflation.

     We have speculated above on ways in which uncertainty about

inflation might affect the after—tax real rate. And we have already

discussed the way in which taxes should play a role, at the same time

advancing the hypothesis that up to the mid—l970s there was too little

tax effect because of a "fiscal illusion," but that this illusion has

progressively disappeared. This disappearance would, of course, be

translated into an increase in the impact of changes in expected

inflation on nominal interest rates.

     Also operating on the measured impact of expected inflation on the

nominal interest rate is the well—known Mundell—Tobin effect. Under

the Mundell—Tobin effect, the real rate can be affected by changes in

expected inflation. A rise in expected inflation causes a shift Out of

money balances and into real capital, thereby depressing the marginal

product of capital and the equilibrium real rate. This is the "Tobin

Effect." Mund€ll (1963) describes a similar phenomenon whereby a rise

in anticipated inflation depresses equilibrium real cash balances, in

turn elevating the steady—state level of flow saving owing to the real

balance effect. Equilibrium is restored by means of a lower real

interest rate, which elevates the level of investment until it equals

the higher level of saving. This effect, operating as it does on the

steady—state rate of saving, is not expected to be subsequently reversed

in the absence of a further change in the rate of expected inflation.

    The impact of the Mundell—Tobin effect on the relationship between

expected inflation and nominal rates of taxes can best be understood

with the aid of a structural juodel that determines the equilibrium value

of the after—tax real rate. This approach also helps to clarify the

role of uncertainty about inflation, money surprises, and surprise fiscal

deficits in determining the level of observable, nominal interest rates.

The structural model presented here, which extends the model developed

in Makin (1983), yields a reduced—form equation for the after—tax real

rate. The resulting expression for the after—tax real rate can then be

substituted into a Fisher equation describing the observable nominal

rate in terms of the after—tax real rate and expected inflation.

    The structural equations are expressed in the familiar IS—LM format

with some modifications, along with an expression for real income

(output) in terms of a distributed lag on money surprises as derived by

Blinder and Fischer (1981). The log of nonincome—induced expenditure

is written as

                =      — czr      —

        Equation (6) describes nonincotne—induced expenditure. As such, it

is negatively tied to the after—tax real rate and to uncertainty about

inflation and positively affected by any real exogenous shock to expen-

diture that is unrelated to other right—hand variables in equation (6).

Expected inflation produces a negative impact on investment owing to the

depressing impact on corporate profits arising from historic cost depre-

ciation rules noted by Feldstein (1976) and Summers (1978). 1/ GAP is a

measure of capacity utilization, or the stage of the business cycle, first

employed by Tanzi (1980a). As GAP rises so does pressure on existing

capacity, signaling a need for more investment. In effect, GAP captures

an accelerator effect on investment.


  1/ The depressing impact on corporate profits of actual inflation may
be offset by a reduction in the real value of corporate debt only to the
extent that actual inflation is unanticipated. But expected inflation
will not result in a lower value of corporate debt, since it will be
reflected in a higher nominal interest rate demanded by lenders and paid
by borrowers in the face of an anticipated depreciation of money against
commodities. It will, however, depress expected after—tax profits under
existing depreciation rules.

     The coefficients on the interest rate equation (10) are functions

of the underlying structural parameters defined in equations (3) and

(6) through (9).   It is usefu to note that the measured impact upon

nominal interest of each of the explanatory variables in equation (10)

also depends upon the effective marginal tax rate, t, on interest

incomes. While the underlying structural parameters are unidentified

(they cannot be measured based on empirical estimation of equation (10))

this framework is still useful for three reasons. First, it shows

clearly why it may be that even with nonzero tax rates applied to

interest incomes, the measured coefficient on expected inflation will

be less than [l/(1—r)] and may even be less than unity. Second,

it clearly shows that the measured impact on interest rates of all

explanatory variables is conditional on the tax rate, r.         Since that

rate may vary over time, it suggests a reason for changes over time in

the fit of many interest rate equations. Finally, the derivation of

equation (10) makes clear the theoretical basis for a negative relation-

ship between expected inflation and the expected after—tax real rate. 1/

     The impact of expected inflation on the nominal interest rate

reflects a combination of four factors: (a) the Fisher effect, whereby

the nominal interest rate rises by the full amount of a rise in expected

  1/ This phenomenon may also arise in open economies where inventory
behavior results in inertia of commodity prices. See Criswell (1983).
                                   — 22 —




inflation;   (b) the tax effect, whereby the nominal interest rate must

rise by more than the rise in expected inflation to maintain a constant

expected after—tax real return; (c) the Mundell—Tobin effect, captured

in equations (7) and (8), whereby a rise in expected inflation depresses

equilibrium real cash balances, in turn elevating the steady—state level

of flow saving owing to the real balance effect, with equilibrium being

restored by means of a lower after—tax real interest rate, which raises

investment to the higher level of saving; and (d) the Feldstein—Surnmers

effect, whereby a rise in anticipated inflation depresses expected

after—tax profits and causes investment to fall. 1r sum, tax eFects

move the coefficient above unity, while the Mundell effect and the

Feldstein—Summers effect both push it below unity. Typical parameter

values for i and A1 indicate an expected value of 0.75 for the

coefficient describing the impact of expected inflation on the nominal

interest rate. 1, rven though tax effects by themselves tend to push

the coefficient above unity, the combined depressing impact of the

Mundell effect and the Feldstein—Summers effect may result in a net

impact below unity. The general equilibrium approach employed here

resolves the apparent "mystery" regarding a less than unitary impact of

expected inflation on interest rates when taxes are considered.

     The hypothesized negative impact of money surprises on the real

rate arises from their positive impact on real income which, in turn,

elevates real saving and requires a drop in the real rate to produce

an equilibrating rise in real investment. This effect outweighs the

simultaneous upward pressure on the real rate rat results from excess

demand for real balances associated with elevated real income. (See

footnote above, p. 20). The effect of money suprises may be contempo-

raneous or it may persist over a number of periods owing either to

stickiness or, more rigorously, to attempts to restore desired inventory

stocks. (See Blinder and Fischer (1981).)

     It is important to distinguish between the real income impact of

a money surprise described here and an expectations effect like that

reported by Mishkin (1982). Mishkin reports a positive relationship

between quarterly money surprises and end—of—period short—term interest

rates. The result arises, in Mishkin's view, from a positive icpact of

a money surprise on expected inflation. In contrast, this study employs

period—average short—term rates as a dependent variable in order to

capture the real income impact under way during the quarter, before

comparison of an actual with an anticipated money supply gives rise to

an expectations effect. A fuller discussion of Mishkin's results and

their relationship with results obtained here is contained in Makin

(1982c). An alternative liquidity rationale for a negative --.ationship

between money surprises and short—term rates is discussed in Makin

(1982b) and Khan (1980).

     The impact of uncertainty about inflation on the equilibrium,

after—tax real rate is ambiguous as discussed earlier. The negative

impact of uncertainty about inflation on real investment is measured
                                  — 24 —




by a2 in equation (6). The negative impact on real saving of uncer-
tainty about inflation is measured by      in equation (7).   The ambiguous

impact on the interest rate is given by X3 in equation (10).

     The impact of exogenous shifts in aggregate demand on the after—

tax real rate is unambiguously positive. If there is an exogenous

upward shift in aggregate demand, the after—tax real rate must •rise to

 crowd out' private investment in order to restore commodity market

equilibrium. The model represented by equations (6) through (10) makes

it clear that tests of the possible impact of fiscal deficits on interest

rates cannot be conducted by inserting a measure of the actual fiscal

deficit directly into an interest rate equation. Since tax proceeds

rise with income, the built—in portion of deficits is endogenous and

typically countercyclical. Interest rates are typically procclical;

therefore, the coefficient on the actual deficit (measured as a positive

number) term in the interest rate equation will be downwardly biased and

possibly negative. 1/

     Expected future deficits have been identified by some as a source

of higher interest rates. However, such effects ought to be confined

to long—term rates. Measurement of the impact of expected future

deficits on long—term rates is confounded by the cyclical biases just

discussed, together with the fact that few actual time series on anything

like a comprehensive measure of expected future deficits exist before



  1/ This is confirmed by results reported in Section V. For a thorough
discussion of government deficits and aggregate demand, see Feldstein
(1982).
                                    — 25 —



 1980.   Some analysts contend that the impact on interest rates of fiscal

deficits arises only from their impact on longer run inflationary

expectations. Others suggest that expected "crowding out" that large

fiscal deficits imply for credit markets will raise real rates and

thereby raise nominal rates. But for all of these longer—run concepts,

measurement presents a serious difficulty.

     One way to avoid these difficulties is to test the impact 1)11

interest   rates of unanticipated movements in the fiscal deficit. 1.!

This approach purges the deficit of its systematic component which,

as noted above, tends to bias downward its measured impact on interest

rates. Further, given period—average short—term rates as the dependent

variable, as with money surprises, it is possible to capture the impact

on interest rates of higher—than—expected sales of government securities

during the quarter. This impact should occur before the end of the

quarter, when comparison of an actual     th   an   anticipated fiscal deficit

may give rise to an expectations effect. More specifically, a surprise

increase in the deficit may cause market participants to expect higher

money growth and therefore higher inflation.        But if this expectations

effect is already captured in the expected inflation term, the surprise

deficit will appear to have no additional explanatory power. The use of

a period—average interest rate as a dependent variable, as noted, avoids

this problem of apparent redundancy of fiscal deficits in an interest


  1/ Another way could be to use the full employment budget surplus.
This was tried in place of the unanticipated deficit for which results
are reported below. The full employment budget surplus did not enter

rte equation.    We expect that a surprise defir. il1 raise the perd—

•verage interest rate.

    Once a measure is obtained of the impact on interest rates

surprise intraquarter rise in the fiscal deficit, expressed in ter'

of basis points per billion per quarter, some idea of the cumulativ.

effect over a year of a rise in predicted deficits can be obtained.

The presumption is that if forecast fiscal deficits over a year rise

by, say, $100 billion, the instant impact on interest rates is equivalent

to the present discounted compound impact of $25 billion per quarter in

fiscal deficit surprises over the coming year. Based on estimates to

he reported below, a $100 billion rise in the estimated ainual deficit

aistributed as a surprise of $25 billion per quarter over four quarters

''d raise three—month Treasury bill rates by 40 basis points.

     The GAP   variable,   as defined above, is positively related to the

":erest rate. A rise in GAP      or   pressure on capacity produces an

accelerated effect on investment, which, ceteris paribus, requires a

higher expected after—tax real rate to maintain equilibrium [Tanzi,

1980a].

     After consideration of all these factors, it is clear from equa-

tion (10) that regression of nominal interest on a constant, a surprise

deficit, a money surprise, GAP, a measure of uncertainty about inflation,

and expected inflation ought to (a) test the hypothesized positive

impact on the after—tax real interest rate of an exogenous shock to

aggregate demand (measured by an unanticipated deficit); (b) test the

hypothesized negative impact of a money surprise on the after—tax ea1

rate   by checking to see if the coefficient on the surprise :s signifi-

cantly less than zero; 1/ (c) test the hypothesized negative impact of

expected inflation on after—tax real interest by checking to see if the

coefficient on expected inflation is significantly below [l/(l—r)};

(d) measure the net impact of uncertainty about inflation on the after—tax

real rate; and (e) test the impact of GAP on thf after—tax real rate.

Contemporaneous and lagged money surprises may depress the real interest

rate insofar as they elevate real output above its natural level.


                          V. Some Empirical Tests

       A report on some empirical tests that attempt to incorporate several

of •the above hypotheses are reported below. These tests, however, will

not be able to capture some of those hypotheses, such as, for example,

the disappearance of fiscal illusion. As a prelude to those tests t

is, perhaps, useful to report some results on the simplest possible test

  1/ Besides Mishkin's (1982) expectations effect, some investigators,
including Grossman (1981), Engel and Frankel (1982), and Roley (1982),
have found a short—run "policy expectations effect,' whereby a positive
difference between a consensus forecast and the announced weekly number
on the money supply causes short—run interest rates to rise. The result
is seen to follow from an anticipated tightening of Federal Reserve
policy in response to excessive money growth.
      This finding, like Mishkin's, is not inconsistent with a finding
that, prior to operation of an expectations effect, when an actual money
number materializes which can be compared with a forecast, an income or
liquidity effect occasioned by money growth above its anticitated path
will depress interest rates. The dependent variable in the "policy
expectations effect" studies is the change in three—month Treasury bill
yields from 3:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Friday afternoon, precisely in
order to isolate a pure expectations effect. Detection of an income or
liquidity effect in these studies would require regressing the average
interest rate from 5:00 p.m on Friday of the previous week to 3:30 p.m.
on the current Friday on the current Friday's money surprise. A negative
interest impact via an income or liquidity effect ought to lead the
money surprise. These issues are discussed further in Makin (l982c).

for     the Fisherian relationship, such as that reflected in an equation of

the type it        rt + t where all the symbols have the same meaning

as above. The results obtained are of some interest.

        (a) The worst period for a test of this simple Fisherian relation-

ship insofar as proximity to one of the coefficients on expected inflation

is concerned is between the late 1950s and the mid—1970s. For this

period, the coefficient of expected inflation, 8,       is   below 0.70. 1/

         (b) If one keeps, say, 1958 as the initial period and extends the

period beyond 1975 to 1981, 3 rises to well over 0.80.

         (c) If one keeps the terminal year at 1981 but moves the initial

year beyond 1958, the coefficient of iT changes little up to the mid—1960s,

but then it starts rising. For the period after 1970, the coefficient

of iT    Is   significant and substantially exceeds unity, which is consistent

with what one would expect from the partial equilibrium framework with

taxes.

         (d) The results are about the same whether one uses 3—month,

6—month, or 12—month Treasury bills.

         These findings from estimating the basic Fisher equation suggest

that either security markets do not fully reflect changes in anticipated

inflation or significant movements in the after—tax real rate have,

in varying degrees over separate subperiods, distorted inferences drawn

from estimating the basic Fisher equation. 2/ In the light of the theory


  1/ This was a period of accelerating inflation.
  2/ They may also indicate that it is not just the rate of inflation
but the change in that rate that may be significant. For example, the
Mundell—Tobin effect may be tied to accelerating inflation rather than
to the rate of inflation Itself.

of interest rate behavior developed in Secti IV, the latter possibility

seems most likely. 1/

        Results of estimating interest rate equations suggested by equation

(10) in Section IV are presented in Table 2. Particular attention is

given to implications of proper modeling of residuals made possible by

the use of transfer function procedures discussed in Box and JenkThs

(1970). An attempt is made to check for the possible atrophy since 1979

of fiscal illusion.

        The fit of the equation for the full period (equation (2.1) in

Table 2) is displayed in Figure 4. Actual and predicted values listed

in Table 3 indicate that the model tracks interest rates well within the

sample period. Use of the transfer function procedure i lies that the

goodness of fit reflects explanatory power both of the iidependent

variables employed and of the past history of interest r:tes. 2/

        Initial estimation of the equations just described resultc in

heteroscedastjc error terms. A Park—Glejser test strongly supported

the hypothesis that error variances grew over time. Therefore, in all

results reported here, variables have been divided by the positively

trended series on expected inflation to adjust for heterscedasticity.

  1/ Summers (1982) has argued, however, that nominal interest rates do
not adjust by the full amount implied by the Fisher hypothesis modified
to allow for marginal tax rates on interest earnings. His results based
on both pre— and post—World War II data arise from equations that employ
actual inflation rates in place of expected inflation and that generally
do not include variables to control for movements in the expected real
rate.
  2/ Estimation employing OLS with adjustment for serial correlation of
residuals yields nearly identical results. This is not surprising since
this procedure is nearly equivalent to a transfer function with an
AR (1) noise model a:d cquations in Table 2 are estimated employing an
ARMA (1,1) model.

  6/ The "time" variable in equation (10) is captured by the "noise model" of residuals
estimated simultaneously with the coefficients on explanatory variables in the interest rate
equation employing the transfer function estimation procedure.

     A number of conclusions emerge from Table 2. First, the coefficient

on expected inflation is in all cases below unity. All of the subsample

estimates of that coefficient lie within one standard error of   the
full—period result. Second, the money surprise variable produces te

hypothesized negative impact on interest rates. 1/ The GAP variable

produces the hypothesized positive impact on interest rates in a manner

consistent with results reported by Tanzi (1980a). 2/

     The impact on interest rates of an exogenous shock to aggregate

demand as measured by an unanticipated increase in the fiscal deficit is

of particular interest. The model presented in Section IV suggests a

positive relationship that would represent the potential "crowdi:.g out"

of private investment widely discussed in connection with large projected

U.S. deficits after passage of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.

Of course, here we are suggesting that only deficits differing from

those projected subsequently to passage of that legislation will produce

an impact on interest rates beyond that embodied ifl projections made at

the time of its passage.

    Results reported in Table 2 for all sample periods suggest that a

surprise increase in the deficit at an annual rate of $10 billion during

a quarter (an ctua1 $2.5 billion surprise during the quarter) would



  1/ Money surprises are measured as residuals from an ARNA (0,8) model
of money (Ml) growth. For a full discussion of this procedure and of
alternatives, see Makin (1983).
  2/ The "time" variable in equation (10) is captured by the "noise
model" of residuals estimated simultaneously with the coefficients on
explanatory variables in the Interest rate equation using the transfer
function methodology.

 raise   the interest rate on three—month Treasury bills by four basis—

points. 1/ This effect may seem small, but it should be remembered

that this is the impact on the short—term bill rate only. Deficit

"surprises" of $20 billion to 40 billion a quarter have not been uncommon

since 1981, and surprises of this magnitude imply annual rates of

$80 billion to $160 billion which in turn would move the short—term rate

by 32 to 64 basis—points. The impact on longer—term rates could be

larger.

      Recall that discussion of the expected coefficient on expected

inflation suggested that tax effects tend to push it above unity, and

the Mundell—Tobin and Feldstein—Summers effects tend to push it below

unity. The reported below—unity results are consistent with our hypo-

thetical predicted value of 0.75 based on "reasonable" parameter values.

      The significant negative impact on interest rates of the money

surprise term is consistent with reported findings in a number of related

studies. Levi and Makin (1979) report that output growth depresses

interest rates, and Makin (l982a) reports that surprise money growth

elevates output growth. Therefore, we would expect that both variables

As noted earlier, the countercyclical deficit combined with the pro—
cyclical interest rates tends to bias downward the estimated coefficient
on the deficit. The result also suggests the enhanced negative impact
of inflation uncertainty, a, on the interest rate when GAP is
excluded from the estimated equation (see below).
                                     — 34 —




 wuld   be negatively correlated with interest rates. Findings are also

 consistent with the hypothesis that surprise money growth produces

 liquidity effects discussed in Makin (1982b) and Khan (1980).

      Uncertainty about inflation was not significant in the presence of

 all of the other variables. This is, of course, theoretically possible,

 since uncertainty about inflation depresses both saving and investment

 sca.dules, Indeed, results reported here suggest that it is not possible

 to reject the hypothesis that the net impact on the equilibrium after—tax

real rate of these shifts is zero.

     This result differs from findings reported in Levi and Makin (1979)

and Makin (1983) where a significant negative coefficient on uncertainty

about inflation was discovered. The reason for the different finding

reported here may be linked to the presence of the GAP variable, which

was not incl'ied in these other studies. A rise in GAP produces a

si---ificant positive impact on the interest rate. At the same time, it

is negatively correlated with the measure of uncertainty about inflation,

a2 (p = —0.32).   The GAP variable is likely proxying for a2 with a

rise in GAP associated with lower inflation uncertainty. No simple

economic explanation for this association comes readily to mind, but it

does reconcile results reported here with the finding reported elsewhere

of a significant negative relationship between interest rQtes and

inflation uncertainty. A rise in GAP may, in addition to its shift

impact on investment, proxy for a drop in a2 which in turn is associated

with higher interest rates.
                              — 35 —




     Compared with the simple Fisher equation, results discussed at the

beginning of this section and reported in Table 2, suggest that the

impact of expected inflation on interest has been remarkably stable

over a number of subperiods. It appears that the variability of that

impact discovered in a number of investigations of the simple Fisher

equation is due to time—varying bias on estimates drawn from equations

that have omitted significant explanatory variables.


              VI. Remaining Puzzles Concerning Interest Rates

     Still, there remains a good deal about interest rate behavior that

is not well understood, particularly in recent years. Although the

levels of inflation and inflationary expectations fell sharply during

1982, both short— and long—term rates remained high, particularly during

the first half of the year. The inconsistency of this experience with

what our model would have predicted is clear from Table 3. Employing

parameter values of the model estimated using 1980—81 data along with

actual values of exogenous variables for 1982 badly underpredicts

interest rate levels for the entire year.

     One possible explanation for this result may have been the very

unusual behavior of velocity during 1982. M—l velocity grew at an

average annual rate of 3.2 per cent from 1950 to 1982, although the

rates of growth usually did fall somewhat during contractions. But

the drop in actual velocity during 1982 was a remarkable 4.8 per cent.

Based on a quarterly time series of M—1 velocity behavior from 1960—81,

predicted growth of velocity during 1982 would have been about 2.95 per

cent. The unanticipated drop in annual velocity growth over the year

was 7.75 per cent, distributed over the quarters as shown in Table 3.

                                    — 37 —




     If,   as some, including the Federal Reserve Board, have suggested

(see testimony of Board Chairman Paul A. Voicker before the U.S. Senate

Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, February 16, 1983),

the collapse in velocity growth during 1982 represented a large,

unpredictable increase in money demand, then excess money demand may

have been responsible for the very high interest rates during much of

1982. The drop in interest rates during the last half of the year may

have reflected some relief from that excess demand condition resulting

from the rapid acceleration of money growth during that period. The

annual growth rate of money (M—1) was 1.5 per cent during the first

half of 1982 and 15.1 per cent during the second half.

     It is tempting to attribute the persistence of high short—term

interest rates during much of 1982, even in the face of lower expected

inflation, to the unexpectedly sharp drop in velocity that occurred at

the same time. However, coincidence does not necessarily imply causality

and it is reasonable to ask if there has existed a stable relationship

between unanticipated movements in velocity and interest rates over a

longer time period and in the presence of the other explanatory variables

in equation (10). As a matter of fact, unexpected velocity growth has,

contrary to expectations, a weak positive impact on interest rates when

included as an explanatory variable in equations like those reported in

Table 2, either for the 1960—81 or the 1960—82 sample period. 1/ When


  1/ Unexpected velocity growth was employed in place of surprise growth
of the money supply, since velocity growth is defined as GNP growth less
money supply growth and therefore is likely to be highly correlated with
money growth.
                                     — 38 —



 interest   rates are regressed on anticipated inflation together with

 velocity shocks alone, the velocity shocks again have a significant

positive impact on nominal interest rates and the level of explanatory

power is comparable to that of equations reported in Table 2.

     The inconsistency between the negative association between velocity

shocks and interest rates during 1982 and the positive association

typical of the 1960—81 sample period can be explained as a manifestation

of the identification problem first encountered by Henry Schultz in 1938.

As Schultz discovered, where demand is highly volatile relative to

supply, price, and quantitative measures map Out a positive relationship.

During 1982, a positive shock to money demand dominated money—supply

shifts and the sharp drop in velocity reflected an excess money demand

shift which caused interest rates, controlled for the level of expected

inflation, to rise. Alternatively, during most of the postwar period

including 1960—81, shocks to money supply have dominated shocks to

money demand. As a result a sharp drop in velocity usually reflects

a positive shock to money supply which in turn produces a simultaneous

negative impact on interest rates while liquidity effects are dominating

expectation effects. The result, consistent with findings reported in

Table 2 on the effects of unexpected money growth, is a dominant positive

association between velocity shocks and interest rates during much of

the postwar period.

     In short, most of the shocks to monetary equilibrium which have

caused short—term rates to move beyond or below levels implied by

changes in expected inflation, at least during the 1960—81 sample period,
                                      — 39 —



 have been supply shocks. In contrast, 1982 was characterized
                                                              by dominance

 of a (positive) demand shock which prevented short—term interest rates

 from falling in line with expected inflation. Once the situation was

 alleviated short—term rates fell roughly in line with the drop in expected

 inflation. The expected real rate on three—month Treasury bills fell

 from 7.09 per cent during the second quarter of 1982 to 3.25 per cent

 during the fourth quarter of 1982.


                          VII. Concluding Remarks

      This paper has attempted to demonstrate a need to expand the simple

 Fisherian view whereby changes in interest rates are explained largely

by changes in expected inflation. The need for this expansion became

particularly evident during the early 1980s. Our measure of expected

inflation dropped from 10.5 per cent per annum during the fourth quarter

of 1980 to 7.6 per cent per annum during the third quarter of 1981.

Over the same period, average yields on three—month Treasury bills rose

from 13.6 per cent to 15.1 per cent.     Some explanation for this apparent

dls:repancy in terms of results reported here may be useful.

     The failure of interest rates to display a sustained drop during

1981 as the expected rate of inflation fell steadily resulted from a

combination of forces. During the first quarter of 1981, some downward

pressure on interest rates did materialize, but a sustained fall was

prevented by a rise in economic activity. Our measure of excess capacity

(minus GAP) fell from 5.5 per cent during the fourth quarter of 1980 to

4.3 per cent during the first quarter of 1981. Our estimates suggest
                                    — 40 —



that   this change alone would add about 25 basis—points to short—term

rates.

       Rates remained high during the second quarter of 1981 owing, among

other things, to a shift to unexpectedly tight money. (See Makin (1982b)

for a fuller discussion.) This shift by itself raised short—term rates

by about 24 basis—points according to our estimates. Unexpectedly tight

money persisted into the third quarter of 1981, during which passage of

the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 also added to higher rates. Short—

term rates were 2.61 percentage points above the level predicted by our

interest rate equation during the third quarter of 1981, suggesting that

some exogenous shock pushed up rates. This was the largest positive

residual during the 20 years covered by our sample and seems likely to

be ributab1e to fundamental changes in the outlook for the cyclical

pattern of deficits attributable to passage of the Economic Recovery Tax

Act of 1981.    [This factor is discussed further below.]

       In the fourth quarter of 1981, there was a sharp fall in short—

term rates. This drop was attributable to, among other things (a) a

large increase in excess capacity (29 basis—points); (b) a large positive

surprise in money growth (36 basis—points); (c) a surprise surplus

during that quarter (16 basis—points); and (d) a drop in inflationary

expectations (48 basis—points). The actual drop of 330 basis—points

was greater than the 129 basis—points indicated here, but the discrepancy

is considerably reduced by accounting for the effects of variables other

than expected inflation. In practice, our "noise model," or the past

history of the three—month Treasury bill rate itself accounts for all

but 69 basis—points of the remainder actual drop in rates.
                                  — 41 —




     During December 1981 and January 1982 there was a sharp acceleration
of money growth accompanied by a rise in interest rates. This would be

contrary to our prediction if part of the sharp increase caine as a

surprise. It must be remembered, however, that the sharp increase

coincided with the first appearance of reports of sharply higher

projections of U.S. fiscal deficits totaling $338.7 billion over

fiscal years 1982 through 1984. These projections, which were revised

upward even further during 1982, suggest another reason for persistently

high interest rates during the first half of 1982. If these figures

materialize, they may well break the traditional countercyclical pattern

historically followed by U.S. fiscal deficits. If the U.S. economy

expands during 1982—84 a rise in fiscal deficits will coincide with

attempts by the private sector to increase borrowing. Traditionally,

in the expansionary phase of the cycle there has been a drop in fiscal

deficits. The perception of a change in the cyclical pattern of deficits

has kept interest rates high since the end of 1981, whereas normally the

dramatic drop in inflation and expectations about future inflation would

have lowered rates. Viewed in this way, it may be that the "surprise"

increase in money growth during December 1981 and January 1982 in fact

cushioned the upward pressure on rates caused by the likelihood of procy—

clical U.S. fiscal deficits coupled witir the then held expectation that

the U.S. economy would recover during the second quarter of 1982. 1/



  1/ A sharp drop in interest rates did materialize by August 1982,
when it became clear that recovery of the U.S. economy was to be delayed.
and when monetary policy began to become more accommodative.
                                      — 42 —




      'ina11y,   there does exist the possibility that an atrophy of

 "fiscal illusion" resulting in a rise in perceived tax rates employed to

 calculate   real after—tax returns has tended to elevate observed pretax

 market rates. Such a rise in perceived tax rates would magnify the

 impact on observed pretax interest rates of rises in expected after—tax

 real rates.

      The high volatility of interest rates since 1979 is explained fairly

 straightforwardly by the sharp rise in the volatility of expected infla-

 tion (the variance of it   rose from 0.44 during the June l976—December 1978

 period to 2.13 during the June 1979—December 1981 period) and by the

 likely increase in volatility of expected after—tax real rates resulting

 from increased uncertainty about the cyclical pattern of U.S. fiscal

deficits and from pressures created by adherence to monetary targets.

The elevated level of variance of expected inflation likely reflects

in part the increased volatility of money growth since 1979. This is

disquieting in view of the stated goal of reducing volatility of money

growth under new Federal Reserve System operating procedures but riot

mysterious in its predictable impact on uncertainty about the outlook

for inflation. Persistent success In targeting aggregates ought to

reduce sharply the volatility of expected inflation. The net result

will be more stable nominal rates even given some higher level of real

rate volatility.

     Overall interest rates have remained high since 1980, although

progress in lowering expected Inflation would normally have brought

reductions, because a number of forces have acted to raise after—tax
                                    — 43 —



 real   rates since that time. Interest rates have been highly volatile in

response to the elevated uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and

for expected real rates.

        These findings suggest a need for further investigation in a number

of areas. Can effects of tax policy on interest rates be considered

separately from effects of other variables? Analysis by Peek (l98l'

suggests that this may be possible. How significant is the perceived

structural change in the cyclical behavior of U.S. fiscal deficits in

pushing up real rates? Is there evidence that fiscal illusion has

moderated and, if so, by how much? Might it be expected to reappear

given a sharp reduction in the level of expected inflation? If higher

real rates persist owing to "crowding out" associated with persistently

enlarged fiscal deficits, what will be the effects on private saving,

on international capital flows, and on private investment? What are

the implications of elevated uncertainty about expected inflation?

And finally and perhaps most important, what are the implications for

the world economy of the unusual behavior exhibited by U.S. interest

rates since 1979? More specific questions include possible effects on

observed and real exchange rates, effects on worldwide economic growth

and capital formation, and implications for the form of the international

monetary system.
