             Price Desynchronization and Price Level Inertia

                            Abstract

     If price decisions are taken neither continuously nor in perfect

synchronization, the process of adjustment of all prices to a new nominal

level will imply temporary movements in relative prices. It might then well

be that, to avoid these movements in relative prices, each price setter will

want to move his own price slowly compared to others. The result will be a

slow movement of all prices to their new nominal level, and substantial

inertia of the price level. This paper formalizes this intuitive argument

and reaches four main conclusions:

     (1) Even small departures from perfect synchronization can generate

substantial price level inertia.

     (2) If price decisions are desynchronized, even anticipated movements

in money will usually have an effect on economic activity. It is however

possible to find paths of money deceleration which reduce inflation at no

cost in output.

     (3) Price desynchronization has implications for relative price

movements as well as for the price level. Goods early in the chain of

production have more price and profit variability than goods further down

the chain.

     (4) Price inertia, if it is due to price desynchronization, may be

difficult to remove. It may well be that, given the timing decisions of

others, no agent has an incentive to change his own   timing decision: the
time structure of price desynchronization may be stable.

I.   Introduction

     It is often informally argued that given the complexity of the price

system and the inherent problems of coordination, the apparent inertia of

the price level should come as no surprise.1 A rather appealing argument

along these lines is the following:

     Then a norninal disturbance requires a change in the price level, what

is required is not a change of a single price, but a change of a complex

structure of final good, intermediate good and input prices. Price decisions

for eac-h of these goods are not taken continuously. Furthermore, price

decisions across goods are unlikely to be perfectly synchronized. The process

of adjustment of all prices to a new nominal level will therefore imply

movements of relative prices along the way. If price setters do not want

large changes in relative prices, the path of adjustment of all prices may

be slow, the price level may adjust slowly.

     The purpose of this paper is to formalize this argument and to see

whether and how it survives formalization. The paper focuses on three sets

of questions:

     The first is whether desynchronization of individual price decisions can

generate substantial" price inertia. It is obvious that, with so many price

decisions, the price level will not adjust overnight to changes in aggregate

demand; the question is whether, if each price is set for a relatively short

period of time, say a month or two at most, desynchronization can generate

the degree of price inertia we appear to have in the United States. The

answer of the paper is that this is indeed possible.

     The second set of questions addresses whether the price level ine-rtia so

generated coincides with the usual notion of inertia or "stickiness." Does
                                     2




it for example imply that decreases in money or decelerations in money growth

necessarily lead to recessions? The answer is mixed: In general, movements

in money will lead to movements in real money balances and economic activity.

There are however paths of monetary deceleration which lead to disinflation

with no output loss. These paths are reasonable and, apart from issues of

credibility, easy to implement.

     The third set of questions considers the implications of desynchronization

for the relation between disturbances, the price level and the structure of

relative prices. This is of interest both in itself and because it provides

a way of differentiating this theory of price inertia from other theories and

potentially testing it.2 Desynchronization implies snake effects, i.e.

movements in factor prices slowly transmitted to intermediate and final good

prices. It also implies more variability of profits and prices for primary

inputs than for intermediate goods, for intermediate goods than for final

goods; these implications seem to be in accordance with facts.

     This paper therefore suggests that desynchronization of price decisions

is capable of generating price level inertia. If price level inertia is

indeed partly due to desynchronization, the prospects for reducing it are

not good. Given the time structure of price decisions, each price setter

chooses its price optimally and frequently. Reducing inertia requires better

overall synchronization of price decisions; this may be difficult to achieve,

either by agents or by policy.

     The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the model.

Sections III and IV look at the implications for price level inertia and the

effects of monetary policy. Section V looks at the implications for relative

prices. Section VI concludes.

1.    The Model

      In order to focus later on the effects of desynchronization, I start with

a eccnomy in which all price decisions are perfectly synchronized.



Ecuilibrium     with Synchronized Prices
      The econcny is characterized by its       technology, a specification of input

?1Y     and of output demand.
      Final    output is produced in n stages, each of them carried under constant

returns- to scale by competitive firms. Technology is given by n relations:



(1)           y. =
               1
                      v•
                      i—1   + O1           i=   1,   ••.,   n.



      y. denote       good i so that.y0 denotes the primary input and y the final

cuzput. All variables, here and in the rest of the paper,are in logarithms.

The . are constants which are unimportant for our purposes and will be

d:e:ad    in   what follows. Production is instantaneous3 and, to avoid issues

of Thventories, all goods are perishable.

      Competitive zero profit equilibrium implies that, if p. is (the log of)

      ?rice of good i, the following relations hold (forgetting the e.):



(2)            p. =
                      p.1                  i = 1,    ...,   n        => p   = p




       Increasing      the number of production stages, n, keeping the sum of O.'s

constant,      allows us to increase the number of price decisions, while leaving

      technology unchanged.4'5 In this economy with synchronized prices., the
nr of          price decisions is clearly irrelevant: y is always     equal   to y

and p to p.
                                      4




      The model is closed by a specification of input supply and output demand:



(3)        y=$(p—p)+

(4)        ym—p
      Input supply is an increasing function of its real price arid of a

disturbance E.6 Output demand depends positively on tea]. money balances.7

      Equilibrium is characterized by the price relations given by (2) and

equilibrium in the primary input market; the derived demand for the primary

input must equal the supply:



(5)




Combining (2) and (5) gives:



           y=y= ; p="=p.==p=m-
      Noney is neutral and affects only the level of all prices. Supply

disturbances increase output, decrease all nominal prices and leave relative

prices unchanged.



Price Desynchronization

      I now relax the assumption that price decisions are taken every period

and are perfectly synchronized:
                                      5




      All price decisions are now taken every two periods. The basic period is

presumably short and can be thought of as a month at most.8

      Price decisions are not all taken at the same time. Half of them are taken

every period, in the following way: Firms at the same stage of production

take decisions at the same time for two periods. At even stages (i even)

firms take decisions at t, t+2 and so on; at odd stages (i odd) firms take

decisions at t—1, t+1 and so on. n is assumed for convenience to be even, so

that firms producing y take decisions at t, t+2, •,       firms producing y
take decisions at t—1, t+1, ••,    suppliers   of the primary input take decisions

at t, t+2, •...

      Firms choosing p. at time t for periods t and t+1 face two possibly
different input prices for t and t+1. The competitive zero profit condition

used above is now replaced byan expected zero profit condition over the two

periods. This is formalized by:9



(6)        pit =   4 _1   t1   + E(p.1 +iIt))
                                                             i =   2, 4, ..., n.


E( t) denotes the expectation conditional on information available at time t.

          is the current input price in period t which was set in period t—1

and E(p.1 +ilt) the expected input price for period t+1. A corresponding

formula holds for i odd, at time t—1 or t+1.

      As nominal prices are fixed ateach stage for two periods, they may not

clear the market in both periods and an assumption must be made about quantity

determination. I assume the outcome to be demand determined: when a firm

fixes its price for two periods, it stands ready to supply on demand. -This

is feasible as production is instantaneous and all input suppliers also supply
                                            6




on demand. Demand for the final good therefore determines the demand for

intermediate inputs and for the primary input.10

      Prices in the primary input market are set in period t at the average

expected market clearing levels over periods t and t+1. For convenience, we

assume m and        to move only every two periods, so that   =         and   =
                                                                  m+i
        As   ri =           the derived demand and the supply of the primary input

are the same in periods t and t+1. The primary input price for t and t+1 is

therefore given by:11



                                =
(7)
             p0 P)+                 m
                                        —




      To suinniarize, all firms choose their relative price every two periods.

Their price decision depends on current and expected input prices for the

next two periods. }alf of the prices change every period.

      The only deviation from the flexible price world is the presence of

desynchronization: other sources of price inertia are excluded in order to

isolate the effects of desynchronization. This excludes in particular such

elements as labor contracts with nominal wages predetermined for long periods

of time.'2 As a result, it is not clear whether the primary input should be

thought of as labor or as a raw material. If thought of as labor, its price

has probably more inertia than formalized in equation (7).



Equilibrium ith Desvnchronized Prices

      Equilibrium is now characterized by equations (6) and (7). Input market

equilibrium, equation (7), gives us a first relation between p and p,

given tn and           The other relation between p and       follows from the et

of pricing relations given by (6). We now derive it by recursive substitution.
                                                           7




       Starting from i =        a,       equation (6) gives:



(8)         pat =                            + E(p1 ÷1It))


For i = n—i, it gives for t—1 and t+1:




            n-1 t-1 =       2   n-2 t-2 + E(pn2tIt_1))



            rn-i t+1 =      + n-2t                      + E(p2 t+2'

Assuming rational expectations, taking expectations of                                  at time t,

using iterated expectations and replacing in equation (8) gives:



                =
                    {i] n2                   t-2    + E(p2 k_1) + n-2        t    + E(p2 t+21t)1


       By induction, e can express p as a function of p:



                        En/2 (n/2)—i
                                                                         - i + j)

        This formula is quite formidable but has a simple structure. Consider

first the case of perfect foresight, so that expectations are equal to actual

values. This gives:




(10')                                                  +
                     2-n[{]PO2I +

        This shows the first effect of desynchronization: the price level

depends. on input prices up to n periods in the past and n periods in the

future. The weights are simply the coefficients of a binomial expansion,

normalized by their sum,

        When we relax the assumption of perfect foresight and allow for

uncertainty, actual values of input prices in (10') are replaced by

expectations. The price level depends then on three sets of terms. The

first double sum involves past input prices, both actual and expected; the

term in p            for example includes both the actual value of p           and the
             ot—2i                                                     ot—2i
values of t2i expected prior to t—2i, from t —        -—i    to t—21—1. The second

sum involves both the actual value and past expectations of the current input

price. The third involves both past and current expectations of future input

prices. Note, and we shall return to this below, that many terms in this last

double sum are past expectations of future prices and thus are predetermined

at time t. Thus, the symmetry between the effects of the future and the past

which obtains under perfect foresight (equation (10')) does not obtain under

uncertainty and rational expectations.

        A visually more explicit representation of (10) is given in Figure 1 for

n = 10.     Each line represents a set of terms in equation (10). The right end

III.   Price Level Inertia and the Number of Price Decisions



A Sim?le Neasure of Inertia

       Producers of the final good freely choose their own nominal price, the

price level, every two periods and would not characterize it as sluggish.

Their price decision however depends directly and indirectly on past input

prices and, in a well-defined sense, the price level is sluggish: looking at

ecuation (10), we can usefully think of the price level as the sum of

ccmponents, some of them determined in the past and thus predetermined at

tine t, some of them free to move at time t.

       This suggests a simple measure of price level inertia, namely the ratio

of the number of predetermined components to the number of nonpredetermined
                                                                          13
cc'ponents in (10). Prom eguation (10), this ratio, R, is given by:


                            n
            R=1—2 -n     I
                          in / 2j




              =   .5 for n = 2, .75 for n = 10, .92 for n = 100.



       Thus this ratio is higher than the proportion of prices which are not

free to adjust at any given tine——one half——and is increasing with the number

 of price decisions. If n is large, most of the elements which compose the

price level are predetermined.
                                      11




     That, as n increases, desynchronization implies a dependence of the price

level on input prices further in the past and expected further in the future

is quite intuitive. That, as n increases, the degree of predetermination

increases is less intuitive. Figure 2 helps understand why by showing how

the price level depends on input prices, as we go down the chain of production.

Any element below the line is predetermined and thus can only depend in turn

on predetermined elements. Any element above the line is not predetermined

and may in turn depend on both predetermined and nonpredetermined elements.

nt depends on predetermined       t—1 and nonpredetermined E(p1 +iIt).

E(p1 +i!t) however depends itself on partly predetermined elements such

as n3 t—1 As we extend the graph to the right, more and more elements go

below the line: the ratio, R, of predetermined to nonpredeter-mined elements

increases and tends to 1 as ngets large.

     This measure of price level inertia is a bit crude: it tells us how

much of the price level is predetermined and cannot change in response to

disturbances in the current period, but tells us nothing about the path of

price level adjustment thereafter. We now look at the complete path; this

requires solving the model.



The Effects of an Increase in Noney

     As characterized by (10), the effect of the input price, actual or

expected, on the price level is unambiguously positive. The effect of the

price level on the input price is however ambiguous, as shown in (7). An

increase in the price level decreases real balances, aggregate demand, the

derived input demand and thus the equilibrium real input price; the net

effect of a higher price level and a lower real price is ambiguous. If      = 1,

the net effect is zero and the input price does not depend on the price level.

The system is then recursive, the price level depending on the input price,

and the input price depending on money and the supply disturbance. We start

with this case; the general case will be analyzed in the next section. If

       Consider a permanent unanticipated increase in money at time to. Because

of the long—run neutrality of money in this model, the long—run elasticity of

the price level with respect to money is unity. We can derive from (11)

incremental and cumulative price level elasticities over time. Denoting the

proportional increase in money by dm we get:

     Tables 1 and 2 give incremental and cumulative elasticities of p over

time for different values of ii.   They show a monotonic adjustment with the

rate of.adjustment increasing initially before decreasing later.

     The adjustment of the price to its higher level takes exactly n periods.

The adjustment is however substantially complete before that: assuming the

period to be a month, the adjustment after a year is 99% complete if n = 20,

90% complete if n = 50, 75% complete if n = 100.    Values of n of 100 may

therefore generate the amount of price inertia we observe in the United States.

Given the highly idealized nature of the model, it is difficult to decide

whether such values for n are or are not reasonable.

     There is an interesting distinction between demand disturbances, m, and

supply disturbances, E. Note from equation (11) that they have an identical

dynamic effect on the price level. Demand disturbances however affect demand

and production all along the chain of production and thus are immediately

perceived by all producers. The assumption made above that the change in money

immediately known by all is therefore reasonable. Supply disturbances on the

other hand have no direct effect on demand (this results from the assumption

of demand determination). Thus, producers of y i       2, " , n   will perceive

no change in their demand or imput price at time to. If their information

included only the demand they face and the input price they pay, they would

not revise expectations. In this case, the increase in the primary input

price would slowly be transmitted to the structure of prices. p would not

more inertia.

The Effects of Money Deceleration

     Characterizing the effects of a change in the level of money is a

useful first step but the experiment lacks empirical relevance. Of more

direct relevance are the effects of money deceleration. Suppose that money

and prices are both growing at rate g per period and that this rate of

inflation is considered too high by policy makers. What are the effects on

real output of a sudden deceleration, say sudden zero growth of money?14

The effects differ, depending on whether this change is anticipated or not.

Lets first assume that the policy Is announced at time to, to take place

at time t+n: the rate of money growth remains equal to g until t+n and

is equal to zero thereafter. From (11), real money balances from to on are

given by:



                                            i—i
                                 n—i
                 +2j
                       =        (2     g)              (i—j)            for   i = 1,   ••, n/2
                                                                    J
                                            J=O

                                            i-i                 n
                       =        (2u1g)             ((n/2)-j))   .       for   I =   n/2,   ..., n
                                            j=O



     The paths of money and prices are plotted in Figure 3. Real money

balances, and therefore output, Increase slowly after the announcement.

They reach their maximum value at t0+n when money growth stops. If for

example n = 50 and g =     1%        which corresponds, if the basic period is a

month, to 12% annually, real money balances are higher by 1.3% at time t+50.

They decrease thereafter and return to their normal level at t +2n. Thus
                                                             0
deflation is achieved not with a recession but with a (mild) expansion!...
                                      18




    What is this due to? The announcement of a lower money growth leads

?rlce setters to slow down their rate of increase of prices before money

deceleration takes place. When zero money growth actually takes place, real

ncney balances are higher but progressively return to their normal level as

                                       This is a very general feature of the
prices keep increasing until t0+2n.

"ne' models of price inertia and holds for example also in the Taylor—Phelps

(Taylor [1980), Phelps [1979)) model of overlapping labor contracts.15 What

is required however is a decrease in inflation before the decrease in money

growth: for this to happen, the announcement of the future change in policy

must be credible. In practice, the lack of credibility is probably what

takes this result unlikely to occur. If for example agents do not believe

zero money growth before it is actually implemented, this deceleration leads

 to a temporary loss in output. The path of prices in this case is also

 pictted in Figure 3.



 IV. Price Level Inertia and the Elasticity of Input Supply

      In traditional enpirical macroeconometric models, prices are approximately

  arkups over wages. Wages in turn depend on labor market conditions; of

 central importance for price inertia and the effects of money on real activity

 is the elasticity of noinal wages to the unemployment rate, the slope of the

 "short—run Phillips curve." These models have however been criticized for their

 foralization of expectations and the critique is as follows: expectations

 cf inflation should be included in the Phillips curve and, with rational

 exectationS, anticipated movements in money will have no effect on output,

  nependently of the slope of the short—run Phillips curve.

       This section shows that, if prices are desynchronized, the slope of the

"short—run Phillips curve" is, even with rational expectations, an important

deterniinant of the degree of price inertia. More precisely, it shows that

the flatter the input supply is, the slower the price level will adjust, the

larger the effect of money on real output will be.

       The case n = 2 can be solved analytically. As S is not necessarily equal

to unity, the model is no longer recursive and is a little more difficult to

solve. To focus on the effects of demand disturbances,                   is put equal to zero.

Replacing (7) in (9) gives us an equation in

previous section. If input supply is relatively inelastic, i.e. for 8 between

0 and 1, A is negative and tends to —1 as 8 tends to zero. If input supply

is relatively elastic, i.e. for 8 greater than 1, A is positive and tends to

1 as 8 tends to infinity. Thus, the flatter input supply, the larger the

direct dependence of the price level on the past.

from unity. As there are no unanticipated movements in money or prices after

to, equation (14) together with the assumed path of money implies in this case:



(15)          nt±2 =   nt   + (1—A)   ;        t   >
                                                       to



Thus, given            we can solve for the sequence of prices after .t. Equation

(12) and the assumptions about the path of money give us another relation

between t2 and               and thus the initial condition we need:

                                               nt


Equations (15) and (16) allow us to solve for the path of prices at and

after t
          0
       Table 3 gives the path of prices for different values of 8.         It shows in

particular that if real input prices are insensitive to market conditions, i.e.

if S is large, the price level reacts less and adjusts more slowly to changes

in money: rcey has larger and more lasting effects on output. If we think

of the input as labor, this shows the importance of the "short—run Phillips

curve" slope, even in an economy with rational expectations.

     Extending the analysis to values of n larger than 2 presents no particular

difficulty and the method is sketched in the appendix. Results for n          10

and different values of 8 are presented in Table 3. The conclusions are the

same as above. As the analysis is substantially simpler when 8 = 1, the last

section makes this assumption; this section has shown how the results would

be modified if the assumption were relaxed.



V.   Variability of Relative Prices and Profits

     Desynchronization of price decisions has implications not only for the

dynamics of the price level but for the dynamics of the structure of relative

prices. The equation giving the behavior of any nominal price k is, if k is

even, the same equation as for p, i.e. equation (10) with n replaced by k.

The formula for k odd is slightly different but, as there are no particular

insights to be obtained from it, we shall limit our attention to prices for

which k is even.



Snake Effects

     To see the effects of a permanent increase in money on the structure of

prices, we can return to Tables 1 and 2 in Section III: they can also be

interpreted as giving the cross section time series of prices. The first

column gives the values of kt for values of k ranging from 2 to 500, the

second column the values of kt+2 for the same values of k and so on.

     Table 2 shows how the increase in money twists the structure of prices.

Prices early in the chain of production move more and adjust faster, prices

further in the chain move less and adjust more slowly. If we measure profit

rates by (pt, —
                  k—2   for sector k,16 it also appears that profit rates move

more for low values of k. These results would be unchanged if we were

looking at a supply disturbance, ,    instead   of a demand disturbance, m.
                                                24



Variance    of Prices and Profits

       Instead of looking at effects of once—and—for—all changes in in             or   ,   we


may look at the stochastic behavior of prices for a given process for in or E.

Assume for example that            and in   are white——keeping for convenience the assumption

that for t       even,   realizations of        and in are the same for t   and t+1. If, as

before, we define            as in. —    ' the behavior of kt is, from (10):

(17)         kt                    bk(k,2)i
                                                 "t—2ij


        Thus, the standard deviations of nominal prices, real prices and profit

rates are given by:




                                  (bk(k/2)i)2j
                                                       °
        -          =
                                (2k bk, (k/2)-i -     2 bn, (n/2)_i)]            b = 0 if i        <0


                                                                   1½

        Using identities associated with the hypergeometric distribution (Feller

                         = 2k               -           1

     The values of these standard deviations, for n = 10 and k = 0, •••, 10,

are reported in Table 4. The standard deviations of nominal prices, real

prices and profit rates are all decreasing in k. This ordering is again

independent of whether the economy is affected by supply or demand disturbances.

     This result is fairly robust, being due to desynchronizationi rather than

to the other assumptions of the model. There are two ways to potentially

reverse it. The first is to relax the assumptions of constant returns and

no inventory. In this case faced for example with a temporary increase in

demand, a firm may decrease its price, decumulate inventory and not change

its derived demand; it would therefore not transmit the disturbance further

down the chain of production. Its price may then vary more than prices further

down the chain. The second is to allow for disturbances to the technology

itself, for example to allow the S. in equation (1) to be stochastic. In this

case sectors affected by large technological disturbances may experience more

price variability than the others.

     If we think of the primary input as raw materials——there are clearly

other factors at work in the labor market——the result is in accordance with

facts. In the United States, the variance of raw materials is larger than

the variance of intermediate products, which is itself larger than the

variance of the WPI, both for periods dominated by demand disturbances and

periods dominated by supply disturbances.17



VI. Conclusions and Extensions

     This paper has shown that desynchronization of individual price decisions

generates both inertia of the price level and movements in relative prices

ich ap?ear in accordance with the facts.
                                     27




     It is time to return to the assumptions and face the question addressed

to other models of price inertia. Are there obvious opportunities for profit

left unused? Is every agent acting optimally? There are two crucial

assumptions in the model:

     The first is that price setters choose the same nominal price for two

periods, rather than choosing different nominal prices for both periods, or

allowing   the second—period price to be contingent. We have purposefully
chosen a basic period short enough that such schemes are likely to have costs
which outweigh their benefits. Indexation of the second—period price on the
price level is clearly unfeasible if the basic period is short: there may well

be no reliable price level index.

     The second is the structure of timing decisions. Given the timing

decisions of others, does an agent have an incentive to maintain his own

timing decision? In our model, the answer that he has an incentive to

change it: each producer has an incentive to synchronize its price

decisions with those of his supplier. This feature is however a

characteristic of the simple structure of the model and is easily removed:

if for example each producer uses two inputs, the prices of which change at

different times, he cannot achieve synchronization with both. It is easy to

construct structures of timing decisions such that no price setter has an

incentive to change his own timing given the timing of others. With such

structures, desynchronization and the implied inertia of the price level

will remain: no agent has an incentive to change his timing or behavior.

     This model can be seen as an alternative to the model of overlapping

labor contracts developed by Akerlof [1969], Phelps.[1979) and Taylor {1980).

Both explanations of price inertia are however probably empirically relevant.

The comparative advantage of this model is twofold. The first is that it is
                                   28




more explicitly grounded in maximizing behavior; this allows for an easier

treatment of normative aspects of policies. The second and more important

is that it derives the complete structure of prices together with the price

level. Thus it is well adapted to analyze questions involving both nominal

and relative prices. It can for example easily be used to look at the

desirability of exchange rate indexation under various sources of disturbances,

a question analyzed by Dornbusch 1982] using the Taylor model.

       We proceed in two steps. The first is to derive the behavior of

E(pjt_n). Taking expectations in (Al) at time t—n and denoting them

                        i=—n/2 (n/2)+i



       Consider the polynomial 1 —          2t1(1Bl)A(L)         associated with the

homogenous part of this difference equation. It is symmetric so that if

A is a root, A1 is also a root. Thus it can be factorized as:
                                                 30

where a is a scalar and B(L) =            1   + b1L +      + b,2 L'2 has all roots inside

the unit circle.

        This implies that E(Plt_n) follows:

        The second step is to solve for the actual value of                   This is easily

done for any specific path of——or process for——money. In the case of a

permanent unanticipated increase in money at time to from zero to unit, it is

derived as follows:

        As there are no unanticipated movements of money or prices after t, (A3)

irnolies for t>
              —      t 0+n:


             B(L)p     =              a (B(L))            A(L)rn



The path of money considered here is such that all values of                   on the right

hand side are equal to unity. Thus:



             B(L)p =       2          a (B(1)) A(1)


 (A4)        B(L)p =        (8B(1))1           as 2 A(1) =         1




         For t =   t+n,          t+2n—2 this gives a system of n/2 equations in n

 unknowns, t2n2' ...,                          In   turn, equation (Al) gives for

t   t, ", t+n-2and      given the path of money, n/2 equations in the same

unknowns. This gives a system of n equations in n unknowns. Once this

system is solved, values of p for t >    t+2n   can be derived using (A4).

This is the method used to construct the second part of Table 3.

Footnotes

1. Many arguments along this line are presented in Gordon [1981]


2. The implications of various theories for the relation between disturbances,

     the price level and relative prices are presented in Fischer [1981).


3.   It is sometimes argued that a source of price inertia is the length of

     the production process (for example, Coutts et al. [1978)). The argument

     is that if price is based on historical cost, a longer production process

     will lead to longer lags in price adjustment. Although this argument

     seems to have some empirical success, it appears difficult to reconcile

     with rational behavior on the part of firms.


4. An alternative formalization, which would extend work by Akerlof [1969),

     would postulate a large number of imperfectly substitutable final outputs

     produced under monopolistic competition. An increase in the number of

     price decisions would be obtained by increasing the number of products.

     The problem for our purposes is that the "technology't would not remain

     invariant as the number of price decisions increased. Otherwise, results

     are very similar.


5. An alternative is to formalize production as iterations of an input—output

     matrix. This turns out to be difficult to analyze.


6.   The supply dsturbance    does not affect the technology. It would be

     easy to allow for technological disturbances as well, by letting the 0.

     be stochastic in equation (1).

7.   It is well known    that   this relation can either be seen as a velocity

     equation or as a reduced form ISLM. Allowing for an interest rate

     explicitly would complicate the analysis but bring few insights. The

     unitary elasticity of output with respect to money balances assumption

     can be easily relaxed.


8.   Although we do not derive the decision about period length from an

     optimization problem, this can be done by equalizing the marginal cost

     of more frequent changes to the marginal benefit of more accurate relative

     prices. This analysis has been pursued by Sheshinski and Weiss (for

     example [1981)).


9.   This voluntarily abstracts from issues of monopoly power which may arise

     with desynchronized price setting. Condition (6) differs in two minor

     ways from the correct expected zero—profit condition: it neglects the

     fact that the second—period expected profit should be discounted by the

     interest rate; equivalently it assumes the real interest rate to be equal

     to zero. It implicitly assumes that the firm sells the same quantities

     in both periods, so that the weights on profit rates in period t

              i_1
          —
                    t—1 and period t+1 (p.r —           +iIt)) are equal. Both
                                                E(p.1
     shortcuts simplify the analysis considerably and are not the source of

     the main results of the paper.


10. In a more realistic model, firms would have the choice of supplying demand

     out of either production or inventories. The initial effect of an increase

     in aggregate demand on the derived demand for the primary input would in

     general be smaller.

11. Using the fixed—price equilibrium terminology, our model allows for

     overemployment or underemployment of the primary input but not for

     unemployment as the input market is always in equilibrium. If we allowed

     for changes in m and      every period, the price would not necessarily clear

     the market in both periods and there could be unemployment.


12. The nominal rigidity of labor contracts is of a different nature from the

     rigidities considered in this paper. It is usually of much longer

     duration and the assumption of demand determination is certainly more

     questionable.


:3. All the expressions in this paper are computed using binomial distribution

     tables (Aiken [1955)). These give F(n,r,p) =           Prob(x   >   r)   if x follows an

     n—binomial with probability p. Then:

             2         =   F(n,r,i)
                                 1    —   F(n,
                                                  •   1
                                                 r-rl, -)
                  rJ


     The usual caveat about policy invariance of the structure applies. Such

     a drastic change may lead price setters to change price decisions more

     often or to try to achieve better synchronization.


:.   In   his paper [1979), Phelps considers a slightly different question. The

     question is whether, starting from steady inflation, there is a path of

     money such that inflation disappears over time and there is no change,

     positive or negative, in output. Phelps shows that there is such a path

      in his model but that the path is unappealing, involving oscillations in

      the rate of inflation along the way. Our model also has such a path,

     -ith the sa-e napea1ing features fQr n > 2.

16. This is more precisely the profit rate of the consolidated sector

    (k, k—i). We use this definition to avoid having to introduce       for

    odd k. The change in definition does not affect any of the conclusions.


17. This statement is based on comparisons of standard deviations of residuals

    from regressions on a quadratic trend, for subsamples of 47—1 to 80—1,

    for the following three series, "finished goods" producer price index

     (WPISOP3000NS in the DRI U.S. price bank), "intermediate materials,

     supplies and components" index (WPISOP2000NS), and 'crude materials for

     further processing" index (WPISOP1000NS).
