                                              ABSTRACT

This paper revisits the association between investment and growth. The empirical findings highlight
substantial heterogeneity for the effect of investment on growth and suggest a possible negative association.
Results based on a battery of cross-sectional and time-series regressions show that the link between
investment and growth has weakened over time and that investment in high-income countries is more
likely to have a negative effect on growth. The adverse effect for high-income countries appears to
have increased over time. An implication is that uphill capital flows could be associated with negative
or zero returns. The result is robust to the presence of control variables that are commonly included
in growth studies.

1.      Introduction
        This paper revisits the association between investment and growth. In the context of
neoclassical growth theory and a canonical concave production function, marginal returns to
capital are presumed to be positive but to diminish as the capital-output ratio rises. As capital-
output ratios rise, and countries grow richer over time, the effect of lagged investment on growth
should diminish and could even turn negative. An implication is that public policy designed to
promote growth via stimulating investment could be ineffective; especially for high-income
countries.


     Diminishing returns are a property of production relationships and this property is
independent of the source of savings that make investment possible. Investment matched by
either foreign or domestic savings would depress marginal returns. Recently, there have been a
few empirical studies examining effects of foreign savings on domestic growth; or alternatively,
the link between current account imbalances and growth.1 In this paper, we investigate the
direct evidence of the marginal effect of investment on growth and whether high and low income
countries experience the same or similar effect.


     There are reasons to doubt that we will observe zero or negative returns to investment. One
motivation for international capital flows is presumably to arbitrage the returns offered by
domestic and foreign markets. The well-documented pattern of capital flows from poor to rich
countries (going back to Feldstein and Horioka, 1980), and among poor countries from rapidly
growing economies to slowly growing economies (Gorinchas and Jeanne, 2007), however, has
cast considerable doubt on the view that savings follow returns across national borders. There is
now a substantial literature on distortions to cross-border capital flows that might generate zero
or negative returns on capital in individual countries.2


     Even if investment follows return opportunities a large influx of capital could depress returns
in the presence of diminishing returns to scale. To further complicate the situation, the actual

capital flow and hence investment could be driven by non-profit considerations including the
saving gluts story. If the non-profit driven capital flows are quantitatively important, the
observed link between investment and growth could be weakened. We briefly review some of
these possibilities in the next section.


    There are reservations on the research strategy of using direct econometric tests to detect the
relationship between investment and growth. Barro (2008), for example, argues that two-way
causation between investment and growth could make direct econometric evaluation of limited
value. The alternative strategy for evaluating the contribution of investment to growth is growth
accounting where the causation problem is sidestepped at the cost of assuming that aggregate
payments to factors of production are determined by their marginal products.3


    The empirical research that has looked at econometric evidence is quite mixed. In the
examination of a cross-section of countries, Houthakker (1961), Modigliani (1970) and Carroll
and Weil (1994) find a positive association between investment and growth. Barro (1991) and
Barro and Lee (1993) also obtain a positive coefficient using a growth-regression approach. In
contrast, Attanasio, Picci and Scorcu (2000) conduct a battery of Granger causality tests in a
panel setting to find that lagged investment rate Granger-causes growth rate with a negative sign.
Unlike the previous studies, these authors also emphasize the importance of time-series over
cross-sectional asymptotics. Finally, using a panel regression approach, Aghion, Comin and
Howitt (2006) find that a higher savings rate is associated with higher growth in poorer countries
while the association is significantly smaller and only marginally statistically significant for
richer countries.

          In a recent review, Hulton (2009) observes “(T)he non-parametric (non-econometric) nature of growth
accounting is made possible by the assumption of competitive markets in which prices are equal to marginal cost. In
this case, cost shares are equal to the corresponding output elasticities. This equality does not hold in non-
competitive markets where prices are likely to deviate from marginal cost.” Clearly, if we assume capital is paid its
marginal product, and capital’s income share of GDP is substantial, it cannot be true that the marginal product of
capital is zero or negative. But the assumption that the marginal and average products of capital are the same is a
very demanding one. See Caselli and Feyrer (2007) for measures of the marginal product of capital based on growth
accounting.

                                                         2
      We adopt an empirical framework that offers some direct inferences regarding the investment
effect on growth. Data from a large number of countries from 1950 through 2007 are considered.
To anticipate the results, our cross-sectional regressions show that the investment-growth link is
quite variable and appears to have weakened over time. The link also displays a discernable
difference between high and low income countries with high-income countries more likely to
generate negative growth effects. These results are robust in the presence of the standard control
variables used in the empirical growth literature. The country-specific regression results affirm
the heterogeneous investment and growth patterns experienced by different countries – even
among the G7 countries.


      In the next section, we briefly review the link between investment and growth. Section 3
gives the basic empirical structure and discusses the empirical findings. Some concluding
remarks are offered in Section 4


2. Investment and Growth


2.1      Are zero or negative returns to investment plausible?
         Conventional assumptions about aggregate production functions include the property
that, other things equal, the marginal return on investment declines, and at some point turns
negative, as the capital-output ratio increases. Conventional analysis also suggests that we are
unlikely to observe investment that generates zero or negative returns. High-income countries,
with high capital output ratios and capital that incorporates the best technology, are likely to be
closer to zero or negative marginal products for capital as compared to low-income countries.
But if there are alternative investment (or storage) strategies that generate positive expected
returns, we would not often observe investment with negative ex post returns. The obvious
investment alternative for savings generated in high-income countries is investment in poor
countries where the marginal return from investment has been assumed to be positive. To be
sure, returns are uncertain and negative ex post returns might occasionally be observed, but
average returns over the business cycle are generally assumed to be positive.



                                                  3
          Gordon Getty (2010a, 2010b) has challenged these assumptions by asking a
straightforward question. What direct evidence do we have concerning the relationship for the
United States between changes in savings or investment ratios and the subsequent behavior of
growth rates? His interpretation of US data is that there is no evidence that increases in savings
rates or investment rates are associated with subsequent increases in income growth rates. That
is, the marginal contribution to growth of unusually high rates of investment is zero. His
interpretation of the evidence is that US savings behavior is not a constraint on economic growth
and that public policies designed to raise savings rates are misguided.


          Even though increases in productivity might cause savings, investment and subsequent
growth rates to rise, the reverse causation from savings and investment to growth is not at all
obvious. Getty (2010b), for example, quotes John Stuart Mill (1848):


      “If it were said, for instance, that the only way to accelerate the increase of capital is by increase of saving,
      the idea would probably be suggested of greater abstinence, and increased privation. But it is obvious that
      whatever increases the productive power of labor creates an additional fund to make savings from, and
      enables capital to be enlarged not only without additional privation, but concurrently with an increase of
      personal consumption.”


          Our approach to the problem is to assume that it is possible that investment booms in
high-income countries are associated with increases in savings and investment that are not a
response to productivity increases and therefore might have no effect or even a negative effect on
subsequent growth.



2.2       Capital flows and growth
          In an environment where international capital flows are widely associated with bad
outcomes for investment in high-income countries, we find the lack of direct tests of the
relationship between investment and growth surprising. A number of distortions to private
investment decisions might generate aggregate negative returns. One interpretation of recent
history for high-income countries (Bernanke et al., 2011) is that savings gluts in the rest of the
world or shifts in portfolio preferences for US assets by private (Caballero et al., 2006) or
                                                             4
official investors (Dooley et al., 2003, 2009) have pushed foreign savings into the US.4 This
inflow of foreign savings reduced the incentives for US government and private savings, but the
offset was incomplete, and the resulting level of investment caused marginal returns to
investment to fall. The fact that US real interest rates have remained quite low by historical
standards throughout the period seems to us consistent with this hypothesis.


        The implications of “uphill” capital flows for subsequent growth performance are
obvious. Foreign savings attracted by high expected returns are likely to contribute to growth.
Foreign savings attracted by other factors depress returns, and if these other factors are powerful
enough, could be associated with zero or negative expected returns.


        A related idea is that the inflow of foreign savings not only depressed expected real yields
in the US but also overwhelmed in an unexpected manner the ability of the US financial system
to efficiently and honestly intermediate the augmented flow of savings. In this interpretation
productive investment opportunities are available but the financial system is unable or lacks the
incentives to find them. The negative externality from an increased flow of savings and
investments can generate negative ex post rates of return on investment. In this view savings
were misallocated and the recent financial crisis was the inevitable result of the capital losses
generated by ex post valuation of investment projects.


        Another line of research suggests that various types of distortions turn investment booms
into growth busts (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009). Moreover, investors fail to learn through
experience. These arguments are largely based on historical analysis of financial crises and their
antecedents. The idea that investment booms, particularly in housing, have been generated by
speculative bubbles, unsustainable government subsidies or distortions in financial markets has
dominated recent discussions of the subprime crisis.


        In this paper we do not distinguish among the many possible reasons why investment
might fail to drive growth. Since our sample ends in 2007 we are not capturing the subprime
4
 See Alfaro, Kalemli‐Ozcan and Volosovych (2005) for empirical evidence that official capital inflows are not
associated with increases in productivity.
                                                         5
crisis. We do test the idea that some unknown cause of unproductive investment has generated
over time increasingly weak and finally negative returns for investment in high-income
countries. The implication would be that the subprime crisis may have been the most recent
manifestation of a secular trend in investment returns for high-income countries.


       To explore Getty’s conjecture that savings are not a constraint on growth we conduct an
extensive battery of econometric tests both for US data and for a large sample of rich and poor
countries. We consider both cross-section and time-series evidence. Our priors are that it is
important to consider high- and low-income countries as having different characteristics. This is
clearly the case for studies of the convergence hypothesis. The empirical literature on
convergence tests the prediction that investment returns are higher in poor relative to rich
countries. If this is the case, similar rates of investment will eventually lead to a convergence of
per capita income. The conventional result from that literature is that there is some support for
the convergence hypothesis within groups of poor and rich countries but not between these
groups. In this paper we investigate the possibility that within the high-income group
convergence is associated with zero or even negative marginal contributions to growth from
investment. This is a different type of convergence in that the high-income countries are moving
back to the pack.




3.     The Results


3.1    Data
       The baseline regression uses country level data on real gross domestic product at
purchasing power parity per capita (henceforth GDP for brevity) and investment share in GDP.
Annual data from 1950 to 2007 and on up to 188 countries were retrieved from the Penn World
Tables, Version 6.3 (Heston and Aten, 2009).


       Some control variables are employed to evaluate the robustness of the baseline regression
results. They include a) economic openness (openness) given by the ratio of export and import

                                                  6
volume to GDP, b) the ratio of general government consumption to GDP (govtcons), c) annual
percentage change in consumer prices (inflation), d) secondary school enrollment rate among
male population (schooling), e) infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births (mortality), and f) total
births per woman in logarithm (fertility); see, for example, Barro (1991) and Barro and i Martin
(2003). These data were obtained from the World Bank World Development Indicators database.
In addition, we consider the political stability indicator, Polity2 , that is defined by the difference
between institutional autocracy and institutional democracy scores; these scores assume a value
between -10 to 10. The data on Polity2 are from the Marshall and Jaggers (2002). Table 1
summarizes the variables used in the regression analysis and their sources.


3.2     Bivariate Regression
        Let yj be country j’s average annual GDP growth over an n-year period and ij be the
average of its annual investment share in GDP in the same n-year period. The basic growth-
investment regression is given by the bivariate equation:


        yj = α + βij,-n + ε j,                                                         (1)


where the β coefficient gives the lagged investment effect on growth and ε is the regression error.
The use of lagged investment in the regression is meant to alleviate the possible feedback effect
between growth and investment so that the β coefficient could be properly interpreted as the
growth effect of investment.


        Table 2 summarizes the cross-sectional regression results based on equation (1) using
non-overlapping data with a three-year sampling window (n = 3). The year-heading gives the
last year of the sampling window. Essentially, the results are in accordance with the notion that
(lagged) investment promotes growth; the investment share coefficient estimates are mostly
positive. For the 18 cross-sectional regression estimates, 10 are positive and statistically
significant. Note that the investment effect on growth has declined over time and become
statistically insignificant after 1995.



                                                   7
         The explanatory power given by the adjusted R-squared estimate is quite high for the
1956 regression – the investment share explains 31.6% of the variation in GDP. The adjusted R-
squared estimate, however, tends to decline over time and is less than 2% after the 1995
regression. Both the coefficient estimates and the R-squared estimates suggest that the link
between investment and growth has weakened over time.5


3.3      High-Income vs. Low-Income Countries
         As noted in Section 2, investment in high-income and low-income countries could have
different implications for growth. To allow for the differential effects, we consider the cross-
sectional regression specification:


         yj = α + 1 Dj + βij,-n + 2 (Dj  ij,-n) + ε j.                                           (2)


The zero-one dummy variable Dj is deployed to differentiate the growth behaviors of high and
low income countries; Dj is set to 1 if country j’s GDP is above the cross-sectional sample mean
during that year and to 0 otherwise.6 The interaction variable Dj  ij,-n captures the (additional)
marginal effect of investment on growth, given by 2, experienced by high-income countries.
Under (2), the marginal growth effect of investment is given by β + 2Dj ( ∂yj ⁄∂ij,-n) and of
being a high income country is given by 1+ 2 ij,-n ( ∂yj ⁄∂Dj).


         Table 3 presents the results controlling for high-income country effects based on
specification (2). Compared with the baseline specification, the inclusion of the two high-income
related terms tends to improve the explanatory power, as proxied by the adjusted R-squared.
High income countries, on the average, have high growth rates. The dummy variable Dj always
yields a positive coefficient estimate and 12 of these 18 estimates are statistically significant.


5
         Table A1 in the appendix presents analogous cross-section regression results based on the sampling
window of n = 5. These results are qualitatively similar. We also considered the cases of n equals 2 and 10; the
results based on these sampling windows are again qualitatively similar to those reported in text and are available
upon request.
6
         The use of sample median instead of sample mean gives similar results.
                                                            8
Perhaps, a more interesting result is that all the 18 coefficient estimates of the interaction
variable Dj  ij,-n are negative and are mostly statistically significant.


        While the lagged investment itself in general has a positive impact on growth (the β
estimate has a positive value in 17 of the 18 regressions) investment has a net negative impact on
growth in high-income countries. The marginal effect of investment for high-income countries,
measured by the β + 2 estimate, is mostly negative for the 18 cross-sectional samples. In the
2000s, the interaction variable effect clearly dominates the lagged effect – investment in high-
income countries is negatively associated with future economic growth.


        Figure 1 offers a view on the statistical significance and the time profile of the combined
β + 2 estimates. The figure plots the marginal growth effect of investment, β + 2, from each
annual cross-sectional regression (with n = 3) along with the associated 95 percent confidence
interval.7 The combined β + 2 estimate exhibits a discernible downward trend over time. For the
sample period up to 2000, the zero mark is within the 95 percent confidence band, indicating that
up to that period investment has no statistically significant impact for high income countries on
growth. In contrast, during the 2000s the marginal investment effect is not just negative but is
also statistically significant. That is, investment in high income countries tends to have a
significant negative growth effect.


        The analogous plot for the case of n = 5 is given in Appendix, Figure A1. The pattern is
essentially the same as the one in Figure 1. For high income countries, the marginal growth
effect of investment is negative for most of the sample period with the negative effect being
statistically significant at the 5 percent level or higher in the 2000s.


        The estimation results illustrate the differential investment effects. As discussed in
Section 2, there are a few possible reasons for growth not responding to investment. Our
estimation results indicate that the general investment effect on growth (given by the linear β-
estimate) has declined over time while the adverse contribution of the high income dummy

7
        The confidence interval takes into account the variances and the covariance of the estimates of β and 2.
                                                         9
variable to the investment effect on growth (given by the 2 coefficient on the interaction term)
holds up quite well. The phenomenon could be due to, for example, a) a reduction of productive
investment opportunities in high-income countries over time and/or b) some congestion
externality such as the reduction in the ability of the financial system to intermediate capital to
productive investment opportunities. The current setting does not allow us to isolate the
underlying causes of the evolution of investment effects. Nevertheless, it is important to
document the empirical regularity concerning the declining investment effect on growth and the
possibility that investment flows into high income countries could have a negative expected
return.


3.4       Additional Control Variables
          Arguably, both specifications (1) and (2) over-simplify growth dynamics since they omit
some common determinants of cross-country variations in economic growth. To assess the
robustness of our results, we consider the regression


          yj = α + 1 Dj + βij,-n + 2 (Dj  ij,-n) + δControls j,-n + ε j,                                   (3)


where Controls is a vector containing the relevant control variables and δ is the corresponding
coefficient vector. The control variables that are commonly used in cross-country growth
analysis were listed in Subsection 3.1 and are added to the regression sequentially. The
estimation results are presented in Table 4. For brevity, we present the results pertaining to the
cross-sectional analysis based on the annual averages of the 2005 to 2007 period.8


          Two preliminary observations about the controls are in order. First, these control
variables as a group help explain growth variation across countries. The adjusted R-squared
estimates of the benchmark regression (2) are noticeably smaller than the corresponding ones
reported in Table 4 based on equation (3). The marginal explanatory powers of individual control
variables, however, depend on the presence of other regressors in the equation. Second, the

8
         Qualitatively, the results are similar for other time periods. However, as suggested by Figure 1, the results
on the parameter 2, that captures the (additional) marginal effect of investment on growth experienced by high
income countries, are less robust to the inclusion of controls in the earlier time periods.
                                                          10
inclusion of the geographic dummy variables (specification (9) in Table 4) does not improve the
regression performance. After controlling for the relevant economic variables, the Asian
countries, for example, do not have a stronger or weaker growth.


        Next, we move to the interpretation of the coefficients on linear and interaction
investment terms. The growth effect of investment is reinforced by these control variables: the
coefficient estimates on the lagged investment variable increases in both magnitude and
statistical significance with the inclusion of additional country controls. Nevertheless, the
marginal effect of investment in high-income countries during the 2005-2007 period, as given by
the β + 2 estimate, remains negative in all specifications reported in Table 4.


        The coefficient estimates on the two high-income related explanatory variables remain
positive and statistically significant in all the specifications. The interaction variable, on the other
hand, yields a slightly larger (more negative) coefficient estimate in some cases compared to the
benchmark without control variables. In other words, the adverse investment effect on growth
experienced by high income countries reported in Table 3 is robust to the inclusion of additional
economic control variables. Investment in a high-income country could lead to a slow growth
rate. The result naturally raises the question: Will a policy of promoting saving and investment
be effective in pulling the high income countries out of recession in the post 2007 era?


3.5     Results from Time Series Regressions
        The non-overlapping cross-sectional regression results reported in Tables 2 and 3 show
that, on the average, the investment effect on growth could be negative for high income
countries. Does an individual country’s own experience give the same inference? To offer an
alternative perspective on the interpretation of the investment effect on growth, we consider the
following regression for each country:


        yt = α + β1it,-n + β2 yt,-n + ε t,                                              (4)




                                                  11
where the time subscript indicates non-overlapping time series data used. Given the paucity of
time series data, the lagged growth variable is included to capture factors other than investment
that affect growth and to minimize the serial correlation in the error term ε t. Table 5 reports the
results for the 26 OCED countries. To facilitate comparison with results in the previous
subsections, the sampling window parameter n is set to 3. The countries are ranked by the year
2000 level of income per capita to shed some light on the implications of income for the
investment effect on growth.


       The positive investment effect is not a common phenomenon for these OECD countries.
After controlling for the lagged growth effect, lagged investment is found to have a negative
coefficient estimate for 13 countries and a positive one for the remaining half of the OECD
countries included in the analysis. The negative coefficient estimates on lagged investment tend
to concentrate among countries with a higher level of income. For the top 13 high income
countries, 8 display a negative estimate.


       Among the G-7 countries, the four that have the highest incomes (the USA, Canada,
Germany, and Japan) have a negative investment coefficient estimate and the other three
(France, Great Britain, and Italy) have a positive one. Indeed, the standard Chow-test results
indicate that the investment effects of these two groups of G-7 countries are usually different
from each other.


       Table 6 presents results from the 15 fastest growing emerging market economies in the
sample. These countries are not rich. Investment in these countries, however, does not
necessarily have a positive growth implication – indeed, investment has a statistically significant
negative effect in four countries. Thus, investment by itself may not be the main cause of fast
economic growth.


       In passing, we note that similar time series analyses were conducted for other countries.
Within a selected group of countries, high income countries are more likely to experience a
negative investment effect on growth. For instance, for a group of 9 selected developing

                                                 12
countries with the 2000 per capita income between $2.5K and $9K, only Mexico (income at the
$9K level) has a negative investment effect on growth.


       When we pooled all the data together, the investment variable has a statistically
significant coefficient estimate of 0.036; that is, on the average over time and across these
countries, investment has a small positive impact on growth. Of course, the significant pooled
estimate of 0.036 downplays the heterogeneous investment effect across countries with diverse
economic and political characteristics.


       While the cross-sectional regressions illustrate the different behaviors of high- and low-
income countries on average, the country specific results in Tables 5 and 6 highlight the degree
of heterogeneity, even among some high income countries. In general, the negative investment
effect on growth tends to be observed for countries with a high level of income within a selected
group. In that sense, the findings are in line with the main cross-sectional regression results.


4.     Concluding Remarks


       The empirics reported above suggest that the investment effect on growth has declined
over time to a quite low value in the 2000s. While the average lagged effect of investment on
growth across all the countries is positive, it is negative for high income countries. For high-
income countries, the negative coefficient on the interaction term high income dummy in the
growth equation on average dominates so that the combined marginal effect of investment on
growth is negative throughout most of the sample period and is more negative toward the end of
the sample time period: the 2000s. This result is robust to the inclusion of other variables that
have proven useful in cross-section growth studies.


       The time series evidence from individual countries illustrates the degree of the
heterogeneity of investment effect on growth. Within any one of the selected groups discussed in
the previous section, a higher income country is more likely to display a negative investment
effect on growth. However, individual time-series results indicate that not all the high income

                                                 13
countries display a negative investment effect and not all low income countries have a positive
effect. The level of income is not likely to be the sole determinant of the direction of the
investment effect on growth. Nonetheless, the time series evidence is in accordance with cross-
sectional regression results in the sense that, on average, investment has a negative growth effect
in high-income countries.


       Our results show that the investment effect varies over time and across countries. Thus, a
panel regression approach could lead to biased results. As pointed out in Section 3.5, the pooled
regression result ignores the heterogeneity of investment effects. Notwithstanding the caveat, we
note that the β and 2 estimates from estimating equation (3) under a panel data setting are,
respectively, positive and negative. That is, the results (available upon request) are qualitative
similar to those reported in Section 3.


       The evidence does not support any one theory of why investment in high income
countries is not associated with growth. However, recent uphill international capital flows to the
United States may have moved one high-income country to a region of decreasing and even
negative returns to investment. More generally, a policy of increasing saving and investment is
not a panacea, especially for high-income countries, for promoting economic growth.

Figure 1: The marginal growth effect of investment given by β + 2 and its 95% confidence
          interval; n = 3




Notes: The figure plots the marginal growth effect of investment, β + 2, from each annual cross-sectional
regression (with n = 3) based on equation (2) along with the associated 95 percent confidence interval. The
confidence interval takes into account the variances and the covariance of the estimates of β and 2.

interval; n = 5




                  .
Notes: The figure plots the marginal growth effect of investment, β + 2, from each annual cross-sectional
regression (with n = 5) based on equation (2) along with the associated 95 percent confidence interval. The
confidence interval takes into account the variances and the covariance of the estimates of β and 2.
