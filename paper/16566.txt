                                              ABSTRACT

This paper develops a covariate-based approach to the external validity of instrumental variables (IV)
estimates. Assuming that differences in observed complier characteristics are what make IV estimates
differ from one another and from parameters like the effect of treatment on the treated, we show how
to construct estimates for new subpopulations from a given set of covariate-specific LATEs. We also
develop a reweighting procedure that uses the traditional overidentification test statistic to define a
population for which a given pair of IV estimates has external validity. These ideas are illustrated through
a comparison of twins and sex-composition IV estimates of the effects childbearing on labor supply.

1    Introduction
Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE) capture the causal effect of an instrument-induced
shift in treatment. This effect is necessarily tied to the instrument that generates the shift. The
interpretation of IV estimates as instrument-specific should not be surprising or troubling - when
this point is cast in terms of specific examples, one wonders how it could be otherwise. Quarter
of birth instruments for a wage equation reveal the payoff to schooling induced by compulsory
attendance laws and not the value of a bought-and-paid-for MBA. Still, a clear statement of
the nature of the causal effects revealed by any instrument raises questions about the external
validity of this estimate. Can we use a given instrumental variables (IV) estimate to identify the
effects induced by another source of a variation? How about an unconditional average effect?
Can we go from average effects on compliers to average effects on the entire population?
    The usual answer to these questions is “no”. Except in special cases, we can’t go further,
at least, not without additional assumptions.       As described by Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin
(1996), the treated population includes two groups: compliers whose behavior is affected by
the instrument at hand and always-takers who are treated irrespective of whether a Bernoulli
instrument is switched off or on.     The non-treated are likewise composed of compliers and
never-takers; the latter group that avoids treatment no matter what. In the absence of strong
homogeneity or distributional assumptions, the data are uninformative for always-takers and
never-takers. Moreover, each instrument typically generates its own compliant subpopulation.
Effects for one group of compliers need not generalize to another.
    One road to go down in the search for external validity is structural. A latent-index choice
framework sometimes allows us to fill in gaps in the data.       For example, Heckman, Tobias,
and Vytlacil (2001, 2003) and Angrist (2004) use parametric latent-index models to identify
and compare different causal effects. Chamberlain (2010) develops a Bayesian semi-parametric
procedure for extrapolation that relies on models for variation in outcome distributions as a
function of the first-stage. In a recent paper, Heckman (2010) summarizes a literature on IV that
establishes theoretical links between parameters like LATE and effects on the treated. There’s
no free lunch, however; these links can be used for nonparametric identification of effects other
than LATE only with instrumental variables that drive the probability of treatment over a wide
range (in fact, from zero to one if we hope to recover the population average causal effect.) Such
“super-instruments” are rare if not unknown in applied work.       In practice, most instruments
are discrete with finite support, many are Bernoulli.
    These theoretical challenges notwithstanding, the predictive value of a particular set of IV
estimates may be revealed empirically when a researcher succeeds in isolating multiple instru-
ments for the same underlying causal relation. A pioneering effort in this direction is Oreopoulos’


                                                1
(2006) study of the economic returns to schooling. Oreopoulos compares IV estimates of the
returns to schooling across instruments of different strengths. Some of Oreopoulos’ instruments
are derived from compulsory attendance policies that had modest effects on schooling.                       But
two of the policy experiments in the Oreopoulos study generate instruments with dramatic first-
stage effects, something close to a half-year increase in schooling. Moreover, in these examples
there are few never-takers, so LATE is the average effect of treatment on the non-treated. As
it turns out, Oreopoulos’ IV estimates of the returns to schooling using marginal and full-bore
instruments are similar, suggesting a robust causal effect that is likely to have considerable pre-
dictive value.       Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser (2010) make a similar homogeneity argument for
IV estimates of the causal effects of family size on human capital (a relationship known as the
“quantity-quality trade-off”).         Sex composition instruments, which have a modest first stage,
generate causal effects similar to those found using twins instruments, where the first stage is
larger by an order of magnitude and there are no never-takers.1
       These examples are encouraging because they suggest that in a number of important appli-
cations, IV estimates are reasonably stable across instruments. In many applications, however,
heterogeneous effects are likely to be important. In this paper, we ask whether instrumental
variable estimates using different instruments, possibly with very different compliant subpopu-
lations, can be reconciled solely by differences in the observed characteristics of compliers. An
important consequence of the Abadie (2003) weighting theorem is that the distribution of com-
plier characteristics is identified and easy to describe empirically.             A natural first step when
comparing alternative IV estimates is to compare and contrast the observed characteristics of
compliers.       Assuming that treatment-effect heterogeneity is limited in a way that we make
precise below, we can use the distribution of complier characteristics to construct an estimator
that converts covariate-specific LATEs into other parameters such as the effect of treatment on
the treated and LATE using alternative instruments. Our first contribution is to explain and
illustrate this approach to external validity.
       A second purpose of the investigation described here is to use overidentification tests in
pursuit of external validity. In the classical simultaneous equation framework, statistically sig-
nificant differences between alternative IV estimates signal a failure of internal validity, perhaps
due to violations of the exclusion restriction.              In the LATE framework, different (internally
valid) instruments capture different causal effects. On the other hand, covariate-specific overi-
dentification tests and summary conditional tests weighted across covariate cells tell us whether
differences in the observed characteristics of compliant subpopulations are enough to explain
differences in unconditional effects.         If so, it seems fair to say that the IV estimates at hand

meet an empirically useful standard of external validity.
    In practice, the question of whether covariates explain the difference between two sets of IV
estimates need not have a simple yes or no answer. For some covariate values, or perhaps over
a certain range, there may be a good match. In other cases, the match will be poor and the
underlying estimates essentially unreconciled. We therefore use overidentification test statistics
to design a hybrid testing-and-weighting scheme that isolates covariate-defined subsamples for
which alternative IV estimates can be reconciled. We think of these values as defining a popula-
tion for which heterogeneity in treatment effects is solely a function of observed characteristics.
For this population, the predictive value of IV estimates is likely to be especially high.
    The ideas in the paper are illustrated through a comparison of alternative IV estimates of the
labor supply consequences of childbearing. As in the study by Angrist and Evans (1998), the
instruments are constructed from twin births and sibling sex composition. These instruments
have very different first stages and produce significantly different estimates of the causal effect of
a third birth. We show here that differences in the characteristics of instrument-specific complier
populations can account for most of the difference between the two sets of IV estimates.


2    Framework
We imagine that each individual is associated with two potential outcomes, y0 and y1 . These
describe the outcomes that would be realized under alternative assignments of a treatment, d.
The observed outcome, y, is linked to potential outcomes as follows:

                                        y = y0 + (y1 − y0 )d.                                     (1)

A random-coefficients notation for this is

                                           y = α + rd + η,

where α = E[y0 ], η = y0 − α, and r = y1 − y0 is an individual-level causal effect.
    We also define potential treatment status indexed against the instrument, z.            Potential
treatment status is   dz1   when the instrument is switched on and      dz0   when the instrument is
switched off. The variables dz1 and dz0 are superscripted to signal the fact that they are tied to
z. Observed treatment status is
                                        d = dz0 + (dz1 − dz0 )z,

or in random-coefficients notation
                                           d = γ + pz + υ,

where γ = E[dz0 ], υ = dz0 − γ, and p = dz1 − dz0 .

                                                      3
    IV using z as an instrument for the effect of d on y with no covariates is the (1940) Wald
estimator. The Wald estimand can be interpreted as the effect of d on those whose treatment
status can be changed by the instrument. Assuming, as we do here, that the instrument can only
make treatment move in one direction (say, make treatment more likely), those whose treatment
status is changed by z have dz1 = 1 and dz0 = 0. The causal effect on this group is called the
local average treatment effect (LATE; Imbens and Angrist, 1994). Formally, we have:

Assumption 1 (LATE) (a) Independence and Exclusion: (y1 , y0 , dz1 , dz0 ) q z.
    (b) First-stage: E[dz1 − dz0 ] 6= 0 and 0 < P[z = 1] < 1.
    (c) Monotonicity: dz1 ≥ dz0 a.s., or vice versa.

Theorem 1 (LATE) Under Assumption 1

             E[y | z = 1] − E[y | z = 0]
                                         = E[y1 − y0 | dz1 > dz0 ] = E[r | p > 0] := ∆z .
             E[d | z = 1] − E[d | z = 0]

    Proof. See Imbens and Angrist (1994).
    As noted by Angrist, Imbens, and Rubin (1996), the LATE framework partitions the pop-
ulation exposed to an instrument into a set of three instrument-dependent subgroups. These
subgroups are defined by the way people react to the instrument:

Definition 1 (subgroups defined by instrument z) (a) z-Compliers. The subpopulation
with dz1 = 1 and dz0 = 0.
    (b) z-Always-takers. The subpopulation with dz1 = dz0 = 1.
    (c) z-Never-takers. The subpopulation with dz1 = dz0 = 0.

    LATE using z as an instrument is the effect of treatment on the population of z-compliers.


3     Covariate Heterogeneity

3.1    Two instruments for one effect

The relationship between fertility and labor supply has long been of interest to labor economists,
while the case for omitted variables bias in this context is clear: mothers with weak labor force
attachment or low earnings potential may be more likely to have children than mothers with
strong labor force attachment or high earnings potential. This makes the observed association
between family size and employment hard to interpret since mothers who have big families may
have worked less anyway. Angrist and Evans (1998) solve this omitted-variables problem using
two instrumental variables, both of which lend themselves to Wald-type estimation strategies.


                                                  4
    The first Wald estimator uses twin births, an instrument for the effects of family size intro-
duced by Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1980). The twins instrument in Angrist and Evans (1998)
is a dummy for a multiple second birth in a sample of mothers with at least two children. The
twins first-stage is about .6, an estimate reported here in column 2 of Table 1.       This means
that 40 percent of mothers with two or more children would have had a third birth anyway;
a multiple third birth increases this proportion to 1. The twins instrument rests on the idea
that the occurrence of a multiple birth is essentially random, unrelated to potential outcomes or
demographic characteristics, and that a multiple birth affects labor supply solely by increasing
fertility.
    The second Wald estimator in Table 1 uses a dummy for same-sex sibling pairs as an in-
strument.    This is motivated by the fact that American parents with two children are more
likely to have a third child if the first two are same-sex than if sex-composition is mixed. This
is illustrated in column 4 of Table 1, which shows that parents of same-sex siblings are about
6 percentage points more likely to have a third birth than those with a mixed-sex sibship (the
probability of a third birth among parents with a mixed-sex sibship is .38). Internal validity of
the same-sex instrument rests on the claim that sibling sex composition is essentially random
and affects labor supply solely by increasing fertility.
    Twins and sex-composition IV estimates both suggest that the birth of a third child has a
substantial effect on weeks worked and employment. Wald estimates using twins instruments
show a precisely-estimated reduction in weeks worked of a little over 3 weeks, with an employ-
ment reduction of about .08. These results, which appear in column 3 of Table 1, are smaller in
absolute value than the corresponding OLS estimates reported in column 1 (the latter include a
set of controls listed in the table). This suggests the OLS estimates are exaggerated by selection
bias.    Interestingly, however, Wald estimates constructed using a same-sex dummy, reported
in column 5, are larger in magnitude than the twins estimates.         The juxtaposition of twins
and sex-composition instruments suggests that different instruments need not generate similar
estimates of causal effects even if both instruments are valid.
    The last column of Table 1 reports 2SLS estimates of childbearing using both twins and same-
sex instruments, along with the associated overidentification test statistic. The overidentifica-
tion test statistic generates p-values of .02 and .06, implying that the twins and sex-composition
IV estimates are at least marginally significantly different from one another.
    Twins and samesex IV estimates reflect behavior in different compliant subpopulations. To
see this, let x be a Bernoulli-distributed characteristic, say a dummy indicating college graduates.
Are sex-composition compliers more or less likely to be college graduates than other women with




                                                 5
two children? This question is answered by the following calculation:

        P[x = 1 | dz1 > dz0 ]   P[dz1 > dz0 | x = 1]   E[d | z = 1, x = 1] − E[d | z = 0, x = 1]
                              =         z      z     =                                           ,
            P[x = 1]                P[d1 > d0 ]               E[d | z = 1] − E[d | z = 0]

where the second equality follows by Bayes rule. In other words, the relative likelihood a z-
complier is a college graduate is given by the ratio of the first stage for college graduates to the
overall first stage.
   This calculation is illustrated in Table 2, which reports compliers’ characteristics ratios for
the age of the second-born and mothers schooling as described by dummies for high school
graduates, mothers with some college, and college graduates. Twins compliers have younger
second-born children, reflecting the fact that few women who had their second child recently
will have had time to have a third child. The birth of a third child in this group is therefore
especially likely to have been caused by a multiple pregnancy. This is important because the
birth of a third child may matter less if the second child is also young, helping to explain the
finding that twins-IV estimates are smaller than samesex estimates (Gelbach 2002 suggests the
presence of a child younger than age 5 in the household is a key labor supply mediator).
   Twins compliers are also more likely to be college graduates than the average mother, while
sex-composition compliers are less educated. This fact also helps to explain the smaller 2SLS
estimates generated by twins instruments, since Angrist and Evans (1998) show that the labor
supply consequences of childbearing decline with mother’s schooling.
   A general method for constructing the mean or other features of the distribution of covariates
for compliers uses Abadie’s (2003) kappa-weighting scheme. A consequence of Theorem 3.1 in
Abadie (2003) is that
                                                         E[κz (x) x]
                                     E[x | d1 > d0 ] =               ,                               (2)
                                                          E[κz (x)]
where
                                             d(1 − z)           (1 − d)z
                        κz (x) = 1 −                       −                 .
                                       1 − P[z = 1 | x = x] P[z = 1 | x = x]
Intuitively, this works because, as Abadie shows, the weighting function, κz (x), “finds compliers,”
even though it is not a simple indicator for compliers. Estimates of E[x | d1 > d0 ] for age of
second child and mothers education are reported in the last two rows of Table 2. These estimates
show a marked difference in the average second child age and a small difference in schooling.
The latter result is due to the fact that the main difference between the schooling of twins and
samesex compliers is in the proportion of college graduates. Relatively few of the women in the
high-fertility 1980 census sample used to construct these estimates were college graduates.




                                                    6
3.2     Covariates and Extrapolation

Covariates play two roles in our analysis. First, they may be necessary for identification. For
example, we might like to control for race and maternal age when using twins instruments since
the probability of multiple births varies by race and increases with maternal age. Second, we
propose to use covariates for extrapolation. Specifically, we argue that in some cases, including
the twins and samesex comparison, variation in causal effects across covariate cells is sufficient
to explain differences between IV estimates.
    The foundation of our analysis with covariates is a conditional independence assumption.
This assumption express the idea that we think of the instrumental variables as being “as good
as randomly assigned,” conditional on covariates, x. This generalizes Assumption 1:

Assumption 2 (Conditional LATE) (a) Independence and Exclusion: (y1 , y0 , dz1 , dz0 )qz | x
a.s.;
    (b) First-stage: E[dz1 − dz0 | x] 6= 0 and 0 < P[z = 1 | x] < 1 a.s.
    (c) Monotonicity: P[dz1 ≥ dz0 | x] = 1 a.s., or P[dz1 ≤ dz0 | x] = 1 a.s.

    For each value of x, we define covariate-specific LATE constructed using z, as

                                  ∆z (x) := E[y1 − y0 | dz1 > dz0 , x = x].                       (3)

As noted by Frolich (2007), when conditioning is required for identification, unconditional LATE
can be constructed by averaging ∆z (x):
                                                      Z
                  z           z
                 ∆    = E[∆ (x) |    > dz1    dz0 ]
                                            = ∆z (x)dFx (x | dz1 > dz0 )
                        Z
                                 E[d | z = 1, x = x] − E[d | z = 0, x = x]
                      =   ∆z (x)                                           dFx (x),
                                        E[d | z = 1] − E[d | z = 0]
where Fx (· | dz1 > dz0 ) is the distribution of x for z-compliers and Fx (·) is the distribution of x
in the population.
    We first show how to construct causal effects such as the effect on the treated, E[y1 − y0 |
d = 1], from ∆z (x). This is possible because we assume heterogeneity in causal effects across
instruments is due entirely to changes in the observable characteristics of compliers. Specifically,
we start with:

Assumption 3 (CEI) Conditional Effect Ignorability for an instrument z:

                             E[y1 − y0 | dz1 , dz0 , x] = E[y1 − y0 |x] a.s.

    A sufficient condition for CEI is

                                             y1 = y0 + g(x) + ν,

                                                          7
where g(x) is any function and ν is mean-independent of (dz1 , dz0 ) conditional on x. In other
words, heterogeneity in average causal effects is solely due to observed covariates.2
       To see what this means in a latent-index specification, suppose

                                                d = 1[hz (x, z) > η]

where η is a random factor involving unobserved costs and benefits of d assumed to be in-
dependent of z conditional on x. This latent-index model characterizes potential treatment
assignments as:
                                dz0 = 1[hz (x, 0) > η] and dz1 = 1[hz (x, 1) > η].

The associated model for potential outcomes is

                                                y0 = g0 (x) + ²0 ,
                                                y1 = g1 (x) + ²1 .

The errors are mean independent of the covariates and instrument. Assuming hz (x, 1) ≥ hz (x, 0)
a.s., conditional LATE can be written

  ∆z (x) = E[y1 − y0 | x, hz (x, 1) > η > hz (x, 0)] = g1 (x) − g0 (x) + E[²1 − ²0 | x, dz1 > dz0 ]. (4)

The CEI assumption says that ²1 − ²0 is mean independent of (dz1 , dz0 ) conditional on x, so that
(4) simplifies to
                                         E[y1 − y0 | x] = g1 (x) − g0 (x).

       In the language of Rubin (1977), CEI is a kind of ignorability assumption for treatment
effects. Given ignorability, you might wonder why we need be concerned about selection bias in
the first place. Under CEI, selection bias arises due to correlation between η and ²0 . Alterna-
tively, a latent-index specification compatible with the CEI sets ²j = θ + ξj where θ is correlated
with η but ξj is not. In a latent index formulation of the assignment mechanism, CEI rules out
Roy (1951)-type selection into treatment. In other words, η is assumed to be independent of
unobserved gains, denoted by ²1 − ²0 in the latent-index specification. CEI does not rule out
selection bias, but it eliminates an important source of heterogeneity in average causal effects.3
Although the empirical importance of Roy selection has yet to be established, the Roy model
is an important econometric benchmark. Here, however, we focus on an effort to manage the
treatment effect heterogeneity driven by observable characteristics.
   2
       This is a conditional-on-covariates version of Restriction 2 in Angrist (2004) and is similar to the Frangakis
and Rubin (2002) notion of principal stratification, which isolates covariate-defined subpopulations where selection
bias is likely to minimal.
   3
     A fact noted by many authors working with models of this type; see, e.g., Vella and Verbeek,1999


                                                           8
   The latent-index specification can be used to formulate a structural justification for the CEI
assumption in our empirical application. Start by combining the assumptions of Olsen (1980)
and Vytlacil (2002):

                        E[²1 − ²0 | η, x] = ρ(x)η       and η | x, z ∼ U (0, 1).

Conditional LATE then becomes

                 ∆z (x) = g1 (x) − g0 (x) + ρ(x)E[η | hz (x, 1) > η > hz (x, 0), x]
                         = g1 (x) − g0 (x) + ρ(x)[hz (x, 1) + hz (x, 0)]/2.

For each x = x, CEI therefore turns on whether ρ(x) = 0. Following Imbens and Newey (2009),
assume that treatment (fertility) decisions are based on a comparison of predicted benefits and
costs of childbearing. Specifically, women choose to have a third child if

                       1[hz (x, z) > η] = 1{λ(x)E[y1 − y0 | x, η] > c(x, z)},

where λ(x) is the weight given to outcome gaps, c(x, z) is the expected cost of having a third
child, the instrument, z, is a cost shifter independent of potential outcomes, and η is private
information about y1 − y0 , orthogonal to x. Then ρ(x) is small (close to zero) when either λ(x)
is small, i.e., labor supply consequences are of little import; or η matters little given x, e.g., for
women with a young second-born that are already at home or for relatively educated women
who can more easily afford to pay for child care. This offers a possible explanation for why
CEI might be satisfied for women with some characteristics but not for others. We consider
econometric models where CEI is partially satisfied in Section 3.4.


3.3   Reweighting LATE

Our covariate-based strategy reweights treatment effects across covariates cells. This is similar
to matching estimators designed to control for selection bias; such estimators reweight the
conditional mean function for outcome variables to identify causal effects when identification
is based on a selection-on-observables story (see, e.g. Hahn, 1998). In this case, however, we
rely on instrumental variables to control for selection bias, while using covariates to manage
treatment-effect heterogeneity.

Theorem 2 (LATE-Reweight) Let z be an instrument that satisfy Assumption 3 and let
sz = s(dz0 , dz1 , z) be an indicator for any subpopulation defined by z. For example, for z-compliers,
we have sz = dz1 − dz0 , for the treated sz = (1 − z)dz0 + zdz1 = d, for the non-treated sz =
(1 − z)(1 − dz0 ) + z(1 − dz1 ) = 1 − d, and for the entire population sz = 1. Under Assumption 2


                                                    9
and E[|y|] < ∞,
                                                                    Z
                              z               z         z
                E[y1 − y0 | s = 1] = E[∆ (x) | s = 1] =                 ∆z (x)dFx (x | sz = 1).

This is                                   Z
                                              ∆z (x)ωsz (x)dFx (x),
                                                       R
where ωsz (x) = P[sz = 1 | x = x]/P[sz = 1] and             ωsz (x)dFx (x) = 1.

   Proof. By the law of iterated expectations

E[y1 −y0 | sz = 1] = E[E[y1 −y0 | sz = 1, x] | sz = 1] = E[E[y1 −y0 | x] | sz = 1] = E[∆z (x) | sz = 1],

where the second and third equalities follow from CEI. By the Bayes rule
                      Z                           Z
                         ∆ (x)dFx (x | s = 1) = ∆z (x)ωsz (x)dFx (x),
                           z             z



where ωsz (x) = P[sz = 1 | x = x]/P[sz = 1] and
                      Z
                        ωsz (x)dFx (x) = E{P[sz = 1 | x = x]}/P[sz = 1] = 1,

by the law of iterated expectations.
   The LATE-Reweight theorem allows us to go from LATE to the population average treatment
effect (ATE), the effect of treatment on the treated (TOT), and the effect of treatment on the
non-treated (TNT). The relevant weighting functions, ωsz (x), can be written in terms of observed
variables as:
                         z           E[d | z = 1, x = x] − E[d | z = 0, x = x]
                        ω∆ (x) =                                                                  (5)
                                            E[d | z = 1] − E[d | z = 0]
for effects on z-compliers;
                                      ωTz OT (x) = E[d | x = x]/E[d]                              (6)

for effects on the treated;

                                  ωTz N T (x) = E[1 − d | x = x]/E[1 − d]                         (7)

for effects on the non-treated; and
                                                   z
                                                  ωAT E (x) = 1                                   (8)

3.4   Overidentification

Differences in the observable characteristics of twins and samesex compliers may explain the
difference between the Wald estimates constructed using these two instruments. If so, we can
reweight covariate-specific LATEs to go from one to the other. To see this, assume that two
instruments z and w are available. The difference between the LATE generated by each can be
decomposed as
                     Z                                        Z
          z     w            z    w        z
        ∆ −∆ =           [∆ (x) − ∆   (x)]ω∆ (x)dFx (x)   +        ∆w (x)[ω∆
                                                                           z        w
                                                                             (x) − ω∆ (x)]dFx (x).    (9)

The first term reflects differences in conditional LATEs between z- compliers and w- compliers,
while the second term captures differences in complier characteristics. If z and w satisfy CEI,
the following compatibility condition holds

                                          ∆w (x) = ∆z (x) a.s.                                       (10)

and the first term of the decomposition (9) is zero. In other words, joint CEI implies that
the difference between LATEs is driven solely by differences in the observed characteristics of
compliers (the covariate vector x is assumed to be observed). The following theorem shows
that under joint CEI we can use the distribution of compliers for a hypothetical instrument
to construct the treatment effects that might be generated by instruments other than the ones
we’ve got.

Theorem 3 (LATE-Overid) Let z and w be two instruments that satisfy Assumptions 2 and
3. Let ∆w (x) be defined as in (3) using the instrument w. Let sw = s(dw    w
                                                                       0 , d1 , w) be an indi-
cator for any subpopulation defined by instrument w with corresponding treatment assignments
(dw    w
  0 , d1 ). If E[|y|] < ∞,
                                      Z                                Z
                             w             w
              E[y1 − y0 | s = 1] =        ∆    (x)ωsw (x)dFx (x)   =       ∆z (x)ωsw (x)dFx (x).     (11)

   Proof. The first equality in equation (11) follows from Theorem 2 applied to w. For the
second equality, the law of iterated expectations and CEI for z give

              E[y1 − y0 | sw = 1] = E[E[y1 − y0 | x] | sw = 1] = E[∆z (x) | sw = 1].

The result then follows by Bayes rule.
   The LATE-Overid theorem allows us to determine whether differences in the distribution
of complier covariates are enough to explain differences in IV estimates across instruments. If
so, it seems fair to say that the underlying covariate-specific results have predictive value for
populations with these covariate values and therefore some claim to external validity.

                                                    11
    Joint CEI also implies that the conditional LATEs ∆z (x) are overidentified if we observe both
z and w. We can therefore construct more precise estimators for conditional LATEs with cell-
by-cell GMM procedures that use both z and w to form moment conditions. Moreover, GMM
overidentification tests can be used to statistically assess the LATE compatibility condition (10).
Comparisons of estimates of the two expressions on the RHS of (11) can also serve as a test of
compatibility.
    In practice, of course, covariates need not account fully for the difference between two LATEs.
For some covariate values there may be a good match, while for others CEI fails. A rationale
for partial fulfillment of CEI was given in our latent-index example. In this context, partial
CEI is like saying that some types of women select on gains while others do not. The values
for which CEI is satisfied define a population for which heterogeneous treatment effects can be
understood to be solely a function of observable characteristics. For this population, we can
define an average causal effect for which the predictive value of IV estimates is likely to be
especially high.

Definition 2 (CATE) The Compatible Average Treatment effect is
                           Z
                     ∆z,w = ∆z (x)dFx (x | ∆z (x) = ∆w (x)).

    If the compatibility condition ∆z (x) = ∆w (x) holds for all values of x, CATE is ATE. But
if compatibility holds only for some values of x, CATE is ATE for the population defined by
these values.    Below, we develop an estimator for CATE when the compatibility condition is
only partially satisfied.


4    Estimation and Inference
We assume the effects of interest are to be estimated in a random sample of size n.

Assumption 4 (Sampling) {ri = (yi , di , xi , zi , wi ), i = 1, . . . , n} are i.i.d. observations from
r = (y, d, x, z, w).

    We also assume that the covariates x take on a finite and fixed number of values. The
education and age covariates in the empirical example satisfy this condition. Generalization to
continuous covariates seems straightforward, but requires additional technical machinery. For
example, it seems likely that with continuous covariates, we’d like to allow for a gradual failure
of CEI as opposed to discrete cutoffs. We therefore leave this extension for future work.

Assumption 5 (Discrete covariates) For a finite set X = {x1 , ..., xK }, P[x ∈ X ] = 1.


                                                  12
   The effects in Theorems 2 and 3 can be written as follows:

                   ∆lsu = E[∆l (x)ωsu (x)], ωsu (x) = P[su = 1 | x = x]/P[su = 1],

where l = u = z for Theorem 2, and l = z and u = w or vice versa for Theorem 3. More
generally, the superscript l indexes the population where conditional LATEs are obtained and
su is an indicator for the population with the distribution of covariate characteristics of interest,
defined using instrument u.
   Estimation is straightforward in our finite dimensional setting. We replace expectations E
and probabilities P by empirical analogs En and Pn . For conditional expectations and probabil-
ities, let En [· | x = x, u = u] and Pn [· | x = x, u = u] denote empirical analogs in the covariate
cell where x = x and u = u (or for everyone in the covariate cell if we don’t condition on u), for
u ∈ {z, w} and u ∈ {z, w}. This gives

                ∆          ˆ l (xi )ω̂ u (xi )], ω̂ u (x) = Pn [su = 1 | x = x]/Pn [su = 1],
                ˆ lu = En [∆                                                                          (12)
                  s                   s            s             i                   i

      ˆ l (x) is any consistent estimator of ∆l (x). For example, ∆
where ∆                                                           ˆ l (x) can be the Wald estimator
with instrument l ∈ {z, w} in cell x = x, or the GMM estimator using both z and w as
instruments in cell x = x. For treated, non-treated, and the entire population, the indicator sui
is observed and so construction of the empirical ω̂su (x) is straightforward.            For compliers, we
can estimate ωsu (x) using the sample analog of equation (5):

                 u         En [di | u = 1, x = x] − En [di | u = 0, x = x]
               ω̂∆ (x) =                                                   , u ∈ {z, w}.              (13)
                                   En [di | u = 1] − En [di | u = 0]

               ˆ lu follows from the law of large numbers and the Slutsky theorem.
Consistency of ∆ s


Theorem 4 (Consistency) Let z and w be two instruments that satisfy Assumptions 2 and
3. Under Assumptions 4 and 5, and E[|y|] < ∞

                   ˆ l (x) are any consistent estimators of ωsu (x) and ∆l (x), for all x ∈ X .
where ω̂su (x) and ∆

   The estimators developed here are smooth functions of GMM-type estimators and are there-
fore asymptotically normal under standard regularity conditions. The following result uses
the delta method to characterize the relevant limiting distributions. In particular, we show
      ˆ zu , ∆
that (∆      ˆ wu ) are asymptotically jointly normal, what allows us to draw inferences about the
        s      s
effects of interest and to test some of the implications of joint CEI. Let pk = P(x = xk ),
ϑus (x) = P[su = 1 | x = x], i.e., the numerator of ωsu (x), and ϑ̂us (x) be an estimator of ϑus (x).

    It’s worth noting that the joint normality assumption for the components of our reweighting
estimators holds under standard regularity conditions. In particular, this follows for the esti-
mators of the weighting function by the CLT for binary sequences. For IV, GMM, and other

                                                                       14
moment-based estimators of the conditional LATEs, such as generalized empirical likelihood
(GEL), the existence of second moments, i.e., E[y2 ] < ∞, is sufficient.
      Note also that the first term in the expressions for Vszu , Vswu , and Cszw
                                                                                u reflects sampling
variation due to the estimation of the covariate cell probabilities, pk , and the weighting functions,
whereas the second term arises from the estimation of the conditional LATEs. The first term is
zero if, for example, the conditional LATEs are constant, i.e., ∆l (x) = ∆lsu for all x ∈ X .
      In practice, there are two routes to asymptotic inference. We can estimate the asymptotic dis-
tributions analytically using sample analogs or approximate them numerically using resampling
or simulation methods. We use bootstrap methods in the empirical application. Resampling
methods are convenient and save us from having to estimate complicated analytical formulas
for the asymptotic variances and covariances. Consistency of the bootstrap approximation to
the distributions of our reweighting estimators follows from Hall and Horowitz (1996), Hahn
(1996), and Brown and Newey (2002) theorems for GMM, and application of the delta method
for bootstrap (see, e.g., Theorem 23.5 in van der Vaart, 1998).
      There are many ways to bootstrap. We use the empirical likelihood (EL) bootstrap proposed
by Brown and Newey (2002) for GMM estimators. This method resamples from the empirical
likelihood distribution (ELD) that imposes the moment conditions in the sample, instead of from
the empirical distribution (ED). Let E[g(r, θ)] = 0 be the moment conditions that define the
conditional LATEs, weighting functions and effects of interest, where θ includes all the unknown
parameters. The ELD (π̂1 , ..., π̂n ) is the solution to
                                    n
                                    X                     n

                                                                                     X
                        max               ln(πi ), s.t.         πi g(ri , θ̂) = 0,         πi = 1, πi ≥ 0,
                       π1 ,...,πn

where θ̂ is the EL or another consistent estimator of θ.4 ELD is therefore the closest to ED in
terms of Kullback-Leibler distance. ELD and ED are equal in exactly identified models, but they
generally differ under overidentification. In practice, the difference between the EL bootstrap
and the standard nonparametric bootstrap is that the EL bootstrap resamples from the data
with probabilities π̂i instead of 1/n.
   Consistent estimation of CATE requires that we condition on the unobservable events {∆z (x) =
                                          ˆ z (x) = ∆
∆w (x)}. In finite samples, we never have ∆         ˆ w (x). We therefore use cell-by-cell overi-
dentification tests to find compatible values of x. Instead of discarding cells that fail the iden-
tification test for some small significance level, we reweight estimates of conditional LATE by a
decreasing function of the overidentification test statistic. Letting J(x) denote the overidenti-
fication test statistic for the instruments z and w in the cell x = x, the resulting estimator of

        ∆           is the GMM estimate in cell x = x that uses z and w as instruments or any
other moment estimator (such as 2SLS), and an (x) is a sequence such that an (x) → ∞ and
an (x) = o(n), for x ∈ X .
   The sequences an (x) guarantee the consistency of the reweighting estimator (14) for CATE.
These sequences play a role similar to the penalty terms used in Andrews (1999) to obtain
consistent model selection procedures for GMM estimators. To formally establish consistency,
it is convenient to introduce additional notation. Let X0 = {x ∈ X : ∆z (x) = ∆w (x)} denote
the set of covariate values that satisfy the compatibility condition, with complement X̄0 = {x ∈
X : ∆z (x) 6= ∆w (x)}.

ing. As with the reweighting estimators in Theorem 5, the limiting distribution of ∆
on the limiting distributions of the weighting functions. But here, the limiting distribution of
ω̂CAT E (x) converges at nonstandard rates, complicating the analysis. Slow convergence in this
case is a by-product of the need for a term like an (x) in the weighting function to ensure consis-
                                                                     √
tency and the fact that in practice we choose this to be slower than n. 5 Moreover, convergence
to the limiting distribution cannot be uniform in the data generating process because the CATE
estimator implicitly conditions on a pretest (see, e.g., Leeb and Potscher, 2008). In a related
setting, Andrews and Guggenberger (2009) deal with a pretest problem using subsampling, but
subsampling is imprecise in our application due to small cell sizes. We have no easy solution
in this case other than to caution that convergence to the relevant limiting distribution may be
slow and to conjecture the pointwise validity of bootstrap methods.
        A second and less serious inference complication arises from the fact that the EL bootstrap
imposes CEI at all covariate values, while the purpose of CATE is to allow deviations from CEI.
In the empirical application, therefore, we supplement the standard errors obtained from the EL
bootstrap with standard errors obtained by a nonparametric bootstrap that does not impose
the compatibility conditions on the bootstrap DGP.


5        Results
Our empirical exploration of covariate-reweighting focuses on a categorical representation of
second child age and mother’s schooling. As we’ve seen, these covariates are strongly related
to compliance probabilities. On one hand, a younger second child in the household reduces the
likelihood of a third birth, if only because less time has passed since the birth of the second.
Education matters because college-educated women are less likely to choose to have a third child
than less-educated women. Multiple pregnancies are therefore more important for women with
a young second-born and for women with some college and college degrees.                    Sex-composition
compliers, by contrast, are relatively unlikely to be college graduates or to have a third child
soon after the birth of the second.           Labor supply effects are also likely to vary with second
child age and mother’s schooling.             The birth of a third child has little effect on the work
behavior of a woman with a young second-born who is at home already anyway.                         Likewise,
a relatively educated woman should be affected less by the birth of a child than other women
because, for women earning higher wages, it makes sense to pay for child care in the market.

        As in Crump, Hotz, Imbens, and Mitnik (2009), we could simplify here by doing inference conditional on
the sample. We do not take this route because we’re interested in predictive population inference as opposed to
sample-specific causal inference.

Differences in twins and samesex complier populations might therefore account for the fact that
twins instruments generate a smaller effect of childbearing than sex-composition instruments.
   In effort to see whether this conjecture is substantiated empirically, Table 3 reports IV
estimates in each of 12 cells defined by second child age and mother’s schooling. The age
categories are: less than or equal to 4 years, greater than 4 and less than or equal to 8, older
than 8. The schooling categories are: high school dropout, high school graduate, some college,
and college graduate. The first column of the table reports the probability mass function in the
contingency table generated by these categories. The next two columns describe the distribution
of covariates for the treated and untreated, relative to the entire population. Women who do
and don’t have a third child are clearly very different.
   Not surprisingly, IV estimates are fairly noisy across cells, as can be seen in columns 4 and 6
of Table 3. From these noisy cell-by-cell estimates alone, it’s hard to tell how the causal effect
of a third birth varies with individual characteristics. A clearer pattern emerges, however, once
the cells are “weighted-up,” a point we return to in Table 4.
   Table 3 also reports estimates of

                                                P[sz = 1 | x = x]
                                    ωsz (x) =                     ,
                                                    P[sz = 1]

the weighting function for twins compliers (column 5) and samesex compliers (column 7). This
is just the ratio of the relevant first stage in the cell to the overall first stage. The distribution
of twins and samesex compliers over cells is clearly different from the cell distribution in the
random sample.      Not surprisingly, given the summary comparisons in Table 2, the complier
distributions for the two instruments are also very different from each other. Specifically, twins
compliers are much more likely to have a young second-born child, while few samesex compliers
are in this group. Twins compliers are also relatively educated, while the schooling gradient in
compliance probabilities for samesex is less pronounced.
   Reweighting covariate-specific samesex IV estimates using twin-complier weights brings these
estimates much closer to the IV estimate using twins instruments. This can be seen in the first
two rows of Table 4, which report

                   ∆lsu = E[∆l (x)ωsu (x)], ωsu (x) = P[su = 1 | x = x]/P[su = 1],

for l = u = twins and l = samesex and u = twins. Compare, for example, the estimates of
effects on weeks worked of -3.15 using twins instruments and -2.71 using samesex instruments.
Reweighting covariate-specific twins and samesex estimates using samesex weights also produces
a good match. Compare, in this case, the estimate of -6.3 using samesex instruments to an
estimate of -5.08 using twins instruments. In other words, the IV estimates generated using


                                                   18
twins and samesex instruments can indeed be effectively reconciled by reweighting covariate-
specific effects using a set of common weights.
    This is an encouraging finding which suggests that external validity is an attainable goal
in this context. On the other hand, Table 4 also shows that ATE and TOT using twins and
samesex instruments are not well-matched. This is disappointing because, by the same argument
that appears to reconcile twins and samesex estimates of LATE, we should be able to generate
similar estimates of ATE and TOT using either instrument to construct cell-specific IV estimates
(the estimators for ATE and TOT apply a common set of weights to the underlying set of IV
estimates). The match for TNT is not bad as that for ATE and TOT. The fact that some
parameters can be more easily matched across instruments than others suggests that a few
poorly matched cells are what drives the cross-instrument imbalance in estimates of ATE and
TOT, i.e., that a handful of cells generate different estimates depending on the instrument.
    CATE, at the bottom of Table 4, solves this problem, and produces a good match for
the average treatment effect in compatible cells by downweighting cells where CEI is most at
odds with the data. Compare CATE estimates of -3.80 to -3.66 for effects on weeks worked
and -.099 to -.095 for effects on employment. The estimates of CATE reported in Table 4 set
an (x) = log n(x)/K, where n(x) is the number of individuals with x = x and K is the number of
covariate cells. This relatively slow normalization works well in our application because the cell-
level over-identification test is never very large. Still, by applying the most weight to cells where
CEI appears to be satisfied, CATE generates remarkably similar estimates of the population
ATE, whether the underlying cell-level IV estimates use twins or samesex instruments.
    The match generated by CATE weighting is for a subpopulation and not a random sample.
Figure 1 describes the compatible subpopulation by plotting the weighting functions used by
different estimators.   CATE weights essentially discard the two low-education cell for women
with an older second-born, and look a lot like the histogram for twins compliers. Because twins
instruments induce one-sided non-compliance, the population of twins compliers is the same as
the nontreated population (Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser, 2010). The population for which IV
estimates of the effects of childbearing have predictive value therefore consists mainly of mothers
who have a young second-born child and are somewhat more likely to have gone to college.


6    Summary and Directions for Further Work
In the LATE framework, differences in IV estimates no longer signal a failure of the exclusion
restriction. Rather, these differences may be attributable to differences in the sort of people
who are affected by the underlying experiments implicit in any IV identification strategy. At
the same time, we’d very much like to use one set of IV estimates to predict causal effects in


                                                  19
settings other than the one generating the estimates. The question of external validity turns on
our ability to do this reliably.
   Here, we begin with the idea that differences in IV estimates of LATE for the same causal
relation might be driven by a combination of treatment-effect heterogeneity across covariate
cells and differences in covariate distributions for instrument-specific compliant subpopulations.
Limiting heterogeneity across cells and instruments to be a function solely of observed character-
istics, we can reweight one set of IV estimates to generate effects for compliant subpopulations
other than the one defined by the instrument at hand. This approach turns out to do a good job
of explaining why twins instruments produce smaller estimates of the labor supply consequences
of childbearing than do sex composition instruments in the Angrist-Evans (1998) data set.
   The CEI assumption that lies at the heart of our approach rules out Roy (1951)-type selection
into treatment on the basis of outcome gains. “No Roy selection” is unlikely to be compelling in
many settings; gain-driven selection motivates a wide range of theoretical discussions of causal
effects in labor economics and other applied micro fields (see, e.g., Rosen and Willis, 1979, for
a Roy model of schooling). At the same time, it seems hard to argue with the idea that any
analysis of treatment-effect heterogeneity ought to at least begin with effect variation that is
associated with the characteristics we observe.
   In an effort to bridge the gap between heterogeneity associated with observed characteristics
and latent gains, we have also explored an approach that allows for some covariate values to sat-
isfy our CEI assumption, while others, perhaps only a few, do not. This idea seems to work well
in our application, generating, for example, remarkably similar estimates of population average
treatment effects using twins and samesex instruments when the sample is reweighted towards
cells that appear to satisfy CEI. At the same time, we acknowledge that such brazen pretesting
induces a complicated limiting distribution that we have not yet succeeded in characterizing
and that may not always be useful for applied work. The development of robust and convenient
inference procedures for CATE-type estimators seems a natural direction for further work on
the external validity of IV estimates.

Note: The table reports OLS, Wald, and 2SLS estimates of the effects of a third birth on labor supply using twins and sex
composition instruments. Data are from the Angrist and Evans (1998) extract including women aged 21-35 with at least two
children in the 1980 census. OLS models include controls for mother’s age, age at first birth, ages of the first two children, and
dummies for race. The first stage is the same for all dependent variables. The sample size is 394,840.
