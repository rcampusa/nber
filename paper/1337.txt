                           Equilibrium Wage Distributions

                                      ABSTRACT


      This paper analyzes equilibrium in labor markets with costly search.
 Even in steady state equilibrium, identical labor may receive different
 wages; this may be the case even when the only source of imperfect
 information is the inequality of wages which the market is perpetuating.
 When there are information imperfections arising from (symmetric)
differences in non-pecuniary characteristics of jobs and preferences of
individuals, there will not in general exist a full employment, zero profit
single wage equilibrium.


      There are, in general, a multiplicity of equilbria. Equilibrium may be
characterized by unemployment; in spite of the presence of an excess supply
of labor, no firm is willing to hire workers at a lower wage. It knows that
if it does so, the quit rate will be higher, and hence turnover costs (training
costs) will be higher, so much so that profits will actually be lower. The
model thus provides a rationale for real wage rigidity. The model also
provides a theory of equilibrium frictional unemployment.


     Though the constrained optimality (taking explicitly into account the
costs associated with obtaining information and search) may entail
unemployment and wage dispersion, the levels of unemployment and wage
dispersion in the market equilibrium will not, in general, be (constrained)
optimaL

1.     Introduction

       The observation that different firms pay different prices for what

appears to be the same commodity or pay different wages for what appears to

be equivalent labor has long been explained in economics by a      reference to
"imperfect   information." This paper is concerned with characterizing market

equilibrium with imperfect information. We do not present a general theory;

rather, we develop in some detail an example of importance in its own right——

imperfect    information in the labor market.   Several   properties of our example,
in   particular, the existence of equilibria with price (wage) dispersion, i.m—
employment (excess supply of labor), positive profits (excess demand for labor),
multiple equilibria and the non—optimality of some or all of the equilibria,
we believe are of more general validity; other results may not be.
      This paper is concerned with two kinds of imperfect information:
    (a) Individuals may not know the wage paid in any particular firm, or
whether there is a vacancy in any particular firm, until they apply for a job.1

extended discussion of the two—sector model briefly discussed in Section 5.3
below.

       (b)   There are a number of characteristics besides the wage rate asso-

ciated with any job which are important to the individual. Some, like the

normal length of a work week, become known when the individual applies for

the job; information about other characteristics (e.g., personalities of

colleagues) is acquired only gradually.

       There is one important difference between the two kinds of imperfect

information: there is a return to natching individuals up with jobs that

suit them in any economic system. There will be imperfect information of

this   sort so long as individuals and jobs differ. On the other hand, the
imperfect information resulting from wage dispersion is a kind of imperfect
information   generated by the market itself. In    particular, a socialist
economy could, if it chose, simply pay a uniform wage for identical labor.
We   are used to thinking   of markets as serving a useful function in conveying

information, e.g., about demands and    supplies,   Our analysis suggests that,

under certain conditions, the market may, in effect, unnecessarily "create"

imperfections   of information which, not surprisingly, may turn out to be
quite costly.
       There are two problems in constructing an equilibrium odel with imper-
fect information: first, how do we prevent the eventual accumulation of
information? If individuals were infinitely lived, and jobs never changed,
eventually, through search,2 everyone would find the job which most suited
him. "Imperfect information" would only characterize the niarket in the short
run. In the discussion below, we maintain a "continual flow of ignorance"
through a continual flow of new entrants into the labor force and a flow of
deaths out of it.3 This "flow of ignorance" is just large enough to offset
                                     —3--




 the "flow of knowledge" resulting from search behavior, and   an   equilibrium
 with imperfect information is sustained.
      The second problem is, how do we induce different firms to pay different
 wages?   That is, imperfect information may explain why individuals pay a

 price for a commodity which is in excess of the lowest
                                                          price being charged
 in the market, or why they accept a wage which is below the maximum being

paid in the market. But we still must explain
                                                why some profit maximizing
firms charge one price or pay one wage while other firms charge another

price or pay another wage.

     We argue that by paying a higher wage, the firm lovers labor turnover

and hence its expected returns on specific training. A low wage firm has

higher training costs. Under certain circumstances, the increase in training

costs is just sufficient to offset the low wages. Profits viewed as a function

of the wage paid must have more than one relative maxima, with the value of

profits at the different relative maxima identical. The somewhat surprising

result of this paper is that this can be the case under very    simple   conditions,
even when all firms have the same training costs.

     There is an important interaction between the search for higher wage

jobs and the search for jobs which "match" one's preferences.    The existence
of wage dispersion clearly affects the profitability of searching for a

"better match." What is not so obvious, however, is that when there is in—

perfect information of the second type ("matching individuals to    jobs") there
cannot, in general, exist a single wage, zero profit equilibrium.

    Previous studies have focused on firm behavior when facing individuals

whose turnover rates are affected by the wage rate (Mortenson (1970), Salop
                                           —4—




(1973b), and with individual behavior in markets with wage dispersions
(Salop (1973a). But there have been no attempts to link the two sides of

the market together: the quit rate of the individuals is affected by the

wage distribution; the wage paid by the firm with a given training cost is

determined by the quit rate function, so the wage distribution in turn is

determined    by the distribution of training costs. Thus, corresponding to

any   distribution   of training costs there is an equilibrium distribution of

wages. But the wage rates and quit rates associated with any given level of

training costs must be such that these firms just break even (assuming free

entry).

      Our analysis can thus be viewed as an attempt at a simple general

equilibrium formulation of the conventional search models. Such a formula-

tion is required because in its absence we are likely to be misled into

formulating models in which there is not in fact wage or price dispersion,

because such an analysis is required if we are to make any valid         welfare
economic statements about the behavior of markets with imperfect information,
and because   it can   provide    the basis of a macro—economic model with unemploy-
ment, explaining why    wages do not fall even in the presence of      unemployment.
      The exact characteristics       of the equilibrium turn out to depend rather

sensitively on the exact assumptions one makes about production, search,

tastes,   labor supply, and      information.    The simplest version of the model is
presented   in the next section; this is then extended to a number of different

directions in subsequent sections.3a

2.      The Basic Model

        2.1 Introduction

        The basic model presented in this section is a simplified version of

the conventional search model. The basic ingredients (described more fully

below and modified in a number of ways in subsequent sections) are the

following:

             (a) Individuals are continually searching for a better, i.e., in

our simplified model, higher paid, job. They quit when they successfully

find a better job. (In the basic model, the intensity of search will be an

exogenous parameter.)

             (b) For simplicity, we assume only one coiruriodity which we choose

as   our numeraire. All production processes are characterized       by constant
returns    t scale, and there is free entry. Firms face specific training
costs. By paying higher wages, they reduce their turnover rate. The optimal
level of wages depends on their training costs.

        The assumptions of free entry and the constant returns to scale property
of the technology make the zero profit condition seem natural. This in turn
has the implication that the scale of each firm is indeterminate; what is
determinate, however, is the wage distribution. Later, we shall show some
instances in which the zero profit condition may not be satisfied.
        Implicitly,   the   model with which we are dealing here is a dynamic one.
Firms   hire workers and pay      the training costs one period, receiving the returns
in   subsequent periods. In making their decisions, they must form expectations

of future interest rates, prices, and other market conditions. We shall avoid

these problems by focusing on the long—run equilibrium, where the wage distribu-

tion, prices, etc., are invariant.
                                        —6—




       Each firm   in   equilibrium is then characterized by a wage and a level of

employment arid    output;   the market equilibrium is characterized by a wage

distribution. In equilibrium,5

             (a) given the quit rate function generated by the wage distribu-

tion, each firm     has   chosen the wage which maximizes its profits on each job

(position)

             (b) all job positions make zero profits; and

             (c) the markets for goods and    labor   clear.

       In the remainder of this section, we set up and         analyze   the equilibrium

of our simplified economy. We proceed in several stages: in Section 2.2 we

describe the behavior of individuals in the economy, while in Section 2.3 we

describe the behavior of firms as they face a given quit rate function.

Section 2.4 derives the quit rate function. Sections 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and              2.8
construct equilibria with a single wage, with two wages, with multiple wages,

and   finally,   with a continuum of wages. Sections 2.9, 2.10, and         2.11   discuss

the welfare, comparative static, and stability properties of the equilibria.


       2.2 Individual Behavior

       We assume all individuals are identical.6 They die exponentially at

the rate i , and they are replaced by an equal number of new workers, so

that the labor supply remains constant at L .          Each laborer supplies one

unit   of labor. When individuals enter the labor force, they randomly apply
for    a job, which they accept. Meanwhile, they continue to         search for a

better, i.e., a higher paying job. The length of time to go from one               firm
to another to find out its wage is a random variable described by a Poisson
process; the average number of searches per unit of time is s , which               is
                                         —7--




 fixed.      There is no cost to search or to changing jobs, up to the search

 intensity s ; more intensive search is prohibitively expensive. Individuals

 do not know the wage paid by any particular firm; since s
                                                                  is determined in
 effect exogenously, we need make no assumption concerning whether the mdi—

 vidual knows the wage distribution. Later (Section 4), however, we shall

have to be more explicit on this point.


       2.3 The Behavior of the Firm: The
              Given the Quit Rate   Function
       For   simplicity, we assume production processes require only labor, no
capital,7 and have constant returns to scale. Thus, a production
                                                                 process is
characterized by a fixed training cost per worker T ,       which is assumed to
occur instantaneously upon hiring the worker, and by a level of output per

man-year a(T) .       In   the model of this section we assume that the firm has no

choice of technique.7a

                                         is to choose a wage. Clearly, if at
       Thus, the only decision of the firm

that wage rate it is making a profit, it will attempt to expand; if it makes
a loss, it will contract or change its wage. We shall be concerned with
characterizing equilibria; accordingly, under the assumption of           entry,
                                                                        free
each   firm makes zero profits, and so    is indifferent about the scale of pro-
duction. Thus, having determined a wage policy, the firm       simply    accepts for
employment all individuals who apply.

       The wage is chosen so that it maximizes the present discounted value of

its profits on each worker hired. Our restriction to stochastic equilibrium

analysis allows us to greatly simplify the problem, for then the wage is

constant over time, and is chosen to maximize:

where

              r        is the rate of discount (rate of interest


                       is the present discounted value of profits


              q(w) is the quit rate function


        The labor costs consist of the direct wage payments (w), training costs

to replace        workers who quit (q),         and interest on previous expenditures for

training costs (r). q ,              the quit rate, acts essentially like a depreciation
factor on "human capital" expenditures of the firm. By increasing w                  ,    the
direct labor costs are increased but the turnover costs (the "depreciation

rate") is reduced. The profits are maximized (labor costs per worker mini—

ized) when


(2.2)                 1 +   q'(w)T    =   o.8

        Normally, the quit rate function is drawn as in Figure la, as a convex

function. The iso—cost curve is a straight line with slope —lIT, and                 its
tangency     with the quit rate function gives the optimal wage. As we increase

training costs, we increase w smoothly.

        No argument, however, has been given why the quit rate function should

have the given shape, rather than that of Figure lb. There, w < w                   for
T < T    .   As    T increases above T           ,   there is a jump in the wage, and there-
after    it increases smoothly with T
        In either case, however, the wage is a monotonically             increasing function

of   training costs.

        2.4   The Determination of the Quit Rate Function

        The   crucial question, then, is the determination of the quit rate func—
tion. Under our assumptions, the quit rate is just the death rate, plus the
probability of an individual finding a better job. The latter is equal to
the    average number of searches per unit of          time, times the probability that

on    one of these      searches the individual      finds a wage greater   than the wage he

is presently receiving. For simplicity, we assume the probability                 of finding
a    job with a wage higher than w is equal to the percentage of jobs paying

wages higher than w          . If    F(w) is the percentage of firms who         pay a wage
                                                                 11
less    than or equal to w , then the quit rate is10'


(2.3)                q(w) =       + s(l —    F(w))


Hence, if        F(w)     is differentiable at w


(2.4)                q'   (w) =   —sf(w)


where f(w) is the density function of w .                  Thus, for the quit rate func-

tion to be convex, the density function must be monotonically declining; i.e.,

the only continuous wage density functions are those in which the density

function of wage is monotonically decreasing. Li particular, continuous uni—

modal distributions, such as          the normal     distribution, imply that f' > 0 for

wages below the mode, and hence are not consistent with equilibrium.12

        If all other firms were to pay a wage w , then           the quit rate function
would look      as in Figure 2a; if        a fraction r of the firms were to pay a
wage w1 and the remainder were to pay a wage of w ,                   the quit rate function
would look as in Figure 2b. A firm with training cost

        We also need to assume that, if w is the minimum wage at which workers

can be obtained,13

                                 T


The search intensity is sufficiently high that a firm finds it unprofitable

to pay the minimum wage. For the remainder of this section, we assume (2.7)

is satisfied, leaving until the next section a discussion of what happens if

it is not.


        2.6 A Two—Wage Equilibrium

        There is a continuum of two—wage equilibria, characterized by


                 WI1   =    W*
(2.8)
                 w      =   w —sTrT
                   0         1


The wage paid by the high wage firms is always the same as that paid in the

single wage equilibria. But the low wage firm pays a lower wage; however,

because of the higher turnover rate, its labor costs are the same. Any pair

of (1T,w) satisfying (2.8) is an equilibrium. The quit rate function for

one such equilibrium is depicted in Figure 3a.


        2.7 A Three—Wage Equilibrium

        There is also a continuum of three—wage equilibria, characterized by

      It    is clear that equilibria with any finite number of wage levels can

be constructed. Indeed, there may be a continuum of wage levels with a uni-

form density between w and w of l/sT, and a mass point at w0, with

3.   Implications of the Basic Model

     Our model has a number of important implications, which we take up in

this section. First, we show that most of the equilibria considered are not

Pareto efficient. Next, we show that a slight extension of our model gen-

erates equilibria with unemployment and with positive profits. Finally, we

consider the implications of our results for the analysis of comparative

statics for search equilibria.


     3.1 Welfare Economics

     By  the very nature of search and information there are important exter-
nalities which firms will not take into account.
     First, as has                                                  imperfect
                      long been recognized (see, e.g., Arrow (1959)),

information means that all firms have, as it were, some degree of imonopoly
power; they can obtain workers even though they pay less than the "market
wage." They quickly lose workers to other firms, but in the meanwhile, they
are able to exploit the absence of information, provided the costs of turnover
are not too high. But what has not been sufficiently recognized is that this
exercise of monopoly power is, in some sense, itself the cause of imperfect
information; that is, it is the exercise of this monopoly power which results
in the wage differentials, in the absence of which search would be unnecessary.
There is thus a cost, in addition to the direct loss of consumer surplus
usually   associated with the exercise of monopoly power, in the additional

search    and turnover costs.
     There is the further externality imposed on the low wage firm by an in-
crease in the wage of a high wage firm: although it reduces its own quit
rate——which at equilibrium results in a reduction in turnover costs just
                                           14-



sufficient      to compensate for the increased wage——it increases the quit   rate
of   other firms and    the   firm fails to take account of the additional turnover

costs of the other firms.

      Note that all of the equilibria with wage distributions are Pareto

inferior to that with a single wage. The low wage individuals are unambig-

uously worse off and resources are wasted in training that otherwise would

not need to have been spent.

       The low wage firms may claim that they have to pay low wages because

of their high turnover; but it is equally true that       they have a high   turnover

because      they pay low wages.

       3.2    Unemployment Equilibria

      The rigidity of real wages has long been recognized to play a central

role in generating unemployment equilibria. While older discussions ascribed

this rigidity to institutional factors, it has more recently been recognized

that if the wage affects the net productivity of the worker,'4 then the firm

may   not    lower its wage, even in the face of excess supply.

       The usual story for why there cannot exist unemployment equilibria is

that if workers are unemployed, they offer to work for less; if the wage is

bid down, demand for labor is increased and       the supply is decreased. The
process      stops only when demand equals supply. In efficiency wage models,

this argument is not valid: firms may not hire workers at lower        wages if
to do so lowers their profits.

       Here, lowering the wage increases the turnover rate, and hence firms

may be reluctant to lower the wage, even though there are workers available

willing to work for less.15
                                                  —)—




        To show the nature of the unemployment equilibrium we replace our

assumption of a constant returns to scale technology with one with diminish-

ing returns; there is an aggregate production function F(L)                 ,   and the full

employment wage is defined by


(3,1)                    F'(L)          + ( +     r)T


where L is the total available labor supply. The value of the marginal

product of labor at full employment equals the full employment real wage
plus    the   turnover costs. Now assume all firms          are   paying a wage in excess

of wf     ,   say


(3.2)                    w' >

Then they will wish to hire workers only to the point where


(3.3)                    F'(L*) =     w   + (i   + r)T


(3.4)                    L*   <   L


that  is, there will be unemployment. Moreover, provided condition (2.7) is
satisfied, there is no wage which is acceptable to workers which yields a
higher   profit than w* .             Hence   firms have no incentives either to change
the wage they pay or the number of workers they hire.
        Note that if all firms could simultaneously change their wages, lowering
them to             ,   then full employment could be attained. Thus, unemployment is
caused   by too high wages, but the excessively high wages come about not because
of union pressure; rather, the interactions of the wage               policies of the dif-

ferent firms,           and the inability of the different firms to coordinate their
wage policies, leads to an inefficient Nash equilibrium.
                                       —16—




     Indeed, it is easy to see in this model how a disturbance to the economy
can move it from a position of full employment to one of unemployment.

Assume, initially, that the economy were at full employment but then the tech-

nology is disturbed in such a way as to decrease the marginal product of

labor. So long as all other firms continue to pay w           ,   it pays each firm
to continue to do so: all adjustments take place in the number of workers
         16
hired.

     Though in the model formulated here, there exists a full employment

single wage equilibrium, in the model presented in Section 5 the only single

wage equilibrium may   entail   unemployment.


     3.3 Positive Profit Equilibrium

     Though it seems natural enough to impose the zero profit condition in

a model with free entry   and constant   returns   to   scale, in models with costly

search, it is possible that there exist positive profit equilibria. The

usual story for why in equilibrium there must be zero profits is that if

profits are positive, some firm will attempt to recruit workers away from

the other firms,   bidding up the   wage; the process continues until there are

zero profits. But offering a slightly higher wage does not instantaneously

recruit all the workers, as it would if search costs were zero. By raising

its wage a little bit, the firm     succeeds    in recruiting a few more workers——

those who arrive at its doors with current wages higher than the old wage
                          17
but below the new wage.         The firm balances off the increased probability

of getting a worker with the decreased profits it gets per worker. Equilibrium

is characterized by the wages paid being profit maximizing wages, but not

necessarily zero profit wages. In equilibrium, all wages paid must make the
                                                   -17--




same expected profits, and these must exceed the expected profits earned by

paying      any other       wage. Thus, the wage distribution must satisfy

     -         [a   -   w   -   T(p + r + s(1—F)) ] F
(3..)
                             r+p                             =   k for wages paid
                                     + s(1—F)


                                      [a—w—T(ii+r+s(1—F))]
                                      r   + + s(l_p)F <          k   for wages not paid

since the      probability of having a worker who applies accept a job is F                       ,   and
the expected present discounted value of profits earned if                     he    accepts is

                        a — w —        (p+s(1-F) + r)T
(3   6)        R    -
                                r+p+s(1—F)

This gives a wage distribution of the form

                    w   -a(p+r±s)T-sk+(w-a÷ (u±r±s)T- )2 4sTk(r+s)
(3.7)

                                                                             for w     w>   w


                        Ofor w>w


depicted in Figure 4. There is a mass point at

          Even though at        the   highest wage there are positive       profits,   increasing
the wage further            recruits      no additional workers, and     does not lower the quit
rate; hence firms have no incentive to raise wages. (Notice that all equilibria

must be of the form (3.7); there is still a multiplicity of equilibria, caused

by the indeterminancy of                    and k.) But in a positive profit equilibrium

there cannot be a mass point at the highest wage, since then increasing the

wage slightly further would have a discrete effect on the probability of

acceptance, and         hence     on profits.'8

              Figure 4
        With positive profits, there are incentives for firms to enter, but no

entering firms would have an incentive to offer a higher wage.

        Though in the model presented so far, there is no determinate                     number of
firms (job—positions), a slight modification of the model allows for                        us to
determine      this. Assume that each job requires a machine that costs $K. The

profits described above (Eq. 3.6) are thus the expected present discounted

value of the quasi—rents. As entry occurs, the probability of any worker

arriving at a firm declines, and hence following the departure of a worker,

the    expected time until the vacancy is filled increases; entry occurs until
the expected present discounted value of quasi—rents is equal to the price
of the machine. For simplicity, we assume a firm consists of one machine
(one j ob).     the number of searches per worker per unit time is S
                Since

the average number of arrivals per unit time at a firm is sL/N , where                          L
is the number of workers and N the number of jobs. Hence a firm that pays

a wage w has a probability of I = sL F                       or having     a vacancy fi_led per
unit    of time. Straightforward calculations establish that zero profits entails19

        EQ.(3.8) can be solved as           before for the equilibrium wage distribution,

which    gives all firms the same profits; and                   the   value of L/N which ensures
that the level of profits is zero.2°
        Earlier, we noted that if condition (2.7) was not satisfied there would
be no zero profit equilibrium: it would always pay a firm to lower its wages

to the minimal acceptable wage, to exploit the monopoly power arising out of
                                      —19—




costly search. While when condition (2.7) is satisfied there exists positive

profit and zero profit equilibria, when condition (2.7) is not satisfied the

only equilibria have positive profits, and are of the form we have described

in this section.

       An Alternative Resolution. If there is more than one commodity, then

there is an alternative way that, even when condition (2.7) is not satisfied,

a full employment zero profit equilibrium may be attained. Assume that there

is a second sector requiring no specific training; we let the output of that

sector be our numeraire. As firms enter the industry requiring training in

response to positive profits, price falls and profits are reduced,21




       3.4   Comparative Statics
       Because   of the continuum of equilibria, it is difficult to do meaningful

comparative static calculations. The question we are particularly interested

in is, does an increase in the search intensity lead to a narrowing of the

wage distribution? Although the partial equilibrium analyses have suggested
that   it would, the general equilibrium analysis of this paper suggests that
the contrary may occur. Consider the two-wage equilibria. An increase in s
either lowers the wage paid by     the low wage firm—-because of the higher tum—
over they cannot "afford" to pay as high wages as previously——or    it reduces

theproportion of firms paying the high wage (i.e., the turnover rate of      low

:ae firms will be the same so long as sr is constant.)

       3.5 lit
       This paper is mainly concerned with equilibrium analysis; yet is is   worth

noting in a heuristic manner an apparent instability of the multi—wage equilibria.
Consider the two-wage equilibrium. If a single firm happened to switch from

paying wage w   to paying wage w1 , w1   would become more profitable; all

the firms would switch. Conversely, if a single firm happened to switch from

paying w1 to paying w, w would become more profitable than w1 (since

now the turnover rate is lowered) and again it would pay all of the firms

paying w1 to switch. The only equilibrium which appears to be stable is

the single wage equilibrium. Again, not too much emphasis should be put on

this result, since, as we shall show in later sections, with slight elabora—

tions on the model, there may not even exist a single wage equilibrium.

4.      Robustness of the Model

        In developing the model of Section 2, we introduced a number of siinpli—

fying assumptions. We have               explored   the consequences of loosening the various

assumptions, and on the basis of these explorations, we believe our model is

robust; if anything, it becomes easier to generate wage distributions and

equilibria with unemployment or positive profits, In this section, we briefly

describe two extensions of the model, to consider the possibility that firms

have a choice of technique and that individuals have a choice of search inten-

sity (with alternative specifications of the search technology). In the next
section,       we consider   an      important extension to the case where firms   differ   in
their non—pecuniary characteristics.

        4. 1    Choice of Techn
        Allowing   firms to have a choice of technique does not seriously alter
the analysis. It does, however, permit us to generate a richer class of wage
distributions. We assume that output per man is an increasing concave function
of   training costs,

        Two—Wage   Distributions. With two wages, a zero profit equilibriun is
characterized      by the zero profit equations


                             =
                    a(T1)            w1 + (i+r)T1

        Figure 5 shows diagrammatically the solution. (4.3) can be solved for

the high training cost technology: it is the same in all equilibria. Then

(4.2) can be solved for the wage which will yield zero             profits for that
technique.      Consider a wage w          .   Draw the line through w0     tangent   to

a(T) .    Let   the proportion of high wage paying firms be such that .i +r + sir

equals the slope of that line. Then, from (4.3) T                 will be   the technique
chosen by firms paying w , and from                (4.2) these firms will just be breaking

even.

        Notice that in the example we have constructed differences in training

costs are endogenous to the model; they are not an exogenously determined

characteristic of firms.

        Distributions with any finite number of wage levels may similarly be

constructed.

        Continuous Wage Distributions. If there is to be           a   continuous distribu-

tion of wages, the zero profit condition implies that for all (w,T} observed,

(4.6)               a'(T) =      p+r+s(1—F(w))


and


(4.7)               1—sfT =         0


        Substituting



(4.8)               a' (—i—) =          + r + s(1-F)




Thus, the density function of wages can                be simply related to the production
function a(T)


        4.2 Search Costs and        the     Determination of Search Intensity

        If there are costs associated with undertaking search, then a rational

individual, in deciding how much search he should undertake, would compare

the expected benefits at each search intensity with the costs.                 It   is natural

to assume that the costs are an increasing, convex function of search inten-

sity,    i.e., if C(s) is the cost per unit              of   time of search at intensity s


(4.9)               C' > 0


In effect, in our earlier analysis we assumed the cost function took on the

special shape depicted in Figure 6b.

             The correct calculation of the benefits of search is not a siuLpie

matter. We must know what the individual's knowledge about the distribution

of wages is, his attitudes towards risk, as well as his expectations con-

cerning the duration which he will keep any      job.   For instance, if the indi-

vidual does not know the wage distribution, not only does search yield a

direct return in the possibility of finding a better job, but it yields an

indirect return in enabling the individual to know better the wage distribu-

tion   and hence                           with respect to search intensity.
                   to make a "better' decision

For simplicity, assume the individual is risk neutral, and has perfect infor—
ination   about the distribution of wages.22 Straightforward calculations verify

that the convexity of the quit rate function depends on the third derivative

of    the search-cost function; clearly there is no necessity for the quit rate

function to be convex even when f is monotonically declining.

       The extension of the analysis of Section 2 follows in a straightforward

manner. There is one situation in which a problem does arise: if the search

cost appears as in Figure 6c, then for the highest paying firm s. = 0         ,   and

the    quit rate function is flat at w = w
                                          max
                                                 .   Hence,   no firm with positive
training costs would pay Wmax        Accordingly, if there exists an equilibrium

wage distribution, it is the degenerate distribution where         all firms pay the
same wage equal to the minimum wage; but this in turn cannot be a zero profit
equilibrium. There exists a non—zero profit equilibrium with all firms paying
w= w 23
       Although the cost function depicted in Figure 6c may be considered to be
pathological, and the problems generated are really those associated with the
fixed     cost of search, even in that case there may exist a multiple wage

equilibrium if the non-pecuniary benefits resulting from search are taken

into account, or if individuals differ with respect to their search costs,
                                       —25—




with some individuals having C'(O) = 0 ,      or   alternative information tech-

nologies (e.g. , an individual buys a newspaper, which reports to him     simul-
taneously all   wage offers; see Salop and Stiglitz (1977)).

     An Alternative Formulation. An alternative formulation of our model

has been suggested by Dybvig and Jaynes. Everyone applies to every job, but

obviously accepts only those jobs which offer a higher wage. The firm selects

randomly among the interested applicants. Thus, a firm paying a       wage of w
has (p+F(w))L   interested   applicants, where L is the total labor force. In the

steady state equilibrium the number of vacancies at wage w is iiLf(w)
Rence, the probability of an individual at a firm paying wage    quitting
to a firm paying wage w is24 pf/p+F , and the total quite rate is thus


                q(w) = I      Tif(w)   dw
                               +F(w)
                       w


The analysis proceeds exactly as in Section 1. 25

5.     NonPecuniary Returns
       Jobs differ not only in the wages they pay, but in certain non—pecuniary
characteristics. Some individuals will prefer the characteristics associated
with   one firm, others those associated with another firm. We assume, for

simplicity, that the individual does not know these characteristics until

after completing training, thereupon he knows them fully.26 The value, in

"consumption equivalents," of the non—pecuniary characteristics we denote by

9 .    Without loss of generality, we let EB = o •27 The distribution of
evaluations of the non—pecuniary characteristics of any firm we denote by

N(O); that is, in a random sample of individuals arriving at the given firm,

M(e) will      discover that their evaluation of its non—pecuniary          characteristics

is    less   than or equal to 0 .    We   assume, moreover, that the evaluation of

firm i is       independent of his evaluation of firm     j   ; and   for   simplicity,

this distribution is the same for all firms. The density function we denote

by m(S) .       A risk neutral individual at a job with wage w and whose non—

pecuniary      characteristics he   values at 0 accepts a job if its wage,

satisfies


(5.1)               >w+0 .
Thus the quit rate function is simply28

(5.2)               q(w) = p + fs(1—F(w+0))i(0,w)d0


where i(0,w) is the distribution of individuals by 0 in a firm paying

wage w (and can be related to N(O) and F(w)), so
                                                —27--




(5.3)                   q' =   — 1sf (w+O)ii(O,w) dO + fs(1—F)(O,w)dO


The important implication of (5.3) is that even the firm which pays the

highest        wage can, by further increments in its wage, reduce its turnover
rate, and, if it attempted to reduce its wage, it would increase its turn-
over rate, even though there are costs of search. There are several inter-

esting        properties of the equilibrium.


         5.1     Impossibility of a Full       Employment Single Wage Equilibrium

         If    all firms paid the same wage w* ,            then   all individuals who discovered
that 0 <         0   would search for a better job and indeed, since they do not know
the characteristics of the job before accepting it and going through training,
would accept the first offer (since all firms pay the same wage).
         The quit rate of a firm
                             steady state) which decides to pay, say, a
                                         (in

wage w > w can be easily calculated: all those with 0 < w* — w will quit.
         Those who do not quit make up a proportionately larger fraction of each
firm's labor force. Those with 0 < w - w have an average duration on the
job of 1/li + s while those with 0 > w - w have, an average duration of
1/li .        Thus   the average quit rate is just

(5.5)                   q(w,w*) =                   1

        For there to be a       single wage equilibrium (assuming M(0) =                1/2)

there exists an unemployment equilibrium. The greater                       the unemployment rate,
the   smaller     is the marginal effect of a decrease in the wage in increasing

the   turnover rate.
        Let   U   be the unemployment rate; it is easy to see that,                in   general,
the   quit    rate at any firm will depend on the unemployment rate as                  well   as the

wage w* being paid by all other firms:3°


                    q         q(w,w*,u)


Then, the equilibrium unemployment rate is given by the solution of the pair

of   equations

(5.9)               —T q(w*,w*,U) = 1


(5.10)              a   =     w* + (q(w,w,U) + r)T


        5.3 Non-Optimality of the Natural Rate of Unemployment

        The unemployment rate derived in           the   previous section can      be   thought of

as the natural rate of unemployment. This unemployment rate has, however, no
obvious optimality properties. Assume the government worked to maximize

the expected utility of the representative worker; we assuzae, for simplicity,

that    the government can control wages and the number of jobs (hence U)
directly, but that it is constrained to paying wages which break even, i.e.,
(5.10) must be satisfied. The only individuals who are uneiiiployed are the
young (all other individuals             remain at their jobs until they find alternative
employment);3' once they obtain a job they receive a wage of w until they
die. The average present discounted value of their non—pecuniary enjoyment

depends on how frequently individuals quit;              we write 0 = &(q)   ,   0' >   0

Thus, the expected present discounted value of utility of an individual is

represented by


(5.11)              g(U)           + 0(q)]


where the function g(U) reflects the lowered discounted value of the life-

time stream of utility resulting from the fact that the individual does not

obtain employment immediately. The government wishes to maximize (5.11)

subject    to the constraint (5.10), which implies that

(512)               dU
                           =   —     T   '     dU
                                                    =



where    we have   made use of the fact that in the single wage equilibrium the

quit rate depends just on U ,                not on w* •32
       The government chooses U so that


(5.13)              g'(iY) -+(q)] + g(1J)q[.j.+')                   0



with   the inequality implying U             = 0
                                                          —30—




       Since   g' (U) < 0   (increasing the unemployment rate increases the expected

time to obtain a job and hence decreases the present discounted value of

lifetime income), and             <    0    ,        it   is apparent that if



                                      U= 0


If training costs are relatively low, the optimal employment rate is zero;

while if

                   r+u        '
                                      IT>       (1




If   training costs are high, the optimal unemployment rate may be positive.

       There are several implicit differences between the market and the govern-

ment solutions. First, each firm believes that it can reduce its turnover by

raising its wage relative to others; but of course, when they all try to do

this, this simply raises the wage, reduces the demand for labor, but has no

direct effect on the turnover rate. The reduction in the demand for labor,

thatis, the increase in unemployment, has, however, an important externality
effect: it reduces turnover at all firms and this lowers aggregate expendi-
ture on training costs, enabling a consequent rise in       wage rate. Though   the

the firm fails to take into account this benefit of the increased unemploy-
ment rate, it also      fails to take into account the increased cost: the poorer
matching of individuals with               firms and the delay in young               individuals obtaining
employment.      We suspect, but have not been able to show, under any general set

of  conditions, that there is a presumption that the natural unemployment rate
is too high.
                                           —31—




     In this section, we have simply compared the optimal single wage

equilibrium with the single wage market equilibrium. The government can

choose   a whole wage distribution; optimality may well entail wage inequality:

workers who are ex ante identical receive different wages.33


     5.4     FrictionalUnemployrnent
     There is a second, quite distinct kind of unemployment      which      can arise
in a slight variation        of the model presented so far. If we assume     that
search    can only     be undertaken while the individual is unemployed, or more
generally,    that search may be carried on less expensively while unemployed,

then the equilibrium may be characterized by a certain level of frictional

unemployment. All those who find that their evaluation of the non—pecuniary

attributes of the firm are sufficiently negative quit, arid (in the absence

of the kind of unemployment described in 5.3 or 3.2) remain unemployed for

an expected duration of 1/s. the time to arrive at the next firm.


     5.5 Positive Profits Equilibrium

     If


                       q(w,w*)
(5.14)                             <    4 for   all w >   w


                            1w =


there    exists   a   positive profits equilibrium. (5.14) implies that firms will

wish to lower         their wages until the minimum acceptable wage w   .   In general,
at   w


                       a > w + (q+r)T
                                                  —32—




there are positive profits. The analysis of the positive profits equilibrium

follows along the lines of Section 3.


      5.6 Multiple Wage Equilibrium

      Thus far, in this section we have shown that with non—pecuniary charac—

teristics of jobs there does not exist a single wage zero profit full employ-

ment equilibrium, but there may exist a single wage equilibrium, either with

positive profits or unemployment. A natural question to raise at this juncture

is, can we have a multiple wage zero profit full employment equilibrium; in

other words, do our difficulties arise from the restriction to all firms

paying   the same wage? The answer is no: there do not exist multiple wage

full employment zero profit equilibria either.

      As before, let r be the proportion of firms paying                                w1 > w      .       The
quit rate function can now be written as

                                                                       w)

      A zero profit equilibrium will in general not exist; we require, at

ww. and ww2

These   provide four equations in three unknowns and a careful examination of
the structure of the equations in the context of simple examples                  should

readily   convince the reader that there is no redundancy. Moreover, increasing
the   number of wage levels does not resolve the difficulty; for each wage level

we add two unknowns,    the wage rate, and the           proportion of firms at that wage

rate;   arid two equations,   the zero profit equation and         the   profit maximization

equat ion.

6.     Concluding Comments

       In this paper we have investigated the implications of imperfect inf or—

mation for the equilibrium wage distribution. We have shown how, even in a

steady state equilibrium, identical labor may receive different wages; the

competitive forces which we normally think of as eliminating such differences
                                                                     34
in    the long run may not do so when there is imperfect information,     Indeed,

this may be the case even when the only source of "imperfect information't is

the    inequality of wages which the market it perpetuating. When   there are

information   imperfections arising   from (symmetric) differences in non—

pecuniary characteristics of jobs and preferences of individuals, there will

not in general exist a full employment, zero profit single wage equilibrium.

       Perhaps even more significant was the result that in equilibrium, there

could be unemployment; in spite of the presence of an excess supply of labor,

no firm is willing to hire workers at a lower wage, since it knows that if ic

does so, the quit rate will be higher, and hence turnover costs (training

costs) will be higher, so much   so that profits will actually be lower. Thus,
this   model provides a rationale for real wage rigidity. The model, in addi-

tion, provides a theory of frictional unemployment, as workers who are badly

mismatched with firms (in terms of the non—pecuniary characteristics of the

job)   rejoin the unemployment pool to seek a better match.
       Though the constrained optitnality (that is, taking explicitly into
account the costs associated with obtaining information and search) may entail

unemployment and wage dispersion, the levels of unemployment and wage disper-

sion in the market equilibrium will not, in general, be optimal. The nature

of the government intervention that is necessary to effect a Pareto improve-

ment is, unfortunately, far from obvious.

1.   In addition, they may or may not know the wage distribution. In later
     sections, we shall need to be more explicit about what information in-
     dividuals have prior to making their search decisions.

2.   If search is costly, individuals will stop short of obtaining "perfect
     information," and so price (wage) dispersions might be maintained.

3.   If there were exogenous sources of uncertainty, e.g., technical change,
     so that "jobs" have a finite life, then the analysis would be similar
     to that contained here.

3a. Since this paper was originally written, a number of other theories of
     price or wage distribution have been formulated. Without presenting
     a complete survey of what has become an extensive literature, It may be
     useful to note a few of the more important strands. In Salop (1977)
     and Salop and Stiglitz (1977), the price distribution is used to dis-
     criminate among individuals who have different search costs. In earlier
     versions of this paper, as well as in Reinganum (1979), firms with dif-
     ferent technologies can be shown to pay different wages or charge dif—
     ferent prices. In Mortenson (j973Y, costly search prevents labor mar-
     kets from becoming fully arbitraged in response to disturbances in sub—
     markets. (The arguments are analogous to those of Grossman and Stiglitz
     (1980) who show that with costly Information, capital markets cannot
     become fully arbitraged.) Closest in spirit to this paper are those
     studies which have attempted to show that equi1i'brii may be characterized
     by a price distribution, even if individuals and firms are identical and
     even if there are no exogenous sources of noise (Salop and Stiglitz (1982),
     Butters (1977)). While in Butters, stores which charge lower prices are
     able to recruit more customers per dollar spent on advertising, in our
     model, firms which pay higher wages are able to retain workers for a
     longer duration.

4.   Because our model is stochastic, to avoid random variations   in   the aggre-
     gate variables of interest, we assume a large economy.

5.   In more general versions of this model, to characterize the equilibrium
     we also need to specify the choice of technique by the firm, the choice
     of search intensities by individuals, and the relative prices of differ-
     ent commodities. There are, correspondingly, some additional equilibrium
     conditions; e.g., each firm chooses its technique to maximize its profits;
     each individual chooses his search intensity (given the wage of the firm
     he is presently at, the costs of search, and the wage distribution) to
     maximize his expected utility.

6.   In Section 5, we assume individuals differ with respect to their eval-
     uation of the non-pecuniary characteristics associated with any firm.
     The assumption of identical individuals is made to avoid the possibility
     that the equilibrium wage disTtribution is generated by firms' attempting
     to act as discriminating monopolists. See Salop and Stiglitz (1977).

7.    Alternatively, if firms are large, then the number of applicants will
      equal the number of deaths; then the firm's production process may in-
      volve capital as well as labor. In other cases; that is, for small
      firms with capital, after each death or quit there may be a (random)
      period of idleness of the machine or the firm may carry an inventory of
      underemployed workers. This means that firms must worry about the per-
      centage of time machines which are idle, and individuals may apply to
      firms with no vacancies. This complicates but does not basically change
      the analysis.

7a, We assume      here (as in fact seems to be
                                            the case) that at least some
      part of the specific training and turnover costs are borne by the firm.
      For a model in which the contract design is endogenous (so that in par-
      ticular, the fraction of the specific training and turnover costs borne
      by the firm is endogenously determined) see Arnott and Stiglitz (J983.
      They show that so long as workers are more risk asverse than firms, a
      fraction of the specific training costs will be borne by firms. (For
      a further discussion of the point, see also Stiglitz (1974).

8.    The number of applicants who are willing to accept a job is, of course,
      a function of the wage offered, but because of the zero profLt condition,
      this has no effect on the wage offered in equilibrium. But see below.

9.    This is consistent, for instance, with each of the large firms having a
      number of places to apply, in proportion to the number of jbs which are
      available.

10.   If instead of assuming that the time required to sample an additional
      firm is a random variable we had assumed the individual makes s
      searches per unit time, then

             q(w) =    + (1 — (F(w))S)   ,     q'   = _sFS   lfl

      The rest of the calculations   must similarly be modified in            a straight-
      forward manner.

11. It is                           quit rate is a function not only of the
              clear from (2.3) that the
      wage paid by the firm in question, but by all other firms. Thus if there
      were m firms, we could have written the th firm's quit rate as
               =                         ,W)
                   q.(w1,w2,.   .




      Our   notation suppresses the dependence

12.   Not too much emphasis should be placed on this result, since, as we
      shall see, it is not true in more complicated versions of the model.

13.   Several different interpretations can be given to w. .         In an   economy
      with effective minimum wage legislation, then w1 is the legislated
      minumum wage. Alternatively, w. may be thought of as the reservation
      wage, below which individuals will not work. Or w.11 may be thought
      of as   the wage which individuals could earn in self—employment. Or there
      may be one sector in which there is an organized, competitive labor market
      of the conventional sort; individuals know they can obtain employnient in
      that sector. Finally, the efficiency wage may provide the minimum wage.
      (See fn.

14. These theories are broadly referred to as efficIency wage theories; in
     the development literature, they were first discussed by Leibenstein
     (1956). While in his theory productivity depended on wages because of
     nutrition, subsequent developments by Stiglitz (1976, 1982a, 1982b.),
     Weiss (1980), Shapiro and Stiglitz (1982), and Calvo (1979) related pro-
     ductivity to wages through selection (the quality of the applicant pooi
     is affected by the wage paid) and incentive effects. For a more extensive
     development of the relationship between turnover and unemployment in a
     slightly different model, see Stiglitz (1974).

15. We assume throughout this paper—-we would argue realistically——that there
     are some turnover costs borne by the firm. A natural question to raise
     at this juncture is, if the worker cannot induce the firm to hire him by
     lowering his wage, why can't he simply offer to pay a larger fraction
     (possibly all) of the turnover costs. There are at least three possible
     explanations. First, workers may not have the capital to pay for the
     training costs. Second, there is a moral hazard problem on the part of
     the firm; it could take the application fee, which is allegedly for
     training, and shortly thereafter fire him. Third, those workers who
     are willing to pay the most for the job may not be the most productive
       (there   are quality—selection effects). The arguments are parallel to
      those presented in Stiglitz and Weiss for why an increase in collateral
      requirements may not be used to equilibrate the credit market, or in
      Shapiro—Stiglitz for why bonding may not eliminate the incentive—
      unemployment with which they were concerned.
           In any case, all that matters for our analysis is that, for one
      reason    or another, there are some turnover costs borne by   the firm.

16. Similar arguments hold for any other change in technology, e.g., a
     change in s , T ,      ,      r
                               or i . Note that an increase in the real
     interest rate will, in this model, lead to unemployment.

17. We are explicitly ruling out other means by which firms may recruit
     workers, e.g., by advertising. These methods, too, are not costless
     Our assumptions ensure that the number of applicants at a firm are in-
     dependent of the wage it pays. This would not be the case under alter-
      native hypotheses concerning the information structure.
18. This result is dependent on our assumption that the number of searches

      firms pay the same wage, then if there is any marginal cost to doing any
      search, if any single firm raises its wage, it will not induce any
      search, and hence will not increase the speed with which it fills vacan-
      cies. It is easy to see, more generally, that there may exist equilibria
      in which at the highest wage there is a mass point.

19. The expected present discounted value of a worker, once he is hired, is
    p /r+q . The expected present discounted value of a vacancy at time t
     is Vet , and such a vacancy will occur at t with                       probability qeqt
      The total return to a machine can thus be written

20. Implicitly, throughout the analysis, we are assuming that the machines
     cannot be rented out when they are idle.

           The analysis requires that the training costs not entail simply
      output of the training goods sector.

                            w
      where the second order condition implies that C" > 0 .  From (4.11) we
      obtain the search intensity as a function of the wage paid (given the
      distribution F(w)).

23.   If the amount of labor each individual supplies is a function of w
      (rather than fixed, as in the analysis of the rest of this paper), then
      the equilibrium wage will be the monopoly wage, i.e., if L(w) is the
      amount of labor an individual supplies as a function of the wage, the
      equilibrium wage will be given by the solution to
                  +   wf'(w*)     0
      This corresponds to the result of Diamond (1971), who shows that the
      equilibrium in his search model involves a single price at the monopoly
      level. But note how dependent it is on the particular ass-rmptions made.
24. We have ignored the possibility that in any period the indiv±ual gets
    offered simultaneously two jobs. If the periods are short, so that the
    number of vacancies is small relative to the number of applicants, this
    is a small probability event; in our continuous time formulation, this
      is a zero probability event.

25. There is a two—wage distribution, with w1 = w and w0 = w1 —
     low wage individuals and those newly entering the labor force apply for
                                                                             Since           -j          .         all

26. There are, of course, some non—pecuniary characteristics which are known
     before accepting the job; there will affect the acceptance rate, but not
     the quit rate. Similarly, there are pecuniary characteristics, such as
     promotion policy, that may become known only gradually to the individual.

27.   If most individuals agree that one firm has more desirable character-
      istics than another, we can simply add the mean value of U onto the
      wage.

28. For simplicity, we revert to our search model of Section 2 where $     is
     fixed. For the more general case, see the 1974 IMSSS version of
     "Equilibrium Wage Distributions."

29, While in the earlier case, a policy of a constant wage was optimal, it
    will not necessarily be so here, since those who remain longer with the
      firm have revealed information about their evaluation of the non—pecuniary
      characteristics of the firm; namely, that 8 > 0 . The firm can exploit
      that information in designing a seniority wage structure. This is a
      difficult problem, the solution to which would not alter the basic qual-
      itative propositions put forth in this section,
           Similar considerations suggest that our first order condition (5.7)
      is only approximately correct; if the firm chooses a fixed wage rate,
      the probability that any individual quits will be a function of the
      length of time he has been on the job, i.e., q = q(w,t) .   The present
      discounted value of profits of the firm are thus


              p   fq[a —       w]e +   (w,t)]td   — T

      where
                           t
                          I q(w,t)dt
             q(w,t) = °

      In our analysis we have replaced (w,t) with q(w,cc) -. Again, the
      central result, that for all w > Wmjn

                    0          when w w* for all firms
      is   still valid.
30. The derivation of the quit rate function from the underlying assumption
     on search and non-pecuniary evaluations is tedious; all that is crucial
      for our result is that q(w,w*,tJ) < 0             at w =
31.   This assumes that 8mjfl < w* , i.e.,, the non-pecuniary disutility does
      not exceed the wage; the modification for the case where some individuals
      quit to join the unemployment pool is straightforward..
32. This follows from our strong assumption that individuals value jobs by
     w + 8, so there are no income effects in the valuation of non—pecuniary
      attributes.
