                                            ABSTRACT



       We describe two methods for correcting an omitted variables problem in discrete choice
models: a fixed effects approach and a control function approach. The control function approach is
easier to implement and applicable in situations for which the fixed effects approach is not. We

apply both methods to a cross-section of disaggregate data on customer's choice among television
options including cable, satellite, and antenna. As theory predicts, the estimated price response rises

substantially when either correction is applied. All of the estimated parameters and the implied price
elasticities are very similar for both methods.

1    Introduction
Models of diﬀerentiated products are widely used for policy analysis (where
impacts often depend on substitution patterns, such as whether the in-
duced demand for new energy-eﬃcient vehicles is drawn more from “gas-
guzzlers” or current “gas-sippers”), merger analysis (where elasticities and
cross-elasticities among similar products determine the welfare implications
of a merger), design and forecasting of new products (where demand de-
pends on the new product’s similarity to other products, and where the
issue of self-cannibalization of the ﬁrm’s similar products is critical for prof-
its), marketing analysis (where the demand for one product depends on the
attributes of all similar products), and a host of other issues.
    In aggregate (i.e., market-level) models of diﬀerentiated products, price
is usually endogenous, determined by the interaction of demand and supply.
Since the demand for diﬀerentiated products under heterogeneous prefer-
ences is inherently non-linear, the application of standard methods for cor-
recting this endogeneity problem are not immediately applicable. Berry,
Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995, henceforth BLP) developed and applied an ap-
proach using product-market ﬁxed eﬀects (as suggested by Berry, 1994)
which provides consistent estimation in the face of omitted product at-
tributes. The method has proven successful in numerous applications, in-
cluding the demand for cable TV (Crawford, 2000), cereals (Nevo, 2001),
and minivans (Petrin, 2002), to name only a few.
    With disaggregate (i.e., customer-level) models of demand, price is not
necessarily endogenous in the traditional sense, since the demand of the
customer does not usually aﬀect market price. However, the issues that
give rise to the need for correction in aggregate models can also appear in
disaggregate models. In particular, omitted product attributes can result
in correlation between the price and the unobserved portion of utility: the
market mechanism causes the price to be higher for products that display
desirable attributes that are observed by consumers but not measured by the
econometrician. Since these attributes aﬀect demand at the customer level,
price can be correlated with the error term even in disaggregate models.
The BLP approach can be applied to disaggregate data, or a combination of
aggregate and disaggregate data, as illustrated by Berry et al. (2001) and
Goolsbee and Petrin (2002).


                                       2
    We propose an alternative approach based on control functions. The
basic idea is to include extra variables in the estimation equation that con-
dition out (i.e., control for) the part of the error that is correlated with the
regressors. The concept dates back at least to Heckman (1978) and Haus-
man (1978).1 We implement it in a discrete choice environment where price
endogeneity often raises econometric concerns.2
    For general cases the assumptions under the control function approach
diﬀer from those for the ﬁxed eﬀects approach, with neither set of assump-
tions necessarily being nested within the other. For many questions the
control function approach can be implemented in the most popular statis-
tical packages, while the ﬁxed eﬀects approach usually requires the use of
a lower-level programming language. Additionally, the control function ap-
proach is available in some situations for which the BLP approach is not.
In the sections below we describe both approaches and apply them to disag-
gregate data on customers’ choice among TV options. We ﬁnd that the two
approaches provide very similar estimates, including a substantial increase
in the price response when either correction is applied.


2       Speciﬁcation
Our speciﬁcation is indexed by consumers (n), products (j), and markets
(m). There are N consumers and J products. The price and attributes of
the products vary over M markets. The price and some product attributes
are observed by the econometrician; these are denoted pmj and xmj , respec-
tively, for product j in market m. Some attributes are not observed by the
econometrician but are known by consumers and aﬀect their demand. The
utility that customer n who lives in market m obtains from product j is
decomposed into these observed and unobserved parts:
                           Unj = V (pmj , xmj , sn ) + enj                         (1)
where sn denotes the observed characteristics of the customer, V is a cal-
culable function up to parameters, and enj is deﬁned as the diﬀerence that
    1
    See also Madansky (1964).
    2
    The term “control function” was introduced by Heckman and Robb (1985) in the
context of selection models and has been applied to a Tobit model by Smith and Blundell
(1986) and binary probit by Rivers and Vuong (1988). See also Trajtenberg (1989, 1990),
Villas-Boas and Winer (1999), and Blundell and Powell (2001).

makes the equation an identity. Customer n buys in one of the markets;
for simplicity, we say that customer n buys in market m without explicitly
denoting the fact that m diﬀers for diﬀerent n.3
    The choice probability is deﬁned in the traditional way. Let en denote
the vector en1 , . . . , enJ , and let ϕ(den ) denote the density of en conditional
on the observed variables. The choice probability for good i is then
                                        
                                Pni =           ϕ(den )                          (2)
                                        Ani

where Ani = {en | Uni > Unj ∀j = i} is the set of en such that product i
provides maximal utility.
   Decomposing price into two components is an important aspect of both
the ﬁxed eﬀects and the control function approach. Price in each market
can be expressed as a function of instruments:

                              pmj = g(j, zm ) + µmj ,                            (3)

where zm includes the observed attributes of the products and other observed
variables that are independent of µmj . The error µmj incorporates factors
like unobserved product attributes that aﬀect price but are not captured by
zm .
     The econometric diﬃculty arises when enj and pmj are correlated (i.e.
if enj and µmj are correlated). The standard choice models are derived
under assumptions that do not incorporate this correlation. Logit and GEV
models (e.g., McFadden, 1974, 1978) assume that the unobserved component
of utility is independent of the observed variables. Mixed logit and probit
(e.g., Brownstone and Train, 1999) allow the covariance of the unobserved
component to depend on observed variables; however, the mean is assumed
to be constant, which precludes correlation with price.

2.1    Fixed eﬀects approach
The BLP approach includes alternative-speciﬁc constants for each product-
market pair to address the price endogeneity problem. Utility is decomposed
into a part that is the same for all customers in a market, labeled δmj , plus
  3
    The more correct but more cumbersome notation would be m(n) as the market in
which n buys.


                                            4
observed Ṽ (·) and unobserved ε̃nj parts that vary over customers in each
market:
                     Unj = δmj + Ṽ (pmj , xmj , sn ) + ε̃nj           (4)
Importantly, δmj , which is called the ﬁxed eﬀect for product j in market
m, incorporates the average value of the omitted attributes along with the
other components of utility that do not vary within a market.4 It is typi-
cally assumed to be separable in price, observed attributes, and unobserved
factors:
                       δmj = αpmj + h(xmj ) + ξmj .                     (5)
For a very general class of choice models Berry (1994) shows that such ﬁxed
eﬀects exist and are unique.
     The econometric concern arises when ξmj is correlated with pmj , that
is, if omitted attributes aﬀect market prices. Without the ﬁxed eﬀect, the
error entering the likelihood is ξmj + ε̃nj , and this error is not mean zero
conditional on price. Typically, it is positively correlated with price, which
biases the price sensitivity towards zero.
     Conditional on the ﬁxed eﬀect, the unobserved portion of utility is given
by ε̃nj . The choice probability is then given by
                                         
                                 Pni =           ψ(dε̃n )
                                          Bni

where Bni = {ε̃n | Uni > Unj ∀j = i} and ψ(dε̃n ) is the density of ε̃n =
ε̃n1 , . . . , ε̃nJ  conditional on the observed variables and ﬁxed eﬀects. This
density is usually assumed to take one of the standard forms, since the
component of utility that is assumed correlated with price is absorbed in
δmj .
     The ﬁxed eﬀects approach consists of three steps. First, the discrete
choice model is estimated with alternative-speciﬁc constants for each prod-
uct in each market. The model can include interactions of demographic
variables with observed attributes, which constitute the elements of Ṽ (·).
The form of this model, such as logit, GEV, probit or mixed logit, is de-
termined by the distributional assumption that is placed on ε̃n . Again,
   4
    Our use of the term “ﬁxed eﬀects” is analogous to that in cross-section/time-series
models, where the ﬁxed eﬀects capture the average in each geographical area around which
time-speciﬁc values vary. Here the ﬁxed eﬀects capture the average in each market around
which customer-speciﬁc values vary.


                                             5
by including the ﬁxed eﬀects, consistent estimates of all parameters except
those contained in the ﬁxed eﬀects obtain because ξmj is controlled for (i.e.
the new error, ε̃nj , is conditional on ξmj ).
     Since the ﬁrst stage only provides estimates of parameters not included
in the ﬁxed eﬀect, two more steps are undertaken to recover estimates of
the remaining parameters. In the second step, the price equation (3) is
estimated using exogenous instruments. The third step is the regression of
ﬁxed eﬀects on characteristics and price (equation (5)) using predicted price
instead of the actual price.5 With estimates for all parameters available
after this last step, any function of the parameters (like price elasticities) is
straightforward to compute.
     A computational issue arises because of the large number of parameters
in the model. One ﬁxed eﬀect is estimated for each product (except one, for
normalization) in each market, which constitutes M · (J − 1) parameters in
addition to those entering Ṽ and those determining the covariance of ε̃n . The
M ·(J −1) ﬁxed eﬀects can in principal be estimated by maximum likelihood
along with the other parameters; however, doing so requires searching over
a very high-dimensional parameter space.
     BLP propose one approach to facilitate estimation. At each trial value of
parameters entering Ṽ and the covariance of ε̃n , ﬁxed eﬀects are calculated
that induce the forecasted shares in each market to equal the sample shares
in that market, and the likelihood is calculated at these values. By concen-
trating the ﬁxed eﬀects out, the parameters entering Ṽ and the covariance
of ε̃n can be estimated using standard optimization methods.
     BLP provide a computational device to aid in concentrating out the ﬁxed
eﬀects. The ﬁxed eﬀects are calculated iteratively by repeated application
of the formula:
                          t+1    t                   t
                         δmj  = δmj + ln(Smj ) − ln(Fmj ).
where t denotes the iteration, Smj is the sample share for product j in market
         t is the forecasted share for product j in market m calculated with
m, and Fmj
 t ∀j. As mentioned above, this iteration for the ﬁxed eﬀects is performed
δmj
for each trial value of the other parameters. It is both the computation-
ally diﬃcult and computationally costly part of the ﬁxed eﬀects estimation
   5
     The second and third steps are actually performed simultaneously using two stage
least squares (2SLS). We break 2SLS into its two component steps to facilitate discussion

routine, and it is entirely avoided in the control function approach.6

2.2     Control function approach
The basic logic of a control function approach is to add to the estima-
tion equation an additional variable that conditions out the part of the
error correlated with the regressors. In our framework the control func-
tion approach includes a new regressor to control for the part of price that
varies with the omitted attributes.7 As with the ﬁxed eﬀects approach,
the price equation decomposes price into a part that is attributable to the
instruments, including the observed attributes, and a residual that is at-
tributable to other factors, including omitted attributes. The price residu-
als, µm = µm1 , . . . , µmJ , are called control variables. For each product, a
control function is speciﬁed, denoted as fj (µm ) for product j. These control
functions are new variables that, once calculated, can enter utility like any
other observed variable.
    With the new regressors fj (µm ) we write utility as

                        Unj = V(pmj , xmj , sn , fj (µm )) + εnj ,                        (6)

where V is a calculable function of the observed variables, including the
control functions, and εnj is the diﬀerence that makes this equation an
identity. In principal, any function V can be speciﬁed, as well as any control
function. Heterogeneity can be incorporated by interacting characteristics
with demographics and/or giving them random coeﬃcients. Similarly, the
    6
      The procedure is called a contraction (BLP) or calibration (Train, 1986.) When
utility contains an additive extreme value error, the procedure is guaranteed to converge;
otherwise, it is not. Other approaches can be used instead; see Goolsbee and Petrin for an
approach that is eﬀective when the error is multivariate normal. Note that the ﬁxed eﬀects
that are obtained by these methods are not the maximum likelihood estimates, except for
a logit model. For probit and mixed logit, the MLE ﬁxed eﬀects do not in general equate
sample shares with forecasted shares, so the procedure might be considered “near” MLE.
    7
      Trajtenberg (1989, 1990) utilizes a similar approach of entering the price residual as a
variable in a discrete choice model in the context of omitted attributes. However, he does
not also enter the actual price, and thus does not estimate the price coeﬃcient along with
the rest of the model estimates. Instead he uses additional outside information to estimate
the price coeﬃcient (as he describes on pp. 463-465 of the 1989 paper). Bajari and Benkard
(2001) provide the conditions under which the exact value of an unobserved attribute can
be recovered from the price equation when a single market is under consideration.



                                              7
control functions can be interacted with demographics and/or given random
coeﬃcients.
   The choice probability is deﬁned by the density of εn , which is conditional
on the control functions and the speciﬁcation of V:
                                      
                              Pni =           φ(dεn )
                                      Cni

where Cni = {εn | Uni > Unj ∀j = i} and φ is the density of ε. If φ takes
a convenient form, then this choice probability can be used as the basis for
parameter estimation. As mentioned above, εnj need not be independent
of the control functions, price, or the other variables in V, since probit and
mixed logit allow its covariance to depend on observed variables. However,
for all the standard models, εnj must have constant mean conditional on
these variables. The purpose of the control function is to condition on the
part of price related to omitted attributes so that remaining unobserved
utility εnj has constant mean conditional on price.
    Estimation is performed in two computationally simple steps. First,
the price equations are estimated. Second, the choice model is estimated
with the residuals from the price equations included as extra explanatory
variables. The simplicity of the approach is an important part of its appeal;
for many questions it can be implemented in the most popular statistical
packages, while the ﬁxed eﬀects approach usually requires the use of a lower-
level programming language.
    The control function approach can be applied in some cases where the
ﬁxed eﬀects approach is not feasible. For example, price might vary endoge-
nously over every observation rather than just over groups of observations
(e.g., over markets). In this case, the ﬁxed eﬀects are not separately identi-
ﬁed from the other parameters in the model (because there is one ﬁxed eﬀect
for each observation). However, as long as an appropriate control function
can be speciﬁed, all of the parameters under the control function approach
are identiﬁed.
    Starting with the original speciﬁcation from equation (1), some special
cases are illustrative. A prominent example arises when enj consists of a
component that varies over markets and a remainder, enj = ξmj + ε̃nj , with
ξmj and µmj distributed jointly normal. The conditional mean of enj is then
Ωξµ Ω−1
      µµ µmj , where the Ω’s are the appropriate covariance matrices. In this



                                          8
case, the control functions are linear in the price residuals and enter utility
linearly.
    Second, if the relevant covariances over products are zero (i.e., Ωξµ and
Ωµµ are diagonal), then the control function for each product is simply
proportional to the price residual for that product: fj (µm ) = λj µmj . This
is the speciﬁcation used by Villas-Boas and Winer (1999).
    More generally, any random variable can be divided into its (conditional)
mean and a deviate from this mean. Thus, writing enj as its mean condi-
tional on µm and a remainder, or

                             enj = fj (µm ) + εnj ,

yields the expression for utility

                   Unj = V (pmj , xmj , sn ) + fj (µm ) + εnj ,

which is a control function model. We now turn to a comparison of the
control function and the ﬁxed eﬀects approaches.

2.3   Comparison under standard speciﬁcations
In the most common speciﬁcations, both approaches can be seen as including
the price residuals but diﬀering in how they enter the likelihood. Using this
common feature of both approaches, we now show when parameter estimates
will diﬀer if the ﬁxed eﬀects model is the “correct” model and a simple
control function approach is used to approximate it.
     We explore the most popular speciﬁcation for the ﬁxed eﬀects approach,
i.e., when the ﬁxed eﬀects are assumed to be linear in price, observed and
unobserved attributes. Substituting p̂mj + µ̂mj for pmj in (5) yields

                    δmj = αp̂mj + βxmj + (αµ̂mj + ξmj ).                   (7)

Estimates of α and β are obtained from this estimating equation in the third
step of the ﬁxed eﬀects routine, where the ﬁxed eﬀects are regressed on in-
strumented price p̂mj and other regressors, with the error term in parenthe-
ses. Consistent estimates result because p̂mj and xmj are, by construction,
uncorrelated with µ̂mj and, by assumption, uncorrelated with ξmj .
    By deﬁning ξ˜mj as
                            ξ˜mj = ξmj − λj µ̂mj ,                       (8)

                                        9
the remaining part of the error ξmj after µmj is accounted for, (5) (and (7))
can be reexpressed as

                        δmj = αpmj + βxmj + λj µ̂mj + ξ˜mj .                           (9)

This equation is the equation that would be estimated if µ̂mj were directly
included in the ﬁxed eﬀects regression with actual prices (and other at-
tributes). As Hausman (1978) notes, OLS on (9) yields identical estimates
for α and β as OLS on (7)8 , which in turn is identical to IV/2SLS on (5).
The ﬁxed eﬀects approach is therefore equivalent to entering the price resid-
uals into the ﬁxed eﬀects regression. The price residuals control for the
correlation between price and the unobserved portion of utility.
    The control function approach uses the price residuals for the same pur-
pose but enters them directly into the choice model. The analogous control
function model is obtained by substituting (9) into (4), or

                Unj = αpmj + βxmj + Ṽ + λj µ̂mj + (ξ˜mj + ε̃nj ).                    (10)

The question arises: does the additional error term ξ˜mj = ξmj − λj µ̂mj ,
which is part of unobserved utility in the control function approach that is
controlled for in the ﬁxed eﬀects approach, lead to inconsistent estimates in
the discrete choice model? Stated alternatively: Suppose we could estimate
a discrete choice model with ξ˜mj entering explicitly as a variable. Would
the estimated coeﬃcients of the other variables and their implications for
elasticities be diﬀerent from the control function approach?
    By the assumptions of the ﬁxed eﬀects approach, ξ˜mj has constant mean
conditional on pmj , xmj , and µ̂mj . Therefore, its inclusion/exclusion will
aﬀect the estimated parameters in this non-linear environment if: (1) it is
correlated with the customer-level demographics in Ṽ , or, (2) its deviations
around its mean are not represented correctly in the analyst’s speciﬁcation
of the error distribution. As in any choice model, misspeciﬁcation can be
directly addressed by appropriate modiﬁcation of the speciﬁcation. Het-
erogeneity can be incorporated by interacting the control functions with
   8
    In (9), substitute p̂mj + µ̂mj for pmj : δmj = αp̂mj + βxmj + (λj + α)µ̂mj + ξ̃mj . OLS
on this equation gives the same estimates for α and β and OLS on (9). OLS on this
equation also gives the same estimates for α and β as OLS on (7), since µ̂mj is orthogonal
by construction to p̂mj and xmj . OLS on (9) therefore gives the same estimates as OLS
on (7).

demographics. Heteroskedasticity is addressed through alternative-speciﬁc
error components in a mixed logit, unequal variances in a probit, and/or by
giving the control functions random coeﬃcients. Finally, testing and semi-
and non-parametric methods, as described by Blundell and Powell (2001),
can be used to assist in determining the appropriate speciﬁcations, as we
now illustrate.


3     Application
We apply the methods to households’ choice of television reception options.
The speciﬁcation and data are similar to those of Goolsbee and Petrin
(2002). Four alternatives are considered available to households: (1) antenna
only, (2) cable with basic or extended service, (3) cable with a premium ser-
vice added, such as HBO, and (4) satellite dish. Basic and extended cable
are combined because the data do not diﬀerentiate which of these options
the households chose. Goolsbee and Petrin describe the market for cable
and satellite TV, emphasizing the importance of accounting for omitted at-
tributes, such as the quality of programming, in demand estimation. We
apply both the ﬁxed eﬀects and the control function approach to data from
2001.
    Our sample consists of 11,810 households in 172 geographically distinct
markets. Each market contains one cable franchise that oﬀers basic, ex-
tended, and premium packages. There are a number of multiple system
operators like AT+T and Time-Warner which own many cable franchises
throughout the country (thus serving several markets). The price and other
attributes of the cable options vary over markets, even for markets served
by the same multiple system operator. Satellite prices do not vary geo-
graphically, and the price of antenna-only is assumed to be zero. The price
variation that is needed to estimate price impacts arises from the cable al-
ternatives. Details of the data are given in the appendix.
    For the control function approach, utility is speciﬁed (after extensive
testing to be described below) as:
                   5
                   
    Unj = αpmj +         θg pmj dgn + βxmj + kj sn + λj µmj + (σνn cj +   nj ).   (11)
                   g=2

The price eﬀect is speciﬁed to diﬀer by income group. Five income groups

                                          11
are identiﬁed, with the lowest income group taken as the base. The dummy
dgn identiﬁes whether household n is in income group g. The price coeﬃcient
for a household in the lowest income group is α while that for a household
in group g > 1 is α + θg . The alternative-speciﬁc constant for alternative
j is kj . These constants are interacted with demographic variables as well
as entering directly. The variable µmj is the residual from the ﬁrst-stage
price regression, for j representing either extended-basic cable and premium
cable. No such residuals are included for antenna-only and satellite since
these prices do not vary geographically. These residuals are the control
functions that are included to account for omitted attributes; we discuss
their construction and alternative speciﬁcations below.
    An error component is included to allow for correlation in unobserved
utility over the three non-antenna alternatives. In particular, cj = 1 if j is
one of the three non-antenna alternatives and cj = 0 otherwise, and νn is
an iid standard normal deviate. The coeﬃcient σ is the standard deviation
of the error component, reﬂecting the degree of correlation among the non-
antenna alternatives.
    The ﬁnal error term, nj , is assumed to be iid extreme value, condi-
tional on the explanatory variables including the control functions.9 The
choice probability therefore takes the form of a mixed logit (Train, 1998;
Brownstone and Train, 1999), with the mixing over the distribution of νn :

where h(·) is the standard normal density and Vnj = αpmj + 5g=2 θg pmj dgn +
βxmj + kj sn + λj µmj . The integral is approximated through simulation: a
value of ν is drawn from the standard normal density, the logit formula is
calculated for this value of ν, the process is repeated for numerous draws,
and the results are averaged.10
    Table 1 gives the estimated parameters. The ﬁrst column gives the
model without any correction for the correlation between price and omitted

    Note that εnj in (6) is the sum of the two error terms, σνn cj + nj , in (11).

    To increase accuracy, Halton (1960) draws are used instead of independent random
draws. Bhat(2001) found that 100 Halton draws perform better than 1000 independent
random draws, a result that has been conﬁrmed on other datasets by Train (2000, 2003),
Hensher (2001), and Munizaga and Alvarez-Daziano (2001).

attributes; utility is the same as speciﬁed above except that the residuals,
µmj , are not included. The second column applies the control function
approach by including the residuals.11 Without correction, the base price
coeﬃcient α is small, suﬃciently so that the price coeﬃcient α+θg is positive
for three of the ﬁve income groups, rendering the model implausible and
unusable for policy analysis. Inclusion of the control functions raises the
magnitude of the estimated base price coeﬃcient, as expected. A negative
price coeﬃcient is obtained for all incomes groups. The magnitude decreases
as income rises, with the highest income group obtaining a price coeﬃcient
that is about thirty percent smaller than that of the lowest income group.
    Several product attributes are included in the model. In the model
without correction, one of these attributes enters with an implausible sign:
number of cable channels. With correction, all of the product attributes
enter with expected signs. The magnitudes are generally reasonable. An
extra premium channel is valued more than an extra cable (non-premium)
channel. An extra over-the-air channel is also valued more than an extra
non-premium cable channel, presumably because there are fewer over-the-
air channels such that each one becomes more valuable. One interpretation
is that the proliferation of cable channels with low programming content
makes the value of extra cable channels relatively low. The option to obtain
pay-per-view is valued highly. Note that this attribute, unlike the others, is
not on a per-channel basis; its coeﬃcient represents the value of the option
to purchase pay-per-view events. The point estimates imply that households
  11
     Since µ̂ are used to approximate µ in the estimation routine, the standard errors
from the traditional formulas (and output by standard estimation routines) are biased
downward. To correct for the additional source of variance in µ̂, we add a new term to
the estimated variance of the parameters obtained from treating µ̂ as the true µ. This
new component comes from bootstrapping the price regressions. That is, we repeatedly
estimate the price regressions with bootstrapped samples, calculate the residuals, and
re-estimate the mixed logit model with the new residuals. The variance in parameter
estimates over the bootstrapped price samples is added to the variance estimates that
obtain from the traditional formulas (which are appropriate when µ is observed without
error). These total standard errors are given in the table. The adjustment is important
for the standard errors of the base price coeﬃcient, the coeﬃcients for the residuals, and
the coeﬃcients of the product attributes, which increase between 50-100%, more closely
approximating the standard errors from of the ﬁxed eﬀect approach. Karaca-Mandic and
Train (2002) provide a formula for the asymptotic standard errors in this type of two-step
estimation; they ﬁnd that in our application the formula gives standard errors that are
very similar to those obtained with the bootstrap procedure.

their income.
     Several demographic variables enter the model. Their estimated coeﬃ-
cients are fairly similar in the corrected and uncorrected models. The esti-
mates suggest that households with higher education tend to purchase less
TV reception: the education coeﬃcients are progressively more highly nega-
tive for antenna-only (which is zero by normalization), extended-basic cable,
premium cable, and satellite. Larger households tend not to buy extended-
basic cable as readily as smaller households. Diﬀerences by household size
with respect to the other alternatives are highly insigniﬁcant. A dummy for
whether the household rents its dwelling is included in the two cable alter-
natives and separately in the satellite alternative. These variables account
for the fact that renters are perhaps less able to install a cable hookup and
less willing to incur the capital cost of a satellite dish than a household that
owns its dwelling. The estimated coeﬃcients are negative, conﬁrming these
expectations. Finally, a dummy for whether the household lives in a single-
family dwelling enters the satellite alternative, to account for the fact that
it is relatively diﬃcult to install a satellite dish on a multi-family dwelling.
As expected, the estimated coeﬃcient is positive.
     The residuals from the ﬁrst-stage price regressions enter the model to
account for the omitted attributes. These control functions are created
as follows. The price in each market was regressed against the product
attributes listed in Table 1 plus Hausman (1997a)-type price instruments.
The price instrument for market m is calculated as the average price in
other markets that are served by the same multiple system operator as
market m. A separate instrument is created for the price of extended-basic
cable and the price of premium cable. Separate regressions were run for
extended-basic price and premium price, using all of the instruments in
each equation (the instruments are discussed later). The residuals were
calculated from the estimated regressions. These residuals enter without
transformation in the mixed logit model. For the main speciﬁcation the
residual from the extended-basic cable price regression enters the extended-
basic cable alternatives, and similarly for the premium cable.
     The residuals enter signiﬁcantly and with the expected sign. In particu-
lar, a positive residual occurs when the price of the product is higher than
can be explained by observed attributes and other observed factors. A pos-


                                      15
itive residual suggests that the product possesses desirable attributes that
are not included in the analysis. The residual entering the demand model
with a positive coeﬃcient is consistent with this interpretation.
    As stated above, the appropriate control function to include is a spec-
iﬁcation issue. We experimented with other speciﬁcations, including the
use of both residuals in each alternative, a series expansion on the residuals
(both signed and unsigned), random coeﬃcients on the residuals, and the
residuals interacted with other variables. In all cases, the extra generality
did not aﬀect the estimated parameters, and the hypothesis that the sim-
pler speciﬁcation is correct could not be rejected at any reasonable level of
conﬁdence.12
    We turn now to the ﬁxed eﬀect approach. All of the elements of util-
ity that do not vary within a market are subsumed into the ﬁxed eﬀects.
The ﬁxed eﬀects are expressed as a function of price and other observed
attributes:
                         δmj = αpmj + βxmj + ξmj .
The utility speciﬁcation given above becomes:
                               5
                               
                Unj = δmj +          θg pmj dgn + kj sn + σνn cj + ˜nj .
                               g=2

Assuming ˜nj and νn are iid extreme value and standard normal respectively
leads to a mixed logit of the same form as for the control function approach
except with ﬁxed eﬀects for each alternative and market.
    Estimation is performed in two stages. First the mixed logit model is
estimated, using the contraction procedure described above for the ﬁxed
eﬀects. Then the ﬁxed eﬀects are regressed against the product attributes
using 3SLS. A separate equation is used for the extended-basic cable, pre-
mium cable, and satellite ﬁxed eﬀects, with the coeﬃcients of the product
attributes constrained across equations so as to be consistent with the usual
BLP approach (and the model in Table 1). The negative of the number of
over-the-air channels enters these equations, since this attribute enters the
  12
    We also tested for speciﬁcation issues unrelated to the control function, including
random coeﬃcients of other variables, and other types of error components. The sim-
pler speciﬁcation could not be rejected, and the parameters estimates were essentially
unchanged.

antenna-only alternative in the model of Table 1 whereas it is now entering
the ﬁxed eﬀects of the non-antenna alternatives.
    The results are given in Table 2. The bottom part of the table gives
the estimates of the demographic coeﬃcients in the mixed logit model. The
top part of the table gives the results of the regression of ﬁxed eﬀects on
product attributes. The ﬁrst column at the top gives the OLS results, which
do not account for omitted attributes, and the second column gives the 3SLS
results.
    As with the control function approach, the correction for omitted vari-
ables raises the price coeﬃcient. Without correction, three of the ﬁve in-
come groups receive a positive estimated price coeﬃcient. With correction,
all groups obtain a signiﬁcantly negative price coeﬃcient.
    The estimated base price coeﬃcient is -.0922, compared to the -0.0969
obtained with the control function approach.13 The diﬀerence is not statis-
tically signiﬁcant at any reasonable conﬁdence level. The estimates of θg ,
the incremental price coeﬃcient for higher income groups, are very similar
under the two approaches. As in the control function approach, the number
of cable channels obtains a negative coeﬃcient when endogeneity is ignored
and becomes positive as expected when the endogeneity is corrected. All
of the product attributes obtain similar values as with the control function
approach. We tested the hypothesis that the coeﬃcients of the product at-
tributes and the base price coeﬃcient are the same as the point estimates
from the control function approach (i.e., as in Table 1.) The test statistic
for a Wald test is 0.88, which with ﬁve degrees of freedom has a P -value of
0.9717, indicating that the hypothesis of equality cannot be rejected at any
meaningful level of conﬁdence.14
    The demographic coeﬃcients in Table 2 provide similar conclusions as
  13
     Since the paper was ﬁrst circulated, our ﬁnding of similar estimates under the two
approaches has been reported on two other datasets by diﬀerent authors. J-P Dubé re-
estimated the ﬁxed eﬀects model in Chintagunta, Dubé, and Goh (2002) for margarine
demand using a control function approach. He reported that the estimates and implied
elasticities are very similar under the two methods, and diﬀerent from those estimates
obtained without either correction. Karaca-Mandic (2002) reported the same ﬁnding for
her demand model for DVDs.
  14
     This test does not account for the variation in the estimates from the control function
approach; however, the P value for a test that takes this variation into account would be
even higher.

those from the control function approach. Education induces households to
buy less TV reception. Larger households tend not to buy extended-basic
cable, and other diﬀerences are not signiﬁcant. Renters tend not to buy
cable and satellite as readily as owners. And single-family dwellers tend
to purchase satellite reception more readily than households who live in
multi-family dwellings.
    Table 3 gives price elasticities from the models for each approach. Given
that the price coeﬃcients are nearly the same from the two methods, similar
elasticities would be expected, except for one issue. In particular, the two
methods calculate elasticities at diﬀerent probabilities for each household.
The ﬁxed eﬀects approach calculates elasticities at the probabilities that
arise when ﬁxed eﬀects are included in the model, such that forecasted shares
equal sample shares in each market. For the control function approach,
forecasted shares need not exactly equal the sample shares in each market.15
As Table 3 indicates, this potential diﬀerence does not cause the elasticities
to diﬀer, as the two methods provide very similar estimates.
    Since we estimate both approaches, we can undertake a test of speciﬁ-
cation that tells us whether omitting ξ˜mj − λj µ̂mj from the control function
speciﬁcation aﬀects estimates of parameters. The point estimates are almost
identical in both cases, and tests for diﬀerences in parameter estimates with
and without ξ˜mj − λj µ̂mj as an additional regressor fail to reject “no diﬀer-
ences” at any reasonable level of signiﬁcance.
    As always with endogeneity, the selection of instruments is an issue.
As stated above, we used the product attributes and Hausman-type prices
as instruments, which follows the practice adopted in Goolsbee and Petrin.
The use of Hausman-type price instruments can be controversial (Bresnahan,
1997; Hausman, 1997b). In our context, these instruments are appropriate
if the prices of the same multiple system operator in other markets reﬂect
common costs of the multiple system operator but not common unobserved
attributes.
    With disaggregate data for several markets, market-level averages of the
demographic variables may be valid instruments if they aﬀect market price
  15
     The model under the control function approach could be calibrated to each market
prior to forecasting, such that market shares equal sample shares under this model also.
This is a hybrid approach where ﬁxed eﬀects are not used in estimation but are calculated
for forecasting.

and are uncorrelated with the remaining error term. For example, con-
sider two households that have the same demographics but live in areas
where the aggregate demographics are diﬀerent. Part of the price diﬀerence
between the two areas may be attributable to the diﬀerence in aggregate
demographics. If this part is not correlated with unobserved attributes,
aggregate demographics are valid instruments.
    We re-estimated the models with the demographic variables included as
extra instruments. The base price coeﬃcient under the ﬁxed eﬀects approach
dropped from -.0922 to -.0739, which, while noticeable, is not a statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerence. With the control function approach, the base price
coeﬃcient was very similar with or without the demographics as instruments.
We also re-estimated both models without using the Hausman-type prices
as instruments, that is, just using aggregate demographics as instruments.
In every case these estimates were similar across the models, and tests for
diﬀerences cannot reject the “no diﬀerences” hypothesis.

4    Conclusion
With disaggregate (i.e., customer-level) models of demand, price is not
necessarily endogenous in the traditional sense, since the demand of the
customer does not usually aﬀect market price. However, omitted product
attributes can result in correlation between the price and the unobserved
portion of utility: the market mechanism causes the price to be higher for
products that display desirable attributes that are observed by consumers
but not measured by the econometrician. Since these attributes aﬀect de-
mand at the customer level, price can be correlated with the error term even
in disaggregate models.
    One popular solution to this econometric problem, proposed by BLP, is
to include product-market ﬁxed eﬀects. We suggest an alternative approach
based on control functions. The basic idea is to include extra variables in the
estimation equation that condition out (i.e., control for) the part of the error
that is correlated with the regressors. We implement it in a discrete choice
environment where price endogeneity often raises econometric concerns.
    For general cases the assumptions under the control function approach
diﬀer from those for the ﬁxed eﬀects approach, with neither set of assump-
tions necessarily being nested within the other. For many questions the
control function approach can be implemented in the most popular statis-
tical packages, while the ﬁxed eﬀects approach usually requires the use of
a lower-level programming language. Additionally, the control function ap-
proach is available in some situations for which the BLP approach is not. In
this paper we describe both approaches and apply them to disaggregate data
on customers’ choice among TV options. We ﬁnd that the two approaches
provide very similar estimates, including a substantial increase in the price
response when either correction is applied.

Appendix
We obtained information on households’ television choices, the character-
istics of households, and the prices and attributes of the cable franchise
serving the household’s geographic area. This information comes from two
sources, the Forrester Technographics 2001 survey and Warren Publishing’s
2001 Television and Cable Factbook. The Forrester survey was designed to
be a nationally representative sample of households. It asks respondents
about their ownership and use of various electronic and computer-related
goods. To these data we match information about cable franchises from
Warren Publishing’s 2001 Factbook, which is the most comprehensive ref-
erence for cable system attributes and prices in the industry.
    To minimize sampling error in market shares, we restricted our analysis
to markets where there are at least 30 respondents in the Forrester sur-
vey. This screen yields 300 cable franchise markets with a total of almost
30,000 households. We randomly choose 172 of these 300 markets, so as
to reduce the number of ﬁxed eﬀects that needed to be estimated. From
these 172 markets, we randomly selected 11810 households, oversampling
those households from smaller markets (again, to minimize sampling error).
These 11810 households are used in the estimation with weights equal to
the inverse of their probability of being sampled.
    As stated in the body of the paper, the alternatives in the discrete choice
model are: expanded basic cable, premium cable (which can only be pur-
chased bundled with expanded basic), Direct Broadcast Satellite, and no
multi-channel video (i.e., local antenna reception only). In the Forrester
survey, respondents reported whether they have cable or satellite, and the
amount they spend on premium television. We classiﬁed respondents as
having premium if they reported that they have cable and spend more than
$10 per month on premium viewing, which is the average price of the most
popular premium channel, HBO. We classiﬁed respondents as choosing ex-
panded basic if they reported that they have cable and they spend less than
$10 per month on premium viewing.
    The survey provides various demographic characteristics, including fam-
ily income, household size, education, and type of living accommodations.
It also includes an identiﬁer for the household’s television market, which can
be used to link households to their cable franchise provider.


                                      22
    The cable franchise market of each surveyed household was matched
to cable system information from Warren Publishing’s 2001 Television and
Cable Factbook. The attributes we include are the channel capacity of a
cable system, the number of pay channels available, whether pay per view
is available from that cable franchise, the price of basic plus expanded basic
service, and the price of premium service. We also obtain from the Fact-
book the number of over-the-air channels available in the franchise market.
Finally, for the price of satellite, we use $50 per month plus an annual $100
installation and equipment cost.
