               Prospects for Liberalizing the International Trading S,'stem


       The first half of       the   l980s was perhaps the most turbulent period for the
international economy since the Second World War. The second oil price in-
crease in 1979—80 and the disinflationary response of most OECD goverments
led to a series of major economic difficulties. Worl&jide recession resulted,
and with it came a nurrber of highly—publicized economic ills. These included
the "debt crisis' of some developing countries, the drop in primary commodity
prices, ultimately including oil, and the first drop (in 1982) in the value
and volume of world trade in any year since the end of the Second World War.
For the United States, some of the difficulty was at first hidden as expan-
sionary fiscal policy offset tight monetary policy. However,                         as most
economists had forecast, that irrbalance gave rise to a series of events — in-
cluding strong appreciation of the dollar, a sharp rise in real interest rates
in the United States and abroad, and large swings in current account balances
among the developed countries — which led to further dislocations both in the
United States and in other major trading nations.
    In   these   circumstances, it was small wonder that protectionist pressures
grew strongly in many countries. Indeed, as I shall arge later, the real
surprise      should be that   protectionism did not       increase even more    than   it   in

fact   did!

  Now    that the worst of      the   recession   is   several   years behind us and moderate

growth has resumed,. it can be argjed that the world economy is at a
crossroads: either the protectionist pressures and measures of recent years
will continue to mount, or there rrust be a fundamental reversal of those
trends. Given the irrportance of that choice in affecting the future economic
growth and levels of well—being of all nations, of conference on Survival and
Growth in a Polycentric World Economy is certainly an appropriate place to


                                                  1
assess the extent to which protectionism has increased, and to evaluate the
prospects for future liberalization of the international economy.
       As Adam Smith long ago pointed out, protectionist pressures are always
with us. That has been true throughout the period since the Second World War.
At     any point in time,          the degree of liberalization of the trade and payments
regime of any country,             and also    of the      world   at large,    can be viewed as an
"eqjilibrium' between           the forces     and   demands for protection, on one hand, and
those for      a liberal international trading order, on the                   other.
     Analysis     of the prospects        for a liberal international order must             therefore
start      by identifying the factors tending to increase protectionism and those
working toward free trade. That is the major thrust of this paper.
       A natural starting point, in Section 1, is a brief review of the                       factors
that led        to the      liberalization       and growth of the        international   economy that

was the hallmark of the 1945—1973 period. A second section contains an
analysis of the changes in pressures, and the resulting shifts in trade policy
and international economic relations in the period 1973 to 1986 from a macro-
economic perspective. The third section then focuses on some institutional
issues that have arisen as a result of trade and growth in the international
economy.       Their resolution may prove the key to resunption of a trend toward
liberalization. A final section provides an assessment of those factors in the
international economy that can be expected to be conducive to continued
liberalization of the system and those that seem likely to give rise to fur-
ther    pressures for protectionism.


1. The Golden Years of Trade Liberalization: 1945 to 1973.
     There is little doubt that, several hundred years hence, economic his-
torians will mark the third quarter of the twentieth century as being
phenomenal in two interrelated regards: 1). the period witnessed sustained


                                                       2
growth of the international economy at a rate far in excess of any rate ear-
her experienced in any part of the globe for a coffparable time period; and 2)
the long and sustained boom was accoTpanied (and in part led) by a tremendous
liberalization in the economic relations among the developed countries.
    It is now frequently forgotten that conteirporary observers in the late
1950s and early 1960s attributed the rapid growth of the first postwar years
to recovery, and regarded it as a transitory phenomenon. Instead, however, if
anything economic growth accelerated, and with it the international economy
became increasingly integrated. The late l940s witnessed the formation of the
European Payments Union, as Europe began to move away from strictly bilateral
clearing arrangements. During the early 1950s, convertibility for current ac-
count transactions rose dramatically and European and Japanese exports began
to grow rapidly. By the late l950s, the first round of rrjlti1ateral nego-
tiations for tariff reductions took place, and currencies were becoming in-
creasingly convertible. It is now often forgotten that as late as 1958 there
were only four countries that had declared convertibilty under Article VIII.
   Further trade and payments liberalization aocoupanied growth throughout the
1960s and into the early 1970s. For present purposes, the iriportant question
is to identify those factors that contributed to the ilTpetus to liberaliza-
tion. It must, of course, be recognized that the process, once started, had a
built—in momentum, as the rapid economic growth, resulting in part from
liberalization itself, made further liberalization possible. Not only did
growth make further liberalization easier, but in addition, some liberaliza-
tion was a natural result   of increasing foreign exchange   earnings   which per-
mitted the authorities to remove remaining controls on current account trans—
actions.
   But a nurrber of other pressures toward liberalization also facilitated the
process. The Treaty of Rome and the success of the Coninon    Market    in its early

                                        3
phases resulted in de facto liberalization of trade.1
      Some of it was the result   of   the continued trend toward lower real costs
of transport and conmjnications — itself a major force for increasing the in-
tegration of the international economy. In addition to all of these phenomena,
there was also the growth — gracijal at the beginning but accelerating in the
1960s —of the private international capital market, especially between North
nerica and Europe which was not only important in its own right but also
served as a further liberalizing factor in trade relations.
      For understanding the momentum    toward liberalization, it   is   also irrportant

to    recognize the role of the United States. (t least until the 1970s, there
was a reasonably solid consensus that an open multilateral trading system was
in (merican political and economic self—interest. Partly because foreign
policy interests were regarded by some as being at least as important as
economic interests, the United States could assume something of a leadership
role in the international economy which was inportant in assuring the con-
tinued trend: (merican support for the European Payments Union, the Coiiiion
Market, and the successive round of multilateral tariff negotiations under
GTT at least facilitated these trade—creating activities and may have been a
necessary condition for them.
     If one were to identify forces for liberalization in the 1950s and l960s,
then, they would include: 1) the political momentum of growth which in part
reciced political pressures against liberalization (which permitted the redjc—

significantly matter. See, for example Jean—Francois Hennart, The Political

argues that the Common Market resulted in the neutralization of growth—
retarding common—interest organizations:..first, French sovereignty over some
important economic matters has been reduced. Second, the power of French or-
ganized interests has been adversely affected by the internationalization of
the French economy. (P. 189). .          .

tion of trade restrictions within the Camon Market to accelerate), 2) the
strong cooinitment of the United States to an open international trading system
and the willingness of that country to take a leadership role in the GATT and
in successive rounds of trade negotiations (notwithstanding the I½erican
Congress' refusal to ratify the International Trade Organization), 3) the
costs (which had been an almost constant source of increasing integration of
the international economy since the early iBOOs); and 4) rapid economic growth
itself, which both resulted from and fed the liberalization process among the
developed countries.
   There were, however, some offsetting pressures toward increased protec-
tionism. Chief among these was the tendency among almost all developing
countries to adopt highly restrictionist trade and paents regimes, and to
attelTpt to insulate their domestic economies from the international market; by
the 1960s, this was strongly reflected in the declining shares of exports and
irrports in most developing countries' national incomes and           developing
countries' demands for a Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and depar-
tures from the multilateral system. However, there were other protectionist
pressures.    The first nontariff measures restricting trade in textiles were
taken in 1955, with a precursor of the current Ntiltifiber Arrangement (NFA).2
In similar vein, the United States had opposed the inclusion of trade in
agricultural products within the GTT and the EC was developing policies which
were, at first, only mildly restrictionist but which would, later on,     become

highly so as European agriculture responded to these measures.
    The extent of protectionist pressures during the 1950s and l960s, is often
forgotten. Writing in the mid—l970s, Charles R. Frank, Jr. could talk about

the "crisis of protectionismof the late 1960s.3 The most restrictionist piece
of legislation to gain serious support in the U.S. Congress was the Burke—
Hartke Bill in 1969, which was defeated in the House of Representatives by one
vote.    Thus, even        in the heyday of trade liberalization, it was      not   true that
all   pressures worked toward liberalization, nor that            there   was no opposition
to an open nultilateral trading system.
    Table    1   provides some data on the growth of world trade and world (P. As
can be seen world real P is estimated to have increased 2.6 times in the two
decades following 1950, inplying an average annual rate of growth of 4.96 per-
cent and a rate of growth of per capita income of about 3 percent. This con-
trasts with economic historians' estimates that the most rapidly growing
countries in the nineteenth century experienced growth rates of about 1.5 per-
cent per capita, and of course, most parts of the world experienced little or
no growth during       that   century..4
      During the same two decades from 1950 to 1970, the volume of world trade
expanded even more rapidly, increasing 4.8 times, for an average annual growth
rate of 8.1 percent. As already mentioned, most of that growth of trade was
concentrated in the OECD countries, as the shares of most developing countries
in world trade      were    falling.
      Table 2 provides sumary statistics showing the relationship of trade
growth to world G\P growth. The first column provides estimates of the elas-
ticity of world trade in manufactures with respect to real growth of world
Q'1P. From 1950 to 1955, for exanple, world trade in manufactures grew 1.2 per-
cent for every percentage point growth in world trade. The overall volume of

trade, manufactures and primary cownodities, grew 1.14 percent for every per-
centage point of real growth. Those elasticities INCREASED throughout the
1950s and 1960s, reaching 1.32 for manufactures and 1.19 for total trade in
the 1965—70 period. Because an elasticity greater than 1 implies a rising
share of trade in &'IP, the rising elasticities are even more remarkable: ul-
timately they must decline and approach 1 (as all goods become traded, if not
before).
    As   the data in Tables 1 and 2 bring out clearly, by the early l970s, the
international economy was vastly more open and integrated than it had been
twenty years earlier. It could fairly be said that successive rounds of
liberalization of trade had resulted in a situation in which tariffs were no
longer a significant barrier to trade in manufactures among the OECD
countries. At the end of the Kennedy Round, it was estimated that tariffs on
dutiable nonagricultural products averaged 9.9 percent in the Uni ted States,
8.6 percent in the European Community, 10.8 percent in the United Kingdom and
10.7 percent in Japan.5. Further cuts, negotiated during the Tokyo Round, and
scheduled to take effect during the 1980s, had left tariffs which were bound
at extremely low levels among the industrial countries.
   As already mentioned, the European Community was not, in its early years, a
trade—diverting organization. Increases in agricultural productivity in the
early post—war years were probably economically efficient and thus it is
likely that agricultural protectioniii did not significantly worsen at least
until the late 1960s and possibly until the entry of the U.K. into the Common
Market.6 Trade in manufactures expanded rapidly both within Europe and between

2. Conflicting Trends:1973 to 1986
        The inflationary   pressures and conodity boom of the early l970s      cul-

minated in the three—fold increase in the price of oil in the fall of 1973.
Until that happened, world trade had expanded rapidly. Uthough the major
trading nations had abandoned the Bretton Woods systein of fixed exchange rates
by the spring of 1973, that abandonment had come about because of the in—
tolerable pressures placed on countries attenpting to support their currencies
in the faóe of large international capital flows — themselves the result of
the integration of the private international capital market.
   With the oil price increase, however,7          a new set of strains enveloped
the world economy. Between 1973 and 1980, for the most part, these tensions
were met primarily through accelerated inflation. Protectionist rhetoric grew
sharply, and world economic growth decelerated. Nonetheless, in an inflation—
ary environment, deceleration was not pronounced, as can be seen in Table 1:
between 1960 and 1970, world real GNP had increased by 69 percent; between
1970 and 1980 it rose by 47 percent. Likewise, the growth of world trade con-
tinued to outpace the growth of world GNP, rising by 63 percent over the
decade. cuthough slightly less buoyant than in the 1960s, the elasticity of
manufactured trade with respect to output remained well above one, while the
elasticity with respect to total world trade fell to 1.04 and 1.06, largely
reflecting a reduced volume of trade in oil.
    s in the l950s and l960s, there were some pressures for increased
protection and some for more liberal trade. Noteworthy among those factors


7. It can plausibly be argued that had the exchange rate system not changed
prior to the oil price increase, the magnitude of the effects would have been
far greater and more serious than it in fact was.



                                        8
tending to integrate the international econoni' were the shift in policies of a
significant nunter of developing countries.8 Likewise, concern over inflation
rates was a significant consideration for many countries in their decisions           to

maintain   open   trade policies. Lower real costs of transport and co4wnunication
continued to serve as an integrating force. And, of course, the Tokyo Round of
trade negotiations insured further cuts in already—low tariff rates among the
incijstrial countries.
    Offsetting     these   factors, however, some protectionist pressures inten-
sified. There were several renewals of the Niultifiber Arrangement,          each    ap-
parently on more restrictive terms than the last. A nurrber of other "Voluntary
Export Restraints, and an EC agricultural policy which was increasingly
protectionist in effect also reflected an increase in protectionist pressures.
In addition, pressures on iron and steel, shipbuilding, and other traditional
indjstries intensified, and, in the context of labor market rigidities and
high unemployment, these phenomena also increased protectionist pressures.
   Underlying these intensified pressures were several identifiable factors:
1) higher unemployment rates in Europe and North nerica following the oil
price increase clearly increased the calls for protection; 2) associated with
higher unemployment was slower growth of real (P, which also contributed; and
3) the emergence of some developing countries as significant exporters of
labor—intensive manufacturers intensified pressures for adjustments in domes-
tic injstries which were naturally resisted.
   These three sources of pressure were clearly interrelated: slower growth
was in part the cause of high unemployment, and, to the extent that                 high

unemployment rates were structural, they contributed to slower growth.

Likewise, the          penetration of developed countries' markets for manufactures
would    have resulted in less discomfort in an envirorinent of more rapid growth
and more rapidly expanding employment opportunities in the expanding ac-
tivities of the industrial countries.
     However, it was difficult to provide meaningful nurrbers with which to
document the rise in protectionism. Indeed, in 1982, Helen Righes and I wrote
a paper in which we attempted to show that the data did not bear out the then—
prevalent view that protectionism had increased sharply, at least toward the
developing countries that were widely believed to be the target of most
protectionist measures. Je concluded that:
             .the    overwhelming impression is that      despite   all the public discussion
of protection and the political            pressures for it, the effects        on imports of
manufactures from developing countries of protectionist measures were rela-
tively small.         The rate   of increase of LDC     market shares was sufficiently    great
that    it   is difficult          to imagine   that rates   would have been significantly
higher    in the      absence of any protectionist measures.'9
     In the aggregate           these   remarks are also borne out     by   the data in Tables   1


and 2.        The     elasticity of trade in manufactures with respect to world GNP
growth       was 1.14, somewhat lower than it had            earlier   been, but it was   recog-

nized    that       earlier rates of growth of trade were probably unsustainable.
Moreover,           insofar   as world real GNP had grown    more slowly, there was further
reason to accept the recorded figure as being well within the range                   that   was

consistent          with   maintenance of the open international trading system.l°

10. There is also a question as to whether the more rapid growth of services
trade might not tend to lower the recorded trade—GNP elasticities. For present
purposes, however, that question is not central to the argument and is there-
fore ignored.


                                                   10
   Overall, the diagnosis on the period 1973—1980 ifust be that protectionist
pressures increased enough ring the late l970s to rece the momentum toward
a more liberalized international econorry but that protectionist forces had not
grown enough to lead on balance to a more restrictive international trading
system. While protectionist pressures had intensified enough to slow down the
thrust of liberalization, they were not strong enough in that period, at least
according to observable data,       to outweigh the continuing momentum of
liberalization.
   Then came the events of the early 1980s: the antiinflationary response to
the oil price increase by the CCD countries, the worldwide recession of the
early 19805 and the inability of many developing countries to continue servic-
ing their debts in those circumstances, the appreciation in real terms of the
U.S. dollar and the large capital inflows into the U.S. in response to high
real interest rates associated with expansionary fiscal and tight monetary
policy.
   It cannot be doubted that protectionist pressures intensified. The higher
unenployrnent associated with worldwide recession was one key factor. As al-
ways, the   slowdown in growth itself contributed directly to increased protec-
tionist   pressures. Likewise, in developing countries, the trend toward more

open trade and payments regimes of the l970s was halted and in many cases sig-
nificantly reversed as debt—servicing difficulties led to      qiantitative
restrictions on inports and the reintroduction of high barriers to inports.
And, as heavily indebted developing countries redjced their irrports from the
developed countries while sirrultaneously atterrpting to increase their exports,
that put further pressure on significant sectors of economic activity in the
developed countries. And, perhaps most significant of all, the real apprecia-
tion of the dollar put tremendous pressure on f½Terican exporting and irrçort—
competing interests, and led to wholesale reduction of support for an open


                                       11
trading system in that important country.
   Meanwhile, some protectionist tendencies, earlier at work, intensifed.
Chief among these was the impact of the EC agricultural policies; earlier, the
EC's protectionism had resulted in reduced imports of agricultural commodities
from the rest of the world; by the 1980s, those policies had resulted in such
large increases in output that the EC became an exporter. For many countries,
including the United States, this put considerable pressure on agricultural
exporting interests, and eroded yet another base of support f or free trade.
  Even the early l9BOs was not entirely bleak, however. P few significant
developments did tend to result In pressures for increased trade liberaliza-
tion. First and probably most important, the technology of the "third in-
dustrial revolution' In information and communications system greatly in-
creased the gains to be realized from an open international trading system.
Not only were time and distance costs of communication and transmission of in-
formation reduced, but the new technology permitted the geographic separation
of engineering and other highly skilled activities from physical production to
a much greater degree than was earlier possible. Simultaneously, the new tech-
nology increased the premium to be placed on large production runs of highly
specialized parts and components of complex equipment: a situation in which
the gains from trade are enormously greater, and in which firms which can
operate in more than one geographic region will have an enormous competitive
edge over firms constrained by protection to operate only in their home
markets.
   Secondly, a nuirber of countries' policy—makers reversed past protectionist
policies, either because the need for greater efficiency was recognized or be-
cause the harsh realities of the world of the 1980s dictated such a reversal.
Notable and early starters among them were such diverse countries as Turkey
and New Zealand. While those early starts were to a considerable extent offset


                                      12
by increases in protectionism elsewhere, they maintained their momentum toward
more liberalized and open economies, while other countries began moving in the
same direction by 1984 and 1985.
   As the data in Tables 1 and 2 indicate, the growth of world G'IP slowed down
markedly in the early 19805. Despite that, the elasticity of world trade with
respect to world Q'W remained L03, while that for manufactured exports was
L12. Although       those   numbers are   not   as irrpressive as the 1.32 and 1.19
figjres     for 1965—70, they nonetheless are not consistent with the view that
the world had turned entirely away from the earlier open international
economy -

   Some further evidence supporting this conclusion is contained in Table 3.
There, data used by Hughes and Krueger is updated. Focussing on developing
countries' exports (which have, after all, been a major focal point of protec-
tionist pressures), the numbers clearly show that the developing countries'
shares of world exports of manufactures rose from 8.9 percent in 1980 to 11 9
percent in 1985. Except for the 1984-85 drop (and it might be argjed that 1984
was the abnormal year), there is little in the data to show any significant
retardation of the trend toward larger shares. While the increase might have
been larger in the absence of protectionist measures, an increase of about
one—third in share in a period of five years is hardly consistent with highly
restrictionist trade practices on the part of the iirporting countries. Given
theslow economic growth in the international economy and the turbulence of the
early 1980s, what is perhaps most remarkable is that developing countries'
share of world trade continued to grow, and that there continued to be an in-
creasing fraction of world output that entered into international trade.
   It is evident, therefore, that the world economy is at a crossroads: either
the pressures for liberalization will increase, or the world will move away
from the open rrultilateral   trading system    that served it so well over the

                                          13
1945—1980 period. Before assessing the pressures working toward and against
liberalization, however, a nurrber          of    institutionalissues,that may have an im-
portant bearing      on the outcome, require examination.



3. Institutional   rrangements      and   Prospects for Liberalization
       Thus   far,   discussion has       taken   place in terms of conflicting pressures
for    trade liberalization and     for   protection. However, it was recognized that
institutions      matter, and    that institutional arrangements strengthened some

pressures.     The GATT itself was such an institution as the existence of rr&ilti—

lateral    trade negotiations, and          the   practice of binding negotiated tariffs,
was conducive to greater reductions in tariffs than might have been politi-

cally feasible unilaterally.

   g   question   arises as to the efficacy of the present institutional structure

in restraining or intensifying protectionist pressures. On one hand, tariffs

are no longer the principal instrument of restrictive trade policy. Moreover,

a nurrber of countries have emerged as important international traders and it

can be     questioned whether the          techniques      of bilateral tariff negotiations
among a limited number of large trading blocks, the                  institution which worked
so well for tariff reductions, is appropriate in today's world.

   If one examines       the list   of issues         that trade   representatives have raised

for the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, many of them focus on areas where
the current international institutional arrangements seem less adequate than
they were for tariff negotiations.
   Clearly the     concerns which have led to the emergence            of   NTB5, agricultural

distortions,      and protectionist measures against the NICs are to some degree
the outcome of the competing pulls of pressures for protection and for an
open trading system discussed       in Sections 1 and 2.           Economic growth and techni-

cal change have both served to increase the relative importance of trade in


                                                 14
services, another issue over which some degree of trade friction has arisen.
   In all these cases, however, institutions matter. The institution of the
EC, when it was founded, was itself a force for liberalization. Likewise, the
successsive rounds of trade negotiations were an institution which restrained
countries from unilateral increases in tariff protection and simultaneously
made is relatively easier to resist protectionist pressures in particular sec-
tors.    If institutions can be adapted to address the new issues reasonably
satisfactorily, protectionist pressures will have less force relative to those
for an open international economic order. In this section, the main institu-
tional issues associated with the major     trouble areas   are   addressed.



   3..l Nontariff Barriers
    The success of the GPTT has been that tariff barriers to trade, at least
among most of the industrial countries, have been virtually eliminated. It
might be argjed that many of the nontariff barriers (NTB5) to trade in
manufactures have been put in place becausee tariffs were bound and countries
could not resort to their use under the G(TT. On that view, elimination of
tariffs has siirply induced countries to substitute less transparent for more
transparent means of protection.
   However, it is at least equally plausible that, mercantilist though they
are in spirit, multilateral negotiations for reducing trade barriers are an
effective institutionredjcing the force of protectionist pressures.            The in-
stitutional arrangement of multilateral negotiations may in fact lead to a
recognition that protection of some activities is disprotection of others, and
lead to irrproved societal decision making as it forces recognition that
protecting some activities necessarily foregoes exports in other lines of
economic activity.
   To   the extent   that   this latter view has validity, finding mechanisms to


                                          15
permit multilateral negotiations to reduce nontariff barriers to trade assumes
urgency. For, to date, NTBs have been negotiated on a sector-by—sector basis.
For   exaJTDle, the FFA is negotiated separately from NIBs       in steel, which are
again treated separately from agricultural NIBs. fl-js far, countries have not
found means of putting NIBs on the table in a manner which would permit, for
example, reduction or removal of the MFA by the developed countries, reduction
in agricultural NIBs by Europe and Japan, reduction in quantitative restric-
tions on imports of capital goods by developing countries, and liberalization
of the NICs' markets for labor-intensive goods. Clearly, institutional ar-
rangements which lead to sector—by—sector negotiations are more likely to be
protectionist than arrangements which result in negotiations among Ministers
responsible for an overview of the economy. And, to date, there seems little
basis to believe that "Codes" are an entirely satisfactory answer.
      There are precedents, such as the phased liberalization of quantitative
restrictions under the European Payments Union and Japanese removal of QRs,
which could be used to devise across—the—board quantification of NTBs with a
view to negotiations as to the rate at which they would be eliminated.              To

date, however, there has been little effort aimed at developing such a frame-
work. Failure   to do so will   surely strengthen   the   ability of protectionists in
the affected sectors to increase barriers to trade.


  3.2 Barriers to Trade in Agriculture
      If one were to attempt to identify trends in the world economy since 1970,
one important one would surely be the impact of increasingly restrictive
agricultural policies by Japan, the EC, other European countries, and to a
lesser extent the United States.
  It can, of course, be argued that there are pressures for liberalization
within those countries that are protecting their agriculture. Chief among


                                         16
these is that the budgetary costs of continued protection are rising. Secon-
darily, there are some indications that consumer awareness of the costs of
protection in agriculture is increasing.J' Possibly more important, however,
is the fact that there are a significant nurrber of countries, both developed
and developing, that are net exporters of agricultural coffrnodities. These
countries' goverrinents recognize the damage that agricultural protection is
inflicting   upon their own pro<±Jcers.
     Because of       this, several institutional questions   arise.    A first is why

agricultural issues      are outside the sphere of GATI. Their omission has cer-

tainly    rendered agricultural protection easier. A second      question is whether

institutional    means can be devised so that coalitions of countries can repre—
sent their interests jointly. That issue has ramifications far         beyond   agricul-
ture, and is    the   subject   of Sect. 3.3



  3.3    Bilateral Bargaining
  The GAIT represented a highly satisfactory forum for trade negotiations
among the large trading     nations:   the U.S., the EC, EFTA, and Japan. However,
now that the large trading nations themselves are concerned with the trade
policies and practices of NICS and some of the      larger developing countries, it

is questionable whether the bilateral reciprocity         techniques that charac-
terized   the earlier rounds of trade negotiations will be quite as effective in

inckjcing the multiple—party, multiple—coiiodity negotiations that current
issues seem to   warrant.

  The    absence of workable techniques for establisrnent of coalitions of ex-
porters renders their effective representation difficult. Although the so—

Protection, Allen and Unwin, Australia, 1986, for an analysis of the factors
leading   to protection, especially in Japan.



                                               17
called "Cairnes group of agricultural exporters has certainly made a start in
that direction,      the institutional problems         of    their conon representation
(which are probably mirrored by exporters          of   textiles, clothing and     footwear)

are   far from resolved..   Even among the Cairnes           Group, there are identifiably
separate interests between exporters of temperate and of tropical comodities,
for example.    There are, however, also comon interests among all agricultural

exporters. Existing arrangements seem conducive to emphasizing the differences

in interest, and to discourage coalitions of a kind which would provide incen-

tives for acting in concert for cormion interests.

      If institutional mechanisms could be devised for simultaneous bargaining

between,    say, agricultural exporters and         importers, textile and clothing ex-

porters and importers,      exporters and importers of electrical and electronic
equipment, and exporters and inporters of mechanical machinery and equipment,

it would certainly increase the       likelihood    that attractive    packages of trade
barrier    reductions could be devised. Nonetheless, as even this simple example

suggests, finding a mechanism to accomplish this is fraught with difficulty.
   The "Cairnes Group' represented the first attempt             to devise one   such coali-

tion. The    problems associated with devising          arrangements conducive to coali-
tional representation seem formidable. Their absence, however, reduces                   the

strength   of the   pressures   for liberalization in a polycentric world.


   3.4. Trade in Services
   In   the past, the majority of international trade consisted of the exchange
of physical goods among countries. These goods might have been produced with
services as irputs, but the technology of international trade was largely that
of transporting commodities from one country to another. That technology, in
turn, led to the use of tariffs and other measures which could be administered
at the border, when the good physically entered the country.


                                           18
   Services, and especially services of a type used as an             i rpu t   into proJc—
tion,     have   increased in ilTportance as    specialized finance,      insurance, en-
gineering skills, and        other   lines of activity have developed.   The informatics
revolution, currently in progress, will increase         this   tendency even further.

   To   a considerable extent, this trend in          itself represents         a   presssure

toward     liberalization. It is far more difficult (and it may prove far more
costly) to regulate international transmission of conuter designs and finan-
cial data than it is to relate shipments of coal and steel. However, there
may be national concerns (such as a desire to have at least a specified frc-
tion of television originating from national sources) which lead to some in-
terventions, and these may not be border interventions.12                At the present
time, there are few satisfactory institutional arrangements for dealing with
these issues. As      the   informatics revolution proceeds, and as services grow in-
creasingly irrportant, the development of such mechanisms may prove increas-
ingly irrportant as a factor in oonjcing toward an open international trading
system.


   3.5. Role of the Developing         Countries
   Many of the issues discussed above — NIBs (and especially the r'FA), trade
in agricultural comiodities, and coalitional issues — are of irrinediate concern
to the developing countries. They need not be repeated here. There are,
however, two additional issues which deserve at least brief mention.
   First, many developing countries have liberalized their trade and payments
regimes in their own self—interest, often in conjunction with ItF and/or World
Bank programs. At present, there appears to be no very satisfactory mechanism


12. See Richard Snape, Trade in Services, W orid Ba E .0 no m...c ev law , Vol,
2,No. 1, July 1987, for a full analysis of the issues that arise in connection
with service trade.



                                               19
by which they can "get credit" for prior liberalization ctjring GPTT nego-
tiations.. (lthough developing countries could, in the course of GTT nego-
tiations, bind their liberalized tariffs, a significant issue of credibility
might arise because     of   the   balance of   payments provisions and infant       industry
exceptions to which they often resort. Mechanisms             for     recognizing liberaliza-
tion on the    part   of developing countries as part of a the             new Round could

serve    as   an additional inducement to trade liberalization on their part,                 and

would   simultaneously   represent      a constructive move in bringing           developing

countries     more into the GATT framework.
   The    second issue is somewhat less obviously institutional in nature, but
nonetheless requries     mention. That is,           the developing   countries have tradi-
tionally asked     for, and received, special and differential treatment within

the GPTT. Thus, they have received preferential tariff treatment under the

Generalized System of Preferences from               most industrial countries, and have
focussed much more on that aspect than on their stake in the multilateral sys—
tern. If mechanisms could      be devised which would more       clearly reflect the          im-

portance of the       multilateral      system to the developing countries, that         might

serve as a useful force toward maintaining an open trading system.                 It   could
also be useful as a step      in   developing useful coalitional arrangements,          and   in
bringing aid officials in developed countries to support trade liberalization
more strongly within their own goverments..'3


4. The Crossroads
    s Sections 1 and 2 demonstrated, there are always pressures for protec-
tion and forces leading to a more open international economy. During the

                                                20
period up to 1973, the tendency toward a more open international trading and
payments system clearly was stronger than protectionist pressures,               although

they were     by no means absent.   From   1973 to 1980,    protectionist   pressures    in-

creased enough in strength so that,         for    the international economy as a whole,

there was something close to an impasse: protectioni may not have resulted
in increased protection, but        it   did increase   enough to dampen halt    the   trend

toward an increasingly open world economy.
       During the early 19805, protectionist pressures clearly had the upper

hand: worldwide recession and the high unemployment that accompanied it

strengthened    protectionist forces in the developed countries,        while declining

commodity     prices and    problems     associated with heaW indebtedness       led many

developing countries to reverse earlier efforts to liberalize their trade and
payments regimes. The nerican support for a free trade position was sig-

nificantly weakened by the strength of the dollar, which along with disinfla-

tion, put     considerable pressure on a large number of economic activities.

   The    recession is over, and    worldwide growth has resumed,       albeit   at rates
slower than those of the 19505 and l960s. Agreement has been           reached   on a new

round    of   trade negotiations, aimed at liberalizing the international economy
and   addressing, in particular, some of the issues discussed in         Section 3.       It
can plausibly be argued that the antiinflationary programs of most of the OEOD
countries have been successful in reducing inflation, and that many of the
structural problems that afflicted some countries, especially in Europe, in
the 19705 and early l980s, appear to be approaching resolution.
      On that reading, one could argue that if the pressures toward liberaliza-
tion were once again on the ascendancy,            worldwide growth   would likely ac-
celerate which, in turn, would be conducive to further liberalization. The
"virtuous     circle" of liberalization—growth—liberalization which characterized

the 19505 and l960s might reappear.



                                             2].
     However, one of the critical qjestions is whether forces for liberalization
will increase in strength, or whether in fact protectionist pressures have not
so strengthened as to irrply that the open international trading system of the
l950s and l960s is a thing of the past. Clearly, no one can forecast the out-
come. ll that can be done is to identify those elements in the international
economy conducive to     liberalization, and those resulting in increased protec-
tionist pressures.


     4.1 Factors Conducive to Renewed Liberalization
     There are several factors conducive to renewed liberalization of the in-
ternational economy.       By and large, they are underlying trends, and not the
sorts of things that make day—to—day headlines, but their power should not be
underestimated. Indeed, it can be argued that the failure of the world economy
to turn even more protectionist in the early 19805 can only be attributed to
the strength of these forces, and that what is really surprising, in light of
the severity of the recession and the rise in unerployment, is that the open
international trading system survived as well as it did.
     P first factor, already mentioned, is the nature of technological change
currently     in progress. Both because economic   growth is   now taking place in   ac-
tivities with very low transport costs and because it is        focussed on   increas-

ingly specialized activities where large production runs of        highly specialized
items call for large, international markets, technological change appears to
be largely on the side of further liberalization of the international
economy. 14


14. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the strength and intensity
of opposition to the U. S. Pdministration's effort to prevent imports of
Toshiba's products to the U.S. market. Not only have consumer groups
protested, but a surprising number of large cmerican corporations have
publicly protested, claiming dependence on the importation of items they can-
not obtain elsewhere at reasonable cost. See New York Times, Sept. 17, 1987,
P.



                                         22
    A second factor, perhaps eqjally strong, is the powerful pull of the idea
of an open international economy. Despite the numerous pressures for protec-
tion, most advocacy is couched in terms of "unfair practices of the other
country, "national defense, or other reasons which broadly accept the notion
of open international trade as the norm. The fact that the 1950s and l960s
were so prosperous and that trade liberalization was then occurring supports
and reinforces   this ideology.

    The   third factor is the start of the Uruguay Round itself. Although the
fact that the Round has started by no means assures its success, it does im-
pose a certain discipline on the Contracting Parties. Should sufficient agree-
ment be reached for the Round to be deemed a success, that will further
diminish protectionist pressures.
   There is also some basis for optimism with regard to agricultural protec-
tionism. In part, optimism must be based on the very high, and rising, costs
of maintaining protection. Both because some of these costs are budgetary and
rising, and because the authorities are confronted with the painful choice
between passing on increasingly high costs to consumers and incurring ever-
greater budgetary costs, there is a basis on which to believe that agricul-
tural protectionism must diminish of its own weight.
   Fifth, there is the consideration that financial and trade linkages are now
so important that a significant polarization of the world economy will prove
highly unattractive to almost all goverrinents. The most visible manifestation
is linkage between developing countries' abilities to expand their exports and
their ability to maintain their debt service. In itself, that represents a
coepelling reason why many indjstrial countries must contain protectionism.
Other ties, represented by foreign direct investment, multinational firms, and
established trading relations, should not be underestimated.
   Sixth, a number of developing countries are starting, or continuing, to


                                      23
liberalize their trade and paents regimes unilaterally. In many instances,
these decisions are the result of a painful recognition of the degree to which
earlier, highly restrictionist, trade and paents regimes had been inimical
to growth.
      Finally, to the extent that economic growth is resuming in Europe, and
that trade irrbalances between Japan and the industrial countries are somehow
remedied, pressures for protection should be diminished.


   4.2 Pressures for Protectionism
      Despite these factors tending toward a more open international economy,
there are a nurrber of factors tending in the opposite direction.
      Perhaps chief among them is that the cocritment to an open multilateral
system has eroded, and that in itself reduces the discipline that earlier
helped       reinforce liberalization. An important   part   of that   erosion   has been

the   reduced support for an open   international trading     system    in   the   United
States.      Although the strength of the American dollar in the early l980s con-
tributed significantly to that reduction, the American current account
deficit, and the associated economic pressures, are         likely to   persist. as long
as the U. S. fiscal lirbalance remains    sizeable.

      Many   observers believe that the American fiscal difficulties will not be
resolved without a period of slow growth or recession. If that view is cor-
rect, that would strengthen protectionist pressures both in the United States
and in the rest of the world. The United States is important both because of
her size     and   because of her traditional role, now largely abandoned, as          a

leader in the international economy.           Should the    United   States   experience
economic difficulties, that would certainly tend to brake economic growth in

the rest of the world, thereby strengthing protectionist forces there. Vuch

therefore depends on the American ability to resolve the current fiscal—



                                          24
monetary inbalance without incurring high costs in terms of foregone output.
   Thirdly • however, the absence of adequate institutional mechanisms that
would permit sinultaneous bargaining over a variety of NTBs, the development
of meaningful coalitions, and the other issues discussed in Section 3 clearly
does not portend well for the prospect that trade liberalization will once
again reach ascendency over protectionism. Whether it is this inadequacy or
the strength   of protectionist forces itself is difficult to evaluate, but cer-

tainly   a great deal hinges on the prospects for a successful conclusion of the
Uruguay Round. Just as success would almost certainly tip the balance toward
resuniption of liberalization of the international economy, failure would in-
tensify protectionist trends. The absence of visible momentum in those nego-
tiations is therefore a factor itself tending toward the strengthening of
protectionism.
   Fourthly, it is surely easier to forego the imposition of a tariff or quan-
titative restriction than it is to remove an existing one. Once in place,
protectionist measures tend to induce the formation of political interest
groups comitted to their maintenance. To the extent that the early 1980s wit-
nessed the introduction and/or strengthening of protectionism, it will be more
difficult to roll back those measures than it would have been to move forwrd
in their absence.
   Fifth, at present there is     no visible leadership to   push for liberaliza-
tion. The role played by the United States in the 1950s and 1960s has not been
assumed by any country or group of countries. While leadership alone cannot
determine the direction of trade negotiations, the presence of.a visible
country or group of countries representing the systemic interests in the in-
ternational economy was clearly important in the l9SOs and l960s. The absence
of corresponding leadership in the mid—1980s will certainly weaken the effec-
tiveness of those pressures tending toward liberalization.
  4.3. The Balance

     Any attempt to assess the relative strength of the pressures toward
liberalization and protectionism       must necessarily involve       a great deal      of

judgment and in any event be subject to an extremely wide margin of error.

Certainly,there   are    conflicting   pressures in both directions, and       it is by no

means clear what the      outcome will be. Because     both   liberalization and   protec—

tionism tend to be somewhat self—reinforcing, the             international    economy is
truly   at a cross—roads.
     Rather than attempt the impossible task of forecasting the outcome, it may

be   preferable to conclude by examining the likely shape of an increasingly
protectionist world. In such a world, it is probable that sizeable trading
blocks would   emerge:    the EC and EFTA would constitute one      block,    incorporating
many    of the   LOME    convention    countries   into their trading relations. Japan
would   surely lead another block, consisting arguably of some Southeast Asian
nations, possibly of Australia and            New Zealand,      and possibly some Latin
American countries. The     United   States would almost surely lead a trading group
containing some Latin American countries and Canada, with possibly some
others. Where the trading ties of the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent,
and China   would be is purely speculative.
  Even   attempting to imagine the economic and       political   ramifications of such
a polarization is enough to lead to a conviction that such an outcome would be
vastly inferior, from the viez>oint of each of these          blocks, to an open inter--

national trading system. Those persuaded of this can shift the likelihood of
