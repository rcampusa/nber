                 Wage Indexation and Exchange Market Intervention
                              In a Small Open Economy


                                    ABSTRACT




       The   analysis of this paper stresses the interdependence between wage
indexation on the one hand, and exchange market intervention on the other,
as   tools of'   macroeconomic stabilization   policy in a   small open economy
subject      to stocl-astic disturbances. It is shown how the choice of either

policy instrument impinges on the effectiveness of the other. In particular,

if the domestic money wage is fully indexed to some weighted average of

the domestic and foreign price levels, then irrespective of what that

chosen weight may be, exchange market intervention is rendered totally

ineffective inofar as the stabilization of the real part of the domestic

economy is concerned. Likewise, if the monetary authority intervenes

in the exchange market so as to exactly accommodate for nominal movements

in the demand for money, thereby rendering the excess demand for money

dependent only upon real variables, then any form of wage indexation is

totally ineffective for the stabilization of the real part of the system.

In either polar case, the respective instrument can stabilize the domestic

price level. Alternative combinations of policy for the stabilization

for domestic and foreign disturbances are considered.

 1. INTRODUCTION

          Recently, the issues of exchange market intervention on the

one hand, and wage indexation on the other, have become topical in the

 international macroeconomic literature. To date, these questions have

been analyzed virtually independently. The intervention literature has

focused exclusively on non—indexed economies. That is, the models

typically assume that nominal wages are fixed by a one period contract

throughout the current period and therefore do not respond to current

stochastic influences; see, e.g., Boyer (1979), Buiter (1979), Henderson

(1979), Roper and Turnovsky (1980), Cox (1980), Turnovsky (1983). This

literature examines the extent to which alternative intervention policies——

usually specified in terms of rules relating the current money supply and

the current exchange rate——insulate the domestic economy from stochastic

disturbances of varying origins. The issue of optimal intervention has

also been discussed, although even for the simplest models, the deriva-

tion of optimal policies proves to be quite tedious. By contrast, the

indexation models typically deal with the extreme regimes of perfectly

fixed and perfectly flexible rates and study the extent to which

alternative forms of wage indexation insulate the economy from various

stochastic disturbances, under these two regimes. Optimal indexation

schemes have also been discussed; see Flood and Marion (1982), Marston

(1982a, 1982b).1

          In fact, exchange market intervention and wage indexation are

highly interdependent policy instruments. Both are intended to reduce

the effects of current stochastic disturbances on the economy. The

indexation scheme does so by adjusting the current nominal wage to these
                                      —2—


disturbances insofar as they are reflected by the price index governing

the indexation scheme. The indexation rule therefore impinges directly

on the supply function of the economy and hence it can be viewed as

being a real form of policy intervention. By contrast, the intervention

rule adjusts the money supply to the random disturbances insofar as they

are reflected by the current exchange rate. Being a monetary rule, it

is a nominal form of policy intervention.

              In this paper we analyze the effectiveness of exchange market

intervention and wage indexation as joint policy instruments. It is

evident that by changing the slope of the supply function, the degree

of wage indexation must influence the effectiveness of exchange market

intervention and in turn the optimal degree of intervention. And the

converse is also true.

              Within the indexation literature, there is a debate concerning

not only the appropriate degree of indexation, but also the appropriate

price against which to index. While traditionally the consumer price

index (CPI) is the chosen measure, it has been proposed that wage indexa—

tion schemes should be based on the movement of the domestic price index

(the GNP deflator). It has been argued that this form of indexation will

shield the domestic economy from increases in the prices of imported goods.2

tn   our   analysis we shall allow for differential degrees of indexation to

domestic and to foreign prices. We therefore consider three policy instru-

ments; the two indexation parameters, together with the degree of exchange

market intervention.

              The framework we employ is a standard stochastic model of a

small open economy under rational expectations; see, e.g., Cox (1980),
                                   —3—


 Turnovsky (1981), Marston (1982a), etc. Our strategy is to solve the

 system for the relevant endogenous variables in terms of the stochastic

 disturbances and the three policy parameters. In principle, one could

 postulate an objective function and optimize simultaneously for the three

 policy parameters. This turns out to be intractable and we prefer to

 focus on the various disturbances individually and collectively and to

 consider how the degrees of intervention and iridexation interact in

 neutralizing the influences of these disturbances on the economy.

           While the detailed results are discussed below, one conclusion

 is worth highlighting at the outset, First, if the current wage is fully

 adjusted to current price changes, in the sense that the sum of the

 degree of indexation to the domestic price cnange plus foreign price change

 is unity, then irrespective of the relative weights assigned to these two

prices in the indexation scheme, exchange market intervention becomes

 totally ineffective in insulating the real part of the domestic economy

 from any stochastic disturbance. On the other hand, if the monetary

authority intervenes in the exchange market so as to render the excess

demand for nominal money balances dependent only upon real variables, then

wage indexation becomes impotent in influencing real behavior. In either

case, the respective policy will still retain influence over the nominal

part of the system.

          The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.

The description of the model and its solution is outlined in

Section 2. The interdependence between the two types of policy variables

is discussed in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5 analyze the stabilization of

domestic and foreign disturbances in turn, while the concluding section

summarizes our main findings. Finally, certain computational details are

given in the Appendix.

2. THE MODEL

          The country we consider is fully specialized in the production

of a single (composite) commodity, part of which is consumed domestically,

the remainder of which is exported. Domestic residents consume two goods,

the domestic good and an imported good, the foreign price of which they

take as given. There are two financial assets held in the portfolios of

domestic residents. These include domestic money, which is non traded

and a single bond which is traded internationally in a perfect bond mar-

ket. The model is described by the following set of equations


            =         —
                d1Y       d2(r — (C+1—C)] + d3(Q-1-E_P)           + t1lt

                                                                           (la)

             The first four equations are standard. Equation (la) describes

the domestic economy's IS curve. Equation (ib) defines the domestic

cost of living to be a log linear weighted average of the price of the

domestic good and the domestic price of the imported good. The third

equation specifies the domestic LM curve, while the assumption of perfect

capital mobility is embodied in the uncovered interest parity condition

(id), which equates the expected rate of return on domestic and foreign
         3
bonds.

             The intervention policy is described by (le) *   This   describes

the degree of intervention by the authority as a function of the observed

deviation from its long—run equilibrium level, which the authority is

assumed to know. The limiting cases of ji = , ji = 0, correspond to

fixed and flexible regimes, respectively, while any finite, non—zero

value of ii describes a managed float. The optimal intervention policy

is to choose i to optimize some specified objective, and as has been

shown previously, an optimal policy may involve either ii > 0 or i <

depending upon the primary source of the stochastic disturbances. Note
that the reaction function (le) is expressed in terms of current

values of M and E, which are assumed to be instantly observable.4

             The supply side of the economy is described by equations (lf)

and (ig). The first of these is the short—run supply function, where

    y are related to the underlying production function; see (4) below.

The latter equation describes the current wage and the wage indexation

scheme.5 At time t—l a nominal wage rate            is contracted for time

t, based on infármation available up to time t—l; i.e., before the

realizations of the stochastic disturbances at time t are known. The
                                          —7--




critical information components include          Pt_l and            the expecta—

tions of the prices of domestic output and the domestic CPI. At tiiae t,

when the actual prices become known, the current wage rate is adjusted

in proportion to the difference between the actual and expected prices.

The coefficient T1 describes the extent to which the wage rate is

indexed to the current domestic price, T2 is the degree of indexation

to the foreign price. Typically, T1 and T2 are constrained to lie in

the range 0 to 1, although this need not be optimal, see footnote 14

below. tn short, the contract wage imposes a nominal short—run

rigidity on the system, which the indexation scheme is intended, inso-

far as possible, to offset.

              A number of special indexation schemes merit mention. If

 T1 >    0, T2 = 0, the wage is Indexed solely to the domestic price level,
with T1 = 1 being full indexation. The case T1               0, T2 > 0 describes

 indexation to the foreign price level, with T2 = 1 being full indexation.

Thirdly, if T1 =    T,   T2 =   T(l-5),    then noting (lb), (ig) becomes


                           =              + T(C —
                                W,_1                C,_i)                    (ig')


which describes indexation to the CPI. Full indexation occurs when

T =     1, i.e., T1 = S, T = (l—S).       More generally, we shall say that the

current wage is fully indexed if T1 + T2 =          1.    In this case (ig) becomes


        =
            W,_1 + T(P —             + (1 -
                                                 T1)(Q   + Et -       - Ei)          (ig")


This is equivalent to the wage being fully indexed to a weighted average

of the domestic and foreign prices, the weights being T1 and 1 —
                                                                            T1,
respectively. The first three schemes noted are just special cases of

this general notion.
                                       —8—


              The next step in the specification of the model is the determina-

tion of the wage contract ,t—l Specifically we shall assume that this

wage is set so that given the expectations of firms and workers, the

labor market is expected to clear. Assuming that workers are concerned

with their real wages in terms of the expected CPI, the expected supply

of labor at the contract wage is


                          N_1 =    a + b(W....i —
                                                       C,_1)               (2a)



Assuming further, a production function linking the logarithm of output

to the logarithm of employment N by


                                                                           (2b)

where      is a stochastic disturbance reflecting technological uncer-

tainty, and having mean zero, it follows that the expected demand for

labor    d                            .               ..
        Nt t—l (based on expected profit maximization) is determined by

the marginal product condition

where firms value real wages in terms of their expected product price.

The contract wage is determined by equating the expected demand and

supply of labor appearing in (2a) and (2c), yielding

we assume that domestic and foreign variables are uncorrelated, thereby

enabling us to distinguish quite clearly between domestic and foreign

          The model thus contains the eight equations (la)—(lh), which

jointly determine the eight endogenous variables ''         r, Et Mt,
                      These are determined on the assumption that the expec-
C,   W and
tations appearing in the model are formed rationally. In order to analyze

the model it is desirable to make several transformations:

             Ci) To reduce the dimensionality of the system we substitute

from (ib), (id), (ig) and (lh) to eliminate         C, W and W tl
         (ii) It is convenient to consider an initial equilibrium defined

by assuming that all expectations are realized and setting all random

variables to zero, thereby enabling us to incorporate all constants in

the initial equilibrium.

        (iii) We define the relative price of foreign to domestic goods

(the inverse of the terms of trade) by



                             S=Q+Et_Pt
Following these procedures, we can reduce the system to the four

stochastic difference equations in the two real variables y, and            and

the two nominal variables Pt and          where lower case letters are used

to denote deviations from the equilibrium; i.e., e E Et — E, etc. These

calculations are straightforward and details are relegated to the Appendix.

             These equations involve the expectations of the relative price

        and the nominal price level +l,t The solution procedures for

 determining these expectations are familiar and are omitted. First, it

 can be shown that the only solution for the forecast of the relative price
                                                        7
 consistent with stability is s÷1 = 0, for all t.            In the case of nominal price

 expectations it can be shown that the nature of the stable solution depends
                                           —11—


upon the intervention parameter .i.            If   either ji     > —l   or i.i   < —(l+2a2) the
only solution consistent with stability is              +l,t 0. However, for
—(l+2a2) < u <     —1    the stable solution for +l,t turns out to be indeter-

minate. We resolve this indeterminacy by choosing the solution                                   =   0.
While this choice is arbitrary, it is simple and has the virtue of yield-

ing a solution which is independent of the choice of intervention

            Thus setting all expectations to zero and substituting for

the intervention rule, the system can be expressed in the following form

3.   iNTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN EXCHANGE MARKET INTERVENTION AND WAGE
     INDEXATION

             The solutions for the endogenous variables of the small open
economy are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that these variables

are linear functions of the random disturbances and in this table we list

the coefficient attached to each disturbance. In Part A of the table we

report the impact effects of the domestic disturbances, while the foreign

disturbances are given in Part B. Notice that under a perfectly flexible

rate regime (      = 0)   the two foreign variables               and        have identical

effects on the domestic variables. We therefore find it convenient to

break down the foreign effects into (w +                      and            the latter being

an additional effect due to exchange market intervention.9 Thus denoting
                                 —12—


the two elements in the first row of Part B by O, O2 the effect of

a unit increase in the foreign interest rate on y is 01, while that of

a unit increase in the foreign price level       is 01 + p02.

          It is clear from Table 1 that y,        and Pt all fluctuate sta-

tically in response to the three domestic random variables (ui, u2,

u3) as well as the two foreign variables (q we). The three policy

parameters ji, T1 and T2 influence the responses of all these endogenous

variables to the exogenous random shocks in an interdependent way. The

degree of wage indexation T1 and T2 influences the effectiveness of

exchange market intervention u, and vice versa. In particular, the

structure of the reduced form of the system, equation (7) enables us

to derive the following important propositions:

           (i) If the domestic wage rate is fully indexed in the

                sense that T1 + T2 =    1, then irrespective of the
                relative magnitudes of T1 and T2, exchange market
                intervention becomes ineffective in insulating the

                real part of the domestic economy (suarized by y

                and s) from any stochastic disturbances. Interven-

                tion policy, will still, however, be effective in influ—

                encing the nominal part of the domestic economy

                (summarized by

          (ii) If the monetary authority intervenes in the foreign

                exchange market so as to render the excess demand for

                nominal moneybalances dependent upon only the real var-

                iables, then wage indexation becomes totally ineffective

                in influencing the real part of the system. It will,

                however, still be able to influence the nominal variables.
                                              —13—


              These two propositions can be immediately estblished as follows.

If the domestic nominal wage rate is fully indexed, i.e., T1 + T2 =                  1,
the domestic supply curve becomes independent of the domestic price

level Pt. Rather, the two real variables y and s becomes jointly

determined by the IS curve together with the supply function. •They are

therefore independent of the intervention parameter p, which impinges

through shifts in the LM curve. But given y and s, so determined, the

domestic price level is determined in the domestic money market and there-

fore is a function of intervention.

              On the other hand, if the monetary authority follows a policy

of leaning with the wind and sets p = —(1 + 2' the excess demand for

nominal money balances becomes independent of the price level and depends

only upon the real variables y and s. These variables become jointly

determined by the IS curve, together with the LM curve and are therefore

independent of the degree of wage indexation which impinges thrQugh the

supply curve. Given y and 5' the price level is now determined by the

tion.   Note that any full wage indexation policy coupled with intervention

in accordance with p = —(1 +                  are mutually inconsistent and therefore

infeasible.

              The comparative static analysis with respect to the various

policy parameters is tedious and is not pursued. Of greater interest

is the question of the optimal choice of the policy parameters, p.
                                                                                   T
and T2. The typical approach to optimal policy questions in models

such as this is to specify some objective function——frequently a weighted

average of the variances of income and prices——and to choose the policy

parameters to minimize this objective)0 While in principle this deriva-

tion is straightforward, in a model such as this it turns out to be
                                   —14—


complicated and not very illuminating.11 iore insight can be gained by

focusing attention on the separate disturbances, taken both individually

and in groups and examining the extent to which they can be eliminated by

an appropriate package of policies. We proceed to consider the domestic

and foreign disturbances in turn.

          In general, it is not possible to stabilize exactly for all

stochastic disturbances simultaneously through indexation and/or exchange

market intervention. The reason is that the number of stochastic dis-

                             and       exceeds the maximum number of con-
turbances (u1, u2, u3,
temporaneous pieces of information which may form part of the indexation

or intervention rules. These include the exchange rate, the price of

domestic output, the price of imported goods, and the domestic interest

rate, although the latter has not been introduced into either of the

rules we are considering. Thus our problem is closely related to the

early work of Gray (1976). In her analysis she introduces two stochastic

disturbances, a real and a monetary, and just one piece of contemporaneous

information, the price of output, in her stabilization rule. She too, is

therefore in general able to achieve only partial stabilization with

respect to the two d. sturbances she considers. In a recent paper, Karni

(1983) achieves full stabilization in the Gray model by indexing wages

to output, as well as to price. But the fact that output quantities

are typically less precisely observable than prices in the time frame

envisaged by this type of analysis makes this form of indexation less

appealing; see footnote 4.

          Finally, we may note that we have restricted our analysis to

just three policy parameters 31, T1 and T2. It would, of course, be
                                          —15--



possible to make the money supply rule depend upon other contemporaneous

variables such as the domestic interest rate, and the prices of domestic

and foreign goods. This in turn raises the number of policy parameters,

thereby increasing the range of possible ways of stabilizing for any

given set of disturbances. However, the additional insight so obtained

is insufficient to compensate for the added complications and accordingly,

this aspect is not pursued.



4. STABILIZATION OF DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES

            Suppose first that only stochastic disturbnace is in the demand

for domestic output, u1. It is evident that output can be stabilized

against this form of stochastic disturbance——as indeed it can against

other stochastic disturbances——in an infinite number of ways. Any com-

bination of the policy parameters T1, T2 and ii,                  satisfying   the condition


            [(l—d)(l—1) ÷ +
                                     a2](l-T1) +      [ + (l-1)]T2 =           0      (3)


will do, as long as they do not violate the condition that the Jacobian

of (7), D    0.    If, for example, the wage rate is fully indexed to the

price of domestic output alone CT1 =              1, T2 =   0),    then y is independent

of ui, irrespective of the degree of intervention. Alternatively, if

the wage is indexed to the extent T to the CPI (T1 = ST, T2 =                      (l—S)T),
then the required degree of intervention is

                                                     +
              I.' = —(l--5)(l--a1)   —        —
                                         a2                 1—ST


This equation highlights the tradeoff which exists between this form of

wage indexation on the one hand, and exchange market intervention on

the other. Any degree of indexation T >              0,   calls for an intervention
                                        —16—

policy of leaning with the wind and the greater the degree of indexation

the more intensive.must this intervention be.13

            The economic intuition for these policy responses can be seen

from the basic equations (7), which when only stochastic disturbances

u1 are present and with partial indexation to the CPI, become

                                                       =

              +    [(l—)(l—ct1)
                                   + ct2]s +   (l+c)p      =
                                                                (s+pt)   =
                                                                             _e     (lob)


                               =                +   y(l_T)p                       (lOc)
                                   _y(l_5)Ts

Suppose initially that there is no           indexation    and the exchange rate is

perfectly   flexible (T =     0, p = 0).       Then a positive disturbance in u1

will cause both output             and the price of domestic output Pt to rise,

the relative price s will fall, and the exchange rate e will appreciate;

see Table l.A. If the monetary authority responds to the appreiating

exchange rate by decreasing the money supply, more of the fluctuations

generated by u1 are borne by the relative price and less by y and Pt.

In the case where the intervention follows the rule p = —(1—6) (1—ct1) —

then y and Pt are jointly          determined by the money market and supply func-

tion, which are free of stochastic fluctuations. This means that the

relative price s is determined by the IS curve and absorbs all the

fluctuations in domestic output demand. If now the wage is partially

indexed (T >      0),   then given the above intervention, the fall in s will

be transmitted to a fall in output, via the indexatiOn rule. To avoid

this, the fall in s must be offset by a rise in Pt and this requires

the monetary contraction to be increased; i.e., the degree of interven-

tion must be intensified.
                                    —17—


             Full indexation   to the domestic CPI (T    1) cannot achieve the

 perfect insulation of y. From (9), this would require the intervention
   = —(1 +
                and as already noted, this is infeasible for any full indexa—

 tion scheme. On the other hand, it has been noted that the perfect insula-

 tion of both domestic output and its price can be attained by setting

 T = 0 and intervening in accordance with the rule i
                                                          = _(1_)(l_l)      —

 Indeed, given this intervention rule, the same objective can be attained
 by setting T2 =   0, i.e., not indexing the wage to foreign price increases,
 regardless of the choice of T1. In this case all the fluctuations are

 absorbed by the relative price s• However, since none of the policy

 parameters impinge directly on aggregate demand, s is independent of

 them. It is therefore impossible to stabilize all three variables

Pt and s simultaneously, despite the fact that there are three policy

instruments available. 14

          In the case of the monetary disturbance u2, there is no such

trade off between intervention and indexation insofar as the stabiliza-

tion of output is concerned. One of two options is possible. First,
                                                                                y
can be stabilized by any full wage indexation rule T1 + 12 =      1, when
is also stabilized as well. This is because in this case the two variables

become jointly determined by the IS curve and the supply function, both

of which are independent of the monetary disturbance. However, the full

indexation rule renders exchange market intervention ineffective, and

intervention would be required to ensure the stability of p. The second,

and superior alternative for eliminating the monetary disturbance, is

simply to peg the exchange rate (.i   = °°). All   the fluctuations in demand

for money are accommodated by the supply and y, Pt and s are stabilized

perfectly; wage indexation is unnecessary.
                                        — 18—



          By contrast, complete stabilization for the supply disturbance

u3 is impossible. The only way y and s can be stabilized is by the

intervention rule i- = —(1   +           but this renders wage indexation ineffective.15
                                 a2),
All the stochastic disturbances originating with domestic supply are

absorbed by the domestic price level. In short, wage indexation is

essentially ineffective as a policy rule for the purpose of stabilizing

for domestic supply disturbances.

          We now shift our focus slightly and consider the extent to

which domestic income can be stabilized against the three domestic

disturbances u1, u2 and u3, when they occur simultaneously. Clearly,

perfect stabilization against all three disturbances is impossible. To

stabilize for u3 would require intervention ii = —(1 +          a2),   which renders

wage indexation infeasible, and this would obviously be required to
stabilize for either of the other disturbances. Hence, if the policy

makers choose to stabilize for u3, then they cannot stabilize for either

of the other two disturbances.

          By contrast, it is possible to stabilize y for the two demand

disturbances u1 and u2 simultaneously and indeed, this can be done in

two ways. One possibility is to index the wage fully to only the domestic

price (T1 =   1, T2 = 0), allowing the degree of exchange market interention
to be arbitrary; another is to peg the exchange rate and fully index the wage

to the price of domestic output (ii        = , T1 = 1),   allowing the degree of

indexation to the foreign price level to be arbitrary.

          To pursue this issue a little further, suppose that the only

disturbances are on the domestic demand side, namely u1 and u2, and

that the primary objective is to stabilize output exactly, and given that

that is achieved, a secondary objective is to minimize the variance of
                                         —19—


 the price of domestic output, p. If we assume that the stabilization

 of output is attained by the indexation scheme T1 =                 1, T2 = 0, then the
 solution for Pt is


                    —   [(l—)(1—ct1)
                                       + +              — (d2+d3)u2
                    —
                                   (l-1-t2+i.)(d2+d3)

 Assuming for simplicity that the two disturbances u1 and u2 are uncorre—

 lated, then


               a2   =
                        [(l—)(l—ci1) +     + 2°i + (d2+d3)2cy                     (11)
                p
                                 (l+c2+i.i)2(d2S+d3)2


 Given that output is fully stabilized by fully indexing the wage to the

 domestic price, the optimal degree of exchange market intervention is

 obtained by minimizing (11) with respect to ii, yielding the optimal policy


                                                   (d2cS-1-d3)2      a
                                                                     —
                                                             +
                                                [5(i—cz1)             a1

Thus the optimal degree of exchange market intervention from the view-

point of price stability as a secondary objective depends in part upon the

relative variances of the two domestic disturbances. As polar cases, if

   = 0 (i.e., there are only real demand disturbances) the optimal policy

is to lean with the wind in accordance with                 =
                                                                —[(l—)(l—c*1) + c2]   while
if a = 0 (i.e., there are only monetary disturbances) the optimum is to

peg the exchange rate. Between these two extremes, the optimal interven-

tion will involve leaning against the wind or leaning with the wind,

depending in part upon the relative magnitudes of the two variances.

          Finally, it should be noted that the ability of either inter-

vention policy or indexation policy to stabilize at least one endogenous

variable perfectly for any single disturbance is a consequence of the
                                    —20—


following general characteristic. The current observation of certain

market variables implies information as to the sources of the random

shocks in the economy. For example, eliminating y, Pt and s from (7)

                                                                     and e of
and noting ra =     _ie,   yields a linear relationship between

the form




where i    is   a function of the known coefficients of the model and     is

a linear function of the unknown stochastic disturbances. The fact that

   and e are observable to the monetary authority, who also are assumed

to know , means that they also observe the linear combination of random

variables contained in .         When only one random variable is present,'it

follows that the observability of this linear combination reduces to the

observability of the random variable itself. This may be appropriately

offset, thereby maintaining perfect stability of at least one of the

endogenous variables of the system.16 A similar argument applies in

the case of the information assumed in the implementation of the indexa—

tion policy.


5. STABILIZATION OF FOREIGN DISTURBMCES

            We now turn our attention to the foreign disturbances which

impinge on the domestic economy through        and .    Initially,   we shall

treat both of these separately, although as noted earlier, they are in

fact jointly determined, reflecting more fundamental disturbances occurring

abroad.

            Domestic output can be stabilized against foreign price dis-

turbances        in a number of ways, the most direct being by fully index—

ing the wage rate to only the price of domestic output (T1 =      1, T2 = O).17
                                    —21—

 This rule means that producers face a fixed real wage and in the absence

 of domestic supply disturbances, output is thereby fixed.    Having indexed

 in this way, the domestic price level can then be stabilized for foreign

 price fluctuations by adopting the exchange market intervention policy

                                                    —
                           =
                                  d3 —   d2(l.-o)
                                                                    (l)
 This may involve leaning against the wind or leaning with the wind, depend-

 ing upon parameter Values. The intuition underlying this response can be

 seen from the basic equation (7), whici with this full wage indexat ion

 scheme reduces to


                               (d2c+d3)s =   d2q                    (13a)



                     (l—S)(l—c1)s ÷ 2e + Pt = —1e       m           (13b)


An increase in       leads to an increase in the relative price   and to

an appreciation of the exchange rate e. Given that expectations are

static, the appreciation in the exchange rate is equivalent to an

increase in the domestic interest rate. The rise in the relative price

s leads to an increase in the demand for money, whereas the rise in the

interest rate leads to a decrease. If the positive relative price effect

dominates, then in order to stabilize the price level (i.e., prevent it

from sharing some of the random fluctuations) the monetary. authority

should accommodate to the increase in the demand for money by increas-

ing the supply. With the exchange rate appreciating Such a policy is

one of leaning against the wind. Conversely, if the negative interest

rate dominates, then the net fall in the demand for money should be met

with a net reduction; i.e, a policy of leaning with the wind.
                                        —22--



            The response to eliminate fluctuations in the foreign interest

rate      are similar. Output can again be stabilized by the full indexa—

tion rule T1 =   1, T = 0, while given this form of intervention the price
of domestic output can be stabilized by the intervention rule


                                2d3 — d2(l—5)(l—ct1+c&2)
                                            d2
The explaiations are virtually identical to those just given for the

foreign price disturbance and can be omitted.

            tn general,       and       are jointly stochastic. Irrespective of

their source of variation abroad, and therefore their degree of correlation,
domestic output can continue to be perfectly stabilized by fully index-

ing the wage to the price of domestic output (T1 =           1, T = 0). With
output stabilized in this way, the solution for Pt is

                        —(a +                       + (d25+d3)uq
                                d2(+c2))(w+q)
                 Pt =
                                    (i+ct2+i)(d2S+d3)

where a     d2(l—S)(1—c1) — x2(d3+d2S).          Suppose now that as a secondary
objective, the monetary authority chooses to intervene so as to minimize

       Letting z          +      the optimum degree of intervention is given by

                                                    -
                   (a+d2a2)[(1+a2)(d2+d3)CT             (d2-a)aJ             (14)

The optimal degree of indexation therefore depends not only upon the

variances a2, a2 but also upon the covariance a , which in turn reflects
           w   q                               wq
the source of the disturbances abroad. A special case of interest arises
                                  —23—

 if (i) the only foreign stochastic disturbances are monetary, and (ii) the

 foreign wage rate is fully indexed to the foreign price level. In that

 case it can be shown that


                                    +    =0
                             z
 and the optimal policy is therefore to set   =   0; i.e., allow the exchange
 rate to float.18 Indeed, in this circumstance a perfectly flexible rate

 will stabilize both domestic output and the price of domestic output,

 irrespective of the degree of wage indexation domestically; see also

 Marston (l982a).

6. CONCLUSIONS

          The analysis of this paper has stressed the interdependence

between wage indexation on the one hand, and exchange market interven-

tion on the other, as tools of macroeconomic stabilization policy in a

small open economy subject to stochastic disturbances. We have shown

how the choice of either policy instrument impinges on the effectiveness

of the other. In particular, if the domestic money wage is fully indexed

to some weighted average of the domestic and foreign price levels, then

irrespective of what that chosen weight may be, exchange market interven-

tion is rendered totally ineffective insofar as the stabilization of the

real part of the domestic economy is concerned. Likewise, if the mone-

tary authority intervenes in the exchange market so as to exactly

accommodate for nominal movements in the demand for money, thereby reder—

ing the excess demand for money dependent only upon real variables, then

any form of wage indexation is totally ineffective for the stabilization

of the real part of the system. In either polar case, the respective

instrument can stabilize the domestic price level.
                                      —24-


          The following more specific conclusions have been obtained for

the stabilization of domestic and foreign disturbances.

          (i) There is an infinite number of combinations of wage

indexation and exchange market intervention which will fully stabilize

domestic output against domestic demand disturbances. Of these, the

most satisfactory is to index the wage fully to (and only to) the price

of domestic output. Exchange market intervention can then stabilize

the price of domestic output, so that in fact the nominal and real

wage are fixed.

          (ii) Domestic output can be stabilized against domestic mone-

tary disturbances by either fully indexing the wage to the price of

domestic output or by pegging the exchange rate. Of these alternatives,

the latter is optimal since it will stabilize all other variables, includ-

ing the price of domestic output, as well.

          (iii) The stabilization for domestic sppply disturbaxices is

more difficult. Since wage indexation becomes totally ineffective,

stabilization must be achieved through exchange market intervention and

this can stabilize either domestic output or the domestic price level,

but not both.

          (iv) Domestic output can be stabilized for either foreign

interest rate disturbances or foreign price disturbances, separately, by

a combination of intervention and indexation policies. It can be

stabilized for both disturbances simultaneously by fully indexing the

wage rate to the price of domestic output. The domestic price can then

be stabilized by exchange market intervention, the degree of which will

depend upon the nature of the shock.

          While   limitations   imposed by considerations of analytical tract-

ability have precluded the derivation of a complete optimal stabilization

package, these results are suggestive of an intuitively appealing policy

assignment rule. With the exception of domestic supply disturbances,

they suggest that indexation policy should be directed toward the stabili-

zation of output while exchange market intervention should be directed

toward the attainment of price stability.

1. This literature in turn is an extension of the familiar closed

    economy model developed by Gray (1976) and Fischer (1977).

2. For a brief discussion see Marston (l982a), who cites various

    countries where such proposals have been considered.

3. For expositional convenience we assume that the income elasticity

    of the demand for money a1 <   1.

4. In discussing intervention policy it is important to distinguish

    between those variables which the authority can in effect currently

    observe, and those which at least in the short run are unobservable.

    Given that data on exchange rates and the money supply are avail-

    able with much greater frequency than income figures, we shall

    assume that Et and Mt are observable and that    is unobservable

    (at time t). This is one of the reasons why in general policy

    makers cannot stabilize output perfectly. The period of time for

    which this assumption is most applicable would be something like

    a month, since income is usually observed only quarterly and weekly

    money figures have considerable noise.

5. The wage indexation scheme assumes that the relevant prices are

    observable at least to the indexation authority, within the time

    period of observation.

                     are exogenous to the small country, they them-
6. Although      w
    selves are endogenously determined in the rest of the world,

    reflecting the various stochastic influences occurring abroad.

    It is thus evident that these variables will almost certainly

    be correlated, with the sign of thecorrelation depending upon

    the sources of the disturbances abroad; see Turnovsky (1983).

 7. This procedure of picking the stable root is typical of rational

     expectations models and is often justified on the grounds that the

     instability that would otherwise occur would be inconsistent with

     observed behavior. Alternatively, it is sometimes justified more

     formally by appealing to transversality conditions from appropriate

     optimizing models, which, provided the underlying utility function

     satisfies suitable restrictions, ensure that the expected price

     movements remain bounded; see, e.g., Brock (1974).

 8. This result is proved by Turnovsky (1983).

 9. The fact that shocks in the foreign nominal price level and foreign

     interest rate impinge identically on the domestic economy under a

     flexible exchange rate is of some interest. It operates through

     the domestic interest rate and stems from the fact that given the

     stationarity of exchange rate expectations, the interest rate

     parity condition simplifies to


                   r =     —e   =             —
                                      (w+q)       (s+p)
10. Implicit in much of our discussion is the minimization of the variance

    of output as being the prime policy objective. Some authors, e.g.,

    Marston (1982b), treat the minimization of the deviations from out—

    put which would result in the absence of contract lags as being the

    policy objective. There is also a new developing literature that

    models fluctuations as an equilibrium process, derived from utility

    maximizing behavior. Such fluctuations should not be confused with

    the welfare reducing deviations from some ideal path. See, e.g.,

    Long and Plosser (1983) for further discussion of these issues.

11.   For an analysis which follows this approach, see Turnovsky (1983).

      The model considered is simpler than the present one in that it

      assumes perfect goods mobility (purchasing power parity). Even

      for that simple model the general expression for the optimal inter-

      vention turns out to be extremely complicated.

12. The expression for D is given in Table 1. We shall assume D > 0.

13. Most of the policy discussions related to exchange market inter-

      vention are restricted to leaning against the wind, which intuitively

      would seem more appealing. The intuition behind why for certain

      disturbances leaning with the wind may be appropriate has been dis-

      cussed elsewhere; see Turnovsky (1983). The case of leaning with

      the wind is also discussed in a somewhat different type of model by

      Buiter and Eaton (1980).

14. Note that if the policy objective is to stabilize the price of

      domestic output and the monetary authority chooses not to inter-

      vene in the exchange market, the optimal indexation policy is to

      set

                         T2 = {(1—ó) (1—ct1)   + ct2J/ct1y

      That   is the wage must be indexed to the foreign price level. More-

      over, the optimal degree of indexation in this circumstance may

      exceed unity.

15. For expositional convenience we assume that the income elasticity

      of the demand for money ct1 <   1.

16. For some disturbances Pt and y move proportionately. In this case

      both can be stabilized simultaneously by the appropriate choice of

      a single policy instrument.

17.   It can be shown that like for domestic demand disturbnaces, that

      with full indexation to the domestic CPI, it becomes impossible

      to stabilize domestic output perfectly in the face of either

      foreign price or foreign interest rate disturbances. The reason

      is the familiar one. To achieve stability would require inter-

      vention t = —(l4u2) which is infeasible, given full wage indexation.

18. This result is proved by Turnovsky (1983).
