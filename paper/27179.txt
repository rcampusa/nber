Savings and Saving Rates: Up or Down?

                                              ABSTRACT

It depends what we want to measure. Most literature has focused on observed flow of savings (per-period
savings as fraction of GDP), which has declined persistently since 1980. Even though this decline
means that fewer funds are available for investment in each period, it does not follow that the households'
actual savings (underlying, not observed, savings determined by dynamic optimization) also go down.
We theoretically link these two concepts, discuss the conditions under which they move in opposite
directions, and show that indeed the actual savings has sharply increased since 1980.

1    Introduction

Since 1980, and after several years of apparent stability, the U.S. saving rate mea-
sured by the National Accounts experienced a persistent decline, bottoming out at
0% of GDP in 2000. This trend drew attention of academics and policymakers alike,
generating a rich literature that seeks to understand why agents' desire to save has
declined. We argue that the observed saving rate based on income flow may be a mis-
leading measure of actual saving rate in the economy.

It is a common mistake to think of savings as just a flow ­ a proportion of income that
households want to keep for the future. However, dynamic models of saving and
consumption deliver a prescriptions about the stock of savings. At any given time,
households target a level of financial assets that depends on their total wealth, present
and future. When present wealth increases (capital gains for instance), or when future
wealth increases (future human capital increases its value), agents rely less on delaying
current consumption to achieve their desired level of savings.

We use a standard macroeconomic model to theoretically link observed savings with
the implied actual savings, and show that observed savings are a good proxy for actual
savings only when the price of current assets and the value of future human capital
are stable. To quantify the link, we use widely available data on the relative prices
of financial assets, realized income and interest rates to compute the implied value of
household wealth and uncover actual savings that are consistent with the observed
savings in the U.S. since 1980.

Consider a stationary economy where agents save 10% of their income every period.
If agents experience an increase in current wealth (capital gains), they have been sav-
ing relatively too much, and will react by reducing their per-period savings below
10% for some period of time. Similarly, if agents believe that their future human capi-
tal will increase, leading to more income than expected, current savings needs decline
reducing again their period-savings below 10%. Thus, there are situations where ac-
tual savings increases while the immediate observed savings declines. We show that
that a similar pattern has played out in the U.S. since 1980.

We decompose the sources of departure between observed and actual savings,1 and
find that although capital gains were relevant on reducing savings as a fraction of
   1
     This accounting exercise is in the spirit of what Farhi and Gourio (2018) has performed to decom-
pose recent macro-finance trends into the evolution of market power, intangibles and risk premia.

income, this happened only over the last 20 years, mostly due to increased stock val-
ues. The capital gain component has indeed received some recent attention. Fagereng
et al. (2019) and Robbins (2019), for instance, adjust observed saving rates by redefin-
ing income to include capital gains. Consistent with our results, they find that adding
capital gains explicitly in the measurement of savings helps to adjust observed sav-
ings upward. Straub (2019) goes beyond this approach and analyzes the impact of
heterogeneity in observed savings through capital gains.

We show, however, that the most relevant factor in explaining why observed and ac-
tual saving rates have moved in opposite direction is the sharp increase in the value of
human capital, which has been widely overlooked in the literature. Furthermore, we
find that the increase in the value of human capital was mainly driven by decreasing
interest rates.

Our finding is relevant because several recent economic and demographic changes
that imply an increase in saving rates (such as relaxed credit constraints, additional
insurance opportunities, and higher life expectancy) have been usually challenged,
and sometimes outright discarded, because they are at odds with declining saving
rates.2 Farhi and Gourio (2018) and Eggertsson, Lancastre, and Summers (2019), for
instance, seemingly counterfactually argue that savings in the U.S. economy should
have sharply increased in the last 30 years. Here we show that indeed saving rates
have been increasing when measured consistently with dynamic models. Similarly,
higher life expectancy implies larger needs for retirement expenses and medical bills.
In a well-known paper, Auerbach, Cai, and Kotlikoff (1991) predicted a sharp increase
in savings over the next 30 years, which did not appear to happen based on observed
saving rates. Our work shows that their predictions, though seemingly inconsistent
with observed savings, are indeed consistent with actual savings.

Related Literature: The first paper noting the fall in observed saving rates was Sum-
mers and Carroll (1987), who stressed the relevance of savings for long-term growth
and urged the U.S. government to take action to prevent a stagnation.3 A subse-
quent rich literature, including Campbell (1987); Attanasio (1994); Nordhaus (1995);
Gokhale, Kotlikoff, and Sabelhaus (1996); Attanasio (1998) and Parker (1999), ad-
dress the economic consequences of declining saving rates and the implied policy
   2
      Recently Lusardi, Skinner, and Venti (2001) also suggest that NIPA saving rates may not be useful
in judging whether households are preparing for retirement or other contingencies.

responses. We show that the decline in the supply of savings is consistent with an
increase in the demand for savings, which has consequences for evaluating potential
policy responses.

These papers also sparked a large literature trying to understand the persistent de-
cline in saving rates.4 A potential solution was to incorporate capital gains into the
computation of savings measures. In an influential paper Gale and Sabelhaus (1999)
show that, among many potential adjustments to measured saving rates (such as re-
tirement accounts, inflation and taxation) the most relevant was capital gains. Other
research involved adjusting for changes in TFP, Chen, Imrohoroglu, and Imrohoroglu
(2006), and proposals to reformulate the NIPA calculations, Boskin (2009). We show
that there may not be any inconsistency in how we measure saving rates.

The evolution of saving rates has also implications beyond growth, as unspent capital
gains appears to be the main driver of wealth inequality (see Gomez (2017), Karabar-
bounis and Neiman (2019), Fagereng et al. (2019) and Robbins (2019), among others).
To further evaluate this mechanism, Straub (2019), building on the seminal work by
De Nardi (2004), incorporates distributional effects in an otherwise standard perma-
nent income theory to reconcile the model's predictions with known but elusive em-
pirical observations as in Dynan, Skinner, and Zeldes (2004). Besides these efforts,
still there seems to be a disconnect between the observed increase in the wealth-to-
income ratio and saving rates, even when adjusting for capital gains.

There is also an evolving literature on savings and financial markets. Carroll, Sla-
calek, and Sommer (2019) argue that financial liberalization helps to explain the re-
duction in saving rates (the easier it is to borrow, the less agents need to save). This
view has been used, for instance, by Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017) to argue that a
sudden sharp reversal of the trend of loosening credit played a large role in the re-
cently, and relatively short-lived, saving rate rise. Given that demographics is recog-
nized as an important driver of savings as well, recent efforts combined demographic
and financial transitions. Ordonez and Piguillem (2019) and Eggertsson, Mehrotra,
and Robbins (2019), for instance, study both forces in the same setting. We show that
the valuation of assets and human capital closely follows movements in interest rates
through valuation effects, affecting both observed and actual saving rates, which is
consistent with the standard theory and with the data.

2    Standard Macroeconomics Model

In this section we provide a theoretical framework to interpret the aggregate mea-
sures of savings. We consider the simplest model of asset accumulation that allows
for a meaningful link between savings flows and stocks, and thus between observed
and actual savings. Time is discrete and continues forever. There is no aggregate risk,
so average prices are deterministic. Households can save using a risky asset a, subject
to i.i.d. idiosyncratic risk, and a risk-free asset b. Assuming households have CRRA
preferences, their problem is:
                                                                    -
                                                                 c1
                                                                  t
                                      max                    t
                               {ct ,at+1 ,bt+1 }tt=0
                                                       t=0
                                                                 1-

subject to the budget constraint:

                    ct + at+1 pt + bt+1  (1 + t ) i at pt + Rt bt + wt ,

where wt is labor income (labor supply is fixed and normalized to 1), the risky as-
set at  0 can be financial or non-financial (e.g., housing), pt is the relative price of
risky assets (introduced to capture capital gains) and t their (dividend) return. As
we show in Appendix A, the distribution function of the idiosyncratic shocks i is
inconsequential to our results as long as it is i.i.d. over time. We introduce shocks
to generate a non-degenerate portfolio, with both risky and risk-free assets. In what
                                 i
follows we simplify notation to t  = (1 + t ) i .

As is standard in the literature, we solve this problem appealing to the permanent
income hypothesis. To that end, we define human wealth, h, as the discounted sum
of future wages:
                                        
                                             wt+j
                                  ht =      j        .                         (1)
                                       j =1 l=1 Rt+l

Households maximize the present value of utility subject to the budget constraint and
the natural debt limit, i.e., bt  -ht . Defining household i's total wealth at t as:

                             Wti = t
                                   i
                                     at pt + Rt bt + wt + ht ,                       (2)

the solution has the form:

                                           t = (1 - st )Wt
                                                          i
                                                                                                (3)
                                     p t ai            i
                                          t+1 = st t Wt .                                       (4)

The factor st is the actual saving rate out of total wealth, the focus of this paper, while the
factor t is the proportion of savings allocated to the risky asset. Notice that both st
and t are independent of the consumer's wealth and current income. This follows
from the fact that preferences are homothetic.

These equations make clear that actual savings is a linear function of the current total
wealth. Households are not concerned about the flow of savings, but about the growth
rate of total wealth. As we show in the Appendix, an agent who has wealth Wti and
received a shock i in period t, chooses financial assets such that in period t + 1, and
upon the realization of a future shock i , the total wealth satisfies:

                                           pt+1
                         Wti+1 = t t
                                   i
                                     +1         + (1 - t )Rt+1 st Wti .                         (5)
                                            pt
                                                 i
                                                rt +1



The choice of st ensures that total wealth grows at the optimal rate. This theory,
which is the standard out-of-shelf theory of savings, has nothing to say about the
flow of savings. It only determines how the household wants its stock of wealth to
grow, and agents adjust savings to achieve their target. In particular, the saving rate
in this environment satisfies:

                         (1 - st )-1 = 1 +  1/ [Ert
                                                  1- 1/
                                                    +1 ] (1 - st+1 )-1 ,                        (6)

which confirms that the saving rate is independent of wealth and income. It is affected by
the interest rate, exposure to risk and the risk tolerance.5 If  = 1 (log utility) then it
is easy to show that st =  , for all t. If instead  = 1, then the saving rate solves the
recursive forward-looking equation (6).

The only theoretical prediction of the model is that saving rate that links stocks into
stocks. How the flows move depends on the particular values of wt and at . We will
characterize its relation to the standard measure of saving rate as a fraction of GDP.

    See Angeletos (2007) for an extension to an environment with Epstein-Zin preferences. As it will
be clear in Section 3, a generalization of equation 6 is not relevant to our analysis.

Remark 1 Idiosyncratic labor income risk: What happens when there is uncertainty?
Take the steady version of saving rate, s:

                                                    1
                                             s =   [Er1- ]1/ .

If labor income is random (but still idiosyncratic) the saving rate could depend on the level of
wealth, but this only happens for those households that are close to the borrowing limit. Since
Krusell and Smith (1998), we know that there is approximate aggregation. In fact, we can
show that the average saving rates in the economy can be closely approximated by:

                                              1                     2
                                       s =   [Er1- ]1/ e(+1)w /2 ,

where w is the standard deviation of a log-normal shock to labor income.


Remark 2 Determination of optimal portfolio allocation, : In Appendix A we show
that  solves:

                                                                                  -
                          pt+1 i                     i      pt+1
                  Ei           - Rt+1             t  t           + (1 - t )Rt+1        = 0,
                           pt t+1                      +1
                                                             pt

which is also independent of wealth.


The takeaway from these results is that savings in a model with homothetic prefer-
ences is properly represented by a relationship as in (5) where st could be affected by
the interest rate, or its expected value, and the household's labor income risk. In any
case, actual savings links stocks to stocks, while observed savings are just the flows
that make such link operational.



3        Measurement Meets Theory

In this section we show how the observed flow of saving rate and the theoretical actual
saving rate based on stocks are linked. Mapping data with its theoretical counterpart,
income is yt = t at pt + (Rt - 1)bt + wt .6 Since we are abstracting from taxes, we can
    6                                                           i
        Here t is the original definition as a dividend, unlike t which is a gross return.



                                                        6
think about r and w as after-tax prices, so that y is also disposable income. Using this
definition, we can rewrite the budget constraint as:

                              ct + pt at+1 + bt+1 = at pt + bt + yt .

Thus, the saving rate out of disposable income is measured as:

                                  pt (at+1 - at ) + bt+1 - bt   y t - ct
                           sd
                            t =                               =          .                      (7)
                                              yt                    yt

This is the standard measure in NIPA, and is also used for the Flow of Funds financial
accounts to compute the personal saving rate. Using the budget constraint, together
with equations (2) and (3), the law of motion of assets is:

                                   pt at+1 + bt+1 = st Wt - ht ,

                          pt at+1 + bt+1 = st [at pt + bt + yt + ht ] - ht .

Reorganizing we obtain:

                  pt (at+1 - at ) + bt+1 - bt            (at pt + bt + ht )
                                              = (st - 1)                    + st .              (8)
                              yt                                 yt

Combining equations (7) and (8) we can see that the standard flow measure of savings
(sd
  t ) and our stock-based measure of actual savings (st ) are linked by:


                                               (at pt + bt + ht )
                               sd
                                t = (st - 1)                      + st .                        (9)
                                                       yt

Researchers and policymakers sometimes measure the left hand side of (9) and ar-
rive to conclusions which the theory only predicts for st in the right hand side. In
short there tends to be a confusion between an implied flow of savings and the actual
desired volume of savings. If at pt + bt (financial capital) and ht (human capital) are sta-
ble, the implications for sd t carry over to st . However, if either financial or human
capital changes, the mapping is no longer valid and drawing conclusions from the
observation of sdt could be misleading.



Remark 3 Alternative definitions of income: Note that given the right-hand side of the
budget constraint, we can define "net savings" as sd
                                                   t = pt at+1 + bt+1 - pt at - bt . Fagereng et al.

(2019) and Robbins (2019) also define "gross savings," which include expected capital gains,
defined as cgt+1 = (pt+1 - pt )at+1 . In this way they generate an alternative, and broader,
measure of income respect to NIPA, known as "Haig-Simons income." Adding cgt+1 to both
sides of the budget constraint, the gross saving rate can be defined as:

                                                sd  + cgt+1
                                          sg
                                           t   = t          .
                                                 yt + cgt+1

The difference comes from multiplying at+1 by pt+1 rather than pt . The saving rate defined
this way directly adds capital gains to the standard flow of savings. In this paper we focus on
the net rate because it is the standard measure in National Accounts that, is directly implied
by the theory and it is not directly affected by realized capital gains.


Remark 4 The role of heterogeneity: One may be concerned that the standard model does
not consider the implications of saving rate heterogeneity on aggregate measures. As equation
(6) shows, heterogeneity in  ,  , and even permanent differences in returns, could gener-
ate heterogeneous saving rates that interact with aggregation. Suppose that individuals are
indexed by a permanent heterogeneous component j , so that:7

                                      sd,j   j     i    j
                                       t = (st - 1)t + st .


Then, aggregate savings satisfies:

                                sd
                                 t = (st - 1)t + st + s, st t .


Given the correlation s, between saving rates and total wealth, more dispersion in either
of its components should generate larger observed flows of savings, not lower. This effect is
reinforced if the correlation increases.8


While sdt is measured frequently, st is not observable. We can, however, back out st by
adjusting the measure of sdt with information about the evolution of at pt + bt (house-
hold net worth) and ht (approximated by the present value of future labor income,
   7
     Aguiar, Bils, and Boar (2020) show that most of the savings heterogeneity in the U.S. is explained
by a permanent component.
   8
     There seems to be positive correlation between saving rates and net worth, as shown by Dynan,
Skinner, and Zeldes (2004). However, Bach, Calvet, and Sodini (2017), who define savings respect to
financial net worth, found a negative correlation in Swedish data.

discounted at the risk-free rate). This adjustment comes from rewriting equation (9):

                            sd
                             t + t                         at pt + bt + ht
                     st =               where        t =                   .      (10)
                            1 + t                                 yt

Thus, using NIPA and the Flow of Fund tables we can compute the implied theoreti-
cal actual saving rate and compare it with the observed saving rate. The relationship
would depend on how t moves over time, due to either capital gains or human capital
(discounted future labor income).

Figure 1 shows the standard measure of saving rates as a fraction of output, sd . As
we can see it continuously declined from 1970 until the Great Recession.

3.1   Measuring Capital Gains.

As a first step toward measuring capital gains, we compute net worth over income.
This is, defining net worth Nt = at pt + bt we compute the component N    t
                                                                         yt
                                                                            in t . The
Flow of Funds provides information about the aggregate holdings of households.
Using Table B.101 to obtain the net worth and NIPA Table 2.1 to compute personal
income we can construct the first panel of Figure 2. Comparing it with Figure 1 we
can see that both seem to be providing opposite (inconsistent) signals. The sharp fall

                                              9
in sd happens simultaneously with a steep increase in net worth, which increased
by around 30% from 1980 to 2018. How is it possible that net worth increases while
savings decline? The answer may be found by considering capital gains.

From the evolution of net worth, we can compute the implied capital gains in house-
hold balance sheets. Table F6 of Flow of Funds provides the net acquisitions of finan-
cial assets by households. Define dNt = Nt+1 - Nt as the net acquisitions in period t.
Absent capital gains, it must be the case that

                                     ~t+1  dNt + Nt .
                              Nt+1 = N

If in period t the computed value is Nt+1 , we can estimate the capital gain between
period t and t + 1 as the ratio

                                      Nt+1     Nt+1
                               pt =        =          .
                                      ~t+1
                                      N      dNt + Nt


Since these calculations use nominal variables, we divide pt by the consumer price
index to estimate real capital gains. The resulting series is depicted in the second
panel of Figure 2. From 1980 to 2018 there was an estimated capital gain of around
65%. We evaluate later the extent to which observed saving rates can be accounted
for by capital gains.

3.2      Measuring Human Capital.

To recover the theoretical actual savings st , we also need to compute the second com-
ponent of t for each t, which corresponds to human capital, ht . This component
relates to the permanent-income hypothesis ­ both consumption and savings are de-
termined by the present value of the future expected income. Calculating it requires
two elements: the expected future income and a risk-free rate. As our model is based
on real variables in a stationary environment, let R    ~ be the nominal interest rate and
 the inflation rate, so that R~ = R + . Denoting by g       ~y the growth rate of nominal
income per capita, real income growth is g y = g      ~y - . Writing human capital from
equation (1) recursively, ht = wt+1 +ht+1             ~ = h/y is:
                                          , the ratio h

To measure equation (11) we need a measure of capital income share, a risk-free nom-
inal interest rate and the growth rate of nominal per-capita disposable income. The
last measure is the simplest; we define g  ~y as the growth rate of nominal per-capita
disposable income (using NIPA Table 2.1 Line 26 dividing disposable income by to-
tal population). For 1 -  we define total "labor share" (or non-capital income) as
compensation to employees (Table 2.1 Line 2) plus government transfers (Table 2.1
Line 17) which includes social security payments, Medicaid and unemployment in-
surance. We divide this total by personal income (Table 2.1 Line 1). This is the equiv-
alent to w in the model in the sense that it is income that did not result from past
financial investments. Notice that this calculation of  uses gross income, so it is
correct only if all sources of income are taxed at the same rate.9

      NIPA only provides information about the total taxes paid by households, without separating the

Regarding the nominal interest rate R ~ , a natural candidate is the return on treasuries.
The problem with this choice is that in general R  ~ -g
                                                      ~y < 0, which generates confusion
as to how to interpret h. Since in average R ~-g ~y < 0 implies that h < 0, which should
be interpreted as infinite human capital. To avoid this problem, we use the corporate
bond rate Baa from Fred, which ensures that in most periods R     ~-g ~y > 0, and it is not
deeply affected by the liquidity premium embodied in treasuries.

Finally, to make equation (11) operational we would need infinite periods. To over-
come this issue, we assume a final value for h     ~ using a steady state approximation.
                                        ~ = (1-y) . We have data up to 2018, and thus
In steady state, it should be true that h     R~ -g

assume that in 2019 the final value for h~ is the steady state formula h ~ = (1-y) , where
                                                                                                                        ~ -g

all variables are computed as the average of the last ten years. Using (11) we can com-
pute the implied values for h  ~ t using the actual realizations of t+1 , R
                                                                          ~ t+1 and g y

a result, the further back in time we go, the more accurate the calculation becomes.

important fact is the steep increase in the value of human capital to income ratio,
mostly explained by the fall in interest rates. This calculation of human capital uses
labor share (green dashed line in Figure 3), which shows a sharp decline from almost
70% in 1960 to almost 60% in 2010, a fact documented by Karabarbounis and Neiman
(2014), among others.

An alternative is to add government transfers to labor income. When we include the
expected transfers from the government the non-capital share remains stable around
80% (blue dashed line in Figure 3). Human capital with this alternative labor share
is the black solid line in Figure 3). Even though levels are different, the feature of an
increase of human capital remains.



3.3   Comparing Observed Savings and Actual Savings.

Using standard observed savings sd   t and the two components of t , we can compute
theoretical actual savings st from equation (10). The comparison between observed
and actual savings can be seen in Figure 4. The blue line is the actual savings of
households considering capital gains and future labor income, while the orange curve
is the observed saving rate out of the flow of income. It is clear from Figure 4 that the
actual saving rate has been increasing since 1980 after a long and sharp decline.

To understand the roots of the opposite behavior between observed and actual sav-
ing rates we perform a series of counterfactual exercises that consists in asking what
saving rates we would have observed sd   t absent capital gains and human capital, if
maintaining the computed actual saving rates st .


                                                                                                                                         13
From equation (9), the measured sd
                                 t is related to actual savings st by:


                                                                                      sd
                                                                                       t = (st - 1)t + st .


Thus, given st , alternative measures of t would have generated flow of savings dif-
ferent than the one depicted in Figure 1.

In scenario 1) we eliminate capital gains in the computation of t . The counterfactual
sd
 t is plotted in Figure 5 with the grey dashed line. Without capital gains, standard
measures of saving rates would have been very similar to the observed ones, which
also declined until 2000. In the last two decades, however, standard measures of sav-
ing rates would have been three percentage points higher. Intuitively, without capital
gains households would have needed to save more to reach their desired savings
levels.

In scenario 2) we eliminate human capital (fixing h ~=h ~ 1980 ) in the computation of t .
The counterfactual sdt is plotted in Figure 5 with the continuous red line. Without an
increase in expected human capital, standard measures of saving rates would have
increased sharply over time from around 12% to 35%.10 Intuitively, without large
expected increases in human capital households would have needed to save much
  10
     This last measure is strikingly similar to the prediction of Auerbach, Cai, and Kotlikoff (1991), who
forecasted that changes in demographics should have induced an increase in savings of around 30%.

                                                                                                     14
more of their income to reach their desired savings levels. But since the human cap-
ital sharply increased, that wasn't necessary and thus the observed measured rate
declined.



4    Conclusions

Using standard measures of saving rates as a fraction of output to infer the actual sav-
ing rates intended by households is misleading. The main reason is that households
adjust their savings each period to accommodate capital gains and future expected
changes in human capital.

We have made this relation between observed and actual saving rates explicit the-
oretically, and have used the result to compute actual saving rates, showing that in
contrast to observed standard measures of saving rates, U.S. households have actu-
ally increased savings since 1980. We were able to measure the role of capital gains
and human capital in driving this apparent inconsistency. We show that, absent cap-
ital gains, standard measures of saving rates would have been slightly higher in the
last two decades, but absent discounted human capital (partly induced by valuation
at lower rates) observed flow-based saving rates would have increased since 1980.

As shown in equations (3) and (4), we guess and verify that:

                             ci              i
                              t = (1 - st )(t at pt + Rt bt + wt + ht )
                      p t ai            i
                           t+1 = st t (t at pt + Rt bt + wt + ht )

Using the budget constraint and the consumption function we can recover the im-
plicit law of motion of the risk-free asset:

                       bi      i i                       i      i
                        t+1 = t at pt + Rt bt + wt - pt at+1 - ct
                       bi        i               i
                        t+1 = Wt - ht - t st Wt - (1 - st )Wt
                                                                 i

                       bi                   i
                        t+1 = (1 - t )st Wt - ht


Therefore the law of motion of wealth is:

          Wti+1 = ti     i                i
                    +1 at+1 pt+1 + Rt+1 bt+1 + wt+1 + ht+1
                   j pt+1
          Wti+1 = t +1       t st Wti + Rt+1 [(1 - t )st Wti - ht ] + wt+1 + ht+1
                         pt
                           pt+1
          Wti+1 = [t t i
                        +1      + (1 - t )Rt+1 ]st Wti - Rt+1 ht + wt+1 + ht+1      (14)
                            pt

Notice that:                 
                                      wt+j                   wt+1 + ht+1
                      ht =           j                ht =                          (15)
                             j =1    l=1 Rt+l
                                                                Rt+1

Using this recursive representation of ht in equation (14) we obtain:
                                            pt+1
                        Wti+1 = [t t
                                   i
                                     +1          + (1 - t )Rt+1 ]st Wti             (16)
                                             pt

                                                18
which is equation (5) in Section 2. To show that the guess is correct, notice that we
can replace the guessed consumption function ct = (1 - st )Wt in the Euler equation
(13) to get:


                     [(1 - st )Wti ]- = Rt+1 Ei [(1 - st+1 )Wti+1 ]-
Now using equation (5) and reorganizing:

                   [(1 - st )Wti ]- = Rt+1 Ei [(1 - st+1 )rt
                                                           i         i -
                                                             +1 st Wt ]

                                              - -1/
                          (1 - st ) = [Rt+1 Ert +1 ] (1 - st+1 )st
After some simple math:

                   (1 - st )-1 = 1 + [Rt+1 ]1/ [Ert
                                                  - 1/
                                                    +1 ] (1 - st+1 )-1              (17)

Alternative approach. Multiplying (12) by t and (13) by 1 - t and adding up:

                   -              pt+1 i
              (ci
                t)   =  Ei t           (ci )- + (1 - t )Rt+1 (ci
                                                               t+1 )
                                                                    -
                                   pt t+1 t+1
                                     pt+1 i
         [(1 - st )Wti ]- =  Ei t        t+1 + (1 - t )Rt+1 [(1 - st+1 )Wti+1 ]-
                                      pt

Now using equation (5) and reorganizing:

                   [(1 - st )Wti ]- =  Ei (rt
                                            i
                                              +1 )
                                                  1-
                                                     [(1 - st+1 )st Wti ]-


                                            1- -1/
                            (1 - st ) = [ Ert +1 ] (1 - st+1 )st
After some simple reorganization of the last equation we obtain (6) in Section 2:

                        (1 - st )-1 = 1 +  1/ [Ert
                                                 1- 1/
                                                   +1 ] (1 - st+1 )-1


For completeness one can solve for the optimal portfolio allocation . Combining
equations (12) and (13) we have:

                                 pt+1 i             -
                          Ei          - Rt+1 (ci
                                               t+1 )  =0
                                  pt t+1

                           pt+1 i
                   Ei           - Rt+1 [(1 - st+1 )Wti+1 ]- = 0
                            pt t+1

                                             19
                            pt+1 i        i         i -
                      Ei         - Rt+1 [rt +1 st Wt ]  =0
                             pt t+1
As a result the optimal portfolio allocation t solves:
                                                                      -
                   pt+1 i                i    pt+1
            Ei          - Rt+1        t  t           + (1 - t )Rt+1       =0
                    pt t+1                 +1
                                               pt

Which is equation (2) in Section 2 and it is also independent of wealth.
