                                              ABSTRACT

Foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs) account for well over half of all Chinese exports and this share
continues to grow. While the substantial presence of FIEs has contributed greatly to the recent export-led
growth of China, an important objective of the Chinese government is to ultimately obtain foreign
technologies and develop their own technological capabilities domestically. This paper uses detailed
data on Chinese exports by sector and type of enterprise to examine the extent to which domestic enterprises
are "keeping up" or even "catching up" to FIEs in the volume, composition and quality of their exports.
 We also use a newly-created dataset on Chinese policies encouraging or restricting FIEs across sectors
to examine the extent to which such policies can affect the evolving composition of Chinese exports.

1.     Introduction

       The phenomenal growth in Chinese trade with the rest of the world since the opening

of its markets in the 1980s is well documented. Recent attention has begun to examine the

sources of such growth, particularly the concomitant growth of foreign firm presence in

China and their use of China as a low-cost export platform. Whalley and Xin (2006)

document that the foreign-invested enterprise (FIEs) share of Chinese exports has risen from

around 10% in 1990 to almost 60% in 2004 (Figure 4, p. 5). The Chinese experience in this

regard is unique in that a substantial portion of FIE presence is by investors from Hong Kong,

Macau, and Taiwan – regions which are considered politically separate to some degree, but

are populated with ethnic Chinese who have strong connections to mainland China.

However, the share of FIE from other countries is significant and growing over time.

       More broadly, the Chinese situation is also unique in its mixture of markets and state-

controlled portions of the economy. Openness to market forces has been allowed in a

stepwise fashion by the government since 1980, with successive new policy announcements,

presumably informed by prior experience. With respect to foreign direct investment (FDI),

market openness really began with the creation of special economic zones (SEZs) in

Guangdong and Fujian provinces in 1979 that allowed FIEs for the first time, charging such

enterprises a profit tax lower than that applied to domestic enterprises. Through the 1980s,

the number of these special zones increased substantially, and by 1991 many of the

restrictions limiting FIEs to SEZs were lifted. Nevertheless, there continues to be substantial

government oversight with respect to FDI in that all new FIE projects require approval from

the central government and regional governments. In addition, FIEs are often subject to

performance requirements regarding export percentages, local content and technology




                                                                                               2
transfer. In 1997, the Chinese government published the “Catalogue for the Guidance of

Foreign Investment Industries”, which provided explicit information on which sectors it

encourages, restricts, or prohibits FDI. Tax policies toward FIEs has changed over time as

well, with initially lower tax rates for FIEs to recent elimination of such special treatment in

accordance with China’s accession to the World Trade Organization which specifies

“national treatment” of tax policies.1

        There are a couple features of the Chinese government’s policy objectives towards

FIEs that will be important for our analysis and which have been deemed important by

previous literature as well. The first is the Chinese government’s concern with the negative

competition effects of FIEs on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and its intention to limit

domestic access to FIEs. The first SEZs were purposely chosen to be in regions that had

little industrial (and, hence, SOE presence). Branstetter and Feenstra (2002) estimate using

provincial data on FIE presence from 1984 through 1995 find that the Chinese government’s

FIE policies are inherently weighting the welfare of the SOEs four to seven times larger than

consumer welfare. In addition, wholly-owned FIEs are almost always subject to minimum

export targets and local content requirements in order to limit their domestic sales, but keep

their domestic purchases high. Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the Chinese economy and

its exports have been falling significantly as the share of FIEs and, more recently private

firms, has increased.

        A second Chinese policy objective with respect to FDI is facilitation of technology

transfer from FIEs to domestic enterprises. Technology transfer agreements are often an

implicit quid pro quo necessary for approval of an FIE project, and are explicitly necessary to


1
 More detailed discussion of these policies and policy changes are discussed by Li and Li (1999), Rosen
(1999), and Graham (2004).


                                                                                                          3
get approval of an FIE project that will also have access to the domestic market. (Rosen,

1999, p. 72) The clear intent is to improve the Chinese’s own productive capabilities

allowing them to fully appropriate the profits from their manufactures of technological goods

and increasing their long-run growth potential. The risk is that such policies are discouraging

FDI in these sectors and, thus, causing China to miss out on the type of technological

spillovers that would occur naturally.

       The evidence on the net effect of such technology transfer policies is far from known

with only a bit of evidence to date. For example, the Chinese government has required

foreign automakers to partner with domestic producers, and Shanghai Automotive recently

announced plans to start up its own factory to produce a luxury sedan based on plans

purchased from Rover after jointly producing autos in China with General Motors and

Volkswagen for many years. Whether Shanghai Automotive will be successful in this

independent venture is clearly uncertain. Chen and Swenson (2006) and Hale and Long

(2006) provide the first careful evidence on productivity spillovers from foreign firms to

domestic ones in China. Both find evidence for such spillovers, but for very limited groups

of Chinese enterprises. Chen and Swenson (2006) finds evidence for positive own-industry

productivity spillovers for private domestic firms in China (which are still a fairly small

portion of the Chinese economy), while Hale and Long (2006) finds that such spillovers are

only positive for the most technologically advanced Chinese enterprises.

       The extent to which Chinese firms are able to develop their own productive

capabilities and transition from state-controlled firms to private, market-oriented firms is

extremely important. Whalley and Xin (2006) undertake a growth accounting exercise that

finds that while the employment share of FIEs is only 3%, they account for over 20% of the




                                                                                               4
Chinese economy and around 40% of its recent growth. Their conclusion is that the

sustainability of China’s export growth and, indeed its overall GDP growth, is suspect if

inward FDI flows plateau. This would be especially true if productivity spillovers are limited.

This point also relates to recent analysis by Rodrik (2006), which shows that the composition

of Chinese exports is much closer to that of a developed economy than other developing

economies and, that this “advanced” composition of China’s export basket is correlated with

higher long-run growth potential.2 However, the extent to which FIEs are behind such

compositional differences, as well as spillover potential, clearly affects this assertion. Wang

and Wei (forthcoming) in this volume analyzes this further by examining the factors

affecting the evolution of Chinese exports vis-à-vis the rest of the world. In contrast, our

focus is on the internal comparison of how Chinese firms have fared relative to foreign-

owned firms, with an eye toward understanding how much Chinese firms are “catching up”

and the extent to which Chinese policies have facilitated a “catch-up” effect.

        In summary, foreign investment and exports by foreign-owned enterprises have

become quite important to the Chinese economy. At the same time, the Chinese government

has been quite active in trying to “manage” foreign investment into China and, particularly,

to encourage technology transfer, so that their own Chinese-owned firms can “catch up” in

their technological know-how.

        This chapter examines these issues by first presenting a model of potential foreign

investment into a vertically-differentiated industry, with a foreign firm producing a higher

quality product than its Chinese rival. The two-period model begins with a foreign firm

deciding whether to locate production into China, knowing that foreign investment into

lower than for developed economies.


                                                                                                                5
China will lower its production costs, but may lead to greater technology transfer due to

closer proximity to the Chinese firm. The model generates a number of predictions for

relative market shares and prices (unit values) charged by the two firms. We also generate

predictions about how Chinese government policies toward FDI will affect these patterns as

well. We then examine these hypotheses using detailed data on Chinese exports by type of

enterprise (wholly-owned foreign invested enterprises, state-owned enterprises (SOEs, joint

ventures, etc.) to analyze the evolution of Chinese export market shares and unit values over

time during our sample period of 1997-2005.

       The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the

literature review while section 3 presents a model of foreign investment into China. We

briefly discuss the descriptive analysis of exports and unit values over time in section 4.

Section 5 offers the empirical analyses and section 6 concludes.



2.     Literature Review

       A significant portion of the previous academic literature on export activities of China

and the role of FIEs has concerned itself with ownership issues. Feenstra and Hanson (2004)

and Feenstra, Hanson, and Lin (2004) examine the prominent role of Hong Kong investors as

intermediaries in China’s trade to the rest of the world. They find that Hong Kong’s re-

exports of Chinese products involve an average of around 25% markups, which are even

larger for differentiated products and allow for price discrimination across different

destinations. They also develop a discrete choice model of the decision whether to use Hong

Kong as an intermediary for trade. Their empirical analysis based on this model estimates

that the benefits of using Hong Kong intermediaries are equivalent to 16% of the value of the




                                                                                                6
product on average. This is evidence that Hong Kong traders have significant informational

advantages over traders and investors from other countries.

       A related literature has examined the type of FIE chosen by all foreign investors in

China. Initially, the Chinese government only allowed joint ventures, not wholly-owned

FIEs. In addition, exports receive different Customs treatment depending on whether

imported inputs are supplied by the foreign party or not. Feenstra and Hanson (2005)

develop a property-rights model to explain when the foreign party will own the plant and/or

make input decisions, and when such ownership and input decisions will be made by the

Chinese party. Their model and empirical analysis finds that foreign owners will be more

likely to cede control over input decisions when the value added in processing those inputs is

higher (such as for more-technologically-advanced products) and when contracts are easier to

write. A complementary study by Feenstra and Spencer (2005) develops a model to

understand the economic forces that determine whether foreign firms outsource intermediate

inputs through pure external transactions, through contractual arrangements, or through their

own foreign affiliates. They use data on Chinese export behavior by these various types of

arrangements to verify their model’s predictions that the variety of exported intermediate

inputs from foreign affiliates and contractual arrangements increases more relative to

“ordinary” exports the lower the (internal) transport costs within China.

       There is a very recent empirical literature that has begun to examine export behavior

and productivity spillovers using a 2001World Bank survey of 1500 firms across 5 major

Chinese cities. Hale and Long (2006) estimate productivity spillovers from foreign to

domestic firms in the same industry and city using these data and find evidence for such

effects only for the most technologically advanced Chinese firms. Further investigation finds




                                                                                                7
that a significant part of this effect is due to these firms’ higher share of managers with

foreign-firm experience, suggesting that spillovers are occurring through labor mobility.3

Park, Yang, Shi, and Jiang (2006) use the Asian financial crisis as a natural experiment to

examine whether exporting affects productivity of the foreign firms in the sample.4 Variation

in export destinations and their currency devaluation with the crisis is used to identify the

effect of exporting experience on firms’ productivity. The study estimates that such

“learning-by-exporting” effects are significant for firms exporting to developed countries, but

not those exporting via Hong Kong or directly to less-developed countries. A final paper that

uses these World Bank survey data, and which is perhaps closest in topic to this chapter, is

Brambilla (2006). This study presents a model that connects experience and productivity to

firms’ ability to develop new product varieties. She finds that foreign firms in the sample

introduce about twice as many new varieties as domestic ones and, consistent with the

model’s predictions, a significant portion of this is due to productivity differences.

         The papers we have surveyed to this point are mainly microeconomic and relatively

static in their analysis, using detailed firm- or product-level data to document patterns of firm

organization and performance for a given period of time. A number of papers have taken a

broader view of Chinese exporting patterns. For our purposes, we focus on Rodrik (2006)

and Schott (2006). Rodrik (2006) compares the composition of China’s exports and finds

that it is much closer to that of OECD countries than its level of per-capita income would

suggest. This bodes well for China in that a related paper by Hausmann, Hwang, and Rodrik


3
  Chen and Swenson (2006) also examine productivity spillovers from foreign firms to domestic ones in China,
but use the same dataset we examine in this study. While this dataset is not firm-level data per se, it has trade
data by type of firm and city code for later years of the sample. Their productivity spillover analysis finds that
the export presence of foreign firms in the same city and sector is correlated with an increased variety of
exported product codes and higher unit values for private Chinese firms.
4
  They can only examine the foreign firms, as domestic Chinese firms do not report their export destinations
which is key for the study to identify firm-specific exchange-rate shocks.


                                                                                                                 8
(2006) find a strong correlation between the sophistication of a country’s export basket and

its economic growth.     Schott (2006) verifies this increasing sophistication of the export

bundle in terms of the types of products exported by China, but finds that its “exports sell at a

substantial discount relative to its level of GDP and the exports emanating from the OECD.”

(p. 17). Neither paper examines the role of FIEs in these export patterns. Yet Whalley and

Xin’s (2006) analysis suggests that FIEs account for the majority of exports from China and

find that overall growth of the Chinese economy is quite dependent on the highly-productive

FIEs in their economy.



3.     A Model of Foreign Investment into China

In this section we present a simple model to motivate what one may expect to happen to FDI

decisions by foreign firms into China, technology transfer from foreign firms to Chinese ones,

and the ultimate impact on the share of Chinese exports by foreign firms.



3.1    Producers

We employ a partial equilibrium set-up, with one foreign firm and one domestic Chinese

firm producing a good. For convenience, we assume away demand in the Chinese market so

that both firms only supply consumers in the foreign country. Thus, prior to any FDI

decision by the foreign firm, the Chinese firm is the sole source of Chinese exports of the

good to the foreign country.

       There is vertical differentiation of the good supplied by the two firms, with the

foreign firm producing a higher quality good with quality level KF, and the Chinese firm




                                                                                               9
producing with a lower quality level KCH; i.e., KF > KCH.5 Variable production costs are

lower for any firm located in the Chinese market, with an assumed zero constant marginal

cost of production in China, and a marginal cost of c>0 in the foreign market. Thus, FDI

into the Chinese market is attractive to the foreign firm due to the lower costs of production.

However, we also assume that technology transfer may occur between the firms if the foreign

firm locates in the Chinese market. This technology transfers raises the quality (KCH) of the

low-quality Chinese producer, but comes at a cost. For convenience, we assume that

technology transfer is zero if the foreign firm does not locate production in the Chinese

market.6 Because of this difference the foreign firm has incentives to not locate production

in the Chinese market, everything else equal.



3.2      Consumers

Consumers have identical preferences for goods, but vary in their income levels. We assume

that income levels are distributed uniformly over the unit interval where h indexes the

consumer with income of h. Consumers may purchase the good from either the foreign or

domestic producer or choose not to purchase. If they do not purchase the good, they receive

a level of utility equal to U0h, where U0>0. If they purchase the good from a supplier, they

receive utility of U(Ki)(h-pi), where p is the price charged by the supplier and i=CH,F. We

make the natural assumption that U(.) is increasing in K so that higher quality means higher

utility. We also restrict U(K)>U0 for all K so that all consumers would prefer to purchase a

product (regardless of its quality) if its price is zero.



5
 We assume away fixed costs of production for convenience.
6
 This keeps the model simple, but captures the idea that it is easier for technology to transfer when firms are
geographically closer.


                                                                                                                  10
          With this set-up we can now solve for the demand function for each firm in the

following way. Given the parameter space we consider (particularly our restrictions on

marginal cost above), the high-quality firm will always charge a higher price than the low-

quality firm in equilibrium (pF > pCH). Thus, demand along the unit interval of consumers

can be divided into the sections shown in Figure 1, with the highest-income consumers

choosing the high-quality variety and lower-income consumers choosing the low quality

variety or possibly not purchasing the good. This gives us two cut-off income levels: hF

designates the consumer indifferent to purchasing either the high- or low-quality variety,

while hCH designates the consumer indifferent between purchasing the low-quality variety or

not purchasing the good. Formally, the following expression of indifference obtains for the

consumer at hF:

                                U(KF)(hF – pF) = U(KCH)(hF – pCH).                           (1)

Letting x denote U(KF) and y denote U(KCH), we can easily derive the following expression

for hF:

                           hF = [U(KF) pF – U(KCH) pCH)] / [U(KF) - U(KCH)].                 (2)

In similar, fashion hCH can be solved as:

                                 hCH = [U(KCH) pCH] / [U(KCH) - U0].                         (3)

General expressions of demand for each firm are then easily derived as:

              DF(pF, pCH) = 1 – hF = 1 - [U(KF) pF – U(KCH) pCH)] / [U(KF) - U(KCH)],        (4)

and

      DCH(pF, pCH) = hF – hCH

               = [U(KF) pF –U(KCH) pCH)] / [U(KF) U(KCH)]-[U(KCH) pCH] /[U(KCH) U0] .        (5)




                                                                                              11
3.3     Timing of Decisions

        We assume that the foreign firm is initially producing a high-quality variety in the

foreign country with per-unit costs of c, while the Chinese firm is producing a low-quality

variety in the domestic Chinese market with per-unit costs of 0. In period 1, the foreign firm

first decides whether to invest into the China or not. If they locate into China, their per-unit

production costs are immediately reduced to 0. Then both firms choose their prices

simultaneously to compete for consumers.

        If the foreign firm locates into China in the first period, then in period 2 the Chinese

firm decides how much to invest in transferring technology from the foreign firm. In

particular, we assume that the Chinese chooses a λ Є [0,1] that leaves it with a new quality

level KTech = (1-λ)KCH +λKF. The Chinese firm may choose to not engage in technology

transfer activities (λ=0), which would leave it with its original level of quality, KCH. The

associated level of consumer utility connected with this new level of quality is U(KTech).

Costs of technology transfer are increasing in λ, via a quadratic function, CTech(λ) = θλ2.

Once a level of technology transfer is chosen, indexed by λ, then the firms compete in prices

again. If the foreign firm did not locate in the foreign market, the firms compete in prices

again under the same conditions as in the first period with no foreign firm relocation. Profits

for each firm in each period take the general form of Π ti ( pCH
                                                              t
                                                                 , p Ft , K CH , K F , λ , c) where t

denotes the period-subgame combination.



3.4     Solving for equilibrium

We solve for the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the model in the usual fashion by solving

backwards beginning with period 2 of our model. In period 2, there are two possible



                                                                                                        12
subgames – one where the foreign firm did not locate in China and, thus, technology transfer

did not occur (which we denote as 2N) and one where the foreign firm located in China and

technology transfer has potentially occurred to the Chinese firm (which we denote as

subgame 2T). In subgame 2N, the foreign firm does not locate production into China and

continues to have a cost disadvantage (i.e., c>0), but no technology transfer occurs (λ=0). In

this case, we denote the respective Nash Equilibrium profits of the foreign and Chinese firms

as

                              Π CH
                                2N
                                   ≡ Π CH ( pCH
                                             2N
                                                , p F2 N , K CH , K F ,0, c)                 (6)

                              Π 2FN ≡ Π F ( pCH
                                             2N
                                                , p F2 N , K CH , K F ,0, c)                 (7)

       2N
where pCH , p F2 N are the optimally chosen prices by the Chinese and foreign firm, respectively.

These equilibrium prices and profits will be identical to those in period 1 when the foreign

firm does not relocate to China (denoted subgame 1N).

       The more interesting and relevant case for our purposes is subgame 2T, where the

foreign firm has located into China and reduced its production costs from c to 0, but the

Chinese firm has the ability to increase its quality from K1 to KTech through technology

transfer. Given costs, qualities and optimally chosen technology transfer, the firms

simultaneously choose their own price to maximize profits. We denote the respective Nash

Equilibrium profits of the foreign and Chinese firms in this subgame as

                               Π CH
                                 2T
                                    ≡ Π CH ( pCH
                                              2T
                                                 , p F2T , K CH , K F , λ , c)               (8)

                               Π 2FT ≡ Π F ( pCH
                                              2T
                                                 , p F2T , K CH , K F , λ , c)               (9)




                                                                                               13
       2T
where pCH , p F2T and are the optimally chosen prices by the Chinese and foreign firm,

respectively, and λ is the optimal degree of technology transfer chosen by the Chinese firm.

From this, we get Propositions 1a and 1b:

Proposition 1a: The ratio of the foreign firm’s equilibrium price to the Chinese firm’s
equilibrium price is decreasing in the amount of technology transfer. (See appendix for
proof)

Proposition 1b: The ratio of the foreign firm’s market share to the Chinese firm’s market
share in equilibrium is decreasing in the amount of technology transfer. (See appendix for
proof)


The results in propositions 1a and 1b are quite intuitive. It is easy to show in the model that a

higher quality firm will charge a higher price. Thus, as technology transfer leads to the

quality of the two firms converging, the equilibrium prices charged by the firms also

converge. An increase in technology also allows the low-quality firm to “steal” market share

away from the high-quality firm even though the high-quality firm will optimally respond by

lowering its equilibrium price some.

         Now we turn to the Chinese firm’s optimal technology transfer decision as

represented by their choice of λ prior to the market competition in period 2. The Chinese

firm’s problem is to choose λ to maximize second-stage profits net of technology transfer

costs:

                          Max Π CH
                                Net
                                    ≡ Π CH
                                        2T    2T
                                           ( pCH , p F2T , K CH , K F , λ ,0) − θλ2         (10)
                            λ


From this optimization problem, we can easily derive:

Proposition 2: The level of technology transfer chosen by the Chinese firm is decreasing in
the cost/difficulty of such transfer (θ). (See appendix for proof)


This leads to the following corollaries:




                                                                                               14
Corollary 3a: The greater the cost of technology transfer, the less the Chinese firm’s
equilibrium price moves closer to the foreign firm’s equilibrium price for the case where
the foreign firm locates in China. (See appendix for proof)

Corollary 3b: The greater the cost of technology transfer, the higher the ratio of the
foreign firm’s market share to the Chinese firm’s market share in equilibrium for the case
where the foreign firm locates in China. (See appendix for proof)


       Corollaries 3a and 3b are a primary focus for our empirical work below where we

examine how the relative prices and export market shares of the Chinese and foreign firms

evolve after FDI into China. In particular, our hypotheses stemming from these corollaries is

that factors that make technology transfer more costly/difficult mitigates positive spillover

effects from foreign firm presence to the Chinese firms. In the case, of prices, more

costly/difficult technology transfer means that Chinese firms’ export prices do not catch up to

foreign firm export prices for the same good very quickly or at all. In the case of market

shares, more costly/difficult technology transfer means that Chinese firms’ relative export

market share will increase less or even decline with foreign firm presence.

       Finally, we solve the first-period of the model. If the foreign firm does not locate in

China (subgame 1N) then equilibrium prices and profits are identical those in subgame 2N

described above. If the foreign firm locates in the Chinese market, production costs are

lowered, but technology transfer has not yet occurred. Equilibrium profits in this subgame

(denoted subgame 1L) are:

                             Π 1CH
                                 L
                                   ≡ Π CH ( pCH
                                             1L
                                                , p 1FL , K CH , K F ,0,0)                   (11)

                              Π 1FL ≡ Π F ( pCH
                                             1L
                                                , p 1FL , K CH , K F ,0,0)                   (12)




                                                                                                15
       1L
where pCH , p 1FL and are the optimally chosen prices by the Chinese and foreign firm in this

subgame. It’s easy to show the following relationships between equilibrium profits for the

foreign firm:

                                      Π1FL > Π1FN ≡ Π 2FN , and                              (13)

                                             Π 2FT ≤ Π 2FN .                                 (14)

This leads us to an analysis of the foreign firm’s initial decision whether to engage in FDI or

not by locating in China. Assuming a one-time fixed cost of FDI, which we denote as F, the

foreign firm decides to locate to China if

                                   Π1FL + Π 2FT − F > Π1FN + Π 2FN .                         (15)

This leads to

Proposition 4: The FDI decision by the foreign firm into China is more likely, 1) the
greater the cost savings, and 2) the greater the cost/difficulty of technology transfer . (See
appendix for proof)

While our empirical work below does not examine data on FDI into China, Proposition 4

highlights that FDI is endogenous with the ability of Chinese firms to transfer technology

from the foreign firm. When technology transfer is made relatively easy by the FDI, the

foreign firm is less likely to locate in China. This selection issue suggests that we may only

observe FDI into industries where technology transfer is difficult/costly. Thus, we may find

little evidence of convergence of relative export prices and increases in Chinese market share

after as FDI increases in an industry. Our empirical analysis below will account for this

potential endogeneity bias.




                                                                                                16
3.5    Role of government policies

       The Chinese government has active policies to encourage or restrict FDI into certain

industries or products. A simple way to examine the impact of these policies in the model is

to simply think of these policies as either lowering or raising the fixed costs of FDI (F).

Encouragement of FDI (lowering of F) would obviously lead to the condition in (15) being

more likely satisfied, increasing the probability of FDI. The immediate effect would be to

increase the foreign firm market share (from zero when no FDI takes place). However, the

foreign firms that did not engage in FDI in the first place were ones for which technology

transfer would be more significant or production cost decreases from location to China less

significant. If the encouragement policy selects a foreign firm into China that otherwise

would have stayed out because of technology transfer concerns, then by Proposition 1a and

1b, we may expect the encourage policy to lead to a greater decrease in the ratio of foreign-

to-Chinese market shares and unit values over time.

       Of course, all of these effects stemming from a policy of encouraging FDI would be

the exact opposite with a Chinese government policy of restricting FDI, if such restrictions

simply increase the costs of FDI. However, in many cases, Chinese restrictions on FDI

involve requiring foreign firms to partner with a Chinese firm and/or arrange for technology

transfer. A prominent example of this is the automobile industry. This restriction can easily

be modeled as a lowering of technology transfer costs (θ) in our model, which by corollaries

3a and 3b would make the ratio of foreign-to-Chinese market shares and unit values decrease

in the second period, ceteris paribus. However, both the higher fixed costs of FDI and

greater technology transfer makes it less likely that the foreign firm would enter.




                                                                                                17
3.6    Ownership structure

       For simplicity, we do not consider alternative forms of FDI ownership structure in our

model. However, the data we explore below have considerable amounts activity from both

joint venture and wholly-owned foreign enterprises. Joint venture activity presumably

facilitates greater technology transfer (i.e., lower costs of transfer for the Chinese firm). A

foreign firm could conceivably be interested in pursuing a joint venture, nevertheless, if it

lowered its fixed costs of FDI or provided an even greater reduction in production costs.

This would lead to a positive selection effect, making it more likely that a foreign firm will

invest in China despite technology transfer concerns. Thus, while we have not modeled a

foreign firm’s decision of ownership structure, this discussion suggests that when a foreign

firm does choose to joint venture, we should expect a greater decrease in relative foreign-to-

Chinese market shares and unit values over time than in the case where the foreign firm

chooses to be an independent, wholly-owned foreign enterprise.



4.     A Brief Descriptive Analysis of Exports and Unit Values over Time

       Before examining our hypotheses, we briefly describe and look at some general

trends in the primary data set on Chinese exports we use for our analysis. These Chinese

trade data span the years from 1995 to 2005 and were made available through the Customs

General Administration of the People’s Republic of China, as part of the project described in

Feenstra et al. (1998). Our data set include both ordinary and processing trade. An

important feature of the data is that it disaggregates export trade activity by the type of

enterprise; namely, foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), state-owned firms (SOEs),

contractual-joint ventures (CJVs), equity-joint ventures (EJVs), collectively-owned




                                                                                                  18
enterprises (COEs), and privately-owned enterprises (POEs). FIEs are enterprises wholly-

owned by foreign funded enterprises and overseas Chinese companies. SOEs are the

traditional non-corporation economic units, where the entire assets are owned by the state.

COEs are collectively owned economic units, including township and village enterprises.

POEs are economic units owned by private, domestic Chinese individuals. Finally, CJVs are

joint ventures between Chinese corporations and foreign partners, where profits and risks are

shared in accordance with their agreements, whereas EJVs are joint ventures where profits

and risks are shared in accordance with the percentage of shareholdings and the foreign entity

may not own more than 50 percent of the venture. These distinctions will allow us to

understand the various and changing role of foreign and domestic enterprises in Chinese

exporting patterns.

           Figure 2 provides the value of exports over time for the top ten industries at the 2-

digit HS level.7 Machinery (HS 84) and Electrical Machinery (HS 85) clearly represent the

largest exporting sectors in China and have been a primary driving force in the growth of

Chinese exports over this period. These two sectors are followed by the two main apparel

sectors (HS 61 and 62), the Furniture and Bedding sector (HS 94) and the Toys and Games

sector (HS 95). Figure 3 shows the export shares of all Chinese exports for years 1995,

2000, and 2005 by firm types. Although the share of SOE exports in 1995 is the largest, the

value of exports by SOE has been significantly decreasing relative to the other firm types

over the years. In place of the declining SOE export shares is the rise in exports by FIEs,

EJVs, COEs, and POEs. Most significant is the relatively large increase in export shares by

POEs from 2000 to 2005. For purposes of our analysis below, we will primarily separate our

    We use the end-of-sample 2004 rankings of export shares to determine the top ten sectors.


                                                                                                   19
data into two groups which we call the foreign firms, consisting of the CJVs, EJVs, and FIEs,

and the Chinese firms consisting of the COEs, POEs, and SOEs.



5.     Empirical Analysis

       We now turn to a statistical analysis of relative market shares and unit values for

foreign and Chinese exports from 1997 through 2005. Our focus is the changes over time in

these relative foreign-to-Chinese measures and how various factors, as suggested by our

model, affect these dynamic patterns. Our estimation strategy is quite simple with

benchmark models specified as the following:

                                           2005
                            FS jt = α +    ∑ β YD +ψ
                                          t =1998
                                                    t   t           j   + ε jt ,                  (16)

                                                             2005
                        ln UV jtF − ln UV jtCH = α +         ∑ β YD
                                                            t =1998
                                                                        t     t    + ψ j + ε jt   (17)


where FSjt is the foreign enterprises’ share of Chinese exports for a given 6-digit HS (HS6)

product code and year, UVjtF and UVjtCH are Chinese export unit values for the foreign and

Chinese enterprises for the HS6 product code j and year t, respectively, YDt are year dummy

variables, ψj are the HS6 product fixed effects, and εjt is an assumed white-noise random

error term. Given that we exclude our sample’s first year, 1997, our year dummy coefficients

capture the difference in the dependent variable from 1997, allowing one to easily chart the

progression of these relative measures over time. Given the specification of the dependent

variable in (16), the coefficients on our year dummies in our “market share regressions”

show the percentage point different in the foreign market share from our base year, 1997.

For the “unit value regressions” in (17), the year dummy coefficients capture the percentage

difference from the base year, 1997.



                                                                                                   20
       From these benchmark models, we explore a number of factors that may affect the

evolution of relative market shares and unit values over time, as motivated by the theoretical

model in section 3. We do this by introducing interaction of these factors, in turn, with our

year dummies. Throughout our tables of empirical estimates, we make the distinction

between the individual coefficient estimates on the interaction terms between a factor and the

year dummies (denoted as “Marginal Differences”) and the sum of the interaction terms and

their associated year dummy coefficients (denoted “Total Annual Effect”).

       Our theoretical model in section 3 suggests three types of factors that may affect the

evolution of our dependent variables: 1) cost of technology transfer, 2) government policies,

and 3) ownership structure. Measures of technology transfer costs are difficult to observe, so

we rely on two proxies: 1) product differentiation and 2) R&D intensity. Our hypotheses are

that sectors with higher R&D intensity and product differentiation will be ones for which

technology transfer is more costly for the Chinese firm. Thus, by corollaries 3a and 3b, these

factors should be associated with lower declines in relative foreign-to-Chinese market shares

and unit values. The R&D intensity, defined as the number of R&D scientist and engineers

per 1000 employees in R&D-performing companies, is from the National Science

Foundation’s Research and Development in Industry (various years). The classification of

goods is from Rauch (1999).

        With respect to government policies, we focus on official lists from the Chinese

government indicating in which sectors they are encouraging or restricting FDI. Information

on industries that the Chinese government encourages, restricts, or prohibits comes from the

Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, first published by the Chinese

government in 1997, and significantly updated in 2002. The listed industries and products




                                                                                                21
are not identified with any formal industrial classification system. We use key words in the

industry/product description for both the 1997 and 2002 lists to search for associated

Harmonized System codes using the U.S. International Trade Commission tariff database

search engine, available at http://dataweb.usitc.gov/scripts/tariff2003.asp. As discussed in

section 3 our model predicts that encouragement of FDI will increase the relative foreign

market share, but may accentuate technology transfer, leading to a greater decrease in the

relative unit value gap. On the other hand, restrictions on FDI should lead to greater

decreases in both foreign market share and relative unit value gap. Likewise, as discussed in

section 3, we would expect to see greater decreases in both foreign market share and relative

unit value gap for joint ventures (where the foreign firm is working in close connection with

a Chinese partner) than with a wholly-owned (and independent) FIE.

       Before turning to our results, it is important to note that our hypotheses come from a

model of one-time competition between a single foreign firm and a single Chinese firm. In

reality, of course, there are likely many foreign and Chinese firms for even a given HS6

product and there has been ongoing FDI into China over our sample period. This most

obviously affects our foreign market share variable, where continual FDI can lead us to see

increasing foreign market shares even if significant technology transfer is taking place.

Likewise, unit value gaps may increase over time if foreign firms are locating ever more

sophisticated products into China. On one hand, this is not a significant issue in examining

the role of various factors in catch-up – it simply means that a factor that would lead to

greater declines in foreign market share in our pure theoretical model simply translates into

smaller increases in foreign market share in a world where foreign market shares are

generally increasing over time. However, we will have to careful not to assert that there is




                                                                                                22
no technology catch-up if we do not find falling foreign market shares or unit value gaps in

our analysis. To address this further, at the end of our empirical section, we regress unit

value gaps not on year dummies, but on lagged foreign market share to control for the

dynamic changes in FDI patterns explicitly and more clearly identify any net technology

transfer effect.



5.1     Benchmark

        To explore the evolution of relative foreign and Chinese export market shares and

unit values we first regress each of our dependent variables on year dummies to uncover the

general dynamic pattern over our sample. Our model explains about 84% of the variation in

relative foreign and Chinese export market share and roughly 60% in relative unit values.

We lose approximately one-third of our observations in estimating (17) due to cases in which

only one of the two firm types export in a sector for a particular year.8 The results of the

benchmark estimation are provided in columns 1 and 2 of Table 1. In what follows relative

foreign and Chinese export market shares (FS) will be presented in the first of the two

columns; whereas relative unit values (UV) will be is given in the second. We find that

conditional on foreign investment in an industry, foreign firms are gaining export market

share relative to Chinese firms over time. More specifically, as compared to 1997 the

relative foreign-to-Chinese export market shares increased by 1.2 percent in 1998 and 4.9

percent in 2005. Moreover, the unit value gap between foreign firms and Chinese firms is




8
  As our model indicates, sample selection concerns may be quite important for our estimates of factors
affecting Chinese catch-up. Interestingly, we found that sample selection effects were often rejected as
insignificant in our regression estimates and had hardly any impact on other estimated coefficients. Thus, we
only report estimates without any sample selection correction.


                                                                                                                23
increasing over time during our sample period. However, the increase in the relative unit

values peaked around 2003 then began to narrow in the last two years of the sample period.

       In the remainder of the section, we will explore how the dynamic patterns

systematically differ for various attributes beginning with the cost of technology transfer

using the following estimation equations:

                                       2005                   2005

where Tech jt denotes the cost of technology transfer and YDt ⋅ Tech jt is the interaction

5.2    Cost of Technology Transfer

       As previously mentioned, we use two methods to measure of cost technology transfer

costs: 1) product differentiation and 2) R&D intensity. Table 1 presents the findings for

production differentiation in columns 3 to 10. Contrary to our hypotheses, the marginal

effects in column 3 suggest that sectors with product differentiation decline in relative

foreign-to-Chinese market shares. However as expected the higher cost of technology

transfer leads to an increase in the relative foreign-to-Chinese unit values. Namely, there is

no evidence of catch-up by Chinese firms for differentiation products even though their

export market share is increasing relative to the foreign firms. In columns 5 and 6, we sum

the coefficient on the year dummy and the coefficient on the interaction between the year

dummy and differentiated products. Similar to the benchmark specification, the results


                                                                                                                       24
indicate an increase in the relative market shares. Moreover, while the sum of the

coefficients on the year dummy and the interaction variable is positive, the unit value gap is

smaller after 2003.

           To further analyze the cost of technology transfer, we identify goods shipped to the

G-3 countries (columns 7 and 8) and Hong Kong (columns 9 and 10) by estimating the

equations below:9

where Dest tu stands for destination of sales with u = G-3, Hong Kong. Considering goods

exported only to the G-3 countries help to account for the increasingly role of Western and

Japanese FDI in China during the 1990s (Branstetter and Feenstra, 2002). Moreover, the

opportunity for spillover is larger with G-3 countries since they are the source of

technological advancement. The motivation to control for sales to Hong Kong stems from its

role as intermediaries in China’s export performance (Feenstra and Hanson, 2004).

           The values presented in columns 7 to 10 is the sum of βt,δjt, and ηjt in estimating (20)

and (21) for the two sales destinations. Comparing columns 5, 7, and 9, we find that the

rising relative foreign-to-Chinese market shares is larger for goods shipped directly to the G-

3 countries relative to those exported to all destinations and Hong Kong. Interestingly, the

unit value gap is larger for goods shipped to Hong Kong. Moreover, starting from 2004, the




9
    Industrial Countries are defined as EU15, Japan, and the United States.


                                                                                                                                              25
relative unit values are smaller for goods destined for the G-3 countries as compared to the

entire sample.

         The results of our second proxy for cost of technology transfer, R&D intensity, is

provided in Table 2. Similar to the results of differentiated goods, the marginal effects of

R&D intensity given in columns 1 and 2 are negative; however, the results are insignificant.

The findings in columns 3, 5 and 7 are not statistically different from the overall general

trends. In general, the relative unit values are also rising for good shipped to the all countries,

the G-3 countries, and Hong Kong. Taken together, our findings suggest Chinese firms fail

to catch-up in sectors that are more costly in terms of technology transfer.



5.3      Government Policies

         An “encourage” policy means that the Chinese government offers incentives to

promote inflows of FDI. To examine the importance of government policies we re-estimated

(18) to (21) where we substituted Techjt with Policyt. Presented in columns 1 to 6 in Table 3

the results show that regardless of export destination, relative foreign-to-Chinese market

shares increase more in these encouraged industries.10 Thus, there is evidence that

encouragement brings in FDI by foreign firms. While the change in relative unit value

differences is unclear for the marginal effects and widens for goods sent to Hong Kong, the

results also show that the relative unit value is negative and significant in the latter two years

for goods exported to the G-3 countries. This result supports the finding by Park, Yang, Shi,

and Jiang (2006) that “learning-by-exporting” effects are significant for firms exporting to

developed countries, but not those exporting via Hong Kong.


10
  Note that the relative market shares are negative and significant for goods shipped to Hong Kong in the first
two years of our sample.


                                                                                                                  26
        Contrary to policies that encourage FDI, the Chinese government may restrict the

activities of foreign firms for a number of reasons: i) to limit competition in the domestic

market, ii) to control strategic sectors (such as national defense or natural resources), or iii) to

promote technology transfer. The results of the estimation with the “restrict” policy is also

provided Table 3. Columns 7 and 8 show that there is no change in relative foreign-to-

Chinese market shares, but obvious decrease in relative unit value differences over time

relative to general trend, suggesting that the technology transfer is occurring in restricted

industries. Upon closer examination, the findings suggest that unlike the “encouraged”

policy, the technology transfer under the “restrict” policy occurs mainly through goods

exported to Hong Kong rather than the G-3 countries. However, the relative foreign-to-

Chinese market shares increase for goods shipped to both Hong Kong and the G-3 countries

with the shares rising faster for the latter.



5.4     Ownership Structure

        In addition to cost of technology transfer and government polices we expect that the

structure of the firm ownership may also affect the evolution of our dependent variables.

Specifically, we expect to find that the foreign market share and relative unit value gap to

decrease for joint ventures (JV) relative to wholly-foreign owned FIEs. To examine our

hypotheses we estimate (16) and (17) separately for the two different ownership structures.

The annual changes in relative market shares and unit values for JVs and FIEs are shown in

Table 4. Columns 1 and 2 presents the JVs results for relative foreign-to Chinese market

shares and unit value, respectively; whereas columns 3 and 4 gives the wholly-foreign owned

FIEs findings in columns 3 and 4. As expected, the relative market shares are decreasing for




                                                                                                 27
joint ventures. Moreover, the relative market shares are decreasing at an increasing rate over

the years as compared to 1997. The results, however, are opposite for FIEs. For both

ownership types, the relative unit value gap is increasing, which suggests a lack of

technology transfer.

       As a further analysis, we examine the evolution of our dependent variables for two

sectors: i) machinery given in Table 5 and ii) electronics shown in Table 6. The overall

results for machinery indicate that there is no evidence of catch-up by Chinese firms even

when we account for export destination and government policies. The exception lies in the

export of machinery to the G-3 countries for years 2004 and 2005. By contrast, foreign firms

are losing market shares to the Chinese firms in machinery goods exported to Hong Kong as

compared to 1997 for years 1998 to 2000. Likewise, the results in Table 6 suggest that the

relative foreign market shares are also rising for electronics bounded for the G-3 countries

while decreasing for those going to Hong Kong. The declining relative market share for

electronics exported to Hong Kong but not to the G-3 countries may indicate more direct

involvement via vertical differentiation by foreign firms over the years rather than

outsourcing through the Chinese city-state. Noteworthy is that electronics results suggest

evidence of technology transfer for restricted foreign investment. However, the results are

opposite for the “encourage” policy where there is a widening of the unit value gap.



5.5    Is Increasing FDI Masking “Catch Up” Effects?

       A concern with our estimates, and the unexpected increasing foreign market share

and relative unit values, is the issue of increasing FDI activity over time. Obviously an

increase of FDI into China of export-oriented foreign firms may be a driving force in the




                                                                                               28
increase in foreign firm export market shares, thus masking any catch-up effects. Likewise,

if these new foreign firms are locating products in China that are increasingly more

sophisticated, this could be behind the rising gap in foreign-to-Chinese relative unit values as

well. However, an important argument against such a concern is that the ratio of FDI in

China relative to GDP has been fairly constant around 15% since the early 1990s, as shown

in Figure 4. In fact, FDI stock as a percent of GDP has even fallen some over our sample

period from 1997 to 2005.

        As a further way to investigate this issue, we use our available data to control for

previous FDI in the HS6 as much as the data allow. While we do not have data on FDI by

industries into China over time (much less at the HS product level), we can use prior foreign

market share in a HS6 product as a proxy for previous FDI. Thus, we estimate the following

specification that modifies equation (17):

                                                                     2005
          ln UV jtF − ln UV jtCH = α + θ 1 FS jt + θ 2 LagFS jt +    ∑ β YD
                                                                    t =1998
                                                                              t   t   + ψ j + ε jt   (22)


where LagFSjt is a term that controls for previous (lagged) foreign-firm market share in a

HS6 product.11 There are a number of ways in which we could specify this lagged term, but

we chose to construct as a moving average of the previous 3 years of the foreign market

share (FSjt) in a given HS6 product j.12

        Table 7 provides results from various runs of this specification. Column (1) provides

our benchmark specification with now some evidence of fairly modest catch-up by Chinese

firms as evidenced by the statistically significant negative coefficient on the lagged foreign

market share term. Interestingly, current period foreign market share is strongly associated

11
  We do not estimate a similar foreign market share equation due to more serious endogeneity concerns adding
lagged foreign market share terms in that setting.




                                                                                                          29
with much greater increase in the relative foreign-to-Chinese unit values, suggesting that new

FDI involves much greater unit values (i.e., sophistication). Comparing the ratios of the two

terms suggests that the Chinese firms are able to then close the gap over the next three years

by about 12% (-0.122 relative to 1.013).

           In the subsequent columns, we again examine how various factors may affect this

catch-up by interacting these factors with our regressors and reporting the appropriate sums

of the coefficients to yield the effect for our sub-sample of interest. The next two columns

provide estimates for differentiated products and high technology products, sub-samples for

which we would expect that catch-up effects would be lessened. While the catch-up effect is

smaller for differentiated products at about 7.4% (-0.104 relative to 1.397), the high-

technology sector looks virtually identical to the full sample. The next two columns look at

how sectors affected by Chinese government policies vary in their catch-up effect. These

sectors are surprisingly much different from the rest of the sample in showing no catch-up

effects whatsoever. Thus, to the extent that these government policies are intended to

encourage technology transfer, we find no evidence of this. The final two columns of Table

7 provide separate estimates when we look at just FIEs and JVs, respectively. Surprisingly,

the catch-up is larger for FIEs than the general sample, though not precisely estimated, while

there is no evidence of catch-up for Chinese firms vis-à-vis the JVs where we would expect it

to be larger than the general sample.


6.         Conclusion

           Facilitating technology transfer to allow their domestic firms to catch up to foreign

firms invested in their country is an obvious goal of the Chinese government in the policies

12
     We also tried putting in separate lags of Fshare going back up to 4 years, but found that standard errors for



                                                                                                                     30
they have regarding FDI. Recent literature has documented the high level of sophistication

of Chinese exports for a country at its general level of development. An important question

is whether this is simply driven by the foreign firms in China or whether Chinese firms are

also gaining greater sophistication from this foreign presence. The answer to this question

has significant implications for China’s long-term growth potential.

         We explore the extent to which Chinese firms are gaining sophistication relative to

foreign firms present in China (i.e., catching up) using detailed Chinese export data that

separately reports exports from foreign and Chinese enterprises. The general patterns over

our time period, 1997-2005, run exactly counter to what one would expect if Chinese firms

were catching up – foreign firm’s share of exports by product category and foreign unit

values relative to Chinese unit values are increasing over time, not decreasing. We see these

patterns despite the fact that FDI into China as a percent of GDP has not increased since

before our sample. Specifications examining how previous foreign market share affects

current unit value gaps finds only modest catching up, at best. There is some, albeit modest,

evidence that Chinese policies used to encourage or restrict FDI have an impact on catching

up of Chinese firms. In particular, the encourage policies facilitated the narrowing of the unit

value gap between foreign and Chinese firms in goods shipped to the G-3 countries in the last

two years of our sample period while the restrict policies successful decreased the unit value

differential in exports to Hong Kong and for electronic goods. However, we fail to find that

joint venturing activity with foreign firms leads to greater catching up in sophistication

within a HS6 product code.



our coefficients were often quite high due to multicollinearity amongst the lagged terms.

Appendix

This appendix provides proofs for the results in the propositions and corollaries presented in
the theory section of the paper. Throughout, we simplify notation by letting x denote U(KF),
y denote U(KCH) and xTech denote U(KTech), recalling that KTech = (1-λ)KCH +λKF.

Proof of Proposition 1a: Solving for Nash Equilibrium prices in period 2 after the foreign
firm has located to China and technology transfer has taken place (subgame 2T), one can
then construct expressions for demands for each firm in terms of parameters as:

                                      D 2FT = 2( x − xTech ) /( 4 x − 3U 0 − xTech ) ,        (A1)
                                         2T
                                      D CH  = ( x − U 0 ) /(4 x − 3U 0 − xTech )              (A2)

Thus, the ratio of foreign-to-Chinese demands is:

                                      Θ 2T ≡ DF2T / DCH
                                                     2T
                                                        = 2( x − xTech ) /( x − U 0 )         (A3)

Then, the effect of technology transfer on this ratio is the following:

                                      ∂Θ 2T ∂Θ 2T ∂xTech
                                           =             = −2( x − U 0 ) < 0                  (A4)
                                       ∂λ    ∂xTech ∂λ


Q.E.D.


Proof of Proposition 1b: Solving for Nash Equilibrium prices in period 2 after the foreign
firm has located to China and technology transfer has taken place (subgame 2T), we obtain:

                p F2T = [2( x − U 0 )( x − xTech )] /[ x(4 x − 3U 0 − xTech )] ,              (A5)
                p   2T
                    CH   = [( xTech − U 0 )( x − xTech )] /[ xTech (4 x − 3U 0 − xTech )] .   (A6)

Thus, the ratio of foreign-to-Chinese prices is:

                Ω 2T = p F2T / pCH
                                2T
                                   = [2 xTech ( x − U 0 ) / x)][ xTech − U 0 ] −1             (A7)




                                                                                                43
Then, the effect of technology transfer on this ratio is the following:

        ∂Ω 2T ∂Ω 2T ∂xTech ⎡ 2( x − U 0 ) ⎤ ⎡          xTech      ⎤
             =            =⎢                  ⎥ ⎢1 −              ⎥[K F − K CH ]             (A8)
         ∂λ    ∂xTech ∂λ   ⎣ x( xTech − U 0 ) ⎦ ⎣ ( xTech − U 0 ) ⎦

Given the parameter values and relationships presented in the text, this is easily signed as
negative. Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 2: Simple comparative static to be detailed in next draft.



Proof of Corollaries 3a and 3b: Using notation for relative price and unit values above, we
can derive the following expressions:

                        ∂Θ 2T ∂Θ 2T ∂λ     ∂Ω 2T ∂Ω 2T ∂λ
                             =         and      =         .                                (A9)
                         ∂λ    ∂λ ∂θ        ∂λ    ∂λ ∂θ

By the relationships established in propositions 1a, 1b, and 2, relative foreign demand and
unit values are then increasing in θ. Q.E.D.


Proof of Proposition 4: By the Envelope Theorem, Π1FN and Π 2FN are decreasing in c, while
c is non-varying parameter in Π1FL and Π 2FT . Thus, an increase in c (i.e., greater cost savings
when the firm locates in China) lowers the RHS of equation (9) in the text and makes FDI
more likely. Likewise, the technology cost variable, θ, is only an argument in Π 2FT on the
LHS equation (9). By the Envelope Theorem, Π 2T
                                             F is increasing in θ, thus making FDI more
likely. Q.E.D.
