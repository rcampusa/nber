We examine international equity allocations at the fund level and show how different returns on
the foreign and domestic proportion of portfolios determine rebalancing behavior and trigger
capital flows. We document the heterogeneity of rebalancing across fund types, its greater
intensity under higher exchange rate volatility, and the exchange rate effect of such rebalancing.
The observed dynamics of equity returns, exchange rates, and fund-level capital flows are
compatible with a model of incomplete FX risk trading in which exchange rate risk partially
segments international equity markets.

1         Introduction
Gross stocks of cross-border assets and liabilities have increased dramatically from around 60%
of world GDP in the mid-1990s to approximately 200% in 2015 (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti,
2017).1 Capital gains and losses on those assets have signi…cant e¤ects on the dynamics of
countries’ external asset positions. The macroeconomic literature …nds that valuation e¤ects
induced by asset price changes have become quantitatively large relative to the traditional
determinants of the current account.2 Valuation e¤ects can also impact the portfolio allocation
decisions of investors directly and trigger capital ‡ows. Yet, there is surprisingly little systematic
documentation about this at the microeconomic level. How do international investors adjust
their risk exposure in response to the ‡uctuations in realized returns they experience on their
positions? Do they rebalance their portfolios towards their desired weights or do they increase
their exposure to appreciating assets? What are the consequences of those portfolio decisions
for exchange rates and capital ‡ow dynamics?
        This paper analyzes time series variation in international asset allocations of a large cross-
section of institutional investors. A distinctive feature of our approach is its microeconomic
focus: while international capital ‡ows and returns are two key variables in international macro-
economics, a purely aggregate analysis is plagued by issues of endogeneity, heterogeneity and
statistical power. For example, asset returns may be reasonably exogenous to the individual
fund and its allocation decisions, but this is not true at the aggregate level, where capital ‡ows
are likely to in‡uence asset and exchange rate returns. Fund heterogeneity can obscure the
aggregate dynamics, but can also generate testable predictions on rebalancing behavior at the
fund level. Finally, any analysis at the individual fund level has enormous statistical power due
to a large cross-section of individual funds.
        To better frame our analysis, we start with an equilibrium model of optimal dynamic portfolio
rebalancing (Hau and Rey, 2006). The model features an exogenous dividend pay-o¤ process
    1
     They peaked at slightly more than 200% in 2007. We use the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey
(CPIS) dataset to estimate the portfolio component of the same statistic: it increased from 43% of world GDP
in 2001 to more than 76% in 2015.

     For data on the increase of gross assets and liabilities and valuation e¤ects see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti
(2007), Tille (2008), Gourinchas and Rey (2007) and Fratzscher, Juvenal, and Sarno (2007a). For a special
focus on exchange rate valuations and currency composition of external assets see Lane and Shambaugh (2010),
Della Corte, Sarno, and Sestieri (2012), Bénétrix, Lane, and Shambaugh (2015), Burger, Warnock, and Warnock
(2017) and Maggiori, Neiman, and Schreger (2017).

in a two-country model with two distinct stock markets and a local riskless bond in fully price
elastic supply. The exchange rate is determined by the ‡ow dynamics of equity rebalancing
between the two stock markets, assuming a risk averse FX liquidity supplier similar to Gabaix
and Maggiori (2015). Di¤erential returns across the two stock markets motivate the rebalancing
behavior of the international investors in both countries and simultaneously drive the exchange
rate and asset price dynamics in an incomplete market setting. Unlike Gabaix and Maggiori
(2015), where demand for foreign exchange is driven by goods trade, in our model demand is
driven by asset trade and optimal porftolio choice. A key prediction of the model is that excess
returns on the foreign equity market proportion of the investor portfolio should be partially
repatriated to maintain an optimal trade-o¤ between international asset diversi…cation and
exchange rate exposure. We also predict that this trade-o¤ is in‡uenced by the level of global
exchange rate volatility as well as fund-level variables, such as the degree of fund diversi…cation
and its rebalancing costs, proxied by fund size and asset liquidity.
      The main contribution of our paper is empirical. The disaggregate fund-level data track
quarterly fund holdings for 8,585 internationally invested equity funds for the period 1999–
2015. The data comprise a total of 109,487 fund-quarters and 25,856,215 individual asset
positions worldwide for funds domiciled in four major currency areas: the United States (U.S.),
the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Eurozone (EZ), and Canada (CA). We can therefore observe
portfolio rebalancing behavior in a large cross-section panel with di¤erent investor locations
and investment destinations. Our data show a high degree of heterogeneity in the portfolio
composition of institutional investors, including signi…cant di¤erences in the degrees of home
bias.3
      Importantly, we …nd strong evidence for portfolio rebalancing strategies at the fund-level
aimed at mitigating the risk exposure changes due to asset price and exchange rate changes.
The key insights are summarized as follows:

         At the fund-level, we study the dynamics of the foreign value share of the portfolio. Fund
         managers adjust their foreign portfolio share to mitigate the valuation e¤ects of asset price
         changes. A higher equity return on the foreign portfolio share compared to the domestic
         share triggers capital repatriation, while the underperformance of foreign assets coincides
         with capital expatriation.
  3
      For a detailed study of home bias at the fund level, see Hau and Rey (2008).

                                                        2
         A high level of global FX volatility reinforces the rebalancing behavior of international
         equity funds. Any excess return on the foreign equity component of the portfolio triggers
         a larger rebalancing toward domestic assets compared to a period of low FX volatility.

         Quantile regressions reveal that the strength of the rebalancing dynamics is non-linear in
         the return di¤erence between a fund’s foreign and domestic equity investments.

         Stronger fund-level rebalancing is associated with more concentrated asset investment
         in fewer stocks, as measured by the Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). Also, smaller
         funds exhibit stronger rebalancing, which is consistent with transaction costs to dynamic
         portfolio adjustments increasing in fund size.

         Aggregating the foreign equity investments of domestic funds and the domestic equity
         investments of foreign funds for each currency area, we show that a reduction in foreign
         equity investments by domestic funds (domestic investment by foreign funds) correlates
         with a subsequent domestic currency appreciation (depreciation).

       The determinants of home bias and static portfolio allocations have been extensively studied
in the literature (see e.g. the surveys of Lewis, 1999 and Coeurdacier and Rey, 2012). Much
less attention has been given to the international portfolio dynamics and their determinants.
While portfolio balance models were originally developed in the early 1980s (see Kouri, 1982
and Branson and Henderson, 1985), a lack of microfoundations limited their theoretical appeal.
However, the …nancial globalization of the last two decades has resuscitated interest in portfolio
balance models (see Blanchard, Giavazzi and Sa, 2005, Hau and Rey, 2006 and Gabaix and
Maggiori, 2015) with their appealing focus on imperfect asset substitutability combined with
plausible implications for exchange rate dynamics.4 Empirical tests of the portfolio balance
models relied on macroeconomic price data and aggregate cross-border ‡ows. The corresponding
results are generally inconclusive (see Frankel, 1982a,b and Rogo¤, 1984). Bohn and Tesar (1996)
analyze return chasing and portfolio rebalancing in an ICAPM framework, while Brennan and

and Van-Wincoop (2010). Dou and Verdelhan (2015) are able to account for the volatility of international cap-
ital ‡ows and to generate a time-varying risk premium in an incomplete asset market model with disaster risk.

Cao (1997) study the e¤ect of information asymmetries between domestic and foreign investors
on correlations between international portfolio ‡ows and returns. Albuquerque, Bauer and
Schneider (2007, 2009) provide models with information asymmetries and investor heterogeneity
aimed at …tting stylized facts to aggregate correlations of ‡ows and returns. Caballero and
Simsek (2017) and Jeanne and Sandri (2017) rationalize comovements of aggregate gross in‡ows
and out‡ows via models in which risk diversi…cation, scarcity of domestic safe assets, and the
global …nancial cycle play important roles.
       Common to most empirical papers is the use of aggregate data on U.S. international transac-
tions (i.e., the U.S. TIC data) and the assumption that investors hold aggregate market indices.5
Another well-known limitation of the aggregate TIC data concerns the recording of the trans-
action location, but not the asset location or currency denomination of the asset. Purchases by
U.S. investors in the London markets are reported as U.K. asset transactions even if they con-
cern a French stock. Furthermore, correlation evidence in aggregate data is di¢ cult to interpret
because of thorny endogeneity issues.6 Our data allow us to get around some of these problems
because we observe the exact portfolio of each individual fund manager and estimate the port-
folio weight changes induced by past realized valuation changes in our sample of heterogeneous
portfolios. Common shocks or aggregate demand e¤ects and their price impact therefore pose
less of an inference problem than they do in aggregate data. The approximately 25 million
observations in our pooled sample also imply a tremendous increase in statistical power.
       A related empirical study on portfolio rebalancing based on microeconomic data was un-
dertaken by Calvet, Campbell and Sodini (2009). The authors investigate whether Swedish
households adjust their risk exposure in response to the portfolio returns they experience dur-
ing the period 1999–2002. In particular, they examine the rebalancing between the risky share
of household portfolios and riskless assets and …nd evidence of portfolio rebalancing among the
most educated and wealthiest households. Our study is di¤erent in that it focuses on institu-
tional investors, who are arguably …nancially literate and understand exchange risk exposure.7
   5
     Notable exceptions are Evans and Lyons (2012), who show a tight correlation between order ‡ow and
exchange rate, and Froot and Ramadorai (2005).
   6
     There is an obvious endogeneity problem with contemporaneous correlations because of common shocks or
price e¤ects due to demand pressure. Correlations of aggregate ‡ows with past and future returns may also be
problematic to interpret as aggregate ‡ows are persistent.
   7
     It would also be interesting to study the global portfolios of the …nal owners of the securities but unfortunately
our data do not provide the relevant information to do so.

Our empirical …ndings can also inform a burgeoning theoretical literature in macroeconomics
and …nance that aims at modeling …nancial intermediaries (see e.g. Vayanos and Wooley, 2013,
Dziuda and Mondria, 2012, Basak and Pavlova, 2013, Gabaix and Maggiori, 2015 and Bruno
and Shin, 2015).8
        In Section 2 we present a simple two-country model with partially segmented asset markets.9
Its parsimonious microeconomic structure allows us to derive two testable propositions about the
joint dynamics of equity returns, exchange rates, and asset rebalancing. In Section 3 we discuss
the microdata on fund asset holdings. The empirical part of our paper presents the rebalancing
evidence (Section 4.1), the exchange rate volatility dependence of rebalancing (Section 4.2),
and the evidence for non-linearities (Section 4.3). In Section 4.4 we discuss the role of fund
characteristics for the rebalancing behavior, followed by evidence on the feedback e¤ect of
aggregate rebalancing on the exchange rate dynamics in Section 4.5. Section 5 concludes.



2         Model
In this section we outline a model of dynamic portfolio rebalancing in which home and foreign
investors optimally adjust to the endogenously determined asset prices and exchange rate in
a home and foreign country. The exchange rate is determined in equilibrium between the net
currency demand from portfolio rebalancing motives and the price elastic currency supply of a
risk-averse global intermediary. The model follows Hau and Rey (2002, 2006).
        A key feature of the model is that the exchange rate and investors’rebalancing dynamics
are driven by the fundamental value of two dividend processes for home (h) and foreign (f )
equity. Innovations in the fundamental value of equity in each country change stock market
valuations and trigger a desire for holding changes because the home and foreign equity markets
are segmented by imperfectly traded exchange rate risk. For the home investor foreign equity is
riskier whereas the opposite is true for the foreign investor. Market incompleteness resides in the
realistic feature that exchange rate risk cannot be traded directly and separately between the
home and foreign investor. A global intermediary is the only counterparty to the net currency
    8
     Hau, Massa,and Peress (2010) and Adrian, Etula, and Shin (2014) also …nd that ‡ows and …nancial conditions
have an impact on exchange rates.
   9
     The segmentation of the two equity markets is a consequence of non-tradeable exchange rate risk (market
incompleteness) and endogenously determined by the level of exchange rate volatility.

demand of home and foreign equity investors, which can generate a high degree of exchange
rate volatility driven by the (asymmetric) rebalancing desires of home and foreign investor.
   To give the model a simple structure, we assume that both the home and foreign investor
maximize a myopic instantaneous and linear trade-o¤ between the expected asset return and its
risk. Home and foreign investors choose portfolio weights Ht = (Hth ; Htf ) and Ht = (Hth ; Htf );
respectively. The superscripts h and f denote the home and foreign equity markets and the
foreign investors are distinguished by a star ( ). Both representative investors solve the opti-

where Et denotes the expectation for the stochastic pro…t ‡ow d                                t   and its variance d   t:   For
excess returns dRt = (dRth ; dRtf )T and dRt = (dRth ; dRtf )T expressed in terms of the currency
of the home and foreign investor, respectively, we can denote the stochastic pro…t ‡ows as


                                                  d    t   = Ht dRt

                                               d       t   = Ht dRt ;


respectively. The investor risk aversion is denoted by                     and the domestic riskless rate is given
by r in each country. The myopic investor objectives assure linear asset demand functions and
abstracts from intertemporal hedging motives that arise in a more general utility formulation.
We also note that investors do not take into account their price impact on asset prices or the
exchange rate. The representative home and foreign investor can be thought of as aggregating
a unit interval of identical atomistic individual investors without any individual price impact.
   Market clearing in the equity market requires


                                          Hth + Hth                 = 1
                                                                                                                             (2)
                                          Htf + Htf                 = 1;

because we normalize the asset supply to one. An additional market clearing condition applies
to the foreign exchange market with an exchange rate Et . We can measure the equity-related




                                                             6
capital out‡ows dQt of the home country (in foreign currency terms) as


                         dQt = Et Hth Dth dt     Htf Dtf dt + Ptf dHtf    Et Pth dHth :                  (3)


The …rst two terms represent the out‡ow if all dividends are repatriated. But investors can also
increase their holdings of foreign equity assets. The net capital out‡ow due to changes in the
foreign holdings, dHtf and dHth are captured by the third and fourth terms. If we denote the
Eurozone as the home and the U.S. as the foreign country, then dQt represents the net capital
out‡ow out of the Eurozone into the U.S. in dollar terms. An increase in Et (denominated in
dollars per euro) corresponds to a dollar depreciation against the euro. Capital out‡ows are
identical to a net demand in foreign currency as all investments are assumed to occur in the
local currency.
      The net demand for currency is met by a risk-averse global arbitrageur with a price-elastic
excess supply curve with elasticity parameter : For an equilibrium exchange rate Et ; the excess
supply of foreign exchange is given by


                                             QSt =     (Et    E);                                        (4)


where E = 1 denotes the steady state exchange rate level.10 Combining equations (3) and (4)
and putting aside net dividend income N DIt = Et Hth Dth               Htf Dtf , it follows that the exchange
rate dynamics dEt is linearly related to the foreign holding changes dHtf by domestic funds and
the domestic holding changes dHth of foreign funds as


                                   dEt = N DIt dt + Ptf dHtf        Et Pth dHth :


Section 4.5 of the paper explores this aggregate relationship empirically.
      Before we can solve this simple model, two more assumptions are needed. First, we have
to specify the (exogenous) dividend dynamics. For tractability, we assume two independent
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with identical variance and mean reversion to a steady state

Second, for a linear solution to the model, we also need to linearize equation (3) as well as the
foreign excess return expressed in the home currency. The model features a unique equilib-
rium for the joint equity price, exchange rate, and portfolio holding dynamics under these two
linearization and reasonable parameter values.11


2.1     Model Solution

The linearized version of the model de…nes a system of linear stochastic di¤erential equations in
seven endogenous variables, namely the home and foreign asset prices Pth and Ptf , the exchange
rate Et ; and the home and foreign equity holdings of both investors Ht = (Hth ; Htf ) and Ht =
(Htf ; Hth ); respectively. These seven variables are functions of past and current stochastic
innovations dwth and dwtf of the dividend processes. To characterize the equilibrium, it is useful
to de…ne a few auxiliary variables. We denote the fundamental value of equity as the expected
present value of future discounted dividends given by
                                                   Z   1

and market incompleteness with respect to exchange rate risk trading imply that asset prices
generally deviate from this fundamental value. We de…ne two variables                                            t   and      t   that embody
the asset price dynamics around the fundamental value, that is

                         Z   t                                                          Z   t
                 t   =           exp[       D (t    s)]    D dws    and         t   =            exp[     z (t       s)]dws ;

where dws = dwth         dwtf and       z   > 0: The variable               t   = Dth           Dtf simply represents the di¤erence
in the dividend level between the home and foreign equity markets, whereas                                               t   aggregates past

    More precisely, the risk aversion of the investors needs to be su¢ ciently low and the currency supply by
the global intermediary su¢ ciently elastic to maintain an equilibrium where investors diversify their portfolio
internationally. Otherwise we revert to a corner solution of domestic investment only.


                                                                    8

   We are interested in an equilibrium for which both the home and foreign investors hold
positive (steady state) amounts of home and foreign equity. For such an equilibrium to exist,
we impose a lower bound on the elasticity of currency ( > ) and an upper bound on investor
risk aversion ( < ): Under these conditions, the following unique equilibrium exists:

the home and foreign asset prices converge to Pth = p0 + Fth and Ptf = p0 + Ftf ; respectively, as
p ! 0; and p ! 0: The limit case features perfect global risk sharing with both the home and
the foreign investor holding half of the equity risk in each market, thus H ! 0:5 and k ! 0;

2.2    Model Implications

The model solution in Proposition 1 implies a unique covariance structure for the joint dynamics
of international equity holdings and equity returns. In this section we highlight the empirical
implications and outline the empirical strategy for testing the model predictions.

      Corollary 1 (Rebalancing and Equity Return Di¤erences):

      The domestic investor rebalances her foreign investment portfolio towards home
      country equity if the return on her foreign equity holdings exceeds the return on her
      home equity investments. Formally, the foreign equity holding change dHtf and the
      excess return of the foreign equity over home equity drtf                       drth = (dRtf        dRth )=P
      feature a negative covariance given by

                                            1     1
            Cov(dHtf , drtf    drth ) =             fD   D   + 2p       D   + 2p    (e       D   + e ) dt < 0;
                                            P     P

      and for the domestic stock investment of the foreign investor we have dHth =                           dHtf .

   Proof: See Appendix A.
   Figure 1, Panel A, plots the covariance Cov(dHtf , drtf                         drth )=dt for varying FX supply
elasticities log( ) 2 [10; 2000] and dividend volatility parameters                      D   2 [0:1; 0:5], where we set
D = 1 and     D   = 0:01: A lower supply elasticity or an increase in stock market volatility imply
that the covariance becomes more negative as rebalancing and its impact on exchange rates
intensi…es. The instantaneous FX volatility given by
                                                r

                                                        dt

also increases in   D   and decreases for larger         as shown in Figure 1, Panel B. In particular, low
values of    can generate a high degree of exchange rate volatility generally observed in the FX
market.
   So far we have treated the           D   and       as constant exogenous parameters. Yet these two
parameters are likely to change over time and it is interesting to explore the implications of this.
For the validity of any comparative statistics, we need to assume that investors do not form
forward-looking expectations of the parameters                D   and       but react to their changes in a myopic

                                                         10
manner. While the parameter             itself is not directly observable, its changes are monotonically
related to corresponding changes in FX volatility. As volatility changes in …nancial markets tend
to have a low degree of forecastability, the assumption of parameter myopia could be a reasonable
approximation of investor behavior. Corollary 2 characterizes the rebalancing behavior under
time-changing FX volatility.

     Corollary 2 (Rebalancing under Parameter Change):

     The home investor rebalances her foreign investment portfolio toward the home coun-
     try more strongly under foreign excess returns drtf             drth if equity market volatility
     increases (larger    D)   and the supply elasticity of FX balances decreases (smaller );
     hence

                                        d h                          i

                                     d    h                          i
                                       Cov dHtf , drtf             h
                                                                drt > 0:
                                    d


     Proof: See Appendix A.

   According to Figure 1, Panel B, a larger            D   and smaller   both imply higher FX volatility.
Unlike , FX volatility is directly observable. A simple empirical test of Corollaries 1 and 2
consists in regressing foreign holding changes of home investors on the contemporaneous relative
performance of their respective foreign and domestic equity returns rtf                rth and their interaction
with FX volatility given by (rtf            rth )V olF X . This test can be implemented for a large cross-
section of internationally invested equity funds. Let the foreign equity holding change for fund
j in period t be denoted by        hfj;t and the corresponding excess return on the foreign equity
                                               f               h
share over the domestically invested share by rj;t            rj;t : We expect the linear regression


                         hfj;t = (rtf       rth ) + V olF X + (rtf    rth )V olF X +    j;t



to yield negative rebalancing coe¢ cients           < 0; and     < 0: In other words, rebalancing toward
home equity increases the return di¤erential between foreign and home equity rtf                    rth and this
e¤ect is reinforced by any increase in FX volatility V olF X : As higher levels of exchange rate
volatility also increase investors’equity home bias (that is H), we can also predict that                 < 0:

3        Data
For data on global equity holdings we use FactSet/LionShares.12 The data report individual
mutual fund and other institutional holdings at the stock level. For investors in the U.S., the
data are collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) based on 13-F …lings
(fund family level) and N-SAR …lings (individual fund level). Outside the U.S., the sources are
national regulatory agencies, fund associations, and fund management companies. The sample
period covers the 16 years from 1999 to 2015 and has therefore not only a large cross-sectional
coverage, but also a reasonably long time dimension to investigate portfolio dynamics.13
       The FactSet/LionShares dataset comprises fund identi…er, stock identi…er, country code of
the fund incorporation, management company name, stock position (number of stocks held),
reporting dates for which holding data are available, and security prices on the reporting date.
We complement these data with the total return index (including the reinvested dividends)
in local currency for each stock using CRPS (for U.S./Canadian stocks) and Datastream (for
non-U.S./non-Canadian stocks). Most funds report quarterly, which suggests that the analysis
is best carried out at a quarterly frequency. Reporting dates di¤er somewhat, but more than
90% of the reporting occurs in the last 30 days of each quarter.
       A limitation of the data is that they do not include any information on a fund’s cash hold-
ings, …nancial leverage, investments in …xed income instruments, or investments in derivative
contracts. All the portfolio characteristics we calculate therefore concern only the equity propor-
tion of a fund’s investment. We believe that missing cash holdings in home currency or …nancial
  12
      Ferreira and Matos (2008) examines the representativeness of the FactSet/LionShares dataset, by compar-
ing the cross-border equity holdings in it with the aggregate cross-country holdings data of the Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) of the IMF. The CPIS data have been systematically collected since 2001
and constitute the best measures of aggregate cross-country asset holdings. The values reported in FactSet are
slightly lower than those in the CPIS but still representative of foreign equity positions in the world economy.
   13
      Other papers using disaggregated data on international institutional investors holdings, albeit with a di¤erent
focus, are Chan, Covrig, and Ng (2005) who look at the determinants of static allocations at the country level
and Covrig, Fontaine, Jimenez-Garcs, and Seasholes (2007) who study the e¤ect of information asymmetries on
home bias. Broner, Gelos, and Reinhart’s (2006) interesting study focuses on country allocations of emerging
market funds and looks at channels of crisis transmission. The authors present a model with time-varying
risk aversion, which predicts in particular that overexposed investors tend to revert to the market portfolio in
crisis times. In the absence of stock level data, they assume that funds hold a portfolio well proxied by the
IFC US$ total return investable index. Froot, O’Connell, and Seasholes’(2001) high-frequency study is based
on the transaction data of one global custodian (State Street Bank &Trust). The authors look at the e¤ect of
aggregate cross-country ‡ows on MSCI country returns. Our study focuses on a di¤erent time scale (quarterly
instead of daily) and uses a whole cross-section of fund-speci…c investment decisions and stock level data. For a
high-frequency study linking exchange rates to aggregated institutional investors ‡ows using State Street Bank
& Trust data, see Froot and Ramadorai (2005).

leverage are not a major concern for our analysis, since (postive or negative) leverage simply
implies a scaling of the absolute risk by a leverage factor. All our analysis is based on portfolio
shares and therefore not a¤ected by constant leverage or time variations in leverage, as long as
these are independent of the excess return on foreign assets.14 A more serious concern is that
funds may carry out additional hedging operations that escape our inference. In spite of this
data shortcoming, we believe that the analysis is still informative. As documented in previous
surveys (Levich, Hayt, and Ripston, 1999), most mutual funds do not engage in any derivative
trading because of high transaction costs and their equity position may therefore represent an
accurate representation of their risk-taking. We also note that any additional hedging is likely
to attenuate rebalancing and therefore bias the predicted negative correlation towards zero.
       To keep the data processing manageable, we focus our analysis on funds domiciled in four
geographic regions, namely the United States (U.S.), the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Eurozone
(EZ) and Canada (CA).15 These fund locations represent 91% of all quarterly fund reports in
our data and constitute 94% of all reported positions by value. Funds in the Eurozone are
pooled because of their common currency after 1999. To reduce data outliers and limit the role
of reporting errors, a number of data …lters are employed:

         We retain holding data only from the last reporting date of a fund in each quarter. A fund
         has to feature in two consecutive quarters to be retained. Consecutive reporting dates are
         a pre-requisite for the dynamic inference in this paper. Our sample starts at the …rst
         quarter of 1999.

         Funds are retained if their total asset holding exceeds $10 million. Smaller funds might
         represent incubator funds and other non-representative entities.

         We retain only international funds that hold at least …ve stocks in the domestic currency
         and at least …ve stocks in another currency area. This excludes all funds with fewer than
         10 stock positions and also funds with only domestic or only international positions. Our
         focus on international rebalancing between foreign and domestic stocks renders funds with
  14
     This argument is only valid for home currency cash and cannot be maintained if cash is held in foreign
currency. In the latter case the exchange rate risk alters the risk features of the portfolio.
  15
     The Eurozone countries included in the sample are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.

         a narrow foreign or domestic investment mandate less interesting.16

         Non-diversi…ed funds with extreme investment biases in very few stocks are also ignored.
         We consider a fund diversi…ed if fund weights produce a Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index below
         20%.

         We discard funds if their return on combined equity holdings exceed 200% or if they
         lose more than 50% of their equity holdings value over a half-year. Individual stock
         observations are ignored if they feature extreme quarterly returns that exceed 500% or
         are below -80%.17

       In Table 1, Panel A, we report summary statistics on fund holdings at the fund-quarter level
for the sample period 1999–2015. An international fund has on average $955 million on total
equity assets, out of which $638 million are invested in home equity and $317 million in foreign
equity. The data on internationally invested funds show a modest home bias, as the average
domestic share of a fund portfolio is 53.2%. While the average quarterly rebalancing between
foreign and domestic equity investments is small at 0.071%, its standard deviation is substantial
at 4.5% of the total (equity) value of the portfolio.
       The number of international funds in the sample increases steadily over time from only 167
funds reporting at the end of 1999 to 5,683 funds reporting at the end of 2015. While the
European fund sample comprises a larger number of fund periods and stock positions than the
U.S. fund sample, the latter amounts to a larger aggregate value throughout the sample period.
For example, at the end of 2006, we count 889 (international) equity funds domiciled in the
U.S. with a total of 156,086 stock positions valued at $1,690 billion. For the same quarter, the
European equity fund sample comprises 2,744 funds with a total of 293,718 stock positions and
an aggregate value of $732 billion.
       Table 1, Panel B presents the aggregate statistics at the quarterly level. The variables
here are the (e¤ective) exchange rate change of currency area c relative to other investment
destinations, the aggregate rebalancing from foreign to home investments for all funds domiciled
                          f
within currency area c ( Hc;t ), and the reciprocal aggregate rebalancing out of the home country
                                              h
for funds domiciled outside curency area c ( Hc;t ).
  16
     We are also unable to capture any "household rebalancing", which might consist of rebalancing out of foreign
country funds into purely domestic equity funds.
  17
     We discard very few observations this way. Extreme return values may be attributable to data errors.

4     Empirical Analysis
The model in Section 2 illustrates that imperfect exchange rate risk trading can generate ex-
change rate volatility that segments the foreign and domestic equity markets. The foreign
investments component is exposed to additional exchange rate risk and generates a rebalancing
motive whenever its value grows relative to the domestic equity share in the investment portfolio.
Such di¤erential exposure to exchange rate risk implies that equity investments are repatriated
to the home country whenever the foreign equity market outperforms the domestic market.
Such rebalancing behavior re‡ects the investor’s desire to partly o¤-set exogenous changes in
exchange rate risk exposure. These investment by fund ‡ows in turn create a feedback e¤ect on
exchange rate volatility. The repatriated equity investments tend to lead to appreciation of the
domestic currency. In this section we …rst explore the validity of the rebalancing hypothesis with
respect to di¤erential equity market performance. This analysis is undertaken at the fund level
and represents the most important contribution of the paper. In the last part of this section,
we also examine the link between aggregate fund ‡ows and exchange rate dynamics. Here we
aggregate fund ‡ows to verify the portfolio ‡ow e¤ect on the exchange rate.

measures active portfolio management                       hfj;t for the respective fund. Fund rebalancing at the
quarterly frequency has a standard deviation of 4.5% for the full sample of 109,487 fund periods
as stated in Table 1. It is highest for Eurozone funds at 5.0% and lowest for the U.K. and U.S.
funds at 3.9% and 3.8%, respectively. We also highlight a larger average foreign investment
share for U.K. funds and the stronger home bias for U.S. funds. By contrast, the Eurozone fund
sample is more uniformly distributed in terms of its foreign investment share.

For stocks outside the currency area of the fund domicile, the return rs;t comprises an exchange
rate component. Analogous to the model, we can de…ne a foreign asset return strictly in local
currency terms where rs;t denotes the local return in the currency of the stock domicile. The
corresponding foreign return component of the portfolio (net of any exchange rate e¤ect) then
follows as
                                                      Nj
                                          f

                                         rj;t   =            f
                                                                    rs;t           1s=f :
                                                       s=1 w j;t 1

In Section 4.1 we explore how the return di¤erence between this foreign equity return component
                                                                          f

in‡uences rebalancing. Expressing the return di¤erence in terms of the respective local currency
implies that exchange rate e¤ects do not interfere with our inference on rebalancing.

4.1       Baseline Results on Rebalancing

As a test of the rebalancing hypothesis, we regress the portfolio rebalancing measure on the
excess return of the foreign part of the portfolio over the home part of the portfolio, that is

                                         X
                              hfj;t =                 f
                                                  l (rj;t l   rh j;t l ) +    c;t   + "j +           j;t ;
                                        l=0;1;2


where      l   < 0 with l = 0 captures instantaneous rebalancing and                         l   < 0 with l = 1; 2 captures
delayed portfolio reallocations with a time lag of l quarters. The speci…cation includes interacted
investor country and time …xed e¤ects                c;t   to capture common (macro-economic) reallocations
between home and foreign equity pertaining to all funds domiciled in the same country. To allow
for a time trend in the foreign portfolio allocation of funds we also include fund …xed e¤ects
"j in most speci…cations. We note that a passive buy and hold strategy of an index produces
     hfj;t = 0 and should imply a zero coe¢ cient. Passive index investment will bias the coe¢ cients
 l   toward zero.
      Table 2 reports the baseline results on the rebalancing behavior of international equity funds.
                                                            f
Column (1) includes only the contemporaneous excess return rj;t                                      rh j;t and does not include
any …xed e¤ects. The 109,487 fund-quarters yield the predicted negative coe¢ cient at                                         2:357;
which is statistically highly signi…cant. As some of the rebalancing is likely to occur only
with a time lag, we include in Column (2) the lagged excess returns on foreign equity. The
inclusion of lagged excess returns also presents a useful control of reverse causality. If a fund
increases (decreases) its positions in illiquid foreign stocks, this may increase (decrease) their
                                                                   f
stock price, generate a positive (negative) foreign excess return rj;t                                       rh j;t and thus bias the
contemporaneous coe¢ cient towards a positive value                     0    > 0: The same logic does not apply to
lagged foreign excess returns. Column (2) also includes interacted time and investor country
…xed e¤ects which should control for all macroeconomic e¤ects such as common equity fund
in‡ows in the investor domicile. The contemporaneous coe¢ cient                                  0    and the lagged coe¢ cient
 1   are both negative at high levels of statistical signi…cance. Adding fund …xed e¤ects in Column
(3) can absorb any positive or negative growth trend in a fund’s foreign equity position, but
their inclusion does not qualitatively a¤ect the rebalancing evidence. Column (4) shows that
                                                         f
even the second quarterly lag of foreign excess returns rj;t                         2   rh j;t          2   has some explanatory



                                                              17
power for fund rebalancing, althought the economic magnitude is much weaker at                                                     0:743:
       Adding the three coe¢ cients in Column (4) implies a combined rebalancing e¤ect of                                                   4:879.
A relative quarterly excess return of two standard deviations (or 0:138) therefore implies a
reduction in the foreign equity weight by 0:673 percentage points for the representative (foreign-
invested) institutional investor.18 In light of the large size of foreign equity positions valued at
$1.84 trillion globally in December 2014, this amounts to economically signi…cant equity ‡ow of
$12.4 billion per quarter.
       We also explore asymmetries in the rebalancing behavior of international investors by split-
ting the sample into negative and positive excess returns. Formally, we have

                      X                                                  X
            hfj;t =           + f
                              l (rj;t l     rh j;t l )     1   r 0   +           l

                                                                                     (rj;t   l

                                                                                                 rj;t l)   1   r<0   +   c;t   +    j;t ;
                      l=0;1                                              l=0;1


where 1       r 0   represents a dummy that is equal to 1 whenever the foreign excess return                                                  r=
 f
rj;t     rh j;t     0 and 0 otherwise. The complementary dummy marking negative foreign excess
returns is given by 1            r<0 :    The regression coe¢ cients for the positive and negative components
of the excess return reported in Column (5) show similar overall rebalancing for positive and
negative excess returns when the coe¢ cients for the contemporaneous and lagged rebalancing
behavior are summed up. We conclude that rebalancing occurs symmetrically for both positive
and negative foreign excess returns. We also split the excess return into a separate foreign and
                                       f                                      h
home market return components, namely rj;t                           l   and rj;t l : Again no evidence for an asymmetric

rebalancing is found in these unreported regression results. Finally, we split the sample into
a pre-crisis period up to June 2008 (Period I) and a post-crisis period (Period II) thereafter.
Columns (6) and (7) show the respective regression results and indicate that the rebalancing
behavior is relatively stable across the two subsamples. Excluding the …nancial crisis period
(Period II) does not change the evidence on fund rebalancing behavior.


4.2        Rebalancing and FX Volatility

Higher FX volatility increases segmentation between the domestic and foreign equity markets.
This reinforces portfolio rebalancing under incomplete FX risk trading in accordance with Corol-
  18
       We note that the dependent variable               hfj;t is scaled by a factor of 100:



                                                                     18
lary 2. To obtain measures of exchange rate volatility at a quarterly frequency, we …rst calculate
the e¤ective daily exchange rate Ec;d for currency area c on trading day d as the weighted average
of its N bilateral exchange rates Ec;i;d with each investment destination i: Formally,

                                                              X

where the weights !c;i are chosen to be the average foreign portfolio shares of all domestic funds
in currency area c: The (realized) exchange rate volatility V OLFc;tX for quarter t is de…ned as
                                      FX
the standard deviation of the return rc;d = ln Ec;d                          ln Ec;d    1   measured for all trading days d
of quarter t: Figure 3 shows the realized e¤ective exchange rate volatility of the four fund loca-
tions for the period January 1999–December 2015. The exchange rate volatility across the four
currency areas features a cross-sectional correlation of 0.71. Exchange rate volatility is also dis-
tinct from stock market uncertainty. For comparison, we plot here the average quarterly Cboe’s
Volatility Index VIX. The correlation between the VIX index of equity market uncertainty and
the exchange rate volatility is 0.62.
     To test for the FX volatility sensitivity of exchange rate rebalancing, we interact the excess

only the contemporaneous component of excess returns (lag l = 0) and its interaction with

FX volatility dynamics.
      We …nd that the rebalancing behavior is stronger under higher levels of exchange rate volatil-
ity    0   < 0 as predicted in Corollary 2. Higher FX volatility can increase the riskness of the
foreign equity share in the fund portfolio and thus strengthen the rebalancing motive. The
                                                f
interaction term between lagged excess returns rj;t       1   rh j;t   1   and the exchange rate volatil-
ity V OLFc;tX 1 in Column (2) is statistically insigni…cant. We also note that higher exchange
rate volatility is ceteris paribus related to increases in the foreign fund position, as indicated
by the positive coe¢ cient , though the estimates are statistically insigni…cant or only weakly
signi…cant.
      Columns (3)–(4) of Table 3 replace the measure of quarterly FX volatility with the average
quarterly Cboe’s Volatility Index VIX. Higher expected market volatility captured by the VIX
does not appear to be related to stronger rebalancing behavior, unlike FX volatility. In particu-
                                                 f
lar, the interaction term of the excess returns rj;t    rh j;t and the V IXt       1   in the previous quarter
(t     1) does not bear any statistically signi…cant relationship to the rebalancing of foreign eq-
uity holdings       hfj;t . This suggests that exchange rate volatility is the more relevant driver of
international equity market segmentation compared to investor uncertainty about stock market
valuations.


4.3        Rebalancing by Quantiles

The linear regression model captures an average e¤ect for the rebalancing channel. Yet the
propensity to rebalance could be highly heterogeneous across funds characteristics. The elastic-
ity of fund ‡ows to di¤erentials in returns could be di¤erent, for example, for large and small
rebalancing ‡ows, which could in turn re‡ect more active or passive strategies. We allow for a
non-linear relationship between foreign excess returns and the intensity of rebalancing by using
quantile regressions. The slope coe¢ cient of the quantile regression represents the incremen-
tal change in rebalancing for a one-unit change in returns di¤erential at the quantile of the
rebalancing variable.
      For the baseline regression in Table 2, Column (2) we undertake 10 di¤erent quantile re-
gressions at the (interior) quantiles       = 0:05; 0:15; 0:25; :::; 0:85; 0:95 of the distribution of
holding changes. Figure 4 plots the quantile coe¢ cients       0   and     1   at lags 0 and 1; respectively.


                                                   20
The gray shaded area shows a 95% con…dence interval around the point estimate. Both the
contemporaneous and delayed rebalancing reactions show an inverted U-shaped pattern where
the edges of the distribution show more negative and therefore stronger rebalancing behavior.
   We therefore …nd that the propensity to rebalance as a function of return di¤erentials is
weakest at moderate levels of portfolio rebalancing. A higher propensity to rebalance (a more
negative coe¢ cient) is associated …rst and foremost with the highest levels of rebalancing in
absolute value (low quantiles    = 0:05; 0:15 of the rebalancing variable, which correspond to
large capital repatriation, and highest quantiles    = 0:85; 0:95 of the rebalancing variable, which
correspond to large capital expatriation). This means that particularly large changes        hfj;t at
the edge of the rebalancing distribution are well explained by di¤erential equity returns between
the foreign and home share of the fund portfolio and that rebalancing intensity is particularly
strong when associated with capital repatriation following an increase in foreign returns over
domestic returns. With one lag the strong association of large rebalancing behavior with a
large response to returns di¤erential remains for the low quantiles ( = 0:05; 0:15) but the
relationship for the higher quantiles becomes somewhat ‡atter. On the other hand, moderate
rebalancing ‡ows are not as responsive to changes in returns. For comparison, we add as blue
horizontal lines the OLS estimate (dashed line) and its 95% con…dence interval (dotted line).
The OLS estimates capture the average rebalancing e¤ect, which is much more intense at the
edges of distribution of holding changes.


4.4    Fund Heterogeneity and Rebalancing

The heterogeneous rebalancing responses of funds reported in Section 4.3 raise the question
whether they are due to fund heterogeneity? Could the stronger rebalancing behavior shown
in the tails of the   hfj;t distribution be explained by di¤erences in the fund characteristics?
The three dimensions of fund heterogeneity we examine more closely are (i) fund size measured
                                                                        f
as log assets under management, (ii) a fund’s foreign investment share wj;t , and (iii) the fund
investment concentration as measured by the Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of all fund
position weights ws;j;t . Fund size may represent an obstacle to frequent rebalancing if average
transaction costs increase with the size of the position change. Large funds are also likely to
be more diversi…ed so that large di¤erences between foreign and domestic equity returns occur


                                                21
less frequently. Greater fund diversi…cation is likely to attenuate the need for rebalancing. We
therefore expect funds with more concentrated holdings to feature stronger rebalancing behavior.
   We calculate the average and median values of these three fund characteristics for all ob-
servations in the direct vicinity of the regression line for 10 quantiles        = 0:05; 0:15; 0:25; :::;
0:85; 0:95: Formally, we associate with quantile              all observations for which the regression
residual switches signs from a negative value         hfj;t     xj;t (    :05) < 0 to a positive value
 hfj;t   xj;t ( + :05)     0 by moving from a quantile regression at quantile          0:05 to the same
regression undertaken at quantile      + 0:05. The regressors xj;t are the same as in the quantile
regression in Section 4.3 and include the excess return at lags l = 0; 1 and interacted country
and time …xed e¤ects.
   Figure 5, Panels A and B characterize the average and median fund size along the various
quantile regression lines, respectively. The average (median) fund size is less than one-third
(one-half) at the edge of the distribution for the rebalancing statistics        hfj;t than at its center.
The strongest propensity to rebalance in reaction to return di¤erentials is therefore observed for
smaller funds. This is true for large rebalancing ‡ows whether for the repatriation of capital (the
lowest quantile of the rebalancing variable) or the expatriation of capital ‡ows (largest quantile
of the rebalancing variable). The smaller price impact makes portfolio adjustment less costly
for these smaller institutional investors, which seems to make them more sensitive to return
di¤erentials. The foreign portfolio share plotted in Panels C and D does not suggest any strong
heterogeneity in the intensity of rebalancing behavior across funds with di¤erent home biases.
Only a slightly larger foreign investment share is associated with larger rebalancing propensities
at low quantiles (large repatriation ‡ows). By contrast, the intensity of rebalancing is strongly
related to the Her…ndahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of a fund’s investment concentration. Its
median value in Panel F is almost twice as large at the edges of the rebalancing distribution
in which the portfolio adjustment to excess returns is most pronounced. Unlike index tracking
funds, concentrated equity funds contribute strongly to the rebalancing evidence. This is not
suprising as these funds are also more likely to feature diverging performance on their domestic
and foreign equity portfolios. Funds with concentrated equity positions feature stronger rebal-
ancing behavior. The more diversi…ed and largest funds tend in contrast to be associated with
moderate rebalancing levels and low rebalancing propensities. They are more likely to follow
more passive strategies.

4.5    Exchange Rate E¤ects of Fund Flows

A key element of the equilibrium model developed in Section 2 is that a country’s exchange
rate dynamics are in turn in‡uenced by portfolio rebalancing. While foreign productivity gains
relative to the home country should depreciate the home currency in a real business cycle model,
the associated higher foreign equity returns can reinforce rebalancing toward the home country,
with the opposite e¤ect on the exchange rate. To what extent the portfolio ‡ow e¤ect dominates
is largely an empirical matter.
   To explore the aggregate e¤ect of equity fund ‡ows on exchange rate dynamics, we de…ne
as Dc the set of all home funds domiciled in currency area c (= U.S., U.K., EZ, CA); and as Ic
the set of all foreign funds invested in currency area c: Let the market value of all foreign equity
positions of fund j 2 Dc at the end of quarter t                      1 be denoted by afj;t               1   and the value of all
home equity positions in currency area c by a foreign fund j 0 2 Ic be given by ahj 0 ;t 1 : We can
then de…ne the aggregate rebalancing of all domestic and foreign funds with respect to currency
area c as

                    f          1     X                                                            X
                   Hc;t =                    hfj;t        afj;t   1   with       Afc;t   1   =            afj;t       1

                               1     X                                                           X

                   Hc;t =                    hcj;t       acj;t    1   with       Ahc;t   1   =          ahj;t 1 ;
                            Ahc;t   1 j2Ic                                                       j2Ic



respectively, where   hfj;t denotes the fund-level rebalancing of home funds towards home equity
and   hcj;t the rebalancing of foreign funds from currency area c towards other currency areas.
In the aggregation of the holding changes of individual funds, we ignore large rebalancing events
with holding changes larger than 3% of fund assets. This …lter should eliminate extremely large
fund ‡ows that might be less likely to originate in the rebalancing motive captured by our model.
In total, we exclude from the aggregation approximately 10% of all fund-level rebalancing events.
   The e¤ect of aggregate portfolio rebalancing on the quarterly e¤ective exchange rate change
  Ec;t can evaluated by the linear regression

                                     f                             h

where we pool observations across the four currency areas U.S, U.K, Eurozone and Canada.


                                                                 23
Each currency area is in turn considered the home country with the three other currency areas
representing the foreign country. The e¤ective exchange rate is calculated based on …xed weights
represented by the average size of their respective equity markets. In line with the model
assumption in Eqs. (3) and (4), we predict                     1   > 0 and       2   < 0; and for a symmetric ‡ow impact
we expect to …nd (1= )1 =                  (1= )2 : The aggregate holding changes are lagged by one quarter to
eliminate the reverse causality whereby international stock market investment ‡ows appreciate
the local currency and simultaneously in‡ate equity prices.
     Table 4 reports the regresssion results. Column (1) includes only the aggregate foreign

holding change           Hc;t    1   of funds incorporated in the home country and Column (2) only the

                           f
holding decrease          Hc;t       1   < 0 (or investment repatriation) does indeed predict an appreciation
of the domestic currency [Column (1)] and vice versa— a decrease in foreign fund investment at
            h
home       Hc;t   1   < 0 predicts depreciation of the domestic currency [Column (2)]. The rebalancing
                                                                                                    f                h
model in Section 2 predicts a perfect negative correlation between                                 Hc;t   1   and   Hc;t 1 ; but the

empirical correlation is only 0:30. Yet, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coe¢ cients
 1   and   2   are equally large (in absolute terms) and of opposite sign. Concerns about collinearity
                                                    f
suggest that we create the linear combination 12 ( Hc;t                      1
                                                                                        h
                                                                                       Hc;t 1 ) as an alternative regressor;

the corresponding regression results are reported in Column (4). The combined e¤ect captured
                                f
by the linear combination 12 ( Hc;t               1

                                                           Hc;t 1 ) produces a coe¢ cient of 0:03. A decrease in net

foreign holdings by two standard deviations (= 0:44) therefore appreciates the domestic currency
by approximately 1:3% in the following quarter. The overall explantory power of the fund ‡ow
channel for exchange rate movements is very modest, as illustrated by the low regesssion R2 :
     Notwithstanding our …ltering procedure for aggregate ‡ows and the lagged measurement of
holding changes, it seems plausible that portfolio ‡ows re‡ect many other macroeconomic factors
uncorrelated with the rebalancing motive induced by di¤erential return performance of home and
foreign equity. As measurement errors for the relevant holding changes, they may attenuate the
predicted positive correlation with the exchange rate change. Hence we apply an instrumental
variable approach where we (i) predict in a …rst-stage regression the fund speci…c rebalancing
according to the regression in Table 2, Column (2), and (ii) aggregate fund-level predicted
rebalancing to the aggregate predicted rebalancing terms                               b c;t

4.6       Alternative Interpretations

Our empirical results provide strong support in favor of portfolio rebalancing. Can the observed
rebalancing result from a simple behavioral hypothesis? One such behavioral hypothesis con-
cerns “pro…t-taking” on appreciating stocks. Fund managers might sell stocks once a certain
target price is reached. The evidence presented here re‡ects the decisions of investment pro-
fessionals who should be less prone to behavioral biases compared to households. But we can
identify two additional aspects of the data that cannot be easily reconciled with a “pro…t-taking
motive” as an explanatory alternative. First, this behavioral hypothesis does not explain why
funds buy foreign equity shares when these assets underperform domestic holdings, as docu-
mented in Section 4.1. Second, the “pro…t-taking motive”evaluates each stock in isolation from
the other portfolio assets, unlike our risk-based paradigm, which looks at the portfolio of all
foreign equity holdings. Third, we also show that higher exchange rate risk interacts with the
rebalancing motive, while it is unclear why it should matter for a “pro…t-taking motive”.
      A second alternative interpretation concerns exogenous investment policies and mandates
 19
      See Jiang (2017) for an insightful discussion of the issue.

for the funds. Could the observed rebalancing behavior result from investment policies that
commit a fund to a certain range of foreign stock ownership? French and Poterba (1991) note
that fund mandates are an unlikely explanation for the home bias in equity. This does not
preclude their greater importance for the rebalancing dynamics documented in this paper. To
the extent that such mandates exist, we can interpret them as re‡ecting the risk management
objectives of the ultimate fund investors. As such they can be interpreted as direct evidence
for limited asset substitutability and support, rather than contradict, the main message of
our study. But rationalizing such mandates in the context of agency problems is beyond the
scope of this paper. Distinguishing between mandated rebalancing and autonomous fund-based
rebalancing presents an interesting issue for future research. To make progress on these issues
we doubtless need a better theoretical understanding of delegated investment strategies and one
that is compatible with the stylized facts that we uncover in this paper: large heterogeneity
of portfolios as measured by domestic and foreign weights— which implies large heterogeneity
of portfolios in their exposure to exchange rate risk. Modeling …nancial intermediaries more
realistically is an important agenda for future research.20



5        Conclusion
This paper documents a pervasive feature of the international equity portfolios of institutional
investors, namely that they repatriate capital after making an excess return on their foreign
portfolio share relative to their domestic equity investment. Some of this rebalancing occurs
over the period of three quarters and is therefore unlikely to be driven by reverse causality.
We interpret such rebalancing behavior as a consequence of investor risk aversion in an equity
market partially segmented by exchange rate risk and present a simple model accounting for
such rebalancing behavior: limited international tradability of exchange rate risk implies that
foreign equity investments are more risky than home country equity investments. International
investors reduce their foreign equity share if excess returns in the foreign market increase their
FX exposure.
       We document a rich set of (new) empirical facts that support this interpretation. First, higher
  20
   Important progress has been made in that direction: see, for example, Bruno and Shin (2015), Gabaix and
Maggiori (2015), and others.

exchange rate risk (measured by realized FX volatility) reinforces the rebalancing channel. By
contrast, variations in stock market uncertainty do not account for intertemporal variations in
the strength of the rebalancing channel. Second, the largest correlation between rebalancing
and foreign excess returns is found at the tails of the rebalancing distribution, suggesting a
non-linear relationship. In particular, large rebalancing ‡ows are associated with much stronger
rebalancing elasticity to return di¤erentials. Third, we …nd that smaller funds and funds with a
higher concentration of their investments in fewer stocks have the largest rebalancing propensity
in reaction to return di¤erentials. By contrast, rebalancing is observed equally across funds
with very heterogeneous foreign investment shares. Last, we show that the aggregate fund ‡ows
induced by the documented rebalancing behavior move exchange rates in line with the model
prediction, even though the explanatory power of this link is economically weak.
   We speculate that our evidence potentially casts some light on two di¤erent types of in-
ternational …nancial links. The …rst is an international …nancial adjustment mechanism (see
Gourinchas and Rey, 2007). If persistent trade surpluses induce increasing foreign asset holdings,
then the corresponding increase in the foreign portfolio share for domestic investors may ulti-
mately depreciate the foreign currency and provide a mechanism for an adjustment of the trade
balance. By contrast, the second is an international ampli…cation mechanism. The valuation
e¤ects of a foreign asset market boom will tend to depreciate the foreign currency and reinforce
the dynamics of a boom and bust cycle. Much remains to be done to better comprehend the
complexity of international links across …nancial assets.

    Corollary 2:
    Because of the endogeneity of the terms P ; p ; p ; e ;and e in Eq. (A16) it is di¢ cult
to show in closed form that the derivative of Cov(dHtf ; drtf      drth ) is negative with respect to
d   D   and positive with respect to d . But the numerical solution plotted in Figure 1B provides
a simple illustration that this is generally the case.

Appendix B: Data Issues
       FactSet/LionShares provides three di¤erent data …les: (i) the "Holding Master File," (ii) the
"Fund File," and (iii) the "Entity (Institution) File.". The …rst …le provides the fund positions on
a quarterly frequency, while the other two give information on fund and institutional investor
characteristics. For our analysis we only use the "Holding Master File," which reports the
FactSet fund identi…er, the CUSIP stock identi…er, the number of stock positions, the reporting
date, the country domicile of the fund, the stock price on the reporting date, and the number
of shares outstanding at the reporting date. We complement the FactSet/LionShares data with
data from Datastream, which provides the total stock return index (assuming dividends are
reinvested and correcting for stock splits) for each stock, the country of stock domicile/listing,
the currency of the stock listing, and the exchange rate.
       In a …rst step, we match holding data for each fund with holding data in the same fund in the
two previous quarters. Holding data for which no holding date is reported in the previous quarter
are discarded. Additional holding data from quarter t            2 are matched whenever available. For
each fund we retain only the latest reporting date within a quarter. The stock price, total return
index, and exchange rate data are matched for the same reporting date as stated in the holding
data.
       Similar to Calvet et al. (2009), we use a sequence of data …lters to eliminate the role of
reporting errors in the data. We focus on the four largest fund domiciles, namely the U.S., the
U.K., the Eurozone, and Canada.21 All small funds with a capitalization of less than $10 million
are deleted. These small funds might represent incubator funds or other non-representative
entities. Funds with a growth in total assets over the quarter of more than 200% or less than
  50% are also discarded. Finally we treat as missing those stock observations for which the
return exceeds 500% or is below          80% over the quarter. Missing observations do not enter
into the calculation of the stock weights or the foreign excess returns. We use …lters discarding
potential reporting errors and typos such as (i) positions with negative holdings, (ii) positions
with missing or negative prices, (iii) positions larger than $30 billion, and (iv) positions for
which the combined stock capitalization (in this dataset) exceeds $300 billion. Two additional
selection criteria guarantee a minimal degree of fund diversi…cation. First, we ignore funds with
  21
    As previously stated, we de…ne the Eurozone as the original 11 members in 1999: Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

fewer than …ve foreign and …ve domestic stocks in their portfolio. Pure country funds or pure
domestic funds are therefore excluded from the sample. Second, all funds with a Her…ndahl-
Hirschman Index over all stock weights above 20% are discarded. This fund concentration
                                                p
threshold is surpassed if a fund holds more than 0:2 0:447% in a single stock. Funds with
such extreme stock weights are unlikely to exhibit much consideration for risk diversi…cation.
The latter criterion eliminates approximately 0.1% of fund-quarters from the sample.

without fixed eﬀects, Columns (2)—(7) add interacted time and country fixed eﬀects and Column (3) adds additional fund fixed eﬀects.
Column (5) splits the execess return on the foreign portfolio share into a positive and negative realizations to test for symmetry of the
rebalancing behavior. In Columns (6)—(7) we report the baseline regression of Column (3) for the subsample until June 2008 (Period

The eﬀective (log) exchange rate change in quarter  of the four currency areas (U.S., U.K., EZ, CA) (defined in domestic curreny
terms relative to weighted average of the other three major destinations of outbound portfolio investment) is regressed in Column (1)
                                    
on the aggregate rebalancing ∆−1     of the foreign portfolio share of domestically registered funds and in Column (2) on the aggregate
                 ∗
rebalancing ∆−1 of the portfolio share of foreign registered funds invested in domestic stocks. Column (3) includes both terms and in
                                                     
Column (4) we use the linear combination 12 (∆−1             ∗
                                                         − ∆−1   ) as regressor. Columns (5)—(8) provide analagous regressions in which
the actual aggregate rebalancing terms are replaced by the aggregate predicted rebalancing terms estimated by the fund-specific excess
return −1 − −1 as in Table 2, Column (2). We report robust standard errors and use ***, **, and * to denote statistical significance
at the 1%, 5%, and 10% level, respectively.
