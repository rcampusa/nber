                                            ABSTRACT



        I propose a network/search   view of international trade in differentiated products.    I present

evidence   that supports the view that proximity     and common language/colonial          ties are more

important for differentiated products than for products traded on organized exchanges in matching

international buyers and sellers, and that search barriers to trade are higher for differentiated    than

for homogeneous    products.   I also discuss alternative explanations     for the findings.

I. Introduction

        Itis    well known that very few manufactured    (as opposed to primary) commodities       are

traded on organized exchanges.        It is also well understood that the heterogeneity of manufactures

along the dimensions of both characteristics      and quality interferes with the ability of their prices

to signal relative scarcity. I argue that this uninformativeness    of prices prevents “globally

scanning” traders from substituting for organized exchanges in matching international          buyers and

sellers of differentiated products,    Instead connections between sellers and buyers are made

through a search process that because of its costliness does not proceed until the best match is

achieved.      This search is strongly conditioned by proximity and preexisting    “ties” and results in

trading networks rather than “markets”.

        This paper will explore the consequences of this network/search       view at a macro level by

examining world trade flows. In a companion paper (Rauch 1996) I explore the consequences                of

this view at a micro level by examining trade behavior, institutions, and policies in a partial

equilibrium context.     Section fl of this paper expands the argument adumbrated in the previous

paragraph sufficiently to allow for empirical application.     Section III uses a gravity model of

international    trade to see if proximity and common language/colonial     ties are more important for

differentiated products than for products traded on organized exchanges in matching international

buyers and sellers. Section IV examines whether differentiated products tend to be less traded

than homogeneous       products, indicating that search costs are acting as barriers to trade. Section V

considers alternative explanations,    not based on the network/search    view, for the findings in the

preceding two sections.     Conclusions and suggestions for further research are presented in
                                                                                                                  2

II. Organized Exchanges,              Reference Prices, or Neither

          In the empirical work below I will divide internationally         traded commodities    into three

groups:     those traded on organized exchanges, those not traded on organized exchanges but

nevertheless possessing what I shall call “reference prices”, and all other commodities.                In this

section I will give the theoretical motivation for this tripartite division.

          Let us first consider why some commodities         are traded on organized exchanges and others

are not.    The conventional        wisdom is that there is a cost to setting up “markets” (organized

exchanges) that is independent of the volume of transactions,             and that this non-convexity    will not

allow a market to open if the expected volume of transactions at the price expected to prevail in

equilibrium      is too small.’     For the sake of concreteness,    let us attempt to apply this conventional

wisdom to two commodities             at the three-digit level of the Standard Lntemational Trade

Classification     (SITC), which is the Iemt disaggregate           level for which I will attempt to

categorize commodities            in the empirical work below.      The two commodities    are Footwear (SITC

851) and had        (SITC 685, not to be confused with Lead Ores and Concentrates,            SITC 2874).

Suppose we use the dollar values of international           trade in 1990 between the 63 countries in my

sample below to indicate the “thickness”’ of the markets in these commodities,               admitting that this

is a bad proxy because it excludes domestic trade and does not account for the average size of




     ‘Much to my surprise, I could not find a formalization of this “conventional wisdom” in the
literature. The closest I found is Heller ( 1993). Market formation involves set-up costs in his
model, but his focus is on coordination failure where it is mutually profitable to open markets in
complementary commodities but not to open one of them individually.
                                                                                                               3

transactions.    The figures are $27.3 billion for Footwear and $1.3 billion for Lead, of which

nearly 90 percent is Lead and Lead Alloys, Unwrought (SITC 6851) as opposed to Lead and Lead

Alloys, Worked (SITC 6852).        Unwrought lead is traded on the London Metal Exchange while

footwear is not listed on any organized exchange.       This information    appears to contradict the

conventional    wisdom on formation of organized exchanges.         However, one could argue that

“footwear” is not a well-defined commodity and needs to be disaggregated           into various types of

shoes, each one of which may have a volume of transactions         smaller than that of lead. As we

know. in the limit this process of disaggregation    leads to shoes for which there is only one

supplier:   shoes are “branded” or differentiated products.

        Without necessarily endorsing this argument, let us explore it further by contrasting

Footwear with Polymerization       and Copol ymerization Products (SITC 583).        1990 international

trade in these chemicals for the 63 countries in my sample amounted to $47.6 billion.           Like

Footwear, they are not listed on any organized exchange, perhaps because they can be

disaggregated    into types for each of which the market is too “thin”.     Does this mean that

Polymerization     and Copolymerization   Products should be treated in the same way as Footwear in

the empirical analysis below?

        The answer is no.    Polymerization   and Copolymerization      Products are not “branded”:

prices can be quoted for these products without mentioning        the name of the manufacturer,        and

these “reference prices” are found to be sufficiently useful by industry actors to be worth quoting

in trade publications.    For example, a price per pound of Polyoxyethylene        Sorbitan Monostearate

 is quoted weekly in Chemical Marketing Reporter on the basis of surveys of suppliers.

 Abstracting from transportation    costs, it is then possible for traders to assess the profitability    of
                                                                                                            4

shipping polymerization   and copolymerization     products between any two countries solely on the

basis of the prices prevailing at the ports of those two countries.     One or more traders specialized

in a given one of these chemicals can keep informed of its prices around the globe and perform

international commodity arbitrage, matching distant buyers and sellers just as would traders on

an organized exchange.    As far as empirical analysis of matching international       buyers and sellers

is concerned, then, the reason to treat commodities    traded on organized exchanges differently

from commodities    that only have reference prices is that we know the former have specialized

traders that centralize price information while the same is only potentially true for the latter.

       Shoes, on the other hand, do not have reference prices. Any observed price at another

location must be adjusted for multidimensional      differences in characteristics,   and the adjustment

depends on the varieties of shoes available at that location and the distribution      of consumer

preferences over varieties at that location.   I claim that these informational    demands are too great

to permit international commodity arbitrage,z and therefore traders will instead engage in a

sequential search for buyers/sellers   that terminates when some “reservation match” is achieved.

This search is facilitated by proximity and common language, and by any contacts who “know

the market”.   Of course the trader’s network of contacts will also be strongly influenced by

proximity and common language.         Discussing “psychological      barriers” to trade, Nothdurft (1992,

pp. 39-40) states, “Typically, trade begins close to home and then, as experience and confidence

grows, expands ‘like rings in the water,’ as one official of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce


    2Here I find it helpful to have in mind Hahn’s ( 1971) definition of markets as activities that
transfom “named” goods into “anonymous” goods. One could argue that the “anonymity”
provided by the price system is what makes international commodity arbitrage possible. It is not
possible for “branded” (named) commodities because they have not been transformed into
anonymous commodities by “markets” (organized exchanges) or by other means.
                                                                                                          5

put it. ”s

        For the purposes of the empirical work below, we can summarize the discussion of this

section as follows.    Possession of a reference price distinguishes   homogeneous     from

differentiated   products.    Homogeneous   commodities   can be further divided into those whose

reference prices are quoted on organized exchanges and those whose reference prices are quoted

only in trade publications.     The networHsearch   model should apply most strongly to

differentiated   products and most weakly to products traded on organized exchanges, with its

applicability    to other homogeneous   products unclear, Thus proximity and common language

should have the greatest effects on matching international     buyers and sellers of differentiated

products, and search costs should act as the greatest barrier to trade for differentiated     products.

These hypotheses will be examined in sections ~ and IV, respectively.




III.   Evidence From a Gravity Model of Trade

 A. The Gravi~ Model

         The standard (indeed, the only) empirical framework used to predict how countries match

up in international    trade is the gravity model. This model takes its name from the prediction that

 the volume of trade between two countries will be directly proportional      to the product of their

 economic masses (as memured by GDP or GNP) and inversely proportional               to the distance

 between them. As Harrigan ( 1994) and others have pointed out, at least two different theoretical


     ‘It is tempting to extend this metaphor and suppose that, with the passage of time, the “rings
 in the water” will flatten out and disappear. Perhaps this is conceivable in a world where the
 varieties of differentiated product remain unchanged for long periods. In fact, product life cycles
 even for “low-tech” goods like shoes are quite short so that the search for buyers/sellers is
 constantly being renewed (see, e.g., Gereffi and Korzeniewicz 1990).
                                                                                                              6

foundations can be given for gravity models of trade: the monopolistic        competition   model and

what Harrigan calls the Arlington        - Heckscher- Ohlin - Vanek model. The careful empirical

work of Hummels and Levinsohn ( 1995) led them to conclude (p. 828) “that something other

than monopolistic   competition   may be responsible for the empirical success of the gravity

model,” but the Arrnington-Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek          model is not strongly indicated as an

alternative.

         Rather than discuss its possible macroeconomic     foundations,   I would instead like to note

that the gravity equation can be derived from the assumption       that every country consumes its

own output and that of every other country in proportion to its share of world demand.          This

leads immediately to the equation



                                        Vq = siGDPj + sjGDPi,                                          (1)




where I have used the notation from Helpman ( 1987): Vti = bilateral volume of trade between

country i and countryj   and s,, = share of country n in world spending.      Since under balanced trade

 s~=GDP n /~        , where GDP     ❑   world gross domestic product, then assuming balanced trade

yields



                                         Vti = 2GDPiGDP/GDP.                                            (2)


This is the basic gravity relationship, minus the inverse dependence of trade on distance.         I would

 argue that it is most useful to view this relationship   as a basic “null” or starting point for further

 analysis of trade rather than as something that itself needs to be explained.      In other words, it will
                                                                                                            7

often be useful for “positive” theoretical and empirical work on trade to focus on explaining

deviations from this relationship, just as normative work takes autarky as its starting point and

measures gains from trade relative to autarky.

       In the empirical work below I will estimate the gravity model separately for each of the

three commodity groups distinguished       in the previous section.   Following the same reasoning

that led to equation (1), we write


                                     VO~ = siwj~GDP, + .YjWi~GDPi,                                    (3)



where wn~is the commodity k share of country n output.        Substituting   for Snas before yields


                                Vtik = (wik + wj~)GDPiGDP/GDP.                                        (4)



If Wti varies across n, due for example to comparative     advantage, then wi~+ wj~is not constant for

a given k. In the final gravity model specifications    below I will assume that w,~+ wj~is absorbed

into a multiplicative   emor term.

       Following the usual gravity specification,    I assume that factors that aid or resist trade

cause deviations from (4) multiplicatively.     In addition to distance and common

language/colonial   ties, we shall include the other factors aiding or resisting trade that were used

by Frankel and co-authors in a series of papers on trading blocs (e.g., Frankel, Stein, and Wei

1993). They used the product of per capita GNPs in the belief that wealthier countries are more

open to international   trade. (They also used GNPs rather than the GDPs that appear in equations

(1) - (4)). They added a dummy variable indicating when two countries are adjacent, which is

important since the distance between Chicago and Mexico City, say, is a much less complete
                                                                                                           8

measure of the physical separation between the United States and Mexico than is the distance

between Chicago and London of the physical separation between the United States and the

United Kingdom.      Finally, they added dummy variables indicating membership          in two

preferential trading blocs, the European Community (EEC) and the European Free Trade

Association    (EFTA).

       I can now state the first gravity model to be estimated in subsection C below:


                    v.~ = UL(GNP,GNP,)p’(PGNPiPGNPj)y’DISTANCE b’
                                                                                                     (5)
          x exp(cflDJACENT    + ~&lNKs + qkEEC + 0kEF7° + Utik), k= 1,2,3,




where k = 1 denotes organized exchange commodities,         k = 2 denotes reference priced

commodities,    and k = 3 denotes differentiated commodities,     and PGNP denotes per capita GNP,

DISTANCE       equals the great circle distance between the principal cities of countries i and j,

ADJACENT       takes the value of one if countries i andj share a land border and zero otherwise,

LINKS takes the value of one if countries i andj share a language or colonial tie and zero

otherwise, EEC and EFTA equal one if countries i and j are members of the European

Community      and European Free Trade Association, respectively,     and zero otherwise, and

uti~is a Gaussian white noise error term associated with the dependent variable Vti~. Taking

natural logarithms of both sides yields



         lnvti~ = lna~ + ~~ln(GNPiGNP,)         + y~ln(PGNP,~GNPj)       + 6~lIID]STANCE
               + e@DJACENT        + ~,LINKS    + q,EEC    + O~EFTA +                                 (6)
                                                                         Utik,   k= 1,2,3.
                                                                                                       9

Equations (6) will be estimated by Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).”

       The dependent variable Vti~is bounded below by zero, and some observations       achieve this

bound. Following Eaton and Tamura ( 1994), I also estimate a modified gravity model in which

the right-hand side of equation (5) must achieve a minimum threshold value a~ before strictly

positive values of Vti~occur. One reason we might observe a~ >0 is economies       of scale in

transportation.   The second gravity model to be estimated in subsection C below is then


               VO~ = max[ -a~ + a~(GNP,GNP,)P’(PGNP, PGNP,)y’DISTANCEa’
                                                                                                 (7)
         x exp(~#DJACENT      + ~~LINKS + q~EEC + O~EFTA + [lti~), O], k= 1,2,3.




Rearranging and taking natural logarithms of both sides yields


   ln(a~ + Vok) = max[lna~ + ~~ln(GNPiGNPj) + yJn(PGNPiPGNPj)    + 6~lfllSTANCE
                                                                                                 (8)
         + ~@DJACENT + ~~NKS        + q~EEC + O~EFTA + uv~, lna~], k= 1,2,3.




Equations (8) will be estimated by maximum likelihood,       where the likelihood function is

constructed using what I call a threshold Tobit model. The details of the estimation procedure

are given in Eaton and Tamura ( 1994, pp. 490-492).

        Following the discussion in the previous section, the factors resisting or aiding trade in

which we are most interested are DISTANCE       and LINKS.    We especially want to know how the

effects of these factors differ across the three commodity   groups:   organized exchange, reference




    The reader might note that it is possible to rewrite equations (5) and (6), replacing the
 product of per capita GNPs with the product of populations, in which case the coefficient on the
 product of GNPs would equal ~~ + y, and the coefficient on the product of populations would
 equal -y~.
                                                                                                               10

priced, and differentiated.      However, if these three commodity groups differ in their

transportability,     this will confound our interpretation    of the differences in their distance effects.

Ideally, then, we should add a variable for transportation         cost of commodity     group k between

country i and countryj.        Unfortunately,   we shall see in the next subsection that available data

does not allow us to create such a variable.        Instead we will compute a measure of

transportability      for each commodity group, and use these to more crudely correct distance effects

for differences in transportability      in subsection C below.

        Equations (6) and (8) will be estimated separately for the years 1970, 1980, and 1990 in

order to check that the results are not the artifact of any particular time period and to allow for

changes in coefficients, especially on DISTANCE             and LINKS, that might have taken place due

(for example) to changes in transportation         and communication      technology.    In light of the theory

presented so far, in each of the three years we expect the following relationships            to hold among

the coefficients after correcting for differences in transportability       across commodity      groups:

~,= I V k, 15, I c 16,1<1531, and ~, c <2< (3. The effects of DISTANCE                  and LINKS for

reference priced commodities         are expected to be intermediate     because, with regard to matching

international       buyers and sellers, their homogeneity     makes them like organized exchange

commodities         but their lack of organized exchanges makes them like differentiated        commodities.

 B. Data

         The sample of countries used in the estimation below is listed in Table 1. They are the

 same 63 countries that were chosen by Frankel and his co-authors.              This allows me to use their

links, European Community membership,       and European Free Trade Areamembership.5          Unlike

Frankel et al., I use the World Trade Database of Statistics Canada as my source for bilateral

trade. The World Trade Database is derived from United Nations COMTRADE              data. Its

advantages are (1) it is much cheaper, especially important given that data at the 4-digit    SITC

level are being used. and (2) special care was taken to insure that trading partners were correctly

identified (as opposed to listing an entrep6t as the trading partner), mainly by making careful

efforts to insure that exports of country i to country j of commodity   k equal imports of country j

from country i of commodity k.d

       As discussed in the previous section, commodities    are classified into three categories:

organized exchange, reference priced, and differentiated,   at the three- and four-digit   SITC level.

Trade reported at a less disaggregated level was omitted.   Fortunately,   this accounted for only 0.1

percent of the total value of trade in my sample in each of the three years. Commodities         were

classified in the following manner. All commodities     at the five-digit SITC level were classified

by looking them up in International   Commodi@ Markets Handbook and The Knight-Ridder                   CRB



    5Frankel et al. also used dummies for “membership” in the geographic areas East Asia and
Western Hemisphere. hcluding these dummies in the estimation below shrinks the coefficients
on DISTANCE (in absolute value) and LINKS, as one would expect, but does so in a proportional
way across all product categories so that the comparisons of these coefficients are virtually
unchanged. I prefer to exclude these dummies because they compound the problem of
interpretation presented by DZSTANCE: when comparing their effects across product categories,
one again needs to try to control for differences in transportability.

     This method will not catch coordinated false reporting. Rozanski and Yeats (1994, p. 126)
 note that falsification of statistics has been a problem for “trade in some products (particularly
 petroleum or commodities covered by international quota agreements)”. Since under the
 “conservative” aggregation discussed below Petroleum (SITC 3330) accounts for a low of 22.4
 percent (in 1970) and a high of 53.0 percent (in 1980) of total trade in organized exchange
 products in my sample (less under the “liberal” aggregation), it seems prudent to see how key
 results might change if it were omitted. This will be done in footnotes to the next subsection.

Commodi~       Yearbook (to check for organized exchanges) and Commodi~                Prices (to check for

reference prices, e.g., price quotations published in trade journals such as Chemical Marketing

Reporter).     Clmsification   of the next higher level of aggregation was then done according to

which of the three categories accounted for the largest share (almost always more than halo of

the value of its world trade. Since the World Trade Database does not report world trade by five-

digit SITC, the sum of 1980 U.S. General Imports and Exports from the U.S. Department of

Commerce was used for this purpose.        Because ambiguities       arose that were sometimes

sufficiently important to affect the classification     at the three- or four-digit     level, both

“conservative” and “liberal” classifications   were made, with the former minimizing              the number

of three- and four– digit commodities     that are classified as either organized exchange or reference

priced and the latter maximizing     those numbers.      An appendix listing all of the commodities           used

in the estimation below and their conservative        and liberal classifications     is available on request.

       Table 2 gives the shares of organized exchange, reference priced, and differentiated

commodities     in the value of total trade in my sample.      Not surprisingly,     differentiated   products

accounted for most of world trade, and their share rose between 1970 and 1990. The temporary

fall in 1980 can be explained by the huge increase in the price of petroleum, an organized

exchange product, between 1970 and 1980. The share of organized exchange commodities                        is of

course higher in the liberal than the conservative       aggregation and the share of differentiated

commodities     is lower, while the reference priced share is consistently          lower although it gains

from the differentiated    category and loses to the organized exchange category in the liberal

aggregation.

       The prefemed method of computing commodity              transportation      costs is to use the ratio of
                                                                                                           13

the difference between the customs, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) and customs values to the

customs value for imports.     Unfortunately,    data for c.i.f. and customs values of imports at the

four-digit SITC level are readily available only for the United States (from the U.S. Department

of Commerce).’     Moreover, the United States does not import all commodities        from all countries

in the sample, the subset of commodities        with positive imports tending to shrink as the volume of

trade with the partner country shrinks.    I therefore decided to abandon construction     of a variable

measuring transportation     cost between country i and countryj     of commodity   group k in favor of

construction   of a memure of “transportability”      of commodity group k based on transportation

costs between the United States and Japan, from which the United States recorded positive

General Imports for over 86 percent of four-digit SITC commodities          in 1985.8 When positive

imports from Japan were not recorded, c.i.f. and customs data for nearby countries or countries a

comparable distance away were used.9 To aggregate these insurance and freight percentages up

to measures of transportability   for the three commodity categories, the shares of each three- or

four-digit SITC in the total value of trade in that commodity category were used as weights.            Of

course insofar as more transportable commodities         tend to be traded more this procedure tends to



   71cannot rule out the possibility that a heroic and expensive effort could have uncovered
comparable data for other countries in the sample, at lemt potentially allowing for computation
of a true transportation cost variable rather than the measure of commodity “transportability” for
which I settle.

   8h section IV this measure of transportability performs quite well in explaining the extent to
which commodities are traded rather than consumed or supplied domestically.

    ‘Countries were defaulted to in the following order: Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Chile, Brazil, New Zealand and Australia. My original intention
was to use U.S. General Import data from 1980 since that is the middle of the sample period, but
this data sometimes yielded negative transportation costs, apparently due to spurious inflation of
customs values.
                                                                                                           14

bias the numbers downwards, but since only their relative values across commodity categories

rather than their absolute values will be used this should not be important.

       Table 3 shows the results of this procedure.     We see that, except for the liberal aggregation

in 1970, the transportabilities   of the organized exchange and reference priced commodity groups

are quite close, while the differentiated product group tends to be roughly twice as transportable

as the other two groups. It will therefore be important to try to correct for transportability    when

comparing the effects of distance on trade in differentiated     products versus organized exchange

and reference priced products.




 C. Resuits of Estimation

       Tables 4-6     give estimates of equations (6), the first gravity model above. It should be

noted that no attempt was made to adjust for changes in classification      of commodities    by the

three categories that may have occurred during the period 1970- 1990. GNP data is not available

for Hungary and Poland in 1970, reducing the maximum possible number of observations                  in that

year from (63)(62)/2 = 1953 to (6 I)(60)/2 = 1830. The number of observations          consistently     falls

well below the maximum, mainly because many countries do not trade with each other in certain

commodity groups or their trade is too small to be recorded.       We shall see below that dropping

these zero observations     has substantial consequences.

        Turning to the hypotheses advanced at the end of subsection A, we see that ~~ is always

significantly different from one. The main hypotheses fare much better. The coefficients on

LINKS are always smaller for the homogeneous         commodity    groups than for the differentiated

commodity group, although the coefficients for the reference priced group are smaller than the
                                                                                                                  15

coefficients for the organized exchange group in i 970 and for the liberal aggregation in 1980.

Comparing distance effects for organized exchange and reference priced commodities,                    between

which differences in transportability     are not an issue, we see that the former are always smaller.

Surprisingly,    distance effects are smaller for organized exchange commodities            than for

differentiated   commodities   even without adjusting for differences in transportability.

       There is remon to believe that the results reported in Tables 4-6             are more favorable to the

main hypotheses I have advanced than is justified.          Note that the number of observations

declines, and thus the number of zero observations on V,,~increases, as one moves from

organized exchange commodities          to differentiated   commodities.      If zero observations   tend to

occur between countries that are far apart and do not share a common language/colonial                     tie, then

omitting them will tend to reduce the estimated effects of DISTANCE                and LZNKS, and that

reduction will be greatest for organized exchange commodities               and least for differentiated

commodities.      With this in mind we turn to Tables 7-9,10 which give the estimates of equations

(8), the second gravity model above. [‘

        I find these estimates to be preferable on two grounds.            First, they fit the gravity models of

subsection A better in the sense that ~~ is never significantly        different from one in 1990, is



    ‘“Observations are missing in these tables because sometimes both country i and countryj did
not report trade at all (or did not report trade with each other in the cue of China and Taiwan),
making it impossible to reconstruct trade between them. This mainly happened in 1990 due to
lags in reporting.

    1lBecause the estimates of the thresholds a~ are positive (and statistically significant at the one
percent level), the estimates of the coefficients ~~, y~, and ~~converge only asymptotically to the
estimated elasticities of the dependent variable with respect to the corresponding independent
variables as the dependent variable approaches infinity. The estimated elasticities evaluated at
the mean values of the dependent variables can be found by multiplying the coefficient estimates
by (6,+ ~l,k)i ~Qk, a quantity that never exceeds 1.001.
                                                                                                         16

significant y different from one only for organized exchange commodities         in 1980, and is not

significantly different from one in for differentiated commodities    in 1970. Second, the estimates

show a consistent, if slight, “shrinking of the globe” that we would expect to observe given the

improvements   in communication     and transportation   that occurred between 1970 and 1990. All

of the coefficients on DISTANCE decrease in absolute value from 1970 to 1980 and again from

1980 to 1990, unlike in Tables 4-6     where they mostly increase in absolute value between 1980

and 1990.12 (In Tables 4-6    four of the six coefficients on LINKS are smaller in 1990 than in

either 1980 or 1970 while this is true for five out of six in Tables 7- 9.).1’

       Turning to the main hypotheses, the coefficients on UNKS are always less for the

homogeneous    commodity groups than for the differentiated     commodity    group, but the

coefficients for the reference priced group are always less than the coefficients for the organized

exchange group, except for the conservative aggregation in 1990.14 The most important change

from Tables 4-6    is that the differences between the organized exchange group coefficients       and




    l*As distance-sensitive costs fall as a percentage of all costs, elasticity with respect to distance
itself falls (in absolute value).

    lsOn the other hand, all of the coefficients on ADJA CENT increase dramatically from 1970 to
1980 and again from 1980 to 1990. Another strange aspect of the behavior of the adjacency
effects is that when one splits the differentiated commodity group into more and less
transportable subgroups, as I do below, the distance effect is larger for the less transportable
group as expected but the adjacency effect is smaller, leading one to wonder how much
transportability really affects the coefficients on ADJACENT. Given the erratic behavior of these
coefficients I thought it prudent to reestimated Tables 7-9 omitting the variable ADJACENT and
the (maximum on 67 country pairs for which it equals one. There were no qualitative changes in
any results pertaining to the main hypotheses, and the same “shrinking of the globe” is observed.

    140mitting Petroleum from the organized exchange group yields the following coefficients on
LINKS for 1970, 1980, and 1990, reporting the conservative and liberal aggregations
respectively: 1.170 and 1.150, 1.141 and 1.093, 0.827 and 0.874.
                                                                                                           17

the differentiated   group coefficients are much smaller.     Comparing     distance effects for organized

exchange and reference priced commodities,       we see that as in Tables 4-6       the former are always

smaller.’s Unlike in Tables 4-6,     however, distance effects are larger for the homogeneous

commodity groups than for the differentiated commodity group except in 1970.

        Since Table 3 indicates that differentiated     commodities    are roughly twice m transportable

as organized market or reference priced commodities,         adjustment of the distance coefficients for

differentiated products is in order. The simplest way to do this is to estimate the sensitivity of

these coefficients to differences in transportability     within differentiated   commodities,   and use

this estimate to compute what the coefficients would have been had differentiated           commodities

been as transportable    as either organized market or reference priced commodities.         To avoid

greatly increasing the number of observations     for which vti~= O when producing this estimate, I

simply split differentiated   commodities   at the median value of transportability      into more and less

transportable groups, and then estimate the gravity equation separately for each group. The

resulting distance coefficients are reported in Table 10, where 1denotes the less transportable

group and m denotes the more transportable       group.

         The adjustment of the distance coefficients for differentiated       commodities    in Tables 7-9

 then proceeds as follows.    Assume that the distance coefficients       6 are additively separable

 functions of search costs and transportation   costs. Maintaining       the hypothesis that search costs

 are equal within a commodity category, 6, - ~~ leaves only the difference attributable to less

 versus more transportability.    Now denote our measure of transportability         by t,and denote

 DISTANCE for 1970, 1980, and 1990, reporting the conservative and liberal aggregations

                                                                                                                18

measures computed as in Table 3 for the less transportable            group of differentiated    products (t>

median) and the more transportable         group (t s median) by ~1and fm,respectively.          If we choose

the functional form clntfor the transportation        cost component of 6, 51- b~ yields cln(t\t~) so that

only relative values of t will matter in the adjustments.          We thus compute our estimate of c, the

sensitivity of the distance coefficients for differentiated        commodities   to differences in

transportability,     using the formula (&l-8,n)/ln(tft,~).     We can then compute what the distance

coefficients for differentiated      commodities    in Tables 7-9     would have been had their

transportability     been equal to that of organized market commodities          and reference priced

commodities,        respective y, by adding ~ ln(tl/t3) and 6 ln(r2/t3) to these coefficients,    where ‘kare

the appropriate numbers from Table 3. The results are reported at the bottom of Table 10.

        With the exception of the liberally aggregated reference priced commodities                 in 1980, the

adjusted distance effects for differentiated        commodities     are larger than the distance effects for the

homogeneous         commodity     groups. Note that by construction      the differences between the

coefficients at the bottom of Table 10 and the coefficients on DISTANCE                in Tables 7-9     for

organized exchange commodities            and reference priced commodities       are equal to the differences

 in the search components        of these coefficients.

         While the evidence presented in this section supports the hypotheses that proximity and

 common language/colonial          ties are more important in matching international       buyers and sellers

 of differentiated     products than homogeneous          products, and also the hypothesis that proximity is

 Iemt important for homogeneous           products traded on organized exchanges, it does so only

 weakly. The differences in the coefficients on DISTANCE                and LINKS are consistent in sign but
                                                                                                         19

small in absolute magnitude. ‘b The implications of this for the value of the networkfsearch

approach to trade in differentiated    products will be discussed in the concluding    section of this

paper.




IV. Evidence from the OECD COMTAP Database

         h the previous section we considered evidence for the networwsearch          view of trade in

differentiated   products that could be revealed by the contrast between the way countries matched

up in international trade in these products versus more homogeneous         products, especially those

traded on organized exchanges.        This view also has implications   for the extent to which

differentiated   versus homogeneous     products are traded at all, that is, for the shares of production

of different products that are traded rather than supplied or consumed domestically.          Let us

consider a commodity that is sufficiently homogeneous         to have a reference price, but for which

no trader is able to keep sufficiently informed of prices around the world to engage in

international commodity arbitrage.        We suppose therefore that any trader who wishes to export

(import) this commodity     must search for a price that is sufficiently higher (lower) than the




    ‘%e natural way to construct a formal test of whether or not the coefficients in Tables 7-9 are
significantly different across commodity groups is to estimate a pooled model. The error term uti~
would then presumably have a country-pair specific component that is constant across
commodity groups, making a random effects specification appropriate. This is very difficult to
combine with the maximum likelihood procedure for estimating the threshold Tobit model. Let
us nevertheless suppose that in each year the coefficients are not significantly different. We can
then ask, focusing on the conservative aggregation, what are the odds that the DISTANCE
coefficients (after adjustment for differences in transportability) would consistently rank lowest
for organized exchange products and highest for differentiated products (in absolute value) across
all three decades, and what are the odds that the LINKS coefficient for differentiated products
would rank consistently highest across all three decades? The answers are (1/6)3 and ( 1/3)~,
respectively, both of which events are significant at the .05 level.
                                                                                                               20

domestic price to cover transportation.     tariffs, and so on.   I claim that this search will be much

less costly than a search for buyers (sellers) of a differentiated    product that are good “matches”,

because prices can vary along only one dimension while product characteristics              can vary along

many,    Hence the barrier to trade in products with reference prices is smaller than the barrier to

trade in differentiated    products, ceteris paribus, and we expect a higher proportion of production

of the former products to be exported and a higher proportion of their consumption              to be

imported.

        To test this hypothesis we need data on trade that is matched with data on production.

Unfortunately,   trade data is collected according to the Standard International         Trade Classification

while production data is collected according to the International Standard Industrial

Classification   (ISIC).    The Compatible Trade and Production Database (see Berthet-Bondet              et

al., 1988, for a description) converts trade data to an ISIC bmis for the period 1970-1985 for the

OECD only, and only for manufacturing         industries (ISIC codes beginning with 3).         Production

data is disaggregated      to the four-digit ISIC level only for 13 of the 22 OECD countries, which

however account for 95.1 percent and 94,0 percent of total OECD manufacturing                 production in

1970 and 1985, respectively .17 A total of 82 industries are distinguished,         of which one, Metal

Scrap from Manufacture        of Fabricated Metal Products (ISIC 3801), had to be dropped due to

fragmentary data. The analysis below is therefore based on the total production, exports, and

imports of the 13 reporting OECD countries for 81 manufacturing            industries.

         Using OECD data presents a problem that would not occur if we had data for the entire




   “The 13 countries are Australia, Belgium-Luxembourg, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, Japan,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and West Germany.

world, for which imports are identically equal to exports:        it might matter whether we test the

hypothesis that tradedness increases with reference pricing using the export share of production

or the import share of consumption.         In particular, the OECD tends to have a comparative

advantage relative to the rest of the world in differentiated     manufactures    and a comparative

disadvantage    in homogeneous        manufactures, perhaps because the former are more skill-intensive

or technologically   sophisticated,     leading to a bias against my hypothesis when tested using the

export share of production and in favor of my hypothesis when tested using the import share of

consumption.      I decided to simply use the average of the export share and the import share as my

dependent variable: 1s

             SHARE =[Exports/Production+          Imports/(Production   + Imports - Exports)]/2.

       The computation      of the percentage of each industry’s output that is reference priced is

complicated     by the fact that production figures for more disaggregated       levels of the ISIC are not

available.     I therefore used the 1979 U.S. Department of Commerce publication           Correlation

Between the United States and International         Standard Industrial Class~ications     to match each

ISIC to the corresponding     four-digit U.S. SIC(s), and then classified each seven-digit U.S. SIC

component as reference priced or not.          I then aggregated up from the seven-digit level using

output figures from the 1977 U.S. Census of Manufactures            to estimate the percentage of each

ISIC’S output that is reference priced, where 1977 was chosen because it is the midpoint of the


    laIn 1970 the average of the expofi share of production across 81 commodities was 13.8
percent compared to 12.6 percent for the import share of consumption. The comparable figures
for 1985 were 19.0 percent and 18.9 percent. Hence there is no comparative advantage revealed
for the OECD relative to the rest of the world in manufacturing as a whole. However, the
average absolute difference between the two shares was 3.3 percent in 1970 and 4.2 percent in
 1985. Clearly these figures would be much larger if the OECD did not mostly trade with itself.

period covered by the COMTAP database.           For the purposes of this section I chose to use this

estimate as a continuous explanatory variable rather than to classify each industry as reference

priced or not. 19

       Transportability   was estimated using the difference between c.i.f. and customs values of

U.S. imports as in the previous section.    Since the U.S. Department     of Commerce does not

produce trade data classified by ISIC, the transportability     estimate for the largest U.S. SIC among

those that make up the 4-digit    ISIC was used. Where the largest was not available (e.g., because

the Department of Commerce does not use it to record trade), a judgment            was made concerning

the SIC that is most representative   of the ISIC.

       Since our estimates of transportability    and reference pricing do not change from year to

year, estimation will be reported for the beginning and end years of the sample only. (Results are

not qualitative y different for other years. ) Table 11 gives descriptive statistics for

transportability    (TRANSPOR~,    reference pricing (PRICING),      and SHARE.       Note that the

median for reference pricing is less than two percent:        most manufacturing     industries have

essentially no reference pricing, indicating that the zero-one classification      of commodities      as

reference priced or not in the previous section was not such a bad approximation,          at lemt for

manufactured commodities.         The minimum and maximum for TRANSPORT                correspond to

Aircraft (ISIC 3845) and Cement, Lime, and Plaster (ISIC 3692), respectively.            A comparison       of

the 1970 and 1985 values of SHARE shows a substantial increase in OECD openness during this




    19Asmentioned above, reference pricing is typically based on the availability of price
quotations in U.S. trade publications based on surveys of U.S. wholesale markets. It follows that
there is minimal scope for “reverse causation”, where extensive international trade leads to more
price quotation and a high estimate of reference pricing.
                                                                                                            23

period, as expected.      I also computed simple and rank correlation coefficients       between

TRANSPORT       and PRICING, obtaining 0.490 and 0.460, respectively.            These results are also in

line with expectations.

       Table 12 reports regressions of SHARE on TRANSPORT                and PRIC’ING.20 Because

SHARE can only vary from zero to one but OLS can yield predictions outside this range, a

logistic transformation       of SHARE is used as the dependent variable.21 The results in the first and

third columns are not favorable to the hypothesis that reference pricing reduces barriers to trade:

TRANSPORT       has a robustly negative effect on SHARE while the effect of reference pricing is

statistically insignificant.     It may be, however, that the effect of reference pricing on tradeability

is being masked by industry characteristics        that are correlated with reference pricing and affect

traceability but are not picked up by TRANSPORT.             For example, concern with “freshness” may

act as a barrier to trade for Manufacturing       of Food, Beverages, and Tobacco (ISIC 31).       To

account for this possibility,     eight dummy variables for ISIC 31-38 (ISIC 39 is the omitted two-

digit industry) are included in the second and fourth columns of Table 12. F-tests reject

exclusion of these dummies at the one percent level in both 1970 and 1985.              We see that

reference pricing does have a statistically significant effect on SHARE within a two-digit

manufacturing     industry.

        How important is reference pricing in lowering barriers to trade within a two-digit



   20Use of the logarithm of TRANSPORT            leaves the results qualitatively   unchanged.

   21The transformation is In[SHARE/( 1-SHARE’)]. In 1985 the value of exports for Fur
Dressing and Dyeing Industries (ISIC 3232) exceeded the value of production, presumably
because of difficulties in translating from SITC to ISIC, I therefore dropped this industry,
leaving 80 observations.     Simply substituting imports for exports and retaining this observation
does not qualitatively change the results.
                                                                                                         24

industry?   Holding all other variables (including dummies) at their mean levels, we can compute

the predicted value of SHARE for an industry with zero reference pricing and one hundred

percent reference pricing using the formula exp(~ )/[ 1 + exp(j )], where ~ is the predicted value

of the transformed dependent variable. The results are 0.077 and 0.233 in 1970 and 0.126 and

0.270 in 1985, indicating that a change from no reference pricing to full reference pricing more

than doubles the tradedness of an industry within a two-digit clmsification.      The decrease in the

effect of reference pricing between 1970 and 1985 is consistent with the “shrinking of the globe”

found in the previous section.    A similar decrease (in absolute value) is found for the effect of

transportability   within a two-digit indust~:   the elasticity of SHARE with respect to

TRANSPORT,         evaluated at the means, equals -0.96 in 1970 and -0.65 in 1985.




V.   Alternative Explanations

        I have examined evidence at the level of world trade flows in order to determine whether

the theoretical considerations    of section II make a difference at the aggregate level. Too often,

the effects of imperfect information are discussed only at the micro level, with no sense of how

or if they aggregate up to something observable at the macro level. Unfortunately,         evidence at

such an aggregate level allows for many alternative explanations.       This evidence will ultimately

have to be supplemented      by case studies of trading and marketing practices for different types of

products.

        Many of the alternative explanations     for the results in sections III and IV can explain only
                                                                                                        25

some of the results.22 Rather than try to discuss each one (and knowing that the reader can

always think of more), I will discuss one alternative explanation     that I find particularly

compelling because it can explain all of the results.23 Suppose that firms develop their varieties

of differentiated   products to suit niches in their home markets.   We suppose further that they do

this not because they know more about their home markets than about foreign markets, which

would again indicate an incomplete information structure where information          about buyers is

mediated by distance, but because positive transportation      costs make this the best decision,

ceteris paribus.    This could explain why differentiated   products tend to be less traded: there is

less demand for them outside the country in which they are produced.         Now suppose further that

the similarity of foreign preferences to those in the home country falls with distance and rises

with common language/colonial        ties. This could explain why trade in differentiated    products

dmreases more with distance and increases more with links than trade in homogeneous              products:

a geographic and linguistic application of the Linder hypothesis.z4



    22Agood example is based on the natural resource intensity of organized exchange and
reference priced products. It can be argued that this leads these products to be traded more
extensively, and across greater distances (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia should not exchange much
petroleum), but this alternative explanation cannot explain the lower coefficients on LINKS for
these product groups. h any case, this argument should hold most strongly for countries that
share a land border, yet the coefficients on ADYACE~      in Tables 7-9 are always largest for
organized exchange products and smallest for differentiated products. The fact that the
coefficient on DISTANCEfalls      (in absolute value) when petroleum is omitted from the organized
exchange group (see footnote 15) also casts doubt on this alternative explanation.

   *’On the other hand, there may be reasons to believe that the results would be stronger in the
absence of certain countervailing influences. For example, we know that there are many
preferential trading agreements for agricultural products based on colonial ties, and these should
work to make the Iinks effect larger for the homogeneous commodity groups.

   240f course production of similar varieties in nearby countries and countries with a common
IanWage/colonial tie would increase too, but this may just stimulate “intraindustry” trade rather
                                                                                                        26

       While it is hard to believe that this alternative explanation   is completely unrelated to the

findings of sections III and ~, a clever study by Gould (1994) strongly suggests that it is not the

whole story. He finds that immigration to the United States increases U.S. bilateral trade with

the immigrants’ countries of origin, that this “immigrant-link    effect” is stronger for U.S. exports

than for U.S. imports, and that the effect on exports exhausts itself for a much smaller number of

immigrants than does the effect on imports.     Taken together these results indicate that the most

important effect of immigration    on trade is through the establishment   of business contacts, with a

secondary effect through increased U.S. preferences for goods produced in the country of origin.

By extension, the argument that preferences are mainly responsible for the findings of sections III

and IV is undermined.

       If the theory of section H has merit, the immigrant-link    effect on exports should be greatest

for differentiated   products and smallest for homogeneous    products traded on organized

exchanges.    Gould did in fact disaggregate his dependent variable, U.S. trade in manufactures

from 1970 to 1986 (from the OECD COMTAP database used in section IV above), into what he

called consumer and producer goods. The four-digit industries he lists in the former category

tend to be less “priced” in the sense of section IV than those in the latter catego~.    Gould reports

(p. 3 10) that, “The immigrant information variable does not appear to be important in the

producer imports equation.”zs



than decreasing trade. Moreover, this production of similar varieties allows extension of the
alternative explanation to trade in producer goods as well as consumer goods.

   25When Gould uses the logarithm of the immigrant stock as his explanatory variable, yielding
a constant elasticity specification (also used by Head and Ries 1995 in their work on immigration
and trade for Canada), it is significant in the consumer export equation but not in the equations
for consumer or producer imports or producer exports. It should be noted that Gould’s equations
                                                                                                             27

VI.   Conclusions     and Suggestions for Further Research

       In section III we saw that the differences in proximity and links effects across organized

exchange, reference priced, and differentiated commodities,        while in the direction predicted by

the network/search    view of trade in differentiated products, were quantitatively      small. In section

IV we saw that the effects of reference pricing on the extent of trade were present only within a

two-digit industry.   Are these results due to a small quantitative importance of networks and

search in trade, or to an overestimation   of the importance of “markets”, leading to networks and

search being very significant for homogeneous        as well as differentiated   products?   The latter

explanation is supported by the fact that the coefficients on LINKS consistently imply that

countries that share a common language/colonial        tie trade with each other products listed on

organized exchanges more than twice as much as countries that do not.zb Once again, however,

examination of more disaggregated data or even case studies of trader behavior will ultimately be

needed to answer this question.

       An important aim of this paper is to put networks and search on the agenda for the study

of trade. One advantage of the network/search        view of trade in differentiated   products is that it

helps to make sense of certain micro-institutional     features of trade. In Rauch ( 1996) I show that

a simple partial equilibrium search model yields economies of scope in search for buyers of

differentiated products, which can help us understand the role of “social capital” in international




contain fixed effects for every U.S. trading partner, so the immigrant stock cannot be acting as a
proxy for distance or common language/colonial ties.

   2bSince the value of this trade is dominated by grains, oil seeds, fuels, and both mineral and
nonmineral raw materials such as metals, a preference-based explanation for this finding is
highly implausible.
                                                                                                               28

trade and the viability of general trading companies such as Japan’s sogo shosha.            I also note that

if search is subject to free-riding (through unintended information spillover) there may be a

rationale for ubiquitous export promotion policies such as subsidized trade missions.             More

broadly, the networtisearch     view of trade opens up space for greater consideration         of the role of

personal contacts and relationship-building     in determining    the geographic distribution       of

economic activity. This is the subject of many business press anecdotes but not much systematic

economic analysis (see Egan and Mody 1992 for an exception).

       Foreign Direct Investment (FD~ projects bear the same relationship            to portfolio

investments as differentiated     products do to homogeneous      products.   Unfortunately,     as far as I

know it is impossible to obtain data on bilateral portfolio investment flows, making comparisons

of the kind performed in section ~ impossible.       Nevertheless,     the importance of proximity for

bilateral FDI flows could be seen as evidence in favor of the robustness of the network/search

view as an approach to understanding      economic transactions more generally, the transactions

being in “differentiated   projects” rather than differentiated   products.   Eaton and Tamura ( 1994)

examine U.S. and Japanese bilateral FDI flows. They use regional dummies rather than distance,

and find (p. 4), “Taking into account population,     income, and factor endowments,           both countries

have deeper trade and investment relationships       with countries in their respective regions than

with the rest of the world. ” This finding is especially striking when one considers that most FDI

is undertaken with the aim of penetrating the market of the host country, so that one should

expect distance to have a positive effect on bilateral FDI flows given the

proximity- concentration      tradeoff.

       A long-ten-n goal for future research is formalization        of the network/search     view of trade
                                                                                                     29

in a general equilibrium   model.     It is possible that this could lead to many more empirical

applications   and more detailed predictions.    We may, for example, be able to improve our

analysis of the effects of distance and common language/colonial        ties in mediating the economic

impacts of trade liberalization     agreements .27
