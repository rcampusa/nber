Estimating the Cream Skimming Effect of School Choice

                                               ABSTRACT

We develop a framework that may be used to determine the degree to which a school choice program
may harm public school stayers by luring the best students to other schools. This framework results
in a simple formula showing that the ‚Äúcream-skimming‚Äù effect is increasing in the degree of heterogeneity
within schools, the school choice takeup rate of strong students relative to weak students, and the importance
of peers. We use the formula to investigate the effects of a voucher program on the high school graduation
rate of the students who would remain in public school. We employ NELS:88 data to measure the
characteristics of public school students, to estimate a model of the private school entrance decision,
and to estimate peer group effects on graduation. We supplement the econometric estimates with a
wide range of alternative assumptions about school choice and peer effects. We find that the cream
skimming effect is negative but small and that this result is robust across our specifications.

1 Introduction

Dissatisfaction with the performance of the U.S. educational system, particularly in minority
urban school districts, has led to a surge in interest in and experimentation with a variety of
school choice programs. To assess the overall eect of any school choice program on educational
outcomes, one must address (at least) three questions. First, by how much do children who
exercise their option to switch schools benet? Second, does increased competition lead schools
to improve? Third, will a choice program lure the best students away from current schools,
and if so, how large is the negative cream skimming eect on those who remain behind? The
same three issues are central to assessing the major types of choice programs: vouchers, charter
schools, and choice within the public school system.
    There is a lot of research on the rst question and some work on the second, but virtually
no work on measuring the cream skimming eect, which is the subject of our paper. 1 Quantify-
ing this eect is dicult. Starting from knowledge of who currently attends public school, one
must assess who will move in response to the program, estimate the consequences of peers for
outcomes, and then weight the change in the peers of public school students by the estimates of
the peer eect parameters. In fact, it is hard to conceive of a controlled experiment, let alone a
natural experiment, that could directly identify this eect. Even if one could randomize eligi-
bility for a choice plan across schools, one still would not know the counterfactual of who in the
control school would remain if they were eligible for the plan. One must combine experimental
or non-experimental variation with a model of school choice and outcomes.
    The rst contribution of the paper is to show that for a broad class of models of school
choice and peer eects, the cream skimming eect is determined by the covariance between the
relative probability that a student will move in response to the choice program with an index
of the dierences between the student's characteristics and the average characteristics of his
or her classmates. The weights of the index are the peer eect coecients. The covariance is
increasing in the amount of heterogeneity within schools, the relative response of advantaged
students to the voucher, and the magnitude of the peer eect coecients. To see the intuition,
note that the cream skimming eect will be zero under three separate conditions. The rst is
zero heterogeneity within public schools, because then the leavers will be the same as the stayers.
   1 Much of the U.S. research on the direct benets from private school attendance is in the context of Catholic
schools. The results are mixed, but studies by Evans and Schwab (1995), Neal (1997), Grogger and Neal (2000),
and Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005) suggests that students who attend Catholic schools perform substantially
better than they when he would have done in a public school. The evidence is strongest for urban minority
students, and the main eects appear to be on high school graduation and college attendance rates rather than
on achievement on standardized tests. Rouse and Barrow (2009) survey the evidence from a number of voucher
experiments on the achievement eects of private school attendance and conclude that they are small. They also
summarize the literature on eects of attending a charter school and on whether competition improves public
school performance. See also Hoxby (2003).
                                                       1
The second is the absense of a relationship between the probability that a student leaves and
student characteristics that aect classmates, because then the voucher will not change the
average values of relevant peer measure. Finally, the cream skimming eect will be zero if peer
eects on outcomes are zero.
    Although our formula for the cream skimming eect could be applied to other school choice
programs, we focus on voucher programs because our data are much more informative about
selection into private schools. We consider both broad based voucher programs and programs
that are targeted to low income students or urban students and use high school graduation as
our main outcome of interest.
    The cream skimming formula provides the structure for what amounts to a mix of formal
econometric analysis and sensitivity analysis. The formal econometric analysis uses data from
the National Education Longitudinal Survey of 1988 (NELS:88) and proceeds in three stages.
The rst stage is to estimate the eect of a voucher on who attends public school. The second
is to estimate the eects of peers on outcomes. The nal stage is to apply our formula and
compute the cream skimming eect.
    In the rst stage of our base case model we estimate a probit model for public school choice
that identies the conditional probability that a student with specied observed characteristics
chooses public school, given the status quo of no voucher program. We model the voucher as
a shift in the index determining school choice for a given group of students. This allows us to
compute the relative probability that public school students will remain in public school given
the level of the voucher. Furthermore, the assumption implies the natural result that students
who are currently in private schools continue to attend them after a voucher is put into place.
This permits us to obtain the distribution of observed and unobserved characteristics of students
who will remain in public school by using the relative probabilities of continued public school
attendance to reweight the distribution for public school students under the status quo. By
comparing reweighted means to the means of public school students under the status quo one
obtains estimates of how mean family income, mean parental education, mean eighth grade test
scores and other characteristics of high school peers will change for those who remain in public
high schools. A big advantage of our approach is that we do not need variation in tuition or
voucher levels to estimate which students are likely to respond to the voucher program.
    We work with several alternative specications of the demand for public schools, including
a nested logit specication in which Catholic and non-Catholic private schools are treated as
separate alternatives, a case in which we t the school choice model to the Milwaukee school
voucher experience, and the extreme assumption that the students who move in response to the
voucher come entirely from the top of the achievement distribution. The most interesting and
dicult case is a model in which peer quality inuences school choice. To handle this case, we
                                                2
develop and implement a new methodology for estimating binary consumer choice models when
demand depends on the characteristics of the other buyers and information on the characteristics
of the other buyers is only available to the researchers for those who choose the product. In
our case, the attractiveness of public school depends on the characteristics of the other public
school students. We have information on the potential public high school classmates of those
who choose public school but not of those who choose private schools. We show that with
data on a set of variables that are correlated with the characteristics of students in a high
school district, such as average family income and racial composition, one can simultaneously
estimate the distribution of the characteristics of the students who choose public high school,
with selection accounted for, while estimating the eects of student body characteristics on
the choice.2 Our methodology could be applied in other situations in which consumer demand
depends the characteristics of other consumers, and consumer characertitics are correlated with
location, and sampling is choice based because of the costs of a random sample.
       The second stage is to estimate the extent of peer eects on high school graduation. We start
with the standard procedure of regressing high school xed eects for the outcome on observed
student body characteristics and address a number of econometric issues. The most dicult is
accounting for the eects of the voucher on unobserved peer characteristics. For example, the
usual school level parental background measures, such as average family income and average
parental education are only crude measures of the resources that parents provide to their chil-
dren. Roughly speaking, we use the school choice model to infer the mean for each high school
of the index of unobserved student characteristics that determine school choice. Observed and
unobserved characteristics that inuence school choice need not be the only student charac-
teristics that inuence peer outcomes, but, as we show below, student characteristics inuence
the cream skimming eect only to the extent that they are related to school choice. In one
case, we calculate the cream skimming eect under a range of assumptions about the relative
size of the eect on school outcomes of the school averages of unobserved and observed student
body characteristics inuence school choice. Our method of handling unobserved characteristics
might be useful in other contexts.
       In the nal stage, we use our estimates of the peer eects models and estimates of the shift in
both the observed and unobserved characteristics of the peers of students who remain in public
school to estimate the eect of the voucher program on the high school graduation rate of the
public school stayers. We report results for a number of dierent model specications and also
investigate voucher programs that are targeted to low income families, low income schools, low
achieving schools, and urban areas. Overall, our results are robust and indicate that a large scale
   2The problem is simpler if information is available for all students about the student body of the public high
school option. We do not know of a US data set that is nationally representative and provides such information.

                                                       3
voucher program would have small eects on the high school graduation probabilities of those
who remain in public school. One might expect the cream skimming problem to be even less
severe in other choice programs such as charter schools given the available evidence on selection
into charter schools. If this is the case we would conclude that the magnitude of this eect is
likely very small in those cases as well.
   We do not know of another study that is directly comparable to ours, but the literature on
voucher programs in the US and elsewhere provides some evidence about who would take up
vouchers. Howell and Peterson (2002) examine several programs targeted to low income students
and conclude the the degree of positive selection in such programs is relatively small. There are
no universal voucher programs to study in the U.S., but Hsieh and Urquiola (2002) nd that
Chile's universal voucher program induced higher income and higher ability children to move to
private sector schools. Ladd (2002) nds that selection in New Zealand's choice program worked
in a direction similar to the Chilean program and that the expansion of choice in that country
exacerbated the problems of the schools at the bottom of the distribution and the reduced
the ability of those schools to provide an adequate education. Given that the composition of
charter schools is heavily inuenced by the specic areas in which they were introduced and
the missions of the schools, one cannot easily draw conclusions about a universal or a targeted
voucher program from aggregate statistics on the composition of charter schools. Nevertheless,
there is little indication that charter schools lead to a large exodus of the most advantaged
children from regular public schools, particularly when compared to private schools. 3
   Our work is also related to a few papers on the general equilibrium eects of voucher pro-
grams with peer eects, including Manski (1992), Epple and Romano (1998, 2002, 2003), Epple,
Newlon, and Romano (2002), and Caucutt (2002). Simulations of calibrated versions of the
models usually show cream skimming, although the magnitude varies with the details of the
model specication and assumed parameter values. Nechyba (1999, 2000, 2003) shows that mi-
gration can have a countervailing eect on low income households who remain in public school.
To our knowledge, the only paper that explicitly estimates and simulates the extent of peer
group eects with vouchers is Ferreyra (2007). She estimates her model using school district
data from several large metropolitan areas. She then simulates the eects of vouchers.
   Ferreyra (2007) does not use data on school quality, but infers the production function for
it based on location and schooling decisions. This is an important limitation because peer
characteristics could inuence school and location choices for a number of reasons, including:
a) the possibility that they aect school outcomes and parents care about the school outcomes,
b) the possibility that parent's care about outcomes and think that peer eects are important
even though they may not be and c) the possibility that parents care about peer quality per se.

In contrast, we are the rst to directly estimate the eects of peers on particular outcomes and

then simulate the eects of cream skimming on these outcome for public school students. Our

analysis is complementary with the general equilibrium papers.

      The paper continues in Section 2, where we present our school choice model, dene the

cream skimming parameter, and derive the key equation that determines the eect. In section

3 we discuss estimation in situations in which peer eects depend only on observed variables.

Sections 4 and 5 we discuss the NELS:88 data and provide descriptive statistics.                        In Section

6 we briey discuss the estimates of our basic school choice model, estimates of the eects of

student characteristics and peer characteristics on high school graduation, and estimate the

cream skimming eect. In Section 7 we allow peer characteristics to aect school choice and in

Section 8 we allow for unobserved school characteristics that inuence choice and for unobserved

peer characteristics. Sections 9 and 10 consider additional alternative assumptions about peer

eects and about school choice. We conclude in Section 11.



2 A Model of School Choice and Outcomes and a Denition
  of the Cream Skimming Eect
In this section, we begin by presenting the basic model for school choice and classmate eects

on school outcomes that underlies our analysis of the eects of school choice on students who

remain in their original school. We then dene our parameter of interestthe cream skimming

eectand analyze the factors that determine it.



2.1 School Choice
Let   S   be the set of all public schools in the country. Each student             i   is assigned to a particular

school district and denote the public school in that district as             Si .   School choice programs are

indexed by     œÑ.   This could represent a program dictating a certain level of a voucher or entry of

a particular class of charter schools. The indicator variable             PiœÑ = 1   if the student chooses their

default public school and       0   if the student chooses an alternative school under program               œÑ.   In
                      œÑ
general, the choice Pi depends         œÑ   both through direct eect of the program on the student and

through the eect of the program on the choices of other students. For most of the empirical

results in the paper, we focus on a universal voucher program that provides the same voucher

amount to all students. We denote the status quo as                œÑ =0     and the corresponding choice as

Pi0 . When we use the expression           PiœÑ   =1   as a conditioning argument, we are conditioning on           i
choosing public school when the school choice program is             œÑ.   The conditioning argument        Pi0 = 1
means that     i   chose a public school in the status quo (and this variable will be observable in the

data set).



                                                           5
    Let V (Xi‚àó , Si , œÑ ) be the dierence in the utility of attending public school Si under choice
program œÑ and the utility of the best alternative school option given i s location, where Xi‚àó is
a vector that includes all variables, both observed and unobserved, that inuence the relative
utility of private school. Thus PiœÑ is determined by

(1)                                         PiœÑ = 1(V (Xi‚àó , Si , œÑ ) > 0).

Note that the function V allows school choice to depend on the specic school Si . This depen-
dence may arise through xed school characteristics that would not be altered by œÑ , as well as
through peer eects that would be altered.

2.2 School Outcomes, School Quality, and Peer Eects
Let Yi (œÑ ) be an outcome that individual i would achieve if he or she attended Si under choice
program œÑ. Examples of outcomes are test scores, high school completion, college attendance,
and earnings. Yi (œÑ ) is determined by

(2)                                       Yi (œÑ ) = Xi Œ≥ + Œ∏ (Si , œÑ ) + Œµi ,

where Œ∏ (Si , œÑ ) is a school quality component that is common to all individuals who attend Si ,
Xi is a vector of observed characteristics of i that inuence the outcome and Œµi is an index of
unobservable individual factors that is uncorrelated with Xi and Œ∏ (Si , œÑ ). The school eect
Œ∏ (Si , œÑ ) depends on œÑ through peer eects that change as dierent students attend public school.
Note that (2) rules out interactions between Xi and , which could be added.
    For any public school s ‚àà S and any voucher program œÑ, peer eects are a function of the
vector
                                       Z (s, œÑ ) = E(Zi | Si = s, PiœÑ = 1),

where Zi is the vector of observed and unobserved student characteristics that inuence other
students and Z (s, œÑ ) is the average of Zi for students who choose Si given the voucher program
œÑ. An important special case is Zi = Xi .
    Without much loss of generality given that Zi may include known nonlinear functions, we
assume that the school xed-eect can be expressed as

(3)                                     Œ∏(s, œÑ ) = Z(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ + Qs BQ + Œæs ,

where the observed variables Qs and the error component Œæs capture other determinants of
school quality that are not inuenced by the voucher, such as the characteristics of the building,
the principal, and the teachers. 4
  4   We use the term peer eects to refer to the inuence of the average values in a school of a variety of student
                                                           6
2.3 The Cream Skimming Eect œÄ p (œÑ )
For individual i we dene the treatment eect of vouchers conditional on staying in public school
as
                    œÄi (œÑ ) ‚â° Yi (œÑ ) ‚àí Yi (0) = Œ∏ (Si , œÑ ) ‚àí Œ∏ (Si , 0) = [ZÃÑ(Si , œÑ ) ‚àí Z (Si , 0)] Œ¥.

Our parameter of interest is the average value of this cream skimming eect for public school
stayers under a school choice program:
                                                     
(4)           œÄ p (œÑ ) ‚â° E œÄi (œÑ ) | PiœÑ = 1, Pi0 = 1
                                                                                
                       = E Z(Si , œÑ ) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 ‚àí E Z (Si , 0) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 Œ¥.
                                                                                                                        
Thus we need to identify Œ¥, E Z(Si , œÑ ) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 , and E Z (Si , 0) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 to iden-
tify the cream skimming eect. So far we have not made assumptions about what is observable
to the econometrician.
     We now derive the formula for œÄp (œÑ ) that underlies our empirical investigation. The term
                           
E Z (Si , 0) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 involves PiœÑ , which is not observed. However, Pi0 is observed, and so
we can condition on Pi0 = 1, the set of people currently in public school. Dene œái ‚â° {Xi‚àó , Zi , Si }.
Letting G represent a generic distribution, we can write
                                                                             
                                                                                                              
                      E Z (Si , 0) | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 =                             Z (Si , 0) dG œái | PiœÑ = Pi0 = 1 .

body characteristics that are determined prior to high school. These include parental education and income,
race, gender, and performance in lower grades. We are side stepping the reection problem discussed by Manski
(1993). It does not matter for our simulations whether peer eects operate through covariates or outcomes. One
can interpret Œ¥ in (3) as the reduced form coecients of a model with reection. The reduced form is all that is
needed.

                                                                                 7
       Using the above two equations and (4), we can write œÄp(œÑ ) as

(5)                           œÄ p (œÑ ) = E(œài (œÑ )[Z (Si , œÑ ) ‚àí Z (Si , 0)] Œ¥|Pi0 = 1).

    The cream skimming formula simplies further if the gain from choosing the default school,
V (Xi‚àó , Si , œÑ ), is monotone in œÑ , so that no student chooses to attend the default school under the
proposed choice policy if they would not under the status quo. (That is under monontonicity,
if Pi0 = 0 then PiœÑ = 0). This is a very natural assumption in the case expansion of charter
schools or introduction of a voucher program although it would not make sense for an expansion
of choices within public schools. 5
    Under monotonicity, using the law of iterated expectations,
                                                       
E Z (Si , œÑ ) | PiœÑ = 1, Pi0 = 1 = E Z (Si , œÑ ) | PiœÑ = 1 = E(E (Zj | Sj = Si , PiœÑ = 1) |PiœÑ = 1)
                                                                           
                                  = E (Zi | PiœÑ = 1) = E œài (œÑ )Zi | Pi0 = 1 .

       Consequently, under monotonicity, (5) reduces to 6

(6)                             œÄ p (œÑ ) = cov(œài (œÑ ), [Zi ‚àí Z (Si , 0)] Œ¥|Pi0 = 1).

    Equation (6) shows that the cream skimming eect œÄp (œÑ ) is the covariance between œài(œÑ )
and [Zi ‚àí Z (Si, 0)]Œ¥. It easy to see that œÄp (œÑ ) depends on three factors. The rst is the extent
and the nature of the variation in œài(œÑ ) If œài(œÑ ) does not vary across i, then students who
move in response to œÑ are more or less a random sample and the characteristics of the peers of
students who remain in public school do not change. If œài(œÑ ) does vary but is unrelated to Zi,
there would be no cream skimming and the cream skimming eect would be 0. By the same
token, œÄp (œÑ ) is more negative the greater degree to which œài(œÑ ) declines with characteristics
that benet other students (i.e, characteristics that increase [Zi ‚àí Z (Si, 0)]Œ¥).
    The second determinant of œÄp(œÑ ) is the extent of heterogeneity in peer characteristics within
a school. œÄp (œÑ ) will be zero if there is no heterogeneity in Zi within a school (eg., parental
background is identical). In this case Zi ‚àí Z (Si, 0) would zero for all i and once again the
treatment eect would be identically zero. The more heterogeneity within a school, the more
negative the cream skimming eect could potentially be. Components of Zi matter for the
cream skimming eect only to the extent that they are correlated with œài(œÑ ). This provides an
   5 While we estimate some models in which montonicity does not have to hold, in every case we present below
it does hold. The simplied version of (5) eases interpretation of the empirical work.
    Getting from the
                     expectation to the covariance uses the additional fact that E(Z | P = 1) =
   6                                                                                             0

below.


      The third determinant is the magnitude of the peer eect coecients                                       Œ¥ . œÄ p (œÑ )      will be


identically zero if there are no peer group eects                        (Œ¥ = 0). More generally, the more peers matter
for school outcomes, the more important the cream skimming eect will be (assuming that


better and more advantaged students from a given school are more likely to move).


      Thus one can see the importance of all three factors. The cream skimming eect will be 0


if   any   of the three channels are 0, not just if                 all   three are 0.        By the same logic, to get a large


value of        œÄ p (œÑ )   all of the channels must be sizeable.                     We obtain small values for            œÄ p (œÑ )   below


because of the combination of factors, not a single one.                               When one plugs reasonable estimates


of the three channels into the formula, small estimates of                              œÄ p (œÑ )   come out.




3 Estimating the Cream Skim Eect
In the next subsections we present the econometric model of school choice that we use to


estimate        œài (œÑ ),   discuss estimation of the school outcome model (2)-(3), and then discuss the


construction of            œÄÃÇ p (œÑ ).   In formula (6) note that      œài (œÑ ) is the only parameter that depends on the
particular choice program. The dierence                        [Zi ‚àí Z (Si , 0)]      is just raw data that can be observed


(or approximated) directly. The peer eect parameter                            Œ¥ is dicult to estimate, but there is much
previous work on this. Thus the novel and challenging aspect of estimating                                     œÄ p (œÑ )   is estimation


of   œài (œÑ ).   If one were to investigate the cream skimming eect of a charter school program or


other types of school choice, one could use estimate                             œài (œÑ )   for that program and then plug it

            7
into (6).         In this paper, we consider the voucher case using observational data on how people


select into private school to understand how people might react to dierent types of voucher


programs.          We focus on a model in which students either remain in public school or attend a


private school.




3.1 An Econometric Model of Public School Attendance
In our baseline case, we estimate                  œài (œÑ ) from a probit model of public school attendance.                     Partition


Xi‚àó   as   {Xi , ui },where Xi            is a vector of observed characteristics and the scalar                  ui   is an index of


unobserved characteristics that inuence the attractiveness of the public school                                          Si   relative to


private schools.            ui   is assumed to be independent of                Xi .   We assume that the utility gain from


attending public school                  Si   under voucher program         œÑ   is



(7)                                       V (Xi‚àó , Si , œÑ ) = Xi Œ≤ + œïZÃÑ(Si , œÑ ) Œ¥ ‚àí ti (œÑ ) + ui
   7 Note that without monotonicity that is no longer true. One would have to use the model to simulate ZÃÑ(S , œÑ )
                                                                                                            i
as well, and then apply (5).

                                                                      9
where ti(œÑ ) is the voucher that individual i is eligible for under voucher program œÑ . Note that
we are implicitly assuming that the voucher aects choices only through the direct eect and
                                           
through the public school peers ZÃÑ(Si, œÑ )Œ¥ , not by changing the characteristics of the private
schools options available to i.8
   The decision rule of student i facing voucher program œÑ boils down to
(8)                            PiœÑ = 1(Xi Œ≤ + œïZÃÑ(Si , œÑ )Œ¥ ‚àí ti (œÑ ) + ui > 0)

    Because we do not have data on ti, we normalize var(ui) = 1. This implicitly denes the
scale of ti such that a unit change in ti has the same eect on school choice as a one standard
deviation change in the ui. We do not need to know the price elasticity of demand for private
schools.9 We instead dene the size of the voucher in terms of the number of people induced
to attend private school by the voucher. For our base case we choose œÑ so that ti(œÑ ) = t induces
10% of public school students to move.
    If ui is N (0, 1) then

                          Pr(PiœÑ = 1, Xi , Si ) = Œ¶(Xi Œ≤ + œïZÃÑ(Si , œÑ ) Œ¥ ‚àí ti (œÑ )),

where Œ¶ is the standard normal CDF. The ratio œài(œÑ ) of the probability that i will stay in public
school if a voucher œÑ is introduced relative to the probability that the student is in public school
under that status quo in which œÑ is 0 may be written as
                                                                                      
                                                     Œ¶(Xi Œ≤+œïZÃÑ(Si ,œÑ ) Œ¥‚àíti (œÑ ))
                                                       Œ¶(Xi Œ≤‚àíœïZÃÑ(Si ,0) Œ¥)
(9)                          œài (œÑ ) =    Œ¶(Xi Œ≤+œïZÃÑ(Si ,œÑ ) Œ¥‚àíti (œÑ ))
                                                                                                  .
                                            Œ¶(Xi Œ≤‚àíœïZÃÑ(Si ,0) Œ¥)
                                                                          dG(œái |Pi0       = 1)

    We construct œàÃÇi(œÑ ) using many dierent versions of the school choice model. In our base
case specication, we ignore feedback eects of peers on school choice, and assume that œï = 0.
In this case, our estimator is
   8 Our assumption is consistent with an expansion of the private school sector to accommodate increased
demand provided that attributes that inuence choice do not change. We are assuming that any feedback from
voucher induced changes in the peer characteristics of public and private schools to school choice is of a second
order of importance. One can accommodate the likely possibility that average distance from private schools
would decrease in the wake of a large scale voucher program, with an eect on the demand for private schools.
To do so, one could redene ti (œÑ ) = t to be an index capturing both the eect of the tuition subsidy and of
a uniform reduction in distance resulting from the private school expansion. In some sense, the reduction in
distance associated with private school entry acts as a multiplier on the eect of a voucher on demand for private
school. In practice however, one might expect the size of the distance reduction to depend on the existing stock
of private schools and to vary across households depending on precisely where they live. One could model this
but we have not done so.
   9 Dynarski, Gruber and Li (2008) use tuition discounts for number of children to estimate the price elasticity
of demand for Catholic primary schools. Their results suggest that lower SES families are more responsive to
the tuition. This would suggest that our estimates are an over-estimate of the cream skimming eect.

where    N p0   is the number of sample members in public school.

      In one set of cases we relax the assumption that peer eects have a negligible eect on the

public school decision by freely estimating             œï at a major cost in terms of computational complex-
ity. In another case, we disaggregate Catholic and non-Catholic private schools using a nested

logit specication. 10 We also experiment with alternative assumptions about unobservables. In

our base case we assume that there are no unobservable peer eects and no xed unobservables

common to students assigned to            Si = s     that inuence school choice. Relaxing this assumption

is very dicult, as we discuss in Section 8 and Appendix 3, but has little eect on our basic

ndings.


3.2 Estimation of the School Outcome Parameters
We estimate the coecient vector           Œ≥    from (2) by OLS regression of                Yi (0) on Xi      with public school

xed eects. Although the estimates of              Œ≥ are not our main focus, bias in the estimator for Œ≥ could
spill over into bias in the estimation of the link between                        Œ∏(s, œÑ )   and   ZÃÑ(s, œÑ ).       Consequently, a

discussion is in order even though we do not have a way to address the issue. First, measurement

error is likely to lead to underestimation of                Œ≥   (in absolute value) and bias                  Œ¥ÃÇ   in the opposite

direction to the extent that school level averages are less aected by measurement error and a

substantial component of the true variation in                   Xi    is across school. This is likely to lead to an

overestimate of the importance for high school performance of the average level of eighth grade

test scores (which have a random component to them), parental education, income, etc. Second,

within school variation in omitted factors that inuence education outcomes and income and

are correlated with the within school variation in                     Xi    will also inuence         Œ≥ÃÇ .   The eect of this

latter source of bias on     Œ¥ÃÇ   is harder to determine.


3.2.1      Estimation of the School Quality Parameter Œ¥

In our base case, we assume that all elements of                      Zi    are observed. Because we only observe a

sample of students from each public school and thus only observe                               Z (Si , 0)      with error, we use

the JIVE estimator discussed in Devereux (2005) to estimate                            Œ¥.    Specically, one may rewrite

(3) as


(11)                                      Œ∏ÃÇ(Si , 0) = Zi Œ¥ + QSi BQ + ŒµŒ∏i
 10   The parameters of a trinomial probit are poorly identied in our data.

                                                             11
where Œ∏ÃÇ(Si, 0) is the estimate of the school xed eect for the school Si attended by person i and
the error term ŒµŒ∏i = [Z (Si, 0) ‚àí Zi]Œ¥ + Œæs + [Œ∏ÃÇ (Si, 0) ‚àí Œ∏ (Si, 0)]. We estimate Œ¥ and BQ by IV
regression. The instruments are QS and the  i left out means Z S consisting of the average
                                        i                                   ‚àíi

value of Z for sample members who attended is public school Si, with i excluded.11
    There are several sources of bias in Œ¥ÃÇ. Advantaged students tend to go to better schools,
suggesting a positive correlation between elements of Z S representing high socioeconomic sta-
                                                                 ‚àíi

tus and Œ∏i (through Œæs). This would lead the estimates of Œ¥ to be biased upward (away from
zero). We have already noted that bias in the Œ≥ estimates could spill over into Œ¥, but the sign
is ambiguous. The fact that some high schools have more than one feeder school will bias our
estimates of Œ¥ to the extent that the mean of Zi varies across feeder schools for a given high
school if the sample is not representative of the mix of students from the various feeder schools.
In practice, we usually only have students from one feeder school. In this situation, the compo-
nent [Z(Si, 0) ‚àí Zi] will be negatively correlated with Z S , the sample average in the high school.
This eect biases the estimate of Œ¥ downward. On the other hand, these students were peers
during eighth grade as well. Since Œ¥ is dened to be the eect of high school peers, Œ¥ will be
biased upward to the extent that eighth grade peer eects continue to matter for high school.
Bias in Œ¥ will bias the magnitude of œÄp(œÑ ) in the same direction. We suspect that the net eect
of the various biases in Œ¥ is positive, which would mean that our estimates can be viewed as
upper bounds for how large the treatment eect could be. However, we also experiment with
alternative values of Œ¥.
    As it turns out, when Œ¥ is unrestricted,Œ¥ is poorly determined in the sample because there is
substantial collinearity among the Z S . Consequently, we focus on models that impose index
                                            ‚àíi

restrictions on Z(s, œÑ )Œ¥. The rst is
(12)                                Z(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ = c + Œ¥X  Œ≤ X(s, œÑ ) Œ≤.

The above equation states that up to a factor of proportionality peer eects depend on average
student characteristics in the same way that the school choice does. Even if this restriction is
false, the fact that the cream skimming eect of the voucher has to work through XiŒ≤ + ti(œÑ )
implies that one can think of (12) as a reduced form that is a rst order approximation to
Z(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ .
    The second and perhaps more natural assumption is that
(13)                                  Z(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ = Œ¥X  Œ≥ X(s, œÑ ) Œ≥.

The restriction states that up to a factor of proportionality, peer eects depend on the school
mean of Xi in the same way the outcome Yi depends on Xi.
  11Because we must deal with sampling error in our measures of peer characteristics, the use of nonlinear
alternatives to the linear probability model with xed eects would greatly complicate that analysis.

4 Data
NELS:88 is a National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) survey that began in the Spring
of 1988. A total of 1032 schools contributed as many as 26 eighth grade students to the base
year survey, resulting in 24,599 eighth graders participating. Subsamples of these individuals13

were reinterviewed in 1990, 1992, 1994 and 2000. The NCES only attempted to contact 20,062
base-year respondents in the rst and second follow-ups, and only 14,041 in the 1994 survey.
Additional observations are lost due to attrition. A subsample consisting of 15,623 individuals
were re-interviewed in 2000, when most respondents were 26 years old. We use information on
income from this wave. Our analysis is based primarily on the restricted use version of NELS:88,
to which we have merged characteristics of the geographic area and school district.
    Parent, student, and teacher surveys in the base year provide information on family and
individual background and as well as a very rich set of pre-high school achievement and behav-
iors. Each student was also administered a series of cognitive tests in the 1988, 1990, and 1992
 12 We leave Z out because random variation in Z across students from the same high school makes the
correlation between Z and the mean including Z stronger than the correlation between Z and ZÃÑ(P , 0).

surveys to ascertain aptitude and achievement in math, science, reading, and history. We use

the behavior measures and 8th grade test scores as person specic control variables and peer

measures. They have the advantage of being determined prior to high school.

       Our main outcome measure is high school graduation (HS i ).             HSi   is one if the respondent

graduated high school by the date of the 1994 survey, and zero otherwise. The school choice

variables   Pi , CHi , N Ci   are mutually exclusive indicators for whether the current or last school

in which the individual was enrolled as of 1990 (two years after the eighth grade year) was a pub-

lic high school, and Catholic high school, or a non-Catholic private high school, respectively. 14

Unless noted otherwise, the results in the paper are weighted. 15               Denitions of variables are

provided in Appendix 1. In the empirical analysis missing values for key explanatory variables

are replaced by their respective unweighted average values and we include missing value dum-

mies in the school choice and outcome models for a few variables as indicated in the tables. 16

Observations with missing values of the school ID or the school type are dropped. The school

choice sample contains 16,483 observations, of whom 14,193 chose a public high school, 1,354

chose a Catholic school, and 936 chose a non-Catholic private school.

       Because of the complexity of the estimator of         œÄ p (œÑ )   and its components, we use a block

bootstrap method to compute standard errors, condence intervals, and bias corrections for

most of the parameters. The blocks allow for correlation in the error terms among students

who attend the same eighth grade and among the students who attend the same high school.

The blocks consist of students from each set of eighth grades who sent at least one student to a

common high school. See the Appendix 1 for more detail. The distribution of                   Ns ,   the number

of sample members in each high school, is concentrated between 6 and 18 observations in our

eective sample.
  14 A student who started in a private high school and transferred to a public school prior to the tenth grade
survey would be coded as attending a public high school ( P = 0). In the case of Catholic schools Altonji, Elder
and Taber (2003) present evidence that is a minor issue.
  15 The sampling scheme in the NELS:88 is complicated. See the NELS Base Year Sample Design Report and the
National Education Longitudinal Study: 1988-1994 Methodology Report for details. The weights depend in part
on school choice and on outcomes, so it is important to weight. We use the 3rd follow-up panel weights (f3pnlwt)
for all analyses involving high school graduation. For the school choice models we use the rst follow-up panel
weights (f1pnlwt). Weighting is particularly tricky when peer eects and/or unobserved school characteristics
inuence school choice, because the appropriate weights depend upon the behavior of the group NELS:88 eighth
graders who are assigned to a particular public high school. We discuss the issues in Appendix 2 and 3,
respectively, but do not provide a full solution.
  16 After the paper was essentially complete, we discovered a coding error in the Lack of eort index that we
used in the analysis. This has little eect on the estimates of the choice and outcome equations and will be xed
in a later version. The descriptive statistics are for the correctly coded variable.

5 Descriptive Statistics
5.1 Student Outcome and Characteristics
Table 1 presents weighted means and standard deviations for the variables we use in the analysis,
with imputed values excluded. The main point to be made from the table is that children who
attend either Catholic high school or other private high schools are advantaged relative to
students in public schools. For example, they come from families with substantially higher
incomes, have better educated parents, are more likely to have both father and mother present,
and have higher 8th grade achievement scores. They also have a 0.63 advantage in log income
(10.84 versus 10.21). Using the estimates of the standard deviation of the school specic and
student specic components of log family income (not reported) one may calculate that the
income gap of 0.63 is equal to a 1.466 standard deviation (unweighted) shift in the component
of parental income that varies across public high schools and to a 0.7037 standard deviation
shift in the student specic component of family income. The gap in eighth grade math scores
between private high school students and public high school students is 0.39 standard deviations.
The gap amounts to 0.896 of standard deviation of the public high school specic component of
this variable.
    Table 1 also shows that private high school students tend to look stronger on a number of
measures of 8th grade behavior. For example, they score lower on an index of delinquency, are
less likely to have gotten into ghts with other students, and are less likely to have behavior
problems. The fraction of students who rarely complete homework is lower, they are much less
likely to have repeated at least one grade between 4th and 8th grade, and they score much lower
on a composite measure of the risk of dropping out. The large gap between private high school
student and public school students on a broad range of observed characteristics that are relevant
for school achievement is part of the cause for concern that vouchers will lead more advantaged
students to leave public schools.
    Turning to outcomes, students who attend private high schools are much more likely to
graduate from high school than public high school students (0.942 versus 0.863) and more likely
to be attending a four year college two years after the normal high school graduation year (0.584
versus 0.297).

6 Results for the Basic Model
In this section we present cream skimming estimates for our baseline specication. In this
case, we exclude peer eects (œï = 0) and unobserved school district specic attributes from
the school choice model (8). We also assume that only observed peer characteristics matter

                                               15
for school quality.   We begin with a discussion of the school choice estimates and the eects

of a student's own characteristics on outcomes.             We then turn to the eects of student body

characteristics on outcomes. Finally, we present estimates of the eects of a voucher program

on the characteristics of those who remain in public school as well as estimates of                     œÄ p (œÑ ).

6.1 Estimates of the Basic School Choice Model
Appendix Table A1 presents MLE-probit estimates of                Œ≤   for the basic school choice model (1)

for the full sample. The dependent variable         Pi0   is one if the student attended public school and

zero if the student attended a private high school.

   We have chosen a rich set of regressors rather than a parsimonious specication to ensure that

our estimates of peer eects are not contaminated by failure to control for the direct eects of a

student's own characteristics and to ensure that the indices            Xi Œ≤   and   Xi Œ≥   are strong predictors

of preference for public school and of high school graduation.                In addition to         Catholic, which
is 1 if the parents are Catholic, the equation contains gender, and race/ethnicity dummies,

region dummies, and urban and suburban dummies.                   It also contains multiple measures of

parental background (both parents present, father's education, mother's education, and log

income), multiple measures of aptitude and achievement, including grades and 8th grade reading,

math, science and history tests, and multiple behavioral and student performance measures.

Consequently, individual variables are hard to interpret and most are statistically insignicant,

although the variables are collectively highly signicant and the pseudo                   R2   of the model is 0.22

   A few results are worth highlighting.           Students with better-educated mothers and fathers

are less likely to attend public school. Parental income is negative and signicant. The eects

are not large however. A four year increase in both father's education and mother's education

accompanied by an increase in log family income of 0.4 would lead to a decline in the public school

probability of about 0.084. Of course, these estimates hold the cognitive and behavior measures

constant.   Reading enters with a statistically signcant negative coecient but coecients on

the other tests vary in sign and are not signicant.            All the behavioral measures that have a

statistically signicant negative association with high school graduation are positively associated

with public school attendance, although typically not statistically signicant. Students in urban

areas are much less likely to attend public school. The same is true of suburban students. These

results are probably inuenced by the fact that private schools, particularly Catholic schools,

are concentrated in urban and suburban areas.

   Given the prevalence of Catholic high schools, the large negative coecient on                     Catholic is not
surprising. Because religious preference has very special role in the decision to attend a Catholic

high school,   Catholic   is set to   0   when we evaluate the indices       Xi Œ≤   and   Xi Œ≥   for the purpose of

imposing index restrictions on the peer eect parameters                Œ¥.   Under a voucher program, the



                                                       16
fraction of private high schools that are Catholic would probably decline.

     In results that are available from the authors on request, the marginal eects derivatives are

typically higher for the urban subsample than the full sample, often by a factor of two or three.

This is not surprising as families with high socioeconomic characteristics who live in the suburbs

are more likely to send their children to public schools.



6.2 The Eect of a Student's Own Characteristics on High School
    Graduation
Appendix Table A2 presents estimates of                 Œ≥,   the eect of student's own characteristics on high

school graduation, holding high school characteristics common to all students constant. Estima-

tion is based on the public high school sample. The estimates are the coecients from a linear

probability model with high school xed eects included. Block bootstrap condence intervals

are included in parentheses. We are well aware of the limitations of the linear probability model

with xed eects, but xed eects probit or logit estimators are unattractive for a variety of

reasons.

     Because we work with a very rich model, the estimates for specic family background vari-

ables, 8th grade test score and achievement measures, and behavioral measures are hard to

interpret and are not of central interest for our study.                    The results for most of the variables

are consistent with the literature.                We obtain positive coecients on father's education and

family income and they are signicant. Not surprisingly, the math test score enters positively.

The positive coecient on Black is consistent with other studies of educational attainment that

control for test scores and family background.                      The graduation probability is 0.148 lower for

students who repeat a grade, 0.167 lower for students who are frequently absent, and .091 lower

for students who rarely complete homework.



6.3 Eects of Student Body Characteristics on Outcomes
In Table 2 we report JIVE estimates of the eects of student body characteristics on outcomes

with the restrictions (12) or (13) imposed on (11).                      The table reports   Œ¥ÃÇX  Œ≤   and       Œ¥ÃÇX  Œ≥ .   95%

condence intervals are in parentheses. These are based upon 1000 bootstrap replications. The

vector    QS      consists of the region indicators, urban and suburban indicators, and a quadratic in

distance from a Catholic school (coecients not shown).

     When we impose the restriction (12) that                Œ¥ is proportional to Œ≤ , our estimate of the coecient
Œ¥X  Œ≤   on   XÃÑ  Œ≤ÃÇ   is -0.0453 with a condence interval from -0.095 to 0.003. To give some sense of

the magnitude, a change in the            X  Œ≤ÃÇ   of 0.3 would change the probability of attending a public

school by roughly ve percentage points. If we compare two high schools where                          XÃÑ  Œ≤ÃÇ   diered by

induce an increase in graduation of roughly                       0.3 √ó 0.0453 = 0.014          in the graduation probability.


If instead we impose the restriction (13),                   Œ¥ÃÇX  Œ≥   is 0.36.      Given that   X(s, œÑ ) Œ≥ÃÇ   and   Y   are in the


same units, the point estimate says that the contribution of an increase in                                 Xi Œ≥ÃÇ   equal to    ŒîXi Œ≥ÃÇ
for student   i in a high school to the graduation rate of that high school is the sum of ŒîXi Œ≥ ,                                   the


direct eect of   XÃÑi Œ≥ÃÇ     on   i   plus   0.36ŒîXi Œ≥ .   Consequently the fraction             0.265 = 0.36/(0.36 + 1)               of


the eect of   Xi Œ≥ÃÇ   on the graduation rate for a given high school operates through peer eects.


This is a substantial externality. The estimate of                        Œ¥ÃÇX  Œ≥   is statistically distinct from zero, but the


the 95% condence interval is fairly wide: (0.029, 0.617).




6.4 The Eects of the Voucher Program on the Characteristics of Who
    Attends Public School
We begin by comparing the mean characteristics of public school stayers and movers for our


base model and a universal voucher                    ti (œÑ ) = t.     For each bootstrap replication, the value of                  t   is


set to a level that is sucient to induce 10% of the public school students to switch to private


school.   This point estimate of               t   is 0.5356, which can be interpreted as equivalent to a 0.5356


standard deviation change in the index of unobservables that determines school choice.


     Point estimates and 95% condence interval estimates of the means of selected elements of


Xi   are displayed for stayers and for movers in columns (1) and (2) of Table 3.                                       The results


show that the mean for movers is larger for two parents present, father's education, mother's


education, log income, and all four test scores. Note that the sign, relative size and statistical


signicance of the dierences between movers and stayers in the means of the elements of                                        Xi   are


only weakly related to the sign, size and signicance of the corresponding elements of                                     Œ≤ÃÇ   despite


the key role of   Œ≤ÃÇ    in determining the relative odds that an individual will remain in public school


in response to a voucher. For example, the mover-stayer dierence in means is 1.26 for father's


education and 0.94 for mother's education. The stayer-mover dierence for a particular variable


is aected by how it is correlated with other variables that inuence school choice.


     The fourth column of the table also reports the change in the average value of peer characteristics


the average value of          Z    of the peers of those who stay in public schools.                      This comes from the


formula
                                                    1  
                                                          œài (œÑ )(Zi ‚àí Z S‚àíi ).
                                                   NP 0 0
                                                       i, Pi =1

Given the values in the fourth column, all we need to do to obtain the overall treatment eect


is to multiply by        Œ¥.   The changes are small.              For example, there is little change in race/ethnic


composition of peers.              The prevalence of two-parent households drops by only -0.01.                             Father's


and mother's education drop by -0.07 and -0.05, respectively and the log of parental income


drops by -.025. The math test score declines by -0.12, which is only 0.012 standard deviations




                                                                     18
at the individual level. 17 Thus one can already see that it will take large peer group coecients
to lead to large overall cream skimming eect on outcomes.
    A good way to summarize change in composition is compare the values of Xi Œ≥ and Xi Œ≤ for
movers and stayers. The bottom panel of Table 3 presents the point estimates and the 95%
                                                                                                 
condence intervals for the school means of the indices Xi Œ≤ , XÃÑi Œ≤ Xi Œ≥ , and XÃÑi Œ≥ by mobility
group status. We exclude Catholic from Xi when computing Xi Œ≥ and Xi Œ≤ . Overall, the results
suggest that a universal voucher program of the magnitude that we consider is unlikely to have
a very large eect on the peers of the children who remain in public school. Consequently, unless
outcomes are very sensitive to peers, the voucher program is not likely to have a substantial
negative eect on how public school stayers do. However, in thinking about magnitudes one
needs to compare the impact on the stayers to the gain of the movers. Since only 10% of the
students move, the stayers are nine times more numerous than the movers. We will return to
this issue momentarily.

6.5 Base Case Estimates of the Cream Skimming Eect œÄ p (œÑ )
Table 4 presents a variety of estimates of the main parameter of interest the cream skimming
eect œÄ p (œÑ ). Row 1 presents results for the base cases, for which the school choice model is
column 1 of Table A1 and the estimates of Œ≥ are in Table A2. Keep in mind that the base
case assumes that there is no school specic component in the school choice error term and that
there is no peer interaction in the school choice model (œï = 0). It also assumes that peer eects
depend on observed characteristics only. We consider alternative cases below.
    In the column labeled  X  Œ≤ index we impose the restriction (12). The point estimate of
œÄ p (œÑ ) is -0.0011 and the condence interval is tight: -0.0017 to 0.0001. The lower bound estimate
implies a small negative eect on stayers. 18
    In the column labeled  X  Œ≥ Index we impose (13). The point estimate of the change in
the peer eect for stayers is -0.0013 and the lower bound to the condence interval is -0.0023. 19
To put these numbers in perspective, it is helpful compare the direct benets to students who
are induced to move to the harm for students who are left behind after weighting by the size
of the groups. Suppose that moving from public school to private school leads to an increase
  17 Not surprisingly, the means for movers of urban and suburban are larger than the means for stayers. In part,
this reects the fact that Catholic schools are much more prevalent in urban and suburban areas. Movers are
more likely to be in the Northeast and somewhat less likely to be in the South, North Central and West regions.
Movers also live closer to a Catholic school. Note that the change in peers for stayers for these variables reect
compositional shifts across schools. These variables are xed for a given school, of course.
 Note      that this eect can be calculated from numbers we discussed earlier. In particular œÄp (œÑ ) =

in the graduation rate by 0.06 for those who move.                       This estimate is in the range of what one


obtains using single equation methods based on NELS:88 and is in the range of the lower bound


estimates that Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005) obtain for Catholic high schools when they


address the problem of selection on unobservables. The voucher program induces 10% of public


school students to move, leaving 9 students in public school for everyone who moves. The point


estimate of -0.0013 for the         X Œ≥     index model implies that for each student who moves to private


school the overall graduation rate for students who were in public school prior to the voucher


rises by   0.06 ‚àí 0.0013 √ó 9 = 0.048.              The gain of        0.06   for each student who moves is partially


oset by a decline of 0.012 in the expected number of graduates among students who remain,


an oset of about 20% of the direct benet received by the child who switches to private school.


Using the lower bound estimate of -0.0023, the negative impact on the number of stayers who


graduates is 0.021 and the expected number of graduates among the pool of students who were


in public school rises by 0.039 for each student who take up the voucher.


    Although our focus is on high school graduation, during the process of our work we estimated


the cream skimming eect using the alternative outcomes college enrollment in 1994 and the


log of labor income in the year 2000 for full time workers. The estimates of                         œÄ p (œÑ )   are small for


these outcomes as well




7 Allowing School Choice to Depend on Peer Quality
In this section, we relax the assumption that the coecient                     œï on the peer quality index ZÃÑ(Si , œÑ )Œ¥
in the school choice model (8) is 0. Doing so dramatically complicates that analysis for a number


of reasons.   The most important is that                ZÃÑ S‚àíi   is not observed for students who do not attend


public school.    Consequently, it must be simulated as part of the model estimation procedure.


To the best of our knowledge, we are the rst to estimate a demand model in which the choice


of a consumer depends on characteristics of the other agents who choose it, and the relevant


agent characteristics are only observed for those who choose the good.                          Our approach requires


data on a set of observables at the district characteristic level,                   Ws ,   that shift the unconditional

                                                                                                20
distribution of   Xi Œ≤   and   Zi Œ≥ .    The latter variables inuence peer quality.


    Assume that



                                          Xi Œ≤ = Œº1s(i) + Œ∑i1 ; Xi Œ≥ = Œº2s(i) + Œ∑i2
  20 Bayer et al's (2007) model of housing and location demand is one of the few studies in which characteristics
of other agents inuence consumer choice. They have data on neighborhood characteristics for all consumers,
which simplies the analysis substantially. On the other hand, they consider location choice as well as housing
choice and solve for equilibrium house prices, while we do not. Their model and estimation methodology builds
on Berry et al (1994) and is very dierent from ours. Ferriera (2007) also estimates a model that allows for peers
to aect choices. The style of estimation is also very dierent from ours.


                                                                 20
where s(i) is the school and i is the individual. We will usually suppress the dependence of s
on i. Unconditionally, by which we mean prior to conditioning on the school choice decisions
of those assigned to s, (Œ∑i1, Œ∑i2) is dened to have mean 0 and is uncorrelated with (Œº1s , Œº2s ) . We
assume that Ws partially determines Œº1s and Œº2s through the equations
(18)                                               Œº1s = Ws Œ±1 + e1s
                                                   Œº2s = Ws Œ±2 + e2s ,

where (e1s , e2s ) is N (0, Œ£e ). Similarly we assume that (Œ∑i1, Œ∑i2) is N (0, Œ£Œ∑ ). Some but not all of the
elements of Ws may be part of Qs and aect school quality Œ∏(s, œÑ ) and/or have a direct eect
on school choice holding XiŒ≤ constant.
   We estimate versions of the model analogous to the two cases discussed above. The case
(13) assumes that eects of peers on school quality (Œ¥ ) are proportional to Œ≥ while the case (12)
assumes Œ¥ is proportional to Œ≤. To save space, we focus on the more complicated Œ≥ case in the
text, but describe both the Œ≥ and the Œ≤ case in Appendix 2. To simplify the expressions below
dene the conditional expectation
                                                                             

Throughout this section we consider universal vouchers, so ti(œÑ ) = t(œÑ ) for all i. Keep in mind
that we denote the absence of a voucher program as œÑ = 0, with ti(0) = 0.
   Using the above equations and normality we may write Œº2 (œÑ, Œº1s , Œº2s ) as

where   Œª    is the inverse Mill's ratio (œÜ(¬∑)/Œ¶(¬∑)). Since there is no closed form solution for
Œº2 (œÑ, Œº1s , Œº2s ), we have to solve for it numerically. Multiple equilibrium are possible because
the demand for public school depends on the choices of other students. Fortunately, we have
not found this to be a problem in practice.
    We can estimate the treatment eect using our formula above with
                                                                                                            

    The estimation procedure is complicated, and so we relegate the details to Appendix 1. Here
is a rough description. For the observed data, œÑ = 0 and t(0) = 0, taking values of (Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ£Œ∑ , Œ£e )
and Œº2 (0, Œº1s , Œº2s ) as given, we estimate Œ≤ and œï using the probit likelihood function for school
                                                                 21
choice and estimate Œ≥ from Eq. (2) using OLS. Given the estimates of Œ≤ , Œ≥, and œï, we use OLS
and (18) to estimate Œ±1 and Œ±2 . We then estimate Œ£Œ∑ and Œ£e from the likelihood function for
Xi Œ≤ and Xi Œ≥ treating Œ±1 , Œ±2 , Œ≤, and Œ≥ as known. Finally, taking Œ±1 , Œ±2 , Œ≤, œï, Œ£Œ∑ and Œ£e as given,
for each s we update Œº2 (œÑ, Œº1s , Œº2s ) as the xed point of (19). We iterate on this procedure until
we nd a xed point.
    The vector Ws consists of the average of the demographic characteristics for the zip code in
which an eighth grade is located. 21 The characteristics are based on the 1990 Census and consist
of percent black, percent Hispanic, an indicator for whether percent black is missing, median
income, the percent of the population below the poverty line, and percent of the population with
income more than double the poverty line. These variables explain an additional 11.96 percent
of the cross high school variance in Xi Œ≤ and 13.68 percent of the cross high school variance in
Xi Œ≥ conditional on other area characteristics that we control for, which include census region,
urbanicity and distance from the nearest Catholic high school. 22
    When (12) is imposed, œïÃÇ is -0.3695 and the coecients on the other variables in the choice
equation are similar to those for the base model in Appendix Table A1. This says that a 0.1
                                                              
increase in peer quality as measured by the index X Œ≤ governing the propensity to attend public
school lowers the probability of attending by about 37% as much as a 0.1 increase in Xi Œ≤ raises
it. As can be seen in Table 2, the estimate of the school quality coecient Œ¥X  Œ≤ is -0.0412, which
is very close to the estimate without œï. To give some sense of the magnitude, as in the base
model, a change in the XÃÑ  Œ≤ÃÇ of 0.3 would change the proability of attending a public school by
roughly ve percentage points. If we compare two high schools where the index diers by 0.3,
the peers at the high school with a lower propensity to attend public school would induce an
increase of roughly 0.3 √ó 0.0412 = 0.012 in the graduation probability.
    In the case of peer model Œ≥, œïÃÇ is 4.68 and Œ¥X  Œ≥ is 0.3614. œïÃÇ is signicant at the 10% level
but not the 5% level. 23 The estimates of œïÃÇ and Œ¥XÀÜ Œ≥ imply that the peer eect of a shift of
0.1 in XÃÑs Œ≥ÃÇ  raises the graduation rate by 0.036 and shifts the latent variable for public school
attendance by about the same amount as the combined eect of an additional four more years
of both mother's education and father's education. Of course, it is possible that peers aect
the demand for public schools through other aspects of preferences in addition to the academic
quality of the high school, as we mentioned earlier in our discussion of Ferreyra (2007). Note
  21 If public high school in NELS:88 receives sample members from NELS:88 eighth grades that are in dierent
zip codes, we assign the average of the census characteristics for the dierent zip codes to students from all of
eight grades. Our reasoning is that that the average will provide a better measure of the characteristics of the
public high school option.
  22 These estimates are unweighted and based on an analysis of variance estimator.      Catholic is excluded from
both indices.
  23 The 90% condence interval for this paramter is (0.2774,10.3294). The 90% condence interval for the  XÃÑ  Œ≤ 
includes zero. It is (-0.6116,0.0486).

also that a dierence across schools of 0.1 in XÃÑs Œ≥ÃÇ  would be associated with a dierence of 0.1
+ 0.036 in the graduate rate for the high school. Families may choose schools based on average
graduate rates rather than school quality per se.
       The point estimates of the cream skimming eect for the two specications are -0.0012 and
-0.0014, respectively (Panel 2 of Table 4). These values are very close to the base case results
with œï set to 0. We conclude that while peers play a role in school choice, they do not have much
inuence on the size of the cream skimming eect. 24 To provide intuition for this result, note
rst that our analysis already assumes that the students on the margin of attending are the most
likely to to be aected by a voucher. We have already shown that the students who leave are
advantaged relative to those who stay. The inuence of peers on demand serves as a multiplier
for the demand response to the voucher. This will inuence the fraction of students who move
as the result of a voucher of a given size. However, it does not change the mix of students
who move by very much. If one were to allow for interactions between peer characteristics and
student characteristics, then accounting for peers in the school choice model might make a bigger
dierence. We leave this extension to future research.
       Given that our basic results are not sensitive to allowing peer characteristics to inuence
school choice and given the complexity of allowing for them, we set œï to 0 in what follows.


8 Unobservable Peer Characteristics
In this section and in Appendix 3 we present a methodology for estimating the cream skimming
eect in the presence of both unobservable peer eects and unobservable school and community
characteristics that inuence school choice but do not depend on the voucher.
       Using notation analogous to Section 7, dene

                uÃÑ (s, œÑ ) = E (ui | Si = s, PiœÑ = 1) ;         Œµ (s, œÑ )=E(Œµi | Si = s, PiœÑ = 1)

where, as a reminder, ui is the error term in the selection equation (1), Œµi is the error term in the
outcome equation and u (s, œÑ ) and Œµ (s, œÑ ) are the means of ui and Œµi among students assigned
to school s who attend public school when the voucher program is œÑ . In what follows, partition
Zi into the observables Xi and an index of unobservables vi and write the peer eect as

                                    ZÃÑ(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ = X (s, œÑ ) Œ¥x + vÃÑ(s, œÑ )

where vÃÑ(s, œÑ ) = E(vi |Si = s, PiœÑ = 1). In the case of the Œ≤ restriction (12), vÃÑ(s, œÑ ) = 0 and
X (s, œÑ ) Œ¥x = Œ¥X  Œ≤ X (s, œÑ ) Œ≤ . A natural generalization of this model is to assume that peer

                                                                                              

eect on the outcome operates through X Œ≥ and a model in which the peer eect in the decision operates through

where uÃÑ(s, œÑ ) enters with the coecient gŒ¥X  Œ≤ .25 Analogously the natural extension of the peer
specication (13) is

Recall that ZÃÑ(s, œÑ ) Œ¥ represents the peer eect and so directly aects the output Œ∏.
       Conditional on Œ≤, which is identied from the school choice equation, g is identied under
our functional form assumptions. However, we do not rely on the functional form assumptions
and instead produce results for a range of values of g . The special case g = 1 corresponds to the
assumption that the unobservables are like observables in that in (20), the coecient relating
Œ∏ (s, œÑ ) to the school mean of the index of observed variables that determines school choice,
X (s, œÑ ) Œ≤, is the same as coecient on the school mean of the error in the choice equation,
u (s, œÑ ) . Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2003, 2005) provide a model that can be used to justify
g = 1 under some very strong assumptions. However, we do not impose only this value but
instead consider the cases g = .5, g = 1, and g = 1.5.
       To proceed, we rst must dene some new notation. As in the previous section, we decompose
Xi Œ≤ and Xi Œ≥, into

                                      Xi Œ≤ = Œº1s(i) + Œ∑i1 ; Xi Œ≥ = Œº2s(i) + Œ∑i2 ,

where s is the school level and i is the individual level. Analogously we decompose ui and Œµi
into

                                               1
                                         ui = vs(i) + œâi1 ; Œµi = vs(i)
                                                                  2
                                                                       + œâi2 .

We assume that (Œ∑i1 , Œ∑i2 ) and (œâi1 , œâi2 ) are both jointly normal. The terms (Œº1s , Œº2s ) may depend
on Ws through (18), in which case we assume further that (Ws Œ±1 , Ws Œ±2 ) is jointly normal.
However, we do not need to make use of the decomposition (18) and thus do not incorporate
Ws and estimation of Œ±1 and Œ±2 into the analysis.
       Let Œ£Œº , Œ£v , Œ£Œ∑ , and Œ£œâ be the variance covariance matrices of (Œº1s , Œº2s ) , (vs1 , vs2 ) , (Œ∑i1 , Œ∑i2 ) and
(œâi1 , œâi2 ) respectively. We use another observables are like the unobservables assumption which
states that there is a single scalar a such that
  25   Equation (20) imposes the restrictions Œ¥x = Œ¥X Œ≤ Œ≤ and vÃÑ(s, œÑ ) = gŒ¥X Œ≤ uÃÑ(s, œÑ ).

Since var(œâi2 ) does not play a role in the analysis, we do not need to restrict this parameter.
          The restrictions say that relative variances and the covariance of the unobservable cross
district components on school choice and the outcome are the same as those of the observable
components. The same is true of the student specic error components, with the exception of
var (œâi2 ) which is not relevant in our approach. Estimation of Œ£Œº and Œ£Œ∑ is analogous to the
endogenous peer quality model in the previous section and we discuss it in the appendix.
          First consider the model in which the peer eect depends on the expected value of Xi Œ≤ + gui
of public school peers. As in the previous section we will consider the change from no vouchers
(ti (0) = 0) to universal vouchers (ti (œÑ ) = t). The cream skimming eect of the new voucher
program on those who remain in a public school from a school district with characteristics Œº1s , vs1
is
                                                                      1                             
                                                    œÉŒ∑11 + gœÉœâ11     Œºs + vs1 ‚àí t          Œº1s + vs1

Note that term Œº1s +gvs1 drops out of the dierence in conditional expectations because Œº1s and vs1
are school district specic rather than student specic. Consequently, they are not aected by
the voucher. However, Œº1s and vs1 do inuence the set of students who choose public school both
before and after the voucher. 26
          When the peer eect is proportional to the expectation of Xi Œ≥ + gŒµi conditional on public
school attendance, the cream-skimming eect is
                                                1                             

          To use (22) or (23) to identify the cream skimming eects for the Œ≤ and Œ≥ specication of
peer eects, we have to address a new issue. We do not observe (Œº1s , vs1 ), which are arguments
of cream skimming eect functions. We solve this problem by using Bayes theorem to infer the
conditional distribution of (Œº1s , vs1 ) given the characteristics of the other students who choose the
     For example, unobservables such as the skill of a district in marketing the public high school, the safety of the
     26
neighborhood immediately surrounding the high school, the attractiveness of the buildings, the characteristics
of the local private school options, as well the district mean of unobserved family characteristics that inuence
school choice are all determinants of Œºs , the district average of ui . These are not directly inuenced by the
voucher, and our analysis takes this fact into account. However, the fact most of the elements of Xi are student
level might lead one to question the restriction unobservables are like the observables restriction. One could
explore sensitivity of the results to allowing the proportionality factor a to dier in the two restrictions, although
we have not done so.


                                                                        25
public school, with selection taken into account. We then integrate (Œº1s , vs1 ) out and identify the
average of of œÄ p (œÑ ; Œº1s , vs1 ) over the distribution of Œº1s , vs1 of those who stay in public school. The
details are in Appendix 2.
   In Table 2, Œ¥ÃÇ X  Œ≤ is 0.0169 when g = 0.5, 0.0157 when g = 1, and 0.0139 when g = 1.5,, which
is close to the value of -0.045 in the base case. The estimates of Œ¥X  Œ≥ are 0.0314 when g = 0.5,
0.0321 when g = 1, and 0.0328 when g = 1.5, which are are substantially lower and more precise
than the eect for the base model.
   The estimates of the cream skimming eect are in the third panel of Table 4. Regardless
of the assumption about g , the estimates of cream skimming eect are slightly positive when
we use the X  Œ≤ index model. The estimates for the X  Œ≥ model are about -0.0002. All of the
estimates are close to zero and precisely estimated.


9 Sensitivity to Alternative Assumptions about the Eects
  of Peers on Outcomes
In the fth panel of Table 4, we present estimates for alternative assumptions about the eects of
peers on outcomes. In the rst two rows of the panel we examine the sensitivity of our estimates
of œÄ to the coecient Œ¥X  Œ≥ relating Œ∏ to X(s, œÑ ) Œ≥. As noted earlier, our point estimate of Œ¥X  Œ≥
is 0.3614 when we exclude unobservable peer eects (Table 4, column 2, row 1) When we set
Œ¥X  Œ≥ to 0.5, the estimate of the cream skimming eect is -0.0018. If we set Œ¥X  Œ≥ to 1, about 3
times our point estimate, the cream skimming eect is -0.0037, with a condence interval from
-0.0050 to -0.0023. On one hand, the decline of -0.0037 in the graduation rate is relative small
in an absolute sense. However, since it is large enough to cancel out almost 2/3rds of the direct
positive eect of moving 1 out of 10 students to private schools, assuming a private school eect
of 0.06. On the other hand, a value of 1 seems extreme. It says that the indirect eect that Xi Œ≥
has on the graduate rate of a high school operating through X(s, œÑ ) Œ≥ is as large as the direct
eect on the graduate rate of person i.
   Discussions of cream skimming often give special emphasis to negative consequences of iso-
lation within public schools of children from low income families or racial minorities. In Table
4, Panel 5, we report results based on estimation of (3) restricting Zi to consist only of average
family income. This specication will tend to maximize the estimated impact of average family
income on school outcomes. We obtain -0.0011, which is similar to our base case estimates. The
next row of Table 4 is based on restricting Zi to consist of only fraction African American. For
this specication the estimate of the cream skimming eect is essentially 0. Note that from Table
3, the fraction of public school students who are African American increases by only 0.0035.
   Finally, fth panel also reports estimates under the assumption that peer eects are a linear


                                                     26
combination of average test scores.            In the  X  Œ≤ index column we use test score coecients
from the school choice equation to form the index. In the ‚ÄúX  Œ≥ index column the test score
coecients are from outcome equation. Both of the estimates of œÄ are very close to zero                Finally,
in the last row we assume peer eects operate only through father's education.                  The estimate
of the cream skimming eect is only -0.0008.


10 Alternative School Choice Models
10.1 Treating Catholic and non-Catholic Private Schools as Distinct
     Options
Since preferences over Catholic and non-Catholic schools are likely to dier we explore the
sensitivity to treating them as distinct choices. Table 4, Panel 4, reports estimates of the cream
skimming eect using a nested logit specication. Catholic and non-Catholic private schools are
in one nest and public school is in the other.            Distinguishing private school type makes very
little dierence.27
   We also consider a simpler case in which vouchers are only used for Catholic schools. The
estimates in Panel 4 of Tables 6 are very similar to the base case and to the nested logit estimates.


10.2 School Choice Depends Only on X  Œ≥
To guage the sensitivity of our results to possible mispecication of our models of school choice,
we performed a simulation in which we assume that sorting into new voucher schools is de-
termined exclusively by Xi Œ≥. To accomplish this, we rank public school students by Xi Œ≥ÃÇ and
assume that the top 10% will move. Under this assumption, the average value of Xi Œ≥ for the
movers is 0.5451 and the average value for the stayers is 0.3531. The average change in X(s, œÑ ) Œ≥
for stayers is -0.0163. Using (13) as the peer eects specication, we obtain -0.0059=0.3614√ó(-
0.0163) as the estimate of œÄ p (œÑ ). This is a substantial eect relative to the private benet of
attending private school, but the assumption that the response to the voucher will be based
entirely on the same index that determines peer eects is extreme. To see this point, contrast
these results with the nal row of table 3. When we freely estimate the school choice model the
mean of Xi Œ≥ for movers is only 0.4144 and the change in the peers for stayers is only ‚àí0.0037.
  27 In the case of the peer eects specication (12) we use the index of coecients that determine whether
public school is chosen over the two alternatives. Our base model without unobservables and our models with
unobservable peer eects generalize to the trinomial probit model in a natural way.   However, we experienced
numerical diculties in estimating the trinomial choice model, which precluded the use of bootstrap methods
to compute condence intervals.   The point estimates are generally consistent with the results that we obtained
using a binomial choice model for a wide range of cases that we considered. Due to computational complexity,
we have not tried the trivariate probit model when there are unobservable peer eects and unobserved school
choice components that are specic to   s   or when peer quality inuences demand.




                                                        27
Clearly the decision to attend public school depends on a lot more than just XiŒ≥ , but one can
also see that with more selection one can obtain larger eects.
    In the nal panel of Table 4 we combine this experiment with setting Œ¥X Œ≥ = 1. This           


essentially makes two of the three factors in the cream skimming eect formula largeselection
into private school is chosen to be as large as possible and the peer group eect is set to a very
high value. This makes a large dierence as we now obtain an estimate of œÄp(œÑ ) which is an
order of magnitude higher than our original result.

10.3 Approximating School choice using the Milwaukee experience.
We also replace our school choice model with a model estimated with data from the Milwaukee
voucher experience. We use data obtained from the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program data
set (obtained from www.disc.wisc.edu). We restrict ourselves to the set of covariates that are
similar in both the Milwaukee data sets and the NELS:88. This leaves us with Catholic religion,
gender, race, a dummy variable for parent's present, father and mother's education, log of family
income, and reading and math test scores (standardized). We estimate the choice parameters
(Œ≤ ) using the data from Milwaukee only, but then estimate the outcome and peer eects from
the NELS:88. In this case we obtain a small positive estimate of the cream skimming eect
for both peer eect specications. Thus when we compare our framework to an actual voucher
program, it seems that if anything we are overstating the negative consequences.

10.4       Programs Targetted to Urban Students or to Low Income Stu-
          dents
We consider the cream-skimming eect of vouchers targetted to urban families after re-estimating
our base model on the urban sample. The point estimates of the change in peer characteristics
of stayers under an urban voucher program are very similar to those for a universal voucher and
are small. The point estimates of œÄp(œÑ ) for the X'Œ≤ index and X'Œ≥ index are 0.0071 and 0.0026
respectively (Table 4, Panel 4, row 3). However, the estimates are noisy for the (12) case, with
a lower bound estimate of -0.0053, which is substantial.
    Next we consider a program that limits eligibility to families whose incomes are in the lowest
20% of our sample. We again calculate the value of the voucher that would induce 10% of the
eligible population to move to private school. The results are qualitatively similar to those for a
universal voucher program in the sense that eects are small. However, because of the targeting,
the peers of stayers become slightly more advantaged as a result of the voucher. For this reason,
the point estimate of the cream skimming eect is 0.0001, which is positive but close to 0. 28
  28 It is important to emphasize that we are estimating the eects on the full population of public school stayers
of a voucher that moves 10% of the eligible population. This is only 2% of the full population. In this case if one




                                                        28
    Programs that target all students in low income school districts regardless of income would
have a dierent selection eect. We investigated this by re-estimating the base models on the
subsample of schools in zipcodes with poverty rates above 16%, which is about 25% of the full
sample. When peer eects depend on X  Œ≥ the point estimate and is identical to the base case
-0.0013, but the condence interval is considerably wider. When peer eects depend on X  Œ≤ ,
the point estimate is -0.0018 but is very imprecise. 29

11 Conclusion
The rst contribution of the paper is to provide a simple formula showing that for a broad
class of models of school choice and peer eects, the cream skimming eect is determined by
the covariance between the relative probability that a student will move to private school in
response to the voucher with an index of the dierences between the student's characteristics
and the average characteristics of his or her classmates. The index is weighted by the coecients
relating outcomes to peer characteristics. The formula for the cream skimming eect provides
the structure for our empirical investigation.
    We rely primarily on formal econometric analysis to estimate the school choice and school
outcome parameters using several alternative models but we also perform a sensitivity analysis
to alternative assumptions about school choice and the eects of peers on outcomes. We provide
a method for allowing school choice to depend on peer characteristics even when peers are not
directly observed for those who do not choose a public high school. We also provide a way
to allow for both unobserved xed characteristics of schools that inuence school choice and
for unobserved characteristics of peers that inuence outcomes. Both methods may have other
applications.
    The specic parameter estimates vary with the details of the econometric specication and
the voucher program specied. However, the point estimates and the lower bounds to the
condence interval estimates of the cream skimming eect of a voucher program on high school
graduation rates are typically small in absolute value. The results suggest that the eects of
vouchers on the productivity of public schools, either through a positive or negative response to
competitive pressure or through an eect on the nancial resources available in public schools,
wishes to compare the private gain in the high school graduation of those who take up the voucher to the losses
of those who stay behind, one should multiply the cream skimming eect by 49 rather than the value of 9 that
we used previously. However, given the small positive point estimate, even after taking this product, one is left
with a small number, and it is positive rather than negative. One would like to know the eect of the targeted
voucher on the targeted population. Unfortunately, it is not straightforward to use our approach to estimate the
impact on members of the targeted subgroup, such as low income students, who remain in public schools unless
there is no heterogeneity in the targeted group within schools or the samples of students from each public high
school are large.
  29 The estimates are somewhat sensitive to the poverty rate cut o we choose, which is to be expected given
the sampling error.

                                                       29
may be more important than the cream skimming eect.
    Extrapolating to other types of choice programs is speculative since we do not examine them
explicitly. However, our cream skimming eect formula would be identical. Under montonicity,
the only dierence would come from the relative probability of remaining in the default school,
œài (œÑ ). In order for the overall eect to be sizeable, one would need the amount of cream skimming
to be more severe than what we have simulated for voucher programs. The evidence to date
on selection into Charter schools suggests that this is unlikely for the Charter school programs
that have been introduced so far.

Appendix 1: Data
A1.1 Sample Sizes By High School and Eighth Grade
Because of the complexity of the estimator of œÄp (œÑ ) and its components, we use a block bootstrap
method to compute standard errors, condence intervals, and bias corrections for most of the
parameters. The methods accounts for correlation in the error terms among students who attend
the same eighth grade and among the students who attend the same high school. The blocks
consist of students from each set of eighth grades who sent at least one student to a common
high school. For example, suppose that eighth grade A sent students to high school 1, 2, and
3, eighth grade B sent students to high school 1 and 3, and no other eighth grades represented
in NELS:88 sent students to high school 1, 2, or 3. Then the students from eighth grade A and
eight grade B constitute a block for purposes of constructing bootstrap replication samples.
    About 86% of the high schools have students from only 1 eighth grade. This is to be expected
because base year survey used eighth grade schools as strata. Among 39,000 schools containing
the eighth grade in the U.S., 1,052 schools were selected. Since students usually go to a nearby
high school, it is not very common in the sample for students from dierent eighth-grade schools
to attend the same high school. About 58% of the eighth grades have sample students in only
1 high school. About 28% have sample students in 2 high schools and 10% in 3 high schools,
with a small fraction sending sample members to 4 or more high schools. The distribution of
observations per resampling block is concentrated between 6 and 30, but there are a few blocks
with larger numbers of students. The largest block contains 965 students, and 7 blocks contain
more than 100 students. We chose break up the blocks of more than 60 students into a separate
block for each high school involved on pragmatic grounds, although doing so did not make much
dierence in the cases we checked. In practice, we also obtained similar condence interval
estimates if we treat students from each high school as a block.
    The distribution of Ns , the number of sample students in each high school is concentrated
between 6 and 18 observations.

A1.2 Description of Variables
NELS:88 variables used in the creation of the measures are shown in italics. This section draws
upon Altonji, Elder, and Taber (2002)
   Demographic Variables: These include indicators for female, hispanic, black, and whether
catholic, which is created from parental responses concerning religion (byp29 ).
   School Sector: Eighth Grade Sector (g8ctrl1 ) High School Sector (CH) (g10ctrl1 )
   Family Background Measures:
   Catholic: 0-1 indicator for whether parents are Catholic ( byp29 ).

                                               34
    Household composition: 0-1 indicator for whether the student lives with his/her mother and
father in the base year. Created from ( byfcomp ).
    Log family income : Continuous variable created using the midpoints of the ranges of the
categorical variable base year variable byfaminc and $230,000 if families with income above
$200,000 (the top category)
    Missing value treatment: All family background variables are set equal to the sample mean
when missing. 0-1 indicators for missing values are created for some of original variables as
indicated in the tables.
   Geographic Variables:
    Region indicators and the Urban and Suburban indicators: Constructed from g8region and
g8urban and refer to location of the 8th grade school the student attended. Missing values were
dropped.
    Distance to the nearest Catholic high school: This variable was constructed from the pop-
ulation weighted center of the zipcode of the 8th grade school and the population weighted
centers of the zipcodes of all the Catholic high schools reported in Ganley's Catholic Schools in
America, 1988 addition. See Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005). The units are 100,000 meters. A
missing value indicator is included in the school choice equation.
    Fraction black (p008002 /p001001 ), fraction Hispanic (p0100001/p0010001), an indicator
for whether fraction black is missing, median income, the fraction of the population below the
poverty line ((p1210001 +p1210002 +p1210003 )/p0010001 ), and the fraction of the population
with income more than double the poverty line ( p1210009 /p0010001 ) are from the 1990 Census
for the zipcode of the high school. Missing values were set to the sample mean.
   Eighth Grade Test Score Measures:
    We use the Item Response Theory scaled scores for reading, math, science, and history,
civics and geographyby2xrstd, by2xmstd, by2xsstd, and by2xhstd. Missing values are set to the
sample mean, and an indicator that is one when all of the tests are is included in the models.
(With a few exceptions, the tests are either all missing or all available.)
   Eighth Grade Behavioral and Performance-in-School Measures:
    Delinquency Index: This variable is the sum of two variables and ranges from 0 to 4. The
rst is (bys55a ), which is 1 if the student reports being sent to the oce once or twice and 2 if
sent more then 2 times. The second is bys55e, which is 1 if the student reports that his parents
were contacted once or twice because of a behavior problem and 2 if they were contacted more
than twice. It ranges from 0-4.
    Student got in a ght: Created from student self-reported variable bys55f : 0 (never) 1 (once
or twice) and 2 (more than twice) in the past semester.
    Student performs below ability: 0-1 indicator variable taken from teacher surveys ( byt1_2
                                               35
and byt4_2 ).
   Student rarely completes homework: 0-1 indicator variable taken from teacher surveys
(byt1_3 and byt4_3 ).
   Student frequently absent: 0-1 indicator variable taken from teacher surveys (byt1_4 and
byt4_4 ).
   Student inattentive in class: 0-1 indicator variable taken from teacher surveys ( byt1_6 and
byt4_6 ).
   Student frequently disruptive in class: 0-1 indicator variable taken from teacher surveys
(byt1_8 and byt4_8 ).
   Student Behavior Variables Missing: 0-1 indicator for whether any of the previous 5 variables
are missing.
   Trouble-Maker: 0-1 indicator variable created from bys56e, and coded as 1 if the student
report indicates that other students see the respondent as a "very big" trouble-maker.
   Behavior problem: 0-1 indicator variable created from byp50, regarding whether the parent
considers their child to have a behavior problem in school.
   Parents Contacted About Behavior: Created from byp57e, which measures the number of
times parents report being contacted about behavior problems in the past school year. The
values are 0 (never), 1 (once or twice), 2 (three or four time) and 3 (more than four times).
   Limited English Prociency Composite: 0-1 indicator variable (bylep). The NELS composite
variable is based on student and teacher reports.
   Repeated Grade: 0-1 indicator of whether a student repeated any grade 4-8, taken as the
maximum of the student (bys74e-bys74i) and parent ( byp46e -byp46i ) reports.
   Lack of Eort index: The base year student variable bys75 measures How many days of
school did you miss over the past four weeks? The values are 0 (none) 1 (1 to 2) 2 (3 or 4) 3
(5 to 10) 4 (more than 10). bys76 measures How often do you cut or skip classes? 0 (0) 1 (<
once per week), 2 ( at least once per week), 3 (daily). bys77 is the response to how many times
were you late for school over the past four weeks?: 0 (0), 1 ( 1 or 2 days) 2 ( 3 or 4) 3 (5-10)
4 (more than 10). bys78a, bys78b and bys78c are responses to How often do you come to class
without pencil or paper when needed?, How often do you come to class without books, and
How often do you come to class without homework. Each is coded as 3 (usually), 2 (often), 1
(seldom), 0 (never). The index is the sum of the 6 variables and ranges from 0 to 20.
   Dropout risk index: This is NELS composite variable byrisk, ranging from 0-6. It is the
sum of binary indicators for risk factors for dropout risk. The indicators are based on byfcomp,
bypared, byp6, bys41, bylep, and byfaminc.
   Grade Index: Based on bygrads, ranging from 0-4.
   Gifted: 0-1 indicator for parent report of whether the student is currently enrolled in a

                                               36
gifted/talented program (byp51 ).
    Missing values of all variables were set to the sample mean.
    Outcome Measures:
    High School Graduation: 0-1 indicator for whether received high school diploma as of the
third follow-up. One if hsstat =1.
    College Attendance: 0-1 indicator for whether enrolled in a 4-year college as of April 1994.
One if enrl0494 =15 or 16.
    Missing values are dropped.


Appendix 2: Estimation with Peer Eects in the School
Choice Equation.
In this appendix we describe the estimation of the model when peer eects inuence school
choice, which is considered in Section 7. We rst discuss estimation of the model when peers
aect demand through the E(Xi Œ≥) index, and then explain how the E(Xi Œ≤) index case diers.
We estimate Œ≥ using the xed eect for the base model. The data comes from the no voucher
regime, and we suppress the indicator for the voucher program regime unless it is needed for
clarity

A.2.1 The X Œ≥ Case
Partition the rest of the parameters that aect school choice into three subsets,

    ‚Ä¢ Œ≤ and œï

    ‚Ä¢ Œ±1 and Œ±2

    ‚Ä¢ Œ£Œ∑ and Œ£e .

We estimate the model by iterating on the following procedure. In each iteration we update the
parameters in the following steps, taking parameters from the previous step as given.
    Step 1: Given an estimate of (Œ± , Œ± , Œ£ , Œ£ , Œ≤) and Œº

                                                                         (0, Œº1s , Œº2s ) from the previous iteration,
we estimate Œ≤ and œï using the likelihood for private and public schools. The log likelihood for
individual i is

                                                                                                              

where wi is the sample weight for individual i and Œ¶ is the cdf of a standard normal. We
treat public and private school students symmetrically and do not use the data on peers to help
update Œ≤ in this step. Instead, we x Œ≤ ‚àó in the above equation at the value Œ≤ÃÇ from the previous
iteration rather than letting it change as we maximize the above likelihood function with respect
to Œ≤ and œï. This means that the update for Œ≤ÃÇ is chosen to maximize the likelihood of the school
choice model rather than to make the XiŒ≤ distribution look approximately normal.
    To see the intution behind Step 1, note that if we knew Œº2 (0, Œº1s , Œº2s ) we would just run a
probit of public school on Xi and Œº2 (0, Œº1s , Œº2s ) . Because we do not know it, we have to use the
model to integrate out its conditional distribution given the data we have.
    Step 2: Given Œ≤ and Œ≥ , we estimate Œ±1 and Œ±2 by regressing Xi Œ≤ and Xi Œ≥ on Ws(i) .
    Step 3: Taking (Œ≤, Œ≥, œï, Œ±1 , Œ±2 ) as given, we estimate Œ£Œ∑ and Œ£e using the likelihood for
public students only:

simplifying assumption that the NELS sampling frame xes the number of interviews at each
public high school independent of the size of the school, but then oversamples bigger schools.
In this case, Ls should be the likelihood of observing a particular realization of the vectors of
values of XiŒ≤ and XiŒ≥ for a particular sample of students from the school. Then, being loose
with notation, the likelihood for a particular school takes the form

Appendix 3: Unobservable School Eects and Unobservable
Peer Characteristics
In this appendix we discuss estimation of the unobservable peer eect model we describe in
the text. In practice there are two complicated issues: estimation of the variance/covariance
components of the model and estimation of Œ¥. Estimation of the variance/covariance model is
                                             40
quite similar to the case discussed in Appendix 2, so we do not go into great detail. However,
estimation of Œ¥ is dierent than in the other models. The dierence results from the need to
infer the expected value of the unobservables from the observables. Basically, we do this using
Bayes theorem, although the expression is quite involved. Our procedure is as follows.

  1. We obtain Œ≤ from a standard probit model for public school choice.

  2. We estimate Œ≥ using xed eects regression on the public school sample, but we correct
     for sample selection by including the inverse Mills-ratio term for public school choice in
     the regression.

  3. Given Œ≤ and taking the variance of u1s(i) and e1i and œÉ 2 = var (e1i + Œ∑i1 ) as known we use a
     likelihood function analogous to step 2 of Appendix 2. That is, we only use public schools
     and the likelihood is

       where we use normality in the last line. Again we approximate with sample analogues.
  30Our assumption that in the school attended by i, data on a random set of students are available and the
number of students is not related to the school choice probability. We account for selection in who choses to
attend the public school. However, in practice the number of students available depends on public school choice.
This is because NELS:88 follows eighth graders into high schools and does not draw a random sample in high
school. Furthermore, the probability that a high school attended by NELS:88 eighth graders is included in the
rst followup survey is increasing in the number who attend up until a school sample of 11. Consequently, the
probability that student i is sampled depends on the choices of the other NELS:88 sample members from the
same eight grade, which depend on Œº1s(i) . This is not accounted for in the expression for fŒºv (Œº1s(i) , Œº2s(i) , vs(i)

Notes: Means for individual variables and standard deviations (n parentheses) exclude missing cases, which were
assigned the sample means when the variables are used in the school choice and outcome equations. Sample sizes
refer to the school choice sample, and the number of nonmissing cases varies across variable. Sample sizes for the
outcome variables are smaller. Explanatory Variables are weighted using the base year through first followup panel
weights. High School graduation and Attend Four Year College are weighted using base year through third followup
panel weights.
