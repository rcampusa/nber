                                             ABSTRACT

This paper documents the extent and characteristics of plants and firms in the US that are outside the
manufacturing sector according to official government statistics but nonetheless are heavily involved
in activities related to the production of manufactured goods. Using new data on establishment activities
in the Census of Wholesale Trade conducted by the US Bureau of the Census in 2002 and 2007, this
paper provides evidence on so-called ‚Äúfactoryless goods producers‚Äù (FGPs) in the US economy. FGPs
are formally in the wholesale sector but, unlike traditional wholesale establishments, FGPs design
the goods they sell and coordinate the production activities. This paper documents the extent of FGPs
in the wholesale sector and how they differ from traditional wholesalers in terms of their employment,
wages, productivity and output. Reclassifying FGP establishments to the manufacturing sector using
our definition would have shifted at least 595,000 workers to as many as 1,311,000 workers from
wholesale to manufacturing sectors in 2002 and at least 431,000 workers to as many as 1,934,000
workers in 2007.

1        Introduction

The global economy has undergone a series of rapid, connected transformations in recent years that
are changing the way we think about Ô¨Årms and sectors and that have potentially large consequences
for future policy, productivity and prosperity. International trade in goods has surged with the ratio
of trade to GDP increasing for almost all exporter-importer country pairs. This substantial increase
in trade has been accompanied by the rise of the importance of global value networks and the
fragmentation of production activities across national borders even within narrowly-deÔ¨Åned goods
categories. At the same time, there has been renewed interest in the fragmentation of production
activities across the boundaries of the Ô¨Årm and its links to the increases in trade and oÔ¨Äshoring of
production. The diÔ¨Äerent activities of the value chain for a product can be performed by one or more
establishments of a single Ô¨Årm, or can involve many diÔ¨Äerent Ô¨Årms. In both cases, the activities can
be performed in diÔ¨Äerent locations within and across country borders. However, to date, almost
all analyses of these trends and their consequences for output, employment or productivity, either
aggregate or Ô¨Årm-level, have focused on establishments and Ô¨Årms in the manufacturing sector and
their decisions to outsource or oÔ¨Äshore.
        In this paper we consider an extreme form of the fragmentation of production activities where
the establishment is outside the manufacturing sector according to oÔ¨Écial government statistics
but nonetheless is heavily involved in activities related to the production of manufactured goods.
These establishments are found in the wholesale sector and are formally known as ‚Äúfactoryless-goods
producers‚Äù (FGPs). Traditional wholesalers are primarily, or exclusively, involved in intermediating
goods between producers and retailers/consumers. Factoryless goods producers, in contrast, design
the goods they sell and coordinate the production activities, either at the establishment itself or
through the purchase of contract manufacturing services. In other words, FGPs are manufacturing-
like in that they perform many of the tasks and activities found in manufacturing establishments
themselves.
        There are many ways to classify the activities or tasks needed to take a product from an initial
concept through production until its delivery to the Ô¨Ånal customer. Pre-production activities can
include development of the initial idea or conceptualization, R&D, product design and engineering
as well as development of speciÔ¨Åcations for production. Production itself involves transformation
and assembly of inputs and coordination of the various production stages. Post-production tasks
might cover the determination of prices and quantities, marketing and branding, logistics and the
ultimate sale of the good to Ô¨Ånal customers1
        Traditionally, these activities were undertaken by the same Ô¨Årm in one location. Today, Ô¨Årms
may perform diÔ¨Äerent parts of each production stage, as well as the stages themselves, in diÔ¨Äerent
    1
    Our focus is on tasks related to production of the goods themselves.We do not address the issue of services
provided to the customer by the Ô¨Årm. This growing activity is discussed in Crozet and Milet (2013)

domestic and foreign locations. When the activities are separated in space, Ô¨Årms can also decide
whether they should outsource them to others. We deÔ¨Åne a factoryless goods producer as an
establishment that is outside of the manufacturing sector but performs pre-production activities
such as design and engineering itself and is involved in production activities either by doing (some
of) them at the establishment or through purchases of contract manufacturing services (CMS).2
CMS purchases entail an arrangement in which the FGP provides design and production criteria
to a manufacturer who performs the physical transformation activities, generally on materials or
inputs speciÔ¨Åed by the FGP.
      FGPs are not hard to Ô¨Ånd. Perhaps the best-known example of a factoryless goods producer
is Apple Inc. Apple designs, engineers, develops, and sells consumer electronics, software and
computers. However, since 2004, Apple has not owned any production lines in the US and the
actual production is conducted by other Ô¨Årms, such as Foxconn, in China and elsewhere. While
Apple is known for its goods and services and closely controls all aspects of a product, from the idea
until the product lands in the hands of the consumer, none of Apple‚Äôs US establishments would be

      Our deÔ¨Ånition diÔ¨Äers from that currently under consideration by statistical agencies in the US, see Appendix B

in the manufacturing sector.3
       The semiconductor industry is well-known to have factoryless goods producers in the form of
‚Äúfabless‚Äù Ô¨Årms.4 Mindspeed Technologies, a fabless semiconductor manufacturer in Newport Beach,
CA with 500+ employees ‚Äúdesigns, develops and sells semiconductor solutions for communications
applications in wireline and wireless network infrastructure equipment‚Äù.5 Mindspeed outsources all
semiconductor manufacturing to other merchant foundries, such as TSMC, Samsung and others.
As with Apple, Mindspeed‚Äôs establishments would not be in the manufacturing sector.
       Perhaps the canonical example of a factoryless goods producer is the British appliance Ô¨Årm,
Dyson, best known for its innovative vacuum cleaners. The Ô¨Årm initially designed, engineered
and produced household appliances in Wiltshire, England but subsequently chose to oÔ¨Äshore and
outsource all its production to Malaysia while leaving several hundred research and other employees
in the UK.6
       All three of these FGPs started with production facilities inside the Ô¨Årm in the home country and
subsequently shed their production lines and outsourced and oÔ¨Äshored production. In addition,these
Ô¨Årms retained or expanded other activities including research and development, design, engineering,
marketing, and distribution.
       Anecdotes aside, however, there is very little systematic evidence on the extent of these types
of Ô¨Årms and establishments. In this paper, we use data from the US Census of Wholesale Trade in
2002 and 2007 to systematically document the extent of FGP activities in the wholesale sector in
the US and to examine the characteristics of plants and Ô¨Årms that are factoryless goods producers.
Statistical agencies in the US and elsewhere are grappling with the problem of how to collect
information about the evolving variety of manufacturing-related companies in the economy (OMB
(2010)). The US Census Bureau has historically classiÔ¨Åed many FGP plants in the wholesale trade
sector, but beginning in 2017, will move these FGP establishments in to manufacturing.7 In addition
there may be substantial numbers of non-wholesale FGPs in other sectors such as Business Services.8
       There are several reasons why distinguishing FGPs from traditional wholesale establishments
may be important for economic welfare or policy. First, the mere existence of the FGPs high-
lights a new type of production function in the global economy involving extreme fragmentation of
tasks. Second, the types of workers, and as result jobs and wages, employed by FGPs may diÔ¨Äer

      As of June 2013, Apple has announced but not yet implemented an investment in new manufacturing facilities
in the US. For a description of the distribution of value in several of Apple‚Äôs products, see Kraemer, Linden, and

      Doherty (2013) discusses the expected impact of reclassifying FGPs on US economic statistics including the value
of imports and exports and sectoral employment and wages.
    8
      Our data do not cover sectors beyond Wholesale Trade and Manufacturing so we are unable to document how
many FGPs might exist in other sectors.

signiÔ¨Åcantly from those at integrated manufacturing plants or traditional wholesalers. Third, the
relative importance of R&D and innovation is likely more important at FGPs. These potential dif-
ferences between FGPs and traditional manufacturers and wholesalers introduce the possibility of
very diÔ¨Äerent wage, employment, and productivity dynamics if factoryless goods production grows
in aggregate activity. We do not address these issues directly, but as a Ô¨Ånal exercise we attempt
to calculate how much employment and output would be shifted from the wholesale sector to the
manufacturing sector if FGPs are reclassiÔ¨Åed. Moving FGP establishments to the manufacturing
sector would have shifted at least 595,000 workers to as many as 1,311,000 workers from wholesale
to manufacturing sectors in 2002 and at least 431,000 workers to as many as 1,934,000 workers in
2007.
    Our research is related to a broader set of questions that asks how production, innovation,
knowledge and productivity are related. One perspective is that without production activities
located nearby in the long run a Ô¨Årm cannot continue to generate new ideas, improve product
quality, innovate its designs and raise productive eÔ¨Éciency. The counterpoint suggests that the
advent of dramatic improvements in telecommunication technology, the rise of the internet, and
the reduction of transportation and trade costs have combined to allow Ô¨Årms to separate their
activities geographically and potentially locate them outside the Ô¨Årm. This perspective suggests
Ô¨Årms will thrive if they can take advantage of comparative advantage and relative cost diÔ¨Äerences
in the performance of the tasks involved in the creation, production, distribution and marketing of
a product. Co-location of these tasks may not be necessary and might be more costly.
    We provide a Ô¨Årst step in developing an understanding of these complex processes by document-
ing the extent to which plants are engaged in diÔ¨Äerent activities in the production value chain. Our
focus is on establishments that are currently characterized by statistical authorities as performing
wholesale trade, i.e. those that are thought to be outside manufacturing. We are motivated by
the idea that the rapid decline in manufacturing employment in the US in recent years has been
accompanied at least in part by a rise in employment in manufacturing-related activities in other
sectors.9

Relation to existing work

This paper contributes to a growing empirical literature about the importance of international
fragmentation of production (i.e., oÔ¨Äshoring). A number of papers use industry-level input output
(IO) tables to show the importance of oÔ¨Äshoring across countries and over time (e.g., Hummels,
Ishii, and Yi (2001), Johnson and Noguera (2012)). While these papers provide strong evidence
that international fragmentation of production is an important and growing phenomenon, their

sector employment.

analyses focus on the manufacturing sector. In this paper, we show that when establishments
relocate the entire physical production process to another location, they become FGPs and so are
no longer included in oÔ¨Écial manufacturing statistics. As a result, current work that relies on IO
tables, or manufacturing more generally, will miss this potentially important type of production
fragmentation.10
       There is also research into the determinants of Ô¨Årms‚Äô vertical production networks. One strand
of this literature focuses on multinational production to assess production sharing across countries
(e.g., Hanson, Mataloni, and Slaughter (2005), Yeaple (2003)). These papers Ô¨Ånd an important
role for wages, distance, taxes and human capital in Ô¨Årms‚Äô sourcing decisions. In more recent work,
Fort (2013) uses the 2007 Census of Manufactures (CM) to asses the role of labor costs, distance to
suppliers, and communication technology in US Ô¨Årms‚Äô domestic and foreign fragmentation decisions.
While the Ô¨Åndings in that paper show that Ô¨Årm use of communication technology signiÔ¨Åcantly
increases the likelihood of domestic fragmentation, it does not necessarily lead Ô¨Årms to oÔ¨Äshore.
Most Ô¨Årms in that paper oÔ¨Äshore to low wage countries, but use of communication technology only
increases the likelihood of sourcing from high technology countries. An open question is whether
these results also apply to oÔ¨Äshoring by FGPs that have relocated the entire physical production
process overseas.
       The vast majority of the existing evidence on international fragmentation is based on manu-
facturers‚Äô decisions to oÔ¨Äshore production. In this paper, we show that focusing exclusively on
manufacturing misses an important element of production fragmentation. Existing evidence on
fragmentation by non-manufactures is much more limited. Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2009) and
Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott (2010) show that Ô¨Årms with wholesale establishments ac-
count for more than 40 percent of US imports. However, these papers are silent on the relationship
between wholesalers and production fragmentation, either domestic or foreign.11
       The paper also relates to the theoretical literature on oÔ¨Äshoring by providing evidence on the
types of producers who fragment, the extent to which they do so, and their import activity. Gross-
man and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) conceptualize the production process in terms of tasks that are
costly to separate from the headquarter location. The FGPs documented here provide some of the
Ô¨Årst direct evidence on establishments that have completely outsourced their production activities.
Baldwin and Venables (2010) take the physical production process seriously to distinguish between
‚Äúsnakes‚Äù, in which production is sequential, and ‚Äúspiders‚Äù in which multiple parts can be made at
the same time. This paper highlights the importance of extending the concept of production to
include product design and engineering. In this sense, the theoretical framework in Antr√†s and
  10
      While the IO tables do include information for the wholesale sector, it is at such a high level of aggregation that
it does not allow for a comparable analysis.
   11
      The new empirical literature on intermediaries in exports implicitly or explicitly assumes that wholesale Ô¨Årms
are merely reselling goods from other producers, i.e. acting as traditional wholesale resellers, see Akerman (2010),
Blum, Claro, and Horstmann (2010), and Bernard, Grazzi, and Tomasi (2011).

                              Factoryless Goods Producers in the US


Helpman (2004) is closely related to the producers we describe here. In that paper, producers
combine headquarter services with intermediate good production that can occur within or outside
the boundaries of a producer‚Äôs Ô¨Årm and country. The FGPs we identify provide the precise type of
headquarter services modeled in Antr√†s and Helpman (2004) and source their intermediate inputs
both domestically and oÔ¨Äshore.
    Although Antr√†s and Helpman (2004) is one of the few theoretical papers to consider both
domestic and foreign fragmentation within the same framework, a burgeoning empirical literature
explores the domestic fragmentation option. Fort (2013) shows that US manufacturers that fragment
production domestically are far more prevalent than those that oÔ¨Äshore. Using IO tables for the US,
Fally (2012) assesses the number of production stages within industries and over time. While that
paper documents a decrease in production fragmentation over time, we note that the emergence
of FGPs introduces error into the IO tables since they do not capture outsourcing by wholesalers.
Akerman and Py (2011) employ Ô¨Årm-level data on Swedish manufacturers to show that Ô¨Årms in
large cities contain fewer occupations, consistent with the premise that these Ô¨Årms are specialized
in a smaller range of tasks. The FGPs documented in this paper have undertaken an extreme form
of fragmentation in which all the physical production processes have been relocated to another
location. To the extent that domestic fragmentation allows for gains to specialization, it represents
a dimension of Ô¨Årms‚Äô organizational choices with potentially large aggregate productivity eÔ¨Äects.
    Our paper is most closely related to several recent working papers on measuring the extent of
FGP activity in the US economy. Doherty (2013) looks at the response of international and US
statistical organizations to the phenomena of rapid improvements in ICT and transportation and
the resulting increase in oÔ¨Äshore outsourcing. Kamal, Moulton, and Ribarsky (2013) analyze data
on contract manufacturing services (CMS) from US Ô¨Årm surveys focusing on the 2011 Company
Organization Survey. They Ô¨Ånd that Ô¨Åve percent of US Ô¨Årms purchase CMS and four percent supply
CMS with one percent both supplying and purchasing. Bayard, Byrne, and Smith (2013) present a
case study of FGP semiconductor production identifying domestic establishments of FGP Ô¨Årms with
a unique dataset combining outside company directories of FGP semiconductor Ô¨Årms with Economic
Census data for 2002 and 2007. Within wholesale trade, they Ô¨Ånd that FGP establishments are
larger in terms of both employment and sales, their employees have higher average earnings, and
they are more geographically concentrated than establishments of other Ô¨Årms. This paper revisits
the deÔ¨Ånition of an FGP and expands the analysis to cover the entire wholesale sector.


2    Data

The data employed in this paper are from the 2002 and 2007 US Census Bureau Census of Whole-
sale Trade (CW). The CW is conducted in years that end in 2 and 7 and covers the universe of
establishments classÔ¨Åed in the Wholesale Trade sector. The data analyzed here are from a new set

                                                 6
                                   Factoryless Goods Producers in the US


of ‚ÄúEstablishment Activities‚Äù (EA) questions that were asked in the 2002 and 2007 censuses. In
2002, the CW asked each establishment whether i) Product design/engineering, and ii) Materials
fabrication/processing/assembly/blending were a) performed by the establishment; b) performed
for the establishment by another company; or c) not provided by the establishment. In 2007, the
CW asked each establishment whether i) it designed, engineered, or formulated the manufactured
product it sold, produced, or shipped; ii) its primary activity was to provide contract manufacturing
services for other establishments, manufacture its own goods, resell goods produced by others, or
other; and iii) it purchased contract manufacturing services from another establishment (within
or outside the Ô¨Årm) to process its inputs. Copies of the exact questions as they appeared in the
censuses are in the appendix.
    The EA data are not available for every wholesale plant. In 2002, all establishments in every
wholesale industry were asked the EA questions. In 2007, only establishments in 49 of the 71 NAICS
industries were sent a form with the EA questions.12 All establishments that receive a census form
in the mail are legally required to return the completed form. Despite the legal requirement, a
number of establishments in both years did not respond to the question. The appendix provides a
list of the excluded wholesale industries in 2007 and discusses sample selection issues.
    Establishments are given a single industry (sector) classiÔ¨Åcation based on their production pro-
cess, i.e. they can either be classiÔ¨Åed as Manufacturing or Wholesale Trade but not both. However,
a given establishment may perform activities in both sectors and have employment in both sectors.
The practical implication of the assignment process is that plants in the Wholesale Trade sector
may, and many do, perform some physical transformation activities.13 These wholesale establish-
ments‚Äô manufacturing activities are not captured by aggregate statistics since all employment and
sales are designated to an establishment‚Äôs uniquely assigned industry and sector.
    The EA data are also available for manufacturing establishments in 2007. The Census of Man-
ufactures (CM) included the same set of Establishment Activities questions asked on the 2007 CW.
For manufacturers, all large plants and all plants that belong to multi-unit Ô¨Årms, as well as a ran-
dom sample of small and medium-sized plants within industries, were asked the EA questions. The
smallest manufacturing plants, generally those with fewer than Ô¨Åve employees, are never surveyed.14
The EA data on manufacturers allow us to compare FGPs in the wholesale sector to manufacturing
establishments that are similar along several key dimensions.
    We supplement the EA data with additional establishment and Ô¨Årm-level variables. Sales,
employees, and wages are available in the censuses. We link the census data to the Longitudinal
   12
      In practice, there are answers to the EA questions in every industry since information was collected from estab-
lishments that switched from one of the included 49 industries in 2002 into an excluded industry in 2007.
   13
      See Appendix A for more detail.
   14
      Manufacturing has short and long forms, and only the long forms asked the EA purchase questions. While all large
and multi-unit Ô¨Årm establishments receive the long form, only a random sample of small, single-unit Ô¨Årms received
the long form. Data for the smallest establishments is imputed from Federal tax returns and industry averages.

Business Database (LBD) to determine establishment and Ô¨Årm age, as well as the Ô¨Årm‚Äôs employment
in all other sectors. We also link the census data to Customs Trade Transactions data to obtain
measures of each Ô¨Årm‚Äôs imports. The Customs data provide value, transaction type (whether the
imports are intra-Ô¨Årm), country, and product information at the Ô¨Årm level.
         We construct a value-added labor productivity measure for establishment i as vapi = vai /tei ,
where va denotes value-added and te denotes total employment. For manufacturing establish-
ments, value-added is provided in the census. For wholesalers, we calculate a proxy measure for
value-added as vai = salesi ‚àí merchi ‚àí invbi + invei , where merchi denotes the establishment‚Äôs
purchases of merchandise for resales and invbi and invei denote inventory at the beginning and
end of the year respectively. It may therefore be more appropriate to think of wholesaler produc-
tivity as a gross-margin, but this provides the most comparable productivity measure available for
wholesale establishments given the existing data. Establishment sales, employment, wages and pro-
ductivity all vary signiÔ¨Åcantly across industries. To make meaningful comparisons of these variables
across establishments in diÔ¨Äerent industries, we provide information on a relative measure for each
characteristics, xij /xÃÑj , where xÃÑj is the mean of variable x in industry j.
         At Ô¨Årst glance, manufacturing production by wholesalers appears paradoxical. Traditional
wholesalers simply distribute goods and have no involvement in the manufacturing process. While
the majority of wholesalers still function as distributors, the sector has evolved to include establish-
ments that design, market and sell their own goods. Because these establishments perform few or
no physical transformation activities, they are classiÔ¨Åed as wholesalers. From an economic theory
perspective, however, plants that design goods and coordinate their production are closer to man-
ufacturers than distributors. As such, the wholesale sector contains plants whose behavior sheds
light on manufacturing activity in the US economy.15


3         Design and manufacturing at wholesale establishments

Since individual establishments (plants) are assigned a single primary industry code, each plant is
covered by only one sector of the quinquennial Economic Census.16 As discussed above, in 2002,
every establishment in the Census of Wholesale Trade was asked questions about its activities in
product design and manufacturing. We focus on these questions to explore the manufacturing-
    15
     The Census Bureau has recognized this issue and attempted to address it in the 2017 Economic Census by
identifying every manufacturing or wholesale establishment that does not perform its own manufacturing activities,
but ‚Äúundertakes all of the entrepreneurial steps and arranges for all required capital, labor, and material inputs
required to make a good‚Äù (OMB (2010), pp. 3-4). In 2017, these establishments will be classiÔ¨Åed in the manufacturing
industry that corresponds to the good they sell, with an additional Ô¨Çag identifying them as factoryless goods producers
(FGPs). The Ô¨Çag will distinguish FGPs from the traditional ‚Äúintegrated manufactures‚Äù (IMs) that perform their own
transformation activities, and establishments whose main activity is to provide contract manufacturing services for
others (referred to as manufacturing service providers or MSPs).
  16
     For example a plant is either in the Economic Census in the Manufacturing Sector or in the Wholesale Sector
but not both. This is true even if the plant performs both activities.

related activities of wholesale establishments and ultimately to create a formal deÔ¨Ånition of an FGP
plant.

2002

In Table 1, we tabulate the counts of plants in the wholesale sector that responded to both the Design
and Manufacturing questions in the 2002 Census.17 In each case, a plant could either perform the
activity at the plant, have it provided by another company, or not provide the activity. Of the
207,494 responding establishments, 63.2 percent participated in neither design or manufacturing
activities, either inside the plant or purchased from another Ô¨Årm, see Figure 2. These plants match
the typical perception of a wholesaler that is not involved in the creation of the product but rather
is active in delivery, warehousing, order fulÔ¨Ållment, logistics or other services that intermediate
between a producer and a customer.
       However, more than 36 percent of wholesale establishments are involved in either design or
manufacturing activities or both. Almost a third of the responding wholesale plants are involved
in manufacturing, evenly split between plants that are doing manufacturing themselves or those
purchasing contract manufacturing services. Similarly more than a quarter of wholesale plants are
  17
    The exact questions from the 2002 CW can be found in Figure 4. Many more plants responded to one of the two
questions. The distribution of responses was similar for plants answering one or two questions.


                                                      9

involved in design and engineering activities; 16.8 percent design at the establishment while 10.0
percent outsource design activities to others. These results challenge the stereotype of a wholesale
establishment that simply intermediates between producer and consumers. The wholesale sector
is a heterogeneous mix of traditional resellers and plants that are actively involved in production
activities.
       There is also new evidence in the other direction, i.e. that manufacturing Ô¨Årms are increasingly
producing services. Crozet and Milet (2013) document the shift away from goods towards services
in French manufacturing Ô¨Årms. They Ô¨Ånd that one third of French manufacturing Ô¨Årms have more
than half of their revenue from services.
       Plants that perform design activities themselves are most likely to conduct manufacturing activ-
ities as well, or to have manufacturing provided by an outside company. More than 1 in 12 wholesale
plants both design and manufacture at the establishment itself. For those plants that outsource
design activities, a large majority (more than 80 percent) also contract for manufacturing services.

2007

As discussed above, the coverage and format of the questions changed between the 2002 and 2007
Economic Censuses. In Table 2 we report three dimensions of the underlying sample of plants for
2007: those that did or did not perform design activities at the plant, the primary activity of the
plant, and whether or not the plant contracted for manufacturing services, either inside or outside
the US. To be included in the table, an establishment had to provide a response to all three of the
questions.18
       Of the 140,726 responding establishments, 15.2 percent indicated that they perform design
activities at the plant, down slightly from 2002. More than a Ô¨Åfth of wholesale plants (21.5 percent)
are involved in activities related to manufacturing either through the purchase or sale of contract
manufacturing services or because they report their primary activity to be manufacturing. There is
substantial variation in manufacturing activities depending on whether or not the plant does design
in-house. 67.5 percent of designing establishments buy or sell CMS or have their primary activity
as manufacturing. Only 13.3 percent of non-design plants are similarly involved in manufacturing
activities.
       For these plants with no design activities, 95.2 percent report their primary activity to be in
‚Äúresales‚Äù or ‚Äúother‚Äù. These establishments conform to the traditional view of a wholesalers. The
remaining 5,678 establishments with no design activity at the plant describe their primary activity
as manufacturing or contract manufacturing for others.
  18
    The exact questions from the 2007 CW form can be found in Figure 5. This requirement that a plant provides
an answer to all three questions results in the smaller sample size in Table 2 than in Table 1. One and two-way
tabulations that are not limited to the subset of plants that responded to all three questions result in comparable
percentages of plants across the categories.

                Figure 3: Design and Manufacturing Activities at Wholesale Plants, 2007




      Among the 21,430 establishments that do report design activities, 6,829 (31.9 percent) report
their primary activity as manufacturing and another 8.3 percent are primarily contract manu-
facturers for other companies, see Figure 3. Although categorized as wholesalers, these plants are
performing a substantial range of manufacturing-related activities. Even among establishments that
describe themselves as resellers (or other), almost 46 percent are purchasing contract manufacturing
services from domestic or foreign locations in addition to their own design activity.
      The 2007 questions also shed light on the role these non-traditional wholesale establishments
play in global production chains. Two percent of establishments that do not design their products
purchase CMS oÔ¨Äshore. In contrast, 13 percent of wholesale plants that design their own goods also
oÔ¨Äshore customized production (i.e., purchase CMS abroad). Fort (2013) examines oÔ¨Äshore CMS
purchases in the manufacturing sector and Ô¨Ånds that the share of oÔ¨Äshoring establishments is close
to two percent. The share of designing wholesale establishments that oÔ¨Äshore is therefore more
than six times the share of manufacturing establishments that oÔ¨Äshore. We do note that, as in the
results for manufacturing reported in Fort (2013), establishments with domestic CMS purchases are
still more prevalent than establishments with oÔ¨Äshore purchases.19
      In both 2002 and 2007, a sizable fraction of wholesale plants are conducting a range of manufacturing-

related activities from design to the purchase of contract manufacturing services to manufacturing
itself. Establishments that perform design are much more likely to have manufacturing activity at
the plant or purchase contract manufacturing than plants that report no design activities.


4     Factoryless Goods Producers

The results above suggest that there are multiple types of wholesale plants engaged in a range of
activities related to the production and distribution of manufactured goods. Both national statistical
agencies and researchers are faced with the diÔ¨Écult question of how to conceptually and practically
deÔ¨Åne an establishment that performs a suÔ¨Écient range of manufacturing-related activities to be
categorized as a factoryless goods producer. Whether or not FGPs should be moved from non-
manufacturing sectors to manufacturing is a separate question.20 Not every wholesale plant that
does design, purchases contract manufacturing services, or manufactures onsite should qualify for
this change in status. The range of manufacturing-related activity must be suÔ¨Écient to cover both
the conceptualization and fabrication of a good. Additional complications arise from the variation
in underlying survey questions over time.

4.1    DeÔ¨Ånition of a Factoryless Goods Producer

Our deÔ¨Ånition is based on a combination of activities at the plant: the wholesale establishment must
perform design (pre-production) and be involved in manufacturing in some capacity (physical trans-
formation activities). Wholesale establishments by deÔ¨Ånition are also involved in post-production
activities.

DeÔ¨Ånition 1. A Factoryless Good Producer (FGP) is a wholesale establishment that performs de-
sign/engineering/R&D activity at the establishment and either conducts manufacturing operations
at the establishment itself or purchases manufacturing services from a domestic or foreign company.

    By this deÔ¨Ånition the wholesale plant has manufacturing-related activity both before (design)
and during the production of the good. Wholesale establishments that are not FGPs (non-FGPs)
include those that contract for design services, those that report no purchases of contract or onsite
manufacturing even if design itself is occurring at the establishment, and those that are not involved
in product design at all.21 In theory the deÔ¨Ånition covers all wholesale establishments and divides
them into FGPs and non-FGPs. In practice, wholesale establishments might not be able to be
  20
     One practical reason to classify FGPs in the manufacturing sector is to ensure adequate data collection. The CM
collects much more detailed information on the inputs and outputs of the physical production process.
  21
     International and US deÔ¨Ånitions of FGPs diÔ¨Äer according to the ownership of inputs but both use a deÔ¨Ånition
that ignores manufacturing activity at the establishment. Using the same CW data, Bayard, Byrne, and Smith
(2013) adopt a version of this narrower deÔ¨Ånition of an FGP as a wholesale establishment that performs design and
purchases contract manufacturing services. Wholesale establishments that both design and manufacture onsite are
excluded from these deÔ¨Ånitions but are included in ours.



                                                        12
                                   Factoryless Goods Producers in the US


categorized if they did not answer the relevant questions about design and manufacturing and thus
will be classiÔ¨Åed as Missing.22 The implementation of our deÔ¨Ånition varies between 2002 and 2007.
We caution that comparisons across the years are diÔ¨Écult both due to changes in the underlying
sample of responding establishments as well as to changes in the nature of the questions in the
Economic Censuses.

4.2      FGPs in 2002

For 2002, using our deÔ¨Ånition, an FGP is an establishment in the wholesale sector that reports de-
sign activity in-house and either conducts manufacturing activity itself or purchases manufacturing
services from outside the company.23 These criteria mean that, for the 2002 CW, the establishment
must have provided an answer to both the design and manufacturing questions to be classiÔ¨Åed as
an FGP.24
       The upper panel of Table 3 reports the counts of FGP and non-FGP plants in the wholesale
sector along with their total sales and employment, while the bottom panel of the table provides
similar totals for the population of wholesale and manufacturing establishments. We are able to
classify almost half of the wholesale establishments in 2002 according to their FGP status. Of
the plants with non-missing FGP status, 13.5 percent are Factoryless Goods Producers doing both
design and manufacturing activities.25 The FGP plants have $253B in sales and employ 595,000
workers. Compared to the population of wholesale establishments, FGP establishments represent
6.5 percent of total establishments and account for 10.2 percent of employment and 5.2 percent of
output.26

4.3      FGPs in 2007

As mentioned earlier, the questions about manufacturing-related activities at the establishment
changed between the 2002 and 2007 Censuses. In addition in 2007 not every wholesale industry
was asked the questions. To qualify under our deÔ¨Ånition of FGP in 2007, a plant had to either (a)
  22
     In practice it is sometimes possible to classify a plant based as non-FGP based on their answer to a single
question. For example, if they indicate they did no design but did not answer the other questions or if they indicate
they were not involved in manufacturing at the plant or through the purchase of contract manufacturing services but
gave no information about their design activity.
  23
     In 2002, the Economic Census does not distinguish between domestic and foreign contract manufacturing pur-
chases.
  24
     However, we are able to categorize some plants as non-FGP even if they answered only one of the questions on
design or manufacturing. All plants with no design and all plants that report no manufacturing are classiÔ¨Åed as
non-FGP (regardless of their answer to the other question) and as a result the total number of plants in Table 3 is
greater than the totals in Table 1.
  25
     These 28,331 FGP establishments represent the sum of the 18,539 plants that did design and manufacturing at
the plant (Table 1 row 1 column 1) and the 9,792 plants that did design at the plant and purchased CMS (Table 1
row 1 column 1).
  26
     We caution that these shares represent the activity at plants we can identify as FGP, i.e. a lower bound, as the
FGP status of more than half of plants in the Wholesale sector is missing.



                                                         13
                                  Factoryless Goods Producers in the US


do design and have its primary activity as Manufacturing, Contracting, or Other or (b) do design
with the primary activity of Resales and purchase contract manufacturing services. A plant was
non-FGP if it either (a) did not perform design or (b) did design with the primary activity of Resales
but did not purchase contract manufacturing services.
         Table 4 gives plant, sales and employment totals for FGP and non-FGP plants in 2007 in the
upper panel. The numbers of plants that are classiÔ¨Åed as FGP or non-FGP drops between 2002
and 2007 even as the population of wholesale establishments grows slightly.27 This is likely due to
the diÔ¨Äerence in the questions asked in the 2007 Census, the need for responses to three questions
instead of two, and the fact that not all industries in the Wholesale Trade sector were asked the
EA questions. Of the wholesale plants with non-missing status in 2007, 10.5 percent are classiÔ¨Åed
as FGP with $279B in sales employing 431,000 workers.
         Interestingly, in the 2007 Economic Census, a subset of manufacturing establishments was asked
the same questions about design, primary activity and CMS purchases and thus we are able to
classify manufacturing Ô¨Årms according to the same criteria. The majority of manufacturing estab-
lishments with non-missing data satisfy the FGP criteria (58.4 percent) and they account for just
under half of total manufacturing sales and employment.


5         Characteristics of FGP Establishments

In this section we compare FGP establishments, non-FGP establishments, all wholesalers, and man-
ufacturing establishments in terms of employment, wages, sales, labor productivity, and age. As
there is no formal theoretical guidance from the literature on how these characteristics should vary
across plant types, we describe two possible wholesale establishments. The FGP plant creates, de-
signs and engineers the product itself and coordinates the production, possibly through the purchase
of CMS. Wholesale status means it is likely that the establishment is involved in post-production
logistics and distribution. The traditional wholesale establishment (non-FGP) is not involved with
pre-production activities, purchases the Ô¨Ånished good directly form the producer, and is primarily
involved in post-production activities.
         The addition of the design activities would tend to raise employment and measured value-added
at the FGP plant, especially when adjusting for total sales. If pre-production workers are relatively
skill intensive, average wages would also be higher at the FGP facility. Sales volume itself might
be higher at the non-FGP plant, especially sales per employee, in part because the traditional
    27
    The 16,752 FGP establishments in 2007 represent the sum of the 10,881 plants that did design at the plant and
had Contracting, Manufacturing or Other as their primary activity (Table 2 rows 1-3 column 4) and the 4,842 plants
that did design at the plant,purchased CMS, and had Resales as their primary activity (Table 2 row 4 columns 1-2).
Note that these numbers sum to only 15,723 since Table 2 is limited to establishments that answered the design
question, the primary activity question and the CMS question. In contrast, FGP status is deÔ¨Åned for all plants that
answered the design question and at least one of the primary activity and CMS questions.

wholesaler is likely to handle a wider variety of goods in any given market.

2002

Table 5 reports unweighted means for each characteristic by plant FGP status in the top panel for
2002. Since diÔ¨Äerences in the means can come from a combination of within industry diÔ¨Äerences
at FGP and non-FGP plants and the mix of industries in the sample of plants with non-missing
FGP status (and the industry mix diÔ¨Äerence between FGP and non-FGP) we report the average
unweighted ratio (or log diÔ¨Äerence) relative to the mean in the industry of the establishment in the
middle panel. The bottom panel in the table gives unweighted means across all establishments in
the wholesale and manufacturing sectors for comparison.
   Within the sample of establishments where we can identify FGP status, we Ô¨Ånd that FGP plants
have much lower sales and log value-added per worker than traditional wholesale plants (non-FGP),
while employment is substantial larger and the average wage is comparable. They are also slightly
younger.
   The middle panel shows the extent to which the diÔ¨Äerences between FGPs and non-FGPs depend
upon the industry composition of each group. In this panel, a value of one indicates that a plant is
exactly at its industry mean (zero for log VA/worker). First, it is clear that, on average, plants in
the FGP sample are larger and more productive than establishments with a missing status. Both
FGPs and Non-FGPs have values greater than one. Second, the relative means reveal important
within-industry diÔ¨Äerences from the raw averages presented in the top panel. Although non-FGPs
still have more sales than FGPs, their relative mean is only 4.7 percent larger than the FGP mean,
whereas the raw numbers suggested a 41 percent diÔ¨Äerence in size. In contrast, the relative means
reveal even bigger diÔ¨Äerences in employment at FGPs versus non-FGPs. FGPs employ 1.67 times
more workers than their industry average, compared to just 1.15 times for Non-FGPs.

2007

We repeat the exercise for 2007 in Table 6. Within the sample of wholesale establishments where
we can identify FGP status, we Ô¨Ånd that FGP plants have somewhat lower sales and substantially
higher employment than traditional wholesale establishments as in 2002. However in this sample,
FGP plants on average have higher wages and comparable, rather than lower, productivity. FGP
plants are also younger than non-FGPs.
   Looking at the middle panel, we Ô¨Ånd that relative to their industry averages, FGP establishments
have substantially higher sales, wages, productivity and especially employment. On average, FGP
plants are also larger, more productive, and pay higher wages than non-FGP plants in the same
industry.

6         FGP Firms

Having established a number of plant-level facts, we turn our focus to the Ô¨Årm. While the Economic
Censuses collect information at the unit of the establishment, economic decision-making in many
cases takes place at the Ô¨Årm level. Most Ô¨Årms in both manufacturing and wholesale trade are single-
plant (SP) organizations but the smaller number of multi-plant (MP) Ô¨Årms are disproportionately
important in aggregate output, and employment and are more likely to produce multiple products
(see Dunne, Roberts, and Samuelson (1988) and Bernard, Redding, and Schott (2010)). For SP
Ô¨Årms, FGP status is a straightforward application of DeÔ¨Ånition 1; however, for MP Ô¨Årms we need a
new deÔ¨Ånition.

DeÔ¨Ånition 2. A Factoryless Good Producing Firm (FGPF or FGP Ô¨Årm) is a Ô¨Årm with at least one
FGP wholesale establishment.

         The practical implementation of DeÔ¨Ånition 2 is complicated by the fact that each wholesale
plant can be in one of three categories: FGP, non-FGP, or Missing. As a result, Ô¨Årms can also be
in one of three categories: FGPF - at least one wholesale plant is an FGP, non-FGPF where none
of the wholesale plants at the Ô¨Årm is identiÔ¨Åed as an FGP and at least one plant is identiÔ¨Åed as
not being an FGP, and Missing - where every wholesale plant in the Ô¨Årm has Missing for its FGP
status.28
         MP Ô¨Årms can be comprised of only wholesale establishments, a mix of manufacturing and whole-
sale establishments and only manufacturing establishments. FGP Ô¨Årms come from the the Ô¨Årst two
Ô¨Årm types, any Ô¨Årm that has no wholesale (only manufacturing) establishments is not an FGPF.29
         Table 7 reports the number of Ô¨Årms by FGP status and Firm type in 2002 (upper panel) and
2007 (lower panel). In 2002, 16.5 percent of the Ô¨Årms with non-Missing status are FGPFs and only
a small fraction of FGPFs are Mixed Ô¨Årms. However, FGPFs are almost twice as likely to be a
Mixed Ô¨Årm (3.8 percent) than are non-FGPFs (2.0 percent) or Missing Ô¨Årms. For 2007, as with
the plant-level data, fewer Ô¨Årms have non-missing FGPF status and among those a smaller fraction
are FGPF. Again the share of Mixed Ô¨Årms among FGPFs is much higher (5.3 percent) than for
non-FGPFs (2.0 percent)
         Table 8 reports on Ô¨Årm characteristics by FGPF status and Firm type (upper panel) as well as by
Census (lower panel) for 2002.30 The comparable Ô¨Årm characteristics for 2007 are given in Table 9.
Sales, employment, and imports are much larger at FGPFs than at other types of Ô¨Årms (non-FGPF
    28
     We note that this is a conservative deÔ¨Ånition of an FGP Ô¨Årm since a plant with missing status at a non-FGP
Ô¨Årm may be an FGP. An alternative deÔ¨Ånition would have classiÔ¨Åed all Ô¨Årms with one or more plants with a missing
status as Missing. However, this classiÔ¨Åcation scheme would likely have resulted in a much bigger allocation of the
larger, MP Ô¨Årms to the Missing category.
  29
     We note that all Ô¨Årms may have employment in other sectors, such as Retail Trade or Business Services, but we
do not measure those activities here.
  30
     We do not report normalization within industries due to the multi-industry nature of many Ô¨Årms.


                                                        16

or Missing) in both years. FGPFs also have more manufacturing plants on average (almost four times
as many in 2002 and Ô¨Åve times as many in 2007) than non-FGPFs. A portion of these diÔ¨Äerences
is driven by the increased presence of Mixed Ô¨Årms in the FGPF category. Within each group,
Mixed Ô¨Årms are dramatically larger, more productive, and more involved in imports. Despite this
compositional component, the Mixed FGPFs are still diÔ¨Äerent from the Mixed non-FGPs. They are
more productive and have more sales, employment, and imports than the non-FGPFs. In addition,
the Mixed FGPFs have twice as many manufacturing and wholesale establishments on average than
non-FGPFs in both 2002 and 2007.
         Tables 8 and 9 also show the average share of intra-Ô¨Årm (related party) imports by FGP status
and Ô¨Årm type. The share of intra-Ô¨Årm imports for Mixed Ô¨Årms is between 0.25 and 0.27 for both
FGPFs and non-FGPFs in 2002 and 2007. In contrast, FGPF Wholesale-only Ô¨Årms have a noticeably
lower share of intra-Ô¨Årm imports compared to non-FGPFs. In 2002, the average share of intra-Ô¨Årm
imports for FGPFs was only 0.09 compared to 0.13 for non-FGPFs. A similar pattern is evident in
2007. Wholesale-only FGPFs had an average share of intra-Ô¨Årm imports of 0.08 compared to 0.13
for non-FGPs.


7         Aggregate Implications

In this section we consider how employment and output aggregates for manufacturing would have
been diÔ¨Äerent if FGP establishments had been included in the manufacturing sector in 2002 and
2007 instead of in the wholesale sector. In 2017, the US Census Bureau is scheduled to do exactly
this by recording FGPs in the manufacturing sector. We emphasize that the results in this section
depend on our deÔ¨Ånition of FGP in each year. The diÔ¨Äerence in the survey questions and coverage
over time makes even the comparison of the 2002 and 2007 numbers problematic.
         A major concern for policymakers in advanced, industrialized economies has been the rapid and
systematic decline in the manufacturing sector in recent decades. The focus of this paper is on
the presence of FGPs that reside outside the manufacturing sector but conduct manufacturing-like
or manufacturing-related activities. Broadly construed FGPs employ workers and produce output
that is similar in many dimensions to traditional manufacturing operations but their employment
and output do not count towards manufacturing aggregates.
         Here we report the results of two exercises that shift FGPs to the manufacturing sector with
adjustments to the aggregate manufacturing employment and output statistics.31 In the Ô¨Årst ad-
    31
    Using a narrower deÔ¨Ånition of FGPs and focusing on the semiconductor industry, Bayard, Byrne, and Smith
(2013) estimate that US manufacturing output would have been 7-30 percent higher in 2002 and 2007 if FGPs has
been included. We consider FGPs more broadly and include a focus on employment which is typically the focus of
policy debates on the manufacturing sector. They Ô¨Ånd a larger share of output in FGPs in the semiconductor sector
than we do for manufacturing overall. This diÔ¨Äerence might exist in part because the semiconductor industry has
undergone more production fragmention than the average manufacturing sector.

justment, we add employment (output) by establishments that we have identiÔ¨Åed as FGPs in 2002
and 2007 to existing manufacturing aggregates. In the second adjustment, we assume that the
prevalence of FGPs in our samples of responding establishments holds for the entire population of
wholesale plants and that employment and output at all those plants diÔ¨Äers from their industry
means to the same extent as found in the samples of responding establishments. The two methods
provide rough lower and upper bounds on the extent of manufacturing-like activity due to the pres-
ence of FGPs in the Wholesale Trade sector. To the extent that FGPs are present in other sectors,
such as Business Services, both of our estimates may understate the presence of FGPs and their
employment and output.
    The Ô¨Årst method is quite straightforward and merely involves adding the employment and output
aggregates at establishments identiÔ¨Åed as FGP in Section 4 to the reported manufacturing totals
for each year. Reclassifying FGP establishments to the manufacturing sector would have increased
reported manufacturing jobs by 595,000 in 2002 and by 431,000 in 2007, corresponding to an 4.0
percent increase in manufacturing employment in 2002 and 3.2 percent increase in 2007. The same
method of adjustment would have resulted in increased reported manufacturing output by $253B
(6.5 percent) in 2002 and by $279B (5.2 percent) in 2007.
    The second method involves two strong additional assumptions. First, we assume that the frac-
tion of FGPs in the overall wholesale sector is the same as that among those plants answering both
the design and manufacturing questions in 2002, and those answering the design, primary activity
and outsourcing questions in 2007. Second, we assume that all these FGPs are proportionally dif-
ferent from (larger than) the average in their industry in terms of employment and output to the
same degree as the observed FGP plants (see Tables 5 and 6).
    Applying the Ô¨Årst assumption results in 58,147 FGPs in 2002 and 45,624 FGPS in 2007. Average
employment at wholesale plants was 13.5 workers in 2002 and 14.3 workers in 2007 and the within-
industry FPG-adjustment factors were 1.67 and 1.65 respectively yielding an average of 22.5 workers
per FGP in 2002 and 23.6 workers per FGP in 2007.
    This more liberal set of assumptions results in 1,311,000 more manufacturing jobs in 2002 and
1,934,000 in 2007, 9.0 percent and 14.4 percent respectively. The same method of adjustment would
have resulted in increased reported manufacturing output by $758B (19.4 percent) in 2002 and by
$895B (16.8 percent) in 2007.


8    Conclusions

Large numbers of workers in the wholesale sector are employed at plants that engage in manufacturing-
related activities. Unlike traditional wholesalers, these establishments are not primarily engaged
in intermediation but instead undertake design and engineering of products themselves and exert
control over the production process. To date, many of these factoryless goods producers have been

                                                 18

hidden in the wholesale sector. Our Ô¨Åndings open a window into the extent and characteristics of
FGPs in the US wholesale sector. The potential for increasing fragmentation of production across
Ô¨Årms and borders means that FGPs are likely to play an even larger role in industrialized economies
in years to come.
   The Ô¨Åndings in this paper raise issues for academic researchers and statistical agencies. There
is the relatively straightforward question of how to assign FGPs to broad sectors such as manufac-
turing or wholesale trade. Our results suggest that merely asking plants about their outsourcing
activities might miss an important segment of FGPs, those that design their goods and still do some
manufacturing but not enough to be reclassiÔ¨Åed as traditional manufacturers. Our Ô¨Åndings suggest
that moving FGPs to manufacturing will substantially raise measured manufacturing employment.
These results also raise questions about the production process itself and how it is fragmented across
locations and Ô¨Årms. Measurement of output and inputs may be fundamentally diÔ¨Äerent at FGPs
than at integrated manufacturing Ô¨Årms or at more traditional wholesalers with obvious consequences
for measuring value-added and productivity. The presence of FGPs in an industry also complicates
the already-diÔ¨Écult job of measuring productivity, both within FGPs over time and between FGPs
and other plants. We lack evidence on their production function, or on how their existence may
bias existing estimates of productivity.
   Our results suggest a fruitful area of research related to theoretical models of tasks, outsourc-
ing and oÔ¨Äshoring. The largely neglected wholesale trade sector contains a sizable number of
establishments that are at the forefront of this type of production fragmentation. The FGPs we
document in this paper suggest that, at least for some producers, it is optimal to fragment the ma-
jority of the physical transformation activities to another location. We also Ô¨Ånd that these plants
are systematically diÔ¨Äerent from integrated manufacturers or traditional wholesale intermediaries.
Rodr√≠guez-Clare (2010) develops a dynamic model of oÔ¨Äshoring in which the reallocation of factors
of production away from manufacturing and towards design activities can result in long-term pro-
ductivity gains for the oÔ¨Äshoring country. The factoryless goods producers we document in this
paper provide evidence of a production process that is consistent with this mechanism. However,
our results only provide a snapshot of FGPs at two points in time. We know nothing about how
they are created, for example whether they are new establishments or transformations of existing
ones, or how they perform over time in terms of output, employment growth, and survival.

A     Data

The industry classiÔ¨Åcations for all establishments covered by the economic census and surveys are
based on the North American Industry ClassiÔ¨Åcation System (NAICS).The method of assigning
industry classiÔ¨Åcations and the level of detail at which establishments were classiÔ¨Åed depends on
whether a report form is obtained for the establishment. Establishments that returned a report form
are classiÔ¨Åed on the basis of their self-designation; product line sales, products produced, or services
rendered; and responses to other industry-speciÔ¨Åc inquiries. Establishments that do not return a
report form and those that were not sent a report form were classiÔ¨Åed using the following methods:
(a) the most current industry classiÔ¨Åcation available from the applicable Census Bureau current
surveys or the previous economic census, (b) the classiÔ¨Åcation from administrative records of other
federal agencies, (c) a brief inquiry requesting information necessary to assign a kind-of-business
code and/or (d) research done by Census Bureau analysts.

B      DeÔ¨Ånitions of FGPs

The Economic ClassiÔ¨Åcation Policy Committee (OMB (2010)) gives the following deÔ¨Ånition of an
FGP:

          The factoryless goods producer (FGP) outsources all of the transformation steps
       that traditionally have been considered manufacturing, but undertakes all of the en-
       trepreneurial steps and arranges for all required capital, labor, and material inputs
       required to make a good. Characteristics of FGPs include:
          Owns rights to the intellectual property or design (whether independently developed
       or otherwise acquired) of the Ô¨Ånal manufactured product;

         ‚Ä¢ May or may not own the input materials;

         ‚Ä¢ Does not own production facilities;

         ‚Ä¢ Does not perform transformation activities;

         ‚Ä¢ Owns the Ô¨Ånal product produced by manufacturing service provider partners; and

         ‚Ä¢ Sells the Ô¨Ånal product.

       The FGP can provide information on the purchase of the manufacturing service, that
       is, the cost of the contract, but would not necessarily have production worker payroll
       or capital expenditures on plant and equipment. However, it can provide data on the
       number of units that were produced and the market value of the Ô¨Ånal product.
