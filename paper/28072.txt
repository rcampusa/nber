                                         ABSTRACT

This paper studies how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected labor demand using over 100
million posted jobs on one of the largest online platforms in China. Our data reveals that, due to
the effects of the pandemic both in China and abroad, the number of newly posted jobs within the
first 13 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020 was about one third lower than that
of the same lunar calendar weeks in 2018 and 2019. Using econometric methods, we show that,
via the global supply chain, COVID-19 cases abroad and in particular pandemic-control policies
by foreign governments reduced new job creations in China by 11.7%. We also find that Chinese
firms most exposed to international trade outperformed other firms at the beginning of the
pandemic but underperformed during recovery as the Novel Coronavirus spread throughout the
world.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has resulted in an enormous loss of
lives around the world. Measures taken by governments to contain the virus have
flattened the epidemic curve and slowed the spread of the disease (1, 2, 3) but
also have resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of jobs and thrown the global
economy into a deep recession. In an age in which most goods are "Made in the
World" (4), there are worries that COVID-19 and pandemic-control policies could
generate shock waves, transmitted via global supply chains, and impose economic
costs that bypass national borders (5, 6, 7).
    Two emerging strands of literature attempt to estimate the economic impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic. On the empirical side, studies have shown that new
job postings online dropped by about 40% in countries such as the United States
(8, 9) and Sweden (10). There also are strong correlations between the drop in
job postings and exposure to COVID-19 by state or county in the United States
(8, 9). In addition, tradable sectors can better withstand the pandemic (8). On
the theoretical side, macroeconomic models have been used to simulate the impact
of the pandemic on employment and other outcomes (6, 7, 11). These studies all
highlight the possibility of COVID-19 shocks as propagating through the global
production network, and neither strand of literature has provided direct evidence
on whether and how global supply chains have played a role in transmitting the
COVID-19 shocks and policy across borders.
    In this paper, we attempt to understand the nexus between COVID-19, gov-
ernment pandemic-control policies, international trade, and Chinas labor market
by exploring over 100 million jobs posted on a leading Chinese online employment
platform. China, the country where COVID-19 first broke out, also has been the
largest trading nation in the world since 2013. In the first quarter of 2020, as
COVID-19 cases peaked in China, total Chinese exports fell by 9.3% quarter-on-
quarter, the largest fall in a decade.1 At the same time, according to our data,
in the first 14 weeks after the lockdown on January 23, 2020 of Wuhan City--the
first epicenter of COVID-19--the number of newly posted jobs dropped by about
31%, or 3.8 million, relative to the same lunar calendar period in 2018 and 2019.2
    Our empirical model correlates, at the city-week level, the creation of new jobs
with exposure to the pandemic in the city, in other parts of China, and to foreign

    The urban unemployment rate went up by about one percentage point to 5.9%, the highest
level and largest month-to-month increase of this statistic since it was officially published in
January 2018. Source: National Bureau of Statistics of China. This official unemployment rate
percentage likely does not fully reflect true unemployment in China because the survey does not
cover most of the 300 million migrant workers, who are more likely to be unemployed during the
pandemic.


                                               2
countries through supply chains. Similar to other recent studies (8, 9), we first
examine the impact of new COVID-19 cases in the local city on local job creation.
Different from these studies, we also separately identify the impact of COVID-19
in other parts of China by using a distance-weighted pandemic exposure measure.
     We also test whether the pandemic has an impact on job creation through the
global supply chain. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to exploit cross-
city variations in their exposure to the global pandemic and virus-containment
policies through their differential trade linkages with other countries. Specifically,
we create trade-weighted measures of exposure to the global pandemic by using
Chinese Customs data to generate weights and to estimate their effects on job
creation in a Chinese city. Thus, the variations come from the change of global
pandemic and containment policies over time and a citys exposures to trade with
different countries. Further, we follow Campello et al. (8) to test whether the trade
sector fares differently from other firms at different stages of the global pandemic.
Empirically, we identify trade intermediary firms by examining whether the names
of firms contain Chinese terms related to trade.
     We establish three main findings. First, we find that COVID-19 cases in the
local city and other parts of China have large negative impacts on job creation
in a Chinese city, and the elasticity of job creation with respect to the latter is
slightly larger in magnitude. Our back-of-the-envelope calculation implies that job
creation was down by 9.6% due to local city COVID-19 cases but by 10.7% due to
cases in other parts of China in the 14 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown. Second,
foreign COVID-19 shocks transmitted via global supply chains also reduced job
creation in China. This impact came mainly from the decline of export demand
due to the policy responses by foreign governments to COVID-19. In the same 14
weeks, foreign COVID-19 shocks reduced job creation in China by another 11.0%,
which weakened the recovery of the labor market. Finally, we find, as a piece
of direct evidence for the role of international trade in transmitting the COVID-
19 shock, that Chinese firms that rely more on international trade outperformed
other types of firms in withstanding the COVID-19 shock when the epicenter was
in China but underperformed during the recovery as the epicenter moved to the
rest of the world.
     In addition to the recent economic literature on COVID-19 cited above, our
paper also is related to the literature on the propagation of shocks through input-
output linkages and global supply chains. The propagation of a local shocks hitting
one or few regions by examining natural disasters in the U.S., the SARS epidemic,
and the 2011 east Japan earthquake have been, respectively, studied (12), (13),
and (14). The COVID-19 pandemic is a global shock and, thus, differs from these
local shocks. Like the pandemic itself, which may have multiple waves (15), the
COVID-19 shock may hit local economies multiple times via global supply chains.


                                          3
    Understanding the transmission mechanism through domestic and interna-
tional linkages is crucial for policymaking to, on the one hand, contain the pan-
demic and, on the other hand, speed up the recovery of the global economy. Do-
mestically, we find that the effect of COVID-19 cases in other parts of China is
similar to that in the local city. This suggests that, for large countries with com-
plex domestic supply chains, such as China, the United States, Brazil, and India,
a nationally coordinated strategy is important for controlling both the pandemic
and economic recovery. With the pandemic under control in China, the impacts of
the global pandemic through trade and pandemic-mitigation policies have become
more prominent over time. As evident from our data, seven weeks after the Wuhan
lockdown, 78.0% of the loss of new jobs was due to foreign pandemic shocks via
the global supply chain. According to our data, over the entire 14-week period,
foreign shocks accounted for slightly more than a third of the 3.8 million "lost new
jobs. These findings suggest that an open economy cannot fully recover unless the
pandemic is well under control among all of its major trading partners, and, thus,
international coordination in pandemic control is crucial.
    Our findings also have implications for Chinas future trade and job creation
beyond COVID-19. The current pandemic will likely pass within a year, when
vaccines and more effective therapeutics are developed (16, 17, 18). With dete-
riorating relations between China and the United States as well as other major
western countries, however, economic decoupling of China from the rest of the
world or a sudden drop in Chinas trade volume is becoming a real possibility. In
light of this, the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent virus
mitigating border control policies adopted by foreign governments could serve as
a natural "simulation and be used as a rare opportunity to test how an abrupt
severing of the global supply chain might affect job creation in China. We find
large negative impacts of trade shocks, in particular, of the drop of foreign demand
due to border control policies. Economic decoupling of China from the rest of the
world will likely cause job losses in China in a similar manner, except that the
magnitude of such a shock will likely be much larger (6).


Data and Methods
Data
We use several data sources for our analysis. Our job posting data come from one
of the largest online platforms that provide hiring services in China.3 We ran a
   3
    According to iResearch , a leading online market research company in China, the platform
we scraped our data from has a stable market share before and during the pandemic. Thus, it
is unlikely that the loss in their posted job ads is due to a platform-specific downward trend.


                                              4
web-scraping algorithm that collected job ads posted on the platform from January
1, 2018, to April 30, 2020. For each ad, we know the basic characteristics of the
job, including the job location, the number of vacancies, and some information on
the firm, including the firm name, size, and industry classification. In total, we
collected roughly 20 million job ads, with 104.9 million posted vacancies by more
than 700,000 firms during our sample period.4 We aggregate the post-level job
vacancies to the city-week level, which is the unit of our analysis. The data sample
covers 334 cities and 122 weeks, and, thus, we have 40,414 city-week observations
in total. As shown in Table 1, a city posted an average of about 500 job ads with
about 2,541 vacancies on the platform each week.
    Our job posting data do not include whether a firm trades with foreign coun-
tries. We follow Ahn et al. (20) to identify trade intermediaries by firm names.
Specifically, we define firms as trade intermediaries if their names contain Chinese
characters that mean "importer," "exporter," or "trading companies."5 Using this
method, we define 3.8% of the firms in our sample as trade intermediaries.
    Our primary COVID-19 data source is DXY, the largest online platform run by
the community of Chinese medical professionals. The platform publishes COVID-
19 epidemic data for each Chinese city, and for each foreign country or region, in
almost real time.6 DXY started to publish the data only after the Wuhan lockdown
on January 23, 2020. For epidemic data from earlier dates, we use data from the
Harvard Dataverse. DXY reports the cumulative number of confirmed cases for
each region, from which we calculate the number of newly confirmed cases in each
week, which is the focus of our analysis.7
    We use the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) to
obtain data on policies adopted by governments in response to the pandemic. Ox-
CGRT collects comprehensive and consistent worldwide data on policy responses
to COVID-19, including containment and closure, testing, and monetary and fiscal
policies (22). Given our interest in the global supply chain, we focus on the inter-
national aspect of these policies, which include border control measures that can

examine the impact of COVID-19 in rural China.
    4
      The numbers of vacancies are 44.4 million in 2018, 50.5 million in 2019, and 10.1 million in
the first four months of 2020.
    5
      The list of Chinese words are "mao4yi4" (trade), "jin4kou4" (import), "chu1kou3" (export),
"jin4chu1kou3" (import and export), "ke1mao4" (science and trade), "wai4mao4" (foreign trade),
and "wai4jing1" (foreign economic).
    6
      DXY is also the primary data source of the online interactive dashboard run by the Center
for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (21). If there are missing data
in DXY, we complement it using OxCGRT, which also reports the number of confirmed cases
by country.
    7
      Results are robust using other COVID-19 measures such as the cumulative number of cases.

generate friction to international trade.8 The tracker classifies such measures into
five levels of stringency, ranging from no measure at all to total border closure.9
We also use Chinese Customs data, which cover export and import transactions by
Chinese firms to measure the trade linkages of each Chinese city with the rest of
the world. We aggregate these transactions to calculate, for each city, its imports
from and exports to other countries/regions.
    To examine how foreign COVID-19 shocks affect job creation in China, we also
construct several trade-weighted pandemic and policy response variables. The
variable expCovid (and, respectively, impCovid) is the weighted average of the
number of new cases in all countries, for which the weights are a citys relative
share of export to (and, respectively, import from) each foreign country in the
year 2012, which are the latest customs data available to us.10 Similarly, the trade-
weighted policy response measures expBorderControl and impBorderControl are
the border control policies imposed by each foreign country, weighted by a citys
relative share of exports to and imports from each country/region, respectively.
To measure the exposure of local labor markets to shocks from other domestic
cities, we construct a distance-weighted measure of new cases in each domestic
city, using the inverse city-pair distance as the weight. All technical definitions
of these constructed measures are in the Appendix S1.1. Table 1 presents the
summary statistics of the key variables.

Methods
Formally, we study the impact of COVID-19 on job creation by estimating the
following equation:

             ln(jobsit ) = a1 ln(localCovidit ) + a2 ln(domCovidit )
                         + a3 ln(expCovidit ) + a4 ln(impCovidit )
                         + a5 expBorderControlit + a6 impBorderControlit
                         + Mt + Springt + Autumnt + CityY earit + it ,                          (1)

where the subscripts i and t represent city and week, respectively. We define weeks
using the lunar calendar, starting from the Chinese New Year, as it coincides with
    8
      As a robustness check, we also use a policy index developed by OxCGRT, which captures
different policies DIMITRI.
    9
      The five levels of border controls are 0 = no measures, 1 = screening, 2 = quarantine arrivals
from high-risk regions, 3 = ban on arrivals from some regions, 4 = total border closure. In the
appendix, we show that we obtain a similar result by using a general policy stringency index
that covers other aspects of containment and closure, including lockdown.
   10
      In the appendix, we also present results using measures that are scaled by total exports or
imports divided by GDP for each city. This does not change our results qualitatively.

the week of the Wuhan lockdown (January 23, 2020) and is the start of the Chinese
labor market cycle.11 The dependent variable jobsit is the number of posted jobs
in city i at week t. The two variables localCovid and domCovid are the number of
newly confirmed cases in the city and other cities in China, respectively, capturing
the severity of the pandemic in China. The two trade variables expCovidit and
impCovidit are used to estimate the effects of pandemic outbreaks in trading part-
ners on job creation in Chinese cities through export and import channels, respec-
tively. To disentangle pandemic effects from the effects of policies in response to
the pandemic, we include the trade weighted policy variables expBorderControlit
and impBorderControlit . Below, we report the estimation results from variations
of Eq. (1) as we gradually include more explanatory variables in the regressions.
    All estimated models include the following control variables. We include Mt ,
dummies of the month to capture the seasonal movements in job creation. In
addition, we include Springt and Autumnt , dummies for spring and autumn hiring
seasons. In Appendix Figure S1, we plot the aggregate number of job postings for
each week, which features two major peaks, the spring and autumn hiring seasons
in each year. The spring season is usually right after the Spring Festival, and
the autumn season typically falls in October or November. We construct these
dummies to capture these hot seasons in the job market. CityY earit is a city by
year fixed effect which captures city and year shocks specific to the local labor
market.


Results
In this section, we present the effects on job creation of domestic COVID-19 cases
and those of the global pandemic through the supply chain. For the global sup-
ply chain effects, we disentangle direct COVID-19 trade effects from pandemic-
mitigation policy effects. We also examine whether trade intermediaries fared
differently from other firms.

Overall Job Losses The COVID-19 pandemic had a large impact on job cre-
ation in China. Figure 1 presents a plot of the fall in the number of posted jobs
for each week, compared to the average of the same lunar calendar week in the
years 2018 and 2019.12 At the trough of the line, which is two weeks after the
  11
     Most workers take a vacation of between one to four weeks during the Chinese New Year
and start to search for jobs immediately after. Correspondingly, there is normally a spike of job
postings right after the Chinese New Year.
  12
     The week that follows the Wuhan lockdown is the Spring Festival holiday in China. The
Spring Festival is based on the lunar calendar and falls on different dates on the Gregorian
calendar in different years. For the years 2018 and 2019, the job posting numbers are those


                                               7
week that follows the Wuhan lockdown on January 23, 2020, which we refer to as
"week zero," the number of posted jobs fell by as many as 1.85 million, or 89% rel-
ative to the same lunar period of the previous two years. As the virus subsided in
China and hit the rest of the world six weeks later, Chinas labor demand gradually
rebounded. It stayed below pre-pandemic levels, however, due partly to foreign
COVID-19 shocks. In the 14 weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, the total number
of jobs posted on the platform was 8.36 million, down 31.2% from the average level
in the same period of 2018 and 2019 (about 12.15 million).

Domestic COVID-19 Cases The results from estimating Eq. (1) show that
domestic COVID-19 cases indeed have a large negative effect on job creation. As
shown in Table 2, the coefficient on ln(localCovid) is negative and statistically
significant at the 1% level, suggesting that fewer jobs were created as the number
of new local COVID-19 cases increased. The magnitude of this effect is large. As
seen in column (4), if the number of local newly confirmed cases increases by 1%,
job numbers fall by about 0.18%.
    The results presented in Table 2 also indicate that the pandemic in other parts
of China influences local labor demand. In Columns (2) - (4), the coefficient of
the variable that captures the pandemic in other domestic regions ln(domCovid)
is negative and significant at the 1% level. Therefore, if the novel coronavirus hit
other domestic regions badly, the local job market will suffer, capturing important
domestic cross-city economic linkages. Moreover, comparing the estimated coeffi-
cients in a given city, we can see that the magnitude of the effect in other regions
is similar to that of the local city. We summarize these results into the following
fact.

   Fact 1: In a given Chinese city, COVID-19 cases in both the local city and
other parts of China have large negative impacts on job creation.

Global Supply Chain The severity of the pandemic abroad also reduced local
labor demand through both the direct trade linkage and the pandemic-control
policies. In Column (3) of Table 2, we include variables that measure exposure to
foreign COVID-19 shocks via export demand (ln(expCovid)) and import supply
(ln(impCovid)) channels. Both trade-weighted measures have negative coefficients
and are significant at least at the 10% level. The magnitude of the export-weighted
pandemic variable almost doubles that of the import-weighted variable, suggesting
that the impact of export demand is relatively more important.
    The variation among all trade-weighted pandemic and mitigation policy vari-
ables suggests that border-control policies through the foreign export demand
posted during the three months after the Spring Festival in each year.


                                               8
channel have the largest impact on job creation in China. In Column (4), we
further include variables that capture the exposure to foreign policies created in
response to COVID-19. We find that the trade-weighted pandemic variables them-
selves become small and statistically insignificant. Although the import-weighed
policy variable is also small and insignificant, the export-weighted policy variable
(expBorderControl) is large and statistically significant with a magnitude similar
to those of the domestic pandemic variables. These results suggest that the impact
of the pandemic abroad on local labor demand in Chinese cities is mainly a result
of foreign government policy responses to COVID-19. We summarize the findings
into the following fact.

    Fact 2: Global supply chains transmitted foreign COVID-19 shocks and reduced
job creation in China mostly via policy responses to the pandemic on export de-
mand.

Economic Magnitude of the Effects We use our estimated model (Column
(4)) to disentangle the loss in job creation from each of the pandemic shocks:
local COVID-19, COVID-19 in other domestic cities, foreign COVID-19 shocks
on export and import, and foreign policy shocks on export and import. For each
week, we compute the implied reduction in the number of jobs according to the
estimated coefficients and the observed shock. We then compute the share of the
reduction in job creation attributable to each shock by dividing the implied job
posting reduction from each shock (calculated from the estimated coefficients) by
the total implied reduction. As can be seen in Figure 2, when the epicenter was in
China (Weeks -2 to 6), the negative impact on job creation in a given city was due
mostly to COVID-19 shocks in the local city and other domestic cities.13 As the
pandemic was on the wane in China and surged in the rest of the world (Weeks
7 to 13), the impact of foreign policy responses on export demand loomed large
and became the primary shocks on Chinese local labor demand (78.0% of the total
impact). Out of the 3.79 million new jobs lost in the entire 14-week period of our
study, the contributions to job losses from each source in a given city are 31.0%
(1.16 million jobs) from the local city, 34.0% (1.30 million jobs) from other Chinese
cities, and another 35.0% (1.33 million jobs) from foreign countries, including the
effects of both the pandemic itself and policy responses.

Trading Firms In this subsection, we examine whether the pandemic and re-
lated trade policies affect trade intermediaries differently from other firms. Trade
intermediaries are arguably more exposed to international trade because their main
  13
    We define the epicenter to be in China when the total number of confirmed cases in China
was higher than the rest of the world.


                                             9
business is to be middlemen between foreign buyers/sellers and domestic firms.14
As documented by Ahn et al. (20), trade intermediaries handled 22% of Chinese
exports and 18% of imports in 2005.
     Empirically, we first split firms in a city into two groups, trade intermediaries
and other firms, and then aggregate the job postings by group for each city and
each week. We estimate a slightly varied version of Eq. (1), with a dummy variable
that indicates whether it is a trade intermediary group and its interactions with
the trade and policy variables. The results reported in Table 3 show that both the
pandemic and related policies abroad hurt trade intermediaries more than other
firms. In Columns (1)(4), we report only the interaction terms between the trade
intermediary dummy and other variables. The interaction terms are all negative
and significant, meaning that foreign COVID-19 shocks have a larger impact on
the labor demand of trade intermediaries than other firms.
     We also can examine the impacts of the global supply chain at different times
throughout the COVID-19 outbreak. We expect trade intermediaries to be less
exposed to COVID-19 than other firms when the pandemic first broke out in China
and domestic demand was depressed. When the epicenter moved to the rest of
the world and foreign governments started to impose pandemic mitigation policies,
however, trade intermediaries in China would be expected to suffer more than do
other firms that rely less on the foreign market. To test this, we estimate the
change of job postings for both trade intermediary and other firms for each week
since the outbreak. The change is relative to the normal level in the previous two
years.15 We plot the implied percentage reduction in job loss for both types of
firms in Figure 3.
     As we can see from the figure, before the Wuhan lockdown, the labor demands
of trade intermediaries and other firms followed parallel trends.16 At the beginning
of the outbreak (Weeks 0 to 2), the number of jobs posted by trade intermediaries
fell by a lesser degree than other firms (60% versus 80%). Trade intermediaries,
however, underperformed compared to other firms when the virus started to hit
the rest of the world; in particular, trade intermediaries missed the large recovery
spike of other firms that occurred in Week 9. Overall, job postings by trade
  14
     Firms that export directly typically sell both at home and abroad, but exports capture only
a small share of total sales. According to Bernard et al. (23), 18% of U.S. manufacturing firms
exported in 2002, but exports made up 14% of total sales.

     See Eq. S5 in the appendix.

     We formally tested the difference between trade intermediaries and other firms by estimating
a difference-in-differences model. The coefficients that capture the difference between the two
types of firms over time are shown in Figure S2. Instead of looking at the difference week-
by-week, we have also done a robustness check which divides the sample into 3 periods: pre-
pandemic, epicenter in China, and epicenter outside China; then, we compare the performance
of trade intermediaries versus other firms. We also use an alternative method to identify trade
intermediaries. Overall, we find similar patterns. The results are in appendix S4.


                                               10
intermediaries remained 60% lower than pre-pandemic levels, while job postings
by other firms gradually outperformed trade intermediaries. To summarize, we
present the following fact.

    Fact 3: Trade intermediaries, which were more exposed to foreign COVID-
19 shocks, outperformed other firms when the epicenter was in China but under-
performed as the epicenter moved out of China.


Conclusion
Using big data collected from 100 million posted jobs in China, we empirically
demonstrate that the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic can be transmitted along
global supply chains. We show that, via the global supply chain, COVID-19 cases
abroad and, in particular, pandemic-control policies by foreign governments re-
duced new job creation in China by 11.0%. We also find that Chinese firms most
exposed to international trade outperformed other firms at the beginning of the
pandemic but underperformed during the recovery as the novel coronavirus spread
throughout the world. Our findings regarding the importance of global supply
chains in the transmission of the COVID-19 shock across national borders suggest
the importance of global cooperation in the fight against the pandemic and the
spread of the novel coronavirus. As long as the pandemic is still raging in some
parts of the world, there is a chance for a second or even third wave of infections
in some parts of the world. As such, our results suggest that, for the global econ-
omy to recover as quickly as possible from the deep pandemic-induced recession,
countries need to work together due to the close linkages of global production.
Recoveries in other countries will serve as a force that pulls the rest of the world
out of the recession, whereas "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies will only prolong the
recession.

             during the COVID-19 outbreak in China compared to the average of the years 2018 and
             2019. To ensure that the weeks are comparable across years, we align the data to the lunar
             calendar and set Week 0 of 2018 and 2019 to the week of the Spring Festival. From Weeks
             0 to 13, the cumulative job loss was 3.79 million, representing a 31.2% loss in local labor
             demand.

                      Figure 2: Contribution to reduction in job creation by component
   Notes. In this figure, the bars plot the contribution of each shock to the reduction in job
   creation, according to the estimation result shown in Column (4) of Table 2.We compute
   the implied reduction in the number of jobs according to the estimated coefficients and the
   observed shocks. We then compute the share of each shock by dividing the implied reduction
   in job creation for a shock by the total implied reduction. The definition of each shock is
   provided in Table 1.

Appendix
S1      Technical Details
S1.1     Measurements
To capture the foreign COVID-19 shocks, we construct the following variables,

                            expCovidit =          expij Njt ,                  (S1)
                                             j

which captures export demand shocks, and

                           impCovidit =           impij Njt ,                  (S2)
                                             j

which captures import supply shocks, where expij is the share of city i's exports
to foreign region j , impij is the share of city i's imports from j , and Njt is the
number of newly confirmed cases in region j at period t. Similarly, we measure
the exposure of each city to foreign COVID-19 policies using

                expBorderControlit =            expij BorderControljt ,        (S3)
                                         j

                impBorderControlit =            impij BorderControljt .
                                         j

where BorderControljt is the border control policy imposed by region j at period
t. To measure the exposure of local labors market to shocks from other domestic
cities, we construct the following variable

                                                   1/distik
                    domesticCovidit =                            Nkt ,         (S4)
                                         k =i      j =i 1/distij


which weights the exposure of city i to the pandemic in city k in terms of the num-
ber of cases Nkt by the inverse of the great-circle distance 1/distik . We normalize
the weights such that they add up to one.

S1.2     Estimating equation for trading firms and other firms
To compare the impact of the COVID-19 shock on trade intermediaries versus
other firms, we split firms in a given city into two groups: trade intermediaries
and other firms, and then aggregate the job postings by group for each city and

                                        A1
each week. Then we define dummies Interikt and Othersikt = 1 - Interikt for trade
intermediaries and other firms, respectively. We then run the following regression,

                               M                             M
  ln(jobsikt ) = Interikt +           · Interikt · T -t +           · Othersikt · T -t +
                               =-m                           =-m

                              + Mt + Springt + Autumnt + CityY earit +          ikt ,   (S5)

where T -t is a time dummy which equals one if time t is  periods away from
the Wuhan Lockdown.  and  are the coefficients of interest which capture
how job postings by trade intermediaries and other firms evolved before and after
the lockdown. To obtain the difference between  and  , we can substitute
Othersikt = 1 - Interikt into Eq. (S5) and get the following equation

                               M                             M
  ln(jobsikt ) = Interikt +           · Interikt · T -t +          d T -t
                               =-m                           =-m

                              + Mt + Springt + Autumnt + CityY earit +          ikt ,   (S6)

where  =  -  . We plot the estimated  and associated ninety-five percent
confidence intervals in Figure S2.

 Notes. The dependant variable is the number of job ads in each city. The control variables
 are time dummies that capture major hiring seasons in the spring and autumn. To address
 the issue of zeros in the data, we do an ln(1 + x) transformation for variables with zeros.
 The models are estimated using the Stata reghdfe package developed by (24), which drops
 singletons during estimation. The numbers in the parentheses are robust standard errors,
 clustered at the provincial level. Significance levels are indicated by *, **, *** at 0.1, 0.05,
 and 0.01, respectively.

Notes. In this table, the numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in domestic cities and
foreign regions/countries are normalized by the local population. When considering foreign
COVID-19 shocks faced by a Chinese city, we scale the shocks by the city export to GDP ratio
and import to GDP ratio (variables with prefix "ScaledExp" and "ScaledImp," respectively).
For the policy variables ("ScaledExpPolicy" and "ScaledImpPolicy"), we consider a wider
spectrum of policies used by governments to contain the epidemic than border controls. The
control variables are time dummies that capture major hiring seasons in spring and autumn.
The models are estimated using the Stata reghdfe package developed by Correia (24), which
drops singletons during the estimation. The numbers in the parentheses are robust standard
errors clustered at the provincial level. Significance levels are indicated by *, **, *** at 0.1,
0.05, and 0.01, respectively.

  negative observations. The control variables are time dummies which capture major hiring
  seasons in spring and autumn. The models are estimated using the Stata reghdfe package

S4     Additional results for trading firms
Instead of estimating a dynamic difference-in-difference specification given by Eq.
(S6), we estimate the following specification

  ln(jobsikt ) = Interikt + 1 T1t + 2 T2t + 1 Interikt · T1t + 2 Interikt · T2t
                            + Mt + Springt + Autumnt + CityY earit + ikt (S7)

T1t is a time dummy for periods in which the epicenter was China (from the
week of Wuhan lockdown to Week 6), and T2t is a dummy for periods in which
the epicenter was outside China (Weeks 7 - 13). The result of the estimation is
shown in Table S4. According to Column (1), the number of jobs posted by trade
intermediaries is much lower than that of other firms in general. As expected, when
the coronavirus hit China, firms reduced their job postings, and as the epicenter
moved outside China, there was a slight recovery of job creation. In Column (2),
when we introduce the interaction term, we find that trade intermediaries' job
postings fell by less than other firms. However, as the epicenter moved outside
China, their job postings fell much deeper than other firms. A similar pattern
holds for the number of job ads when we look at Columns (3) and (4).
    So far, we have defined firms to be trade intermediaries by their names, which
might miss other firms which also participate in international trade directly. To
deal with such concern, we exploit another a variable in our job posting data which
describes the main business of the firm. We look for Chinese characters meaning
"import", "export", or "trade". Together with information from the firm name,
we enlarge the sample of trade firms to about 10 percent of the population of firms
in our data. Using the broader definition of trading firms, we again estimate Eq.
(S7). Table S5 presents the estimation results. Overall, we find a pattern similar
to the results in Table S4.
