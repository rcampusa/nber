                                         ABSTRACT

How readily do potential migrants respond to increased returns to migration? Even if origin areas
become less attractive vis-à-vis migration destinations, fixed costs can prevent increased
migration. We examine migration responses to hurricanes, which reduce the attractiveness of
origin locations. Restricted-access U.S. Census data allows precise migration measures and
analysis of more migrant-origin countries. Hurricanes increase U.S. immigration, with the effect
increasing in the size of prior migrant stocks. Large migrant networks reduce fixed costs by
facilitating legal immigration from hurricane-affected source countries. Hurricane-induced
immigration can be fully accounted for by new legal permanent residents (“green card” holders).

1     Introduction
Moving from one’s country of origin is among the most consequential decisions
a person can make. Substantial numbers of people migrate internationally: esti-
mates of migration over the five-year periods between 1990-95 and 2006-10 range
from 34 to 41 million international migrants, or roughly 0.6% of world population
(Abel and Sander, 2014). Substantially larger numbers—more than 600 million
adults—express a desire to move permanently to another country (Pelham and Tor-
res, 2008). Labor migration to the developed world leads to large income gains for
migrants,1 which benefit not only the migrants themselves but also those remaining
behind in origin countries. Remittances sent by migrants to their home countries
amounted to $432 billion in 2015, far exceeding official development assistance
(World Bank Group 2016). There is substantial evidence that international out-
migration, and the remittances that subsequently flow back to origin areas, generate
benefits at the household level in developing countries.2 Additionally, aggregate
gains in global economic output from freer international labor mobility are esti-
mated to be very large.3
    For all these reasons, it is important to understand the economics of international
migration decisions. The seminal work of Sjaastad (1962) remains a basic and use-
ful framework for such analysis. Individuals choose whether to stay at lower-wage
home locations or to bear a fixed cost and migrate to a higher-wage destination.
This parsimonious model makes a fundamental prediction: an increase in the return
to migration should lead to greater increase in migration when the fixed cost of mi-
gration is lower. In this paper, our goal is to provide a convincing empirical test of
this prediction.
    We exploit exogenous variation in the returns to migration, as well as substantial
cross-sectional variation in a key determinant of the fixed cost of migration. Our

outcome of interest is annual U.S. immigration rates from 1980 through 2004 for
each observable origin location, as constructed from restricted-access Census data.
Variation over time in the return to migration from specific origin areas is generated
by hurricanes, which exogenously lower the attractiveness of remaining in one’s
origin area.4 Our measure of the fixed cost of migration is the size of migrant
networks in the U.S., as measured by the stock of previous migrants. Larger migrant
stocks can lower the fixed costs of migration in a number of ways. Most directly,
prior migrants create a less costly, legal route to immigration for their compatriots
through family reunification immigration policies (Jasso and Rosenzweig, 1989).
They can also play a role in closing information gaps in the labor and housing
markets for incoming migrants.5 We thus examine whether increases in the returns
to migration driven by origin-country hurricanes have larger impacts on migration
from countries that have larger pre-existing migrant networks in the U.S.
    We find that hurricanes cause immediate increases in U.S. immigration on aver-
age. This effect is magnified among origin countries with larger pre-existing stocks
of U.S. immigrants, consistent with our hypothesis. Our estimates indicate that the
effect of hurricanes on migration is positive for countries with a migrant stock in
the U.S. (as share of 1980 population) of at least 0.86%—roughly the 70th per-
centile across countries.6 For a country at the 90th percentile of the prior migrant
stock (5.6% of origin population), a one-standard-deviation increase in our mea-
sure of hurricane affectedness causes an inflow amounting to 0.029% of the origin
population.
    A key question is whether the migrant stock should be interpreted primarily as
a proxy for migration-related fixed costs, or whether it stands in for some other
omitted variable that is responsible for heterogeneity in the migration response to

Rasmussen (2004) and Auffret (2003) find that the negative effects of natural disasters may be larger
in developing countries.

    6 In the regression where the effect of hurricanes is allowed to vary with respect to the size of a

country’s prior U.S. migrant stock, the main effect of hurricanes is negative (although not statistically
significantly different from zero).


                                                   2
hurricanes. We take two approaches to address this question. First, we seek evi-
dence for mechanisms behind the heterogeneous effect. It appears that a key role
played by migrant stocks is formally sponsoring relatives for legal, permanent im-
migration. If we replace our dependent variable of interest with legal immigration
counts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), our coefficient esti-
mates are strikingly similar. The full magnitude of the observed hurricane-induced
immigration (from estimates using U.S. Census data) can be explained by legal,
permanent immigration (from estimates using U.S. administrative data on immi-
gration). Furthermore, this legal, permanent immigration is driven primarily by
different forms of family sponsorship. These findings are strongly suggestive that
migrant stocks reduce the fixed cost of migration by providing access to legal im-
migration channels.
    Our second approach to addressing omitted-variable concerns is to gauge the
stability of our key parameter, the coefficient on the hurricane-migrant stock inter-
action term, to the inclusion of additional control variables for other origin country
characteristics, such as per capita GDP, distance from the U.S., and land area.7 We
show that the coefficient on our interaction term of interest is highly robust to in-
clusion of interaction terms with these other country characteristics. We therefore
argue that hurricanes have heterogeneous effects across countries due to migrant
stocks themselves, and not some other origin-country characteristic that may be
correlated with migrant stocks.
    Our work has a number of features that distinguish it from past research. Most
importantly, to our knowledge this paper is among the first to rigorously test, us-
ing plausibly exogenous variation in migration returns, a fundamental prediction
of standard models: that the migration response to changes in migration returns
will be larger when fixed migration costs are lower. Most previous work has ex-
amined the relationship between migration and either the costs of migration, on the
one hand, or the returns to migration, on the other, but not the interaction between
the two. Aside from the importance of confirming the theoretical prediction, this
question has substantial policy relevance. Shocks to the returns to migration are
   7 Because our coefficient of interest is on an interaction term with hurricanes, these predetermined

control variables must also be included as interaction terms in the same way.



                                                  3
pervasive, and of particular interest are shocks to economic and social conditions
in migrant source countries due to causes such as war, political changes, or natural
disasters. Policy-makers in destination countries would benefit from a better under-
standing of the determinants of migrant inflows that may result from such shocks.
A closely related paper is Clemens (2017), who finds that previous migration plays
a key facilitating role in determining the migratory response of Central Americans
to violence in their home municipalities.
     A second distinguishing feature of our work is that it focuses on immigration
to the U.S., the world’s largest migration destination. Migration to the U.S. ac-
counted for 18.5% of global international migration flows from 1990-2010 (Abel
and Sander, 2014). Conducting our analysis in the context of such an important
and large migration destination reduces concern about external validity of the find-
ings. Furthermore, because our unit of analysis is annual flows from all other loca-
tions worldwide, we can exploit considerable cross-sectional and temporal variation
across countries in hurricane-induced shocks to migration returns, as well as cross-
sectional variation in fixed costs across origin locations.
     Finally, this study makes advances related to data. To our knowledge, this is the
first empirical analysis of U.S. immigration that uses restricted-access U.S. Cen-
sus data to construct country-by-year inflow estimates. With access to full 1-in-6
long-form responses to the U.S. Census, our measures of prior migration stocks and
annual migration flows are more precise than any previous survey-based estimates
used to examine the causal determinants of U.S. immigration from particular source
countries. Importantly, we are also able to include many more origin countries in
our sample than are visible in the public-access U.S. Census data, since the pub-
lic data suppresses country identifiers with small respondent counts. This allows
us to analyze migration flows from a larger sample of countries, and provides ad-
ditional identifying variation because many small countries (e.g., island nations)
are also hurricane-prone. We supplement these data with administrative records on
U.S. legal immigration from the DHS. Finally, we construct hurricane-affectedness
measures from satellite-based meteorological data, which are less prone to mea-
surement error than more commonly-used disaster damage data that are assembled
from reports of aid institutions, governments, or news agencies (Yang, 2008a).


                                          4
     Our work is generally related to the body of research on migration responses to
the returns to migration, and particularly related to work emphasizing causal iden-
tification by focusing on the impact of exogenous shocks.8 A number of studies
have found that increases in the returns to migration, driven by shocks in either
sending or receiving areas, do increase net outmigration. In some studies the iden-
tifying variation comes from shocks in the source locations,9 while in others the
variation in returns is generated by shocks in destination locations.10 Other stud-
ies have found the opposite—that increases in the returns to migration driven by
negative shocks in home areas lead to less outmigration (Halliday, 2006; Yang and
Choi, 2007; Yang, 2008c). The latter set of findings may reflect the importance of
migration fixed costs in combination with liquidity or credit constraints.11 Bazzi
(2017) finds that positive income shocks in origin areas in Indonesia lead to less
migration in wealthier areas and more in poorer ones, which he ascribes to the role
of liquidity constraints when there is a fixed cost of migration.
     In examining the responsiveness of migration to negative shocks in source coun-
tries, our work is related to the large body of work on how households in developing
countries cope with risk.12 In particular, there is evidence that migration and remit-
tances serve a risk-coping role, either ex ante (prior to shocks),13 or ex post (after
shocks occur).14 Our findings suggest that migration is an international risk-coping
   8 There   is also a body of work that examines the empirical correlation between migration and
home-country wealth or income. Key examples include Hatton and Williamson (1998), Abramitzky
et al. (2012), and Mayda (2010). The literature on the “mobility transition,” a well-documented
inverted-U-shaped cross-sectional relationship between country income and outmigration, is re-
viewed by Clemens (2014).

prior migrant stocks to reduce fixed costs of migration.
    This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline a simple theoretical
framework that provides predictions and guides interpretation of results. Section
3 provides a brief overview of U.S. immigration policy during our study period.
Section 4 describes the data used in the empirical analyses, and Section 5 reports
empirical results. Section 6 concludes.

2     Theory
We follow in the tradition of Sjaastad (1962) by modeling migrants as agents who
compare the present discounted value of net income streams in destination areas
and origin areas. A substantial subsequent literature has built on this starting point
with the primary aim of examining migrant selectivity.15 A subset of the literature
explicitly takes account of migration fixed costs.16 McKenzie and Rapoport (2010)
adapt the notation of Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) to consider migration fixed costs
that decline in the size of the migrant network at destination, and we follow their
formulation. The literature tends to focus on implications of the theory for migrant
selectivity (the extent to which the migration decision depends on relative returns to
skill across migrant origin and destination). Instead, we focus on a key prediction of
this model that has been under-emphasized: that the migration response to changes
in the returns to migration will depend on the size of migration fixed costs. Because
it is not our focus, we suppress consideration of migrant selectivity.

                                                    6
2.1   Basic setup
Consider an individual in their “home” (non-U.S.) country deciding whether or
not to migrate to the “foreign” country (the U.S.). Let wh be the present value
of the flow of the individual’s future income in the home country, and w f be the
corresponding value for the foreign country. To simplify matters, we consider a
one-time decision to migrate permanently to the foreign country.
    Migration involves a fixed cost C, which we presume is a function of the mi-
grant’s network n. Previous work on migration networks suggests that the fixed cost
of migration is lower when an individual has a larger migrant network, meaning
C0 < 0 (Massey et al., 1994; Carrington et al., 1996; Kanbur and Rapoport, 2005;
Bauer et al., 2005). This could be true for a number of reasons. As emphasized in
previous research, networks could help reduce search and information costs (e.g.,
related to legal and illegal modes of entry, employment, housing, etc.), provide so-
cial support during adjustment (a reduction in psychic costs), and sponsor relatives
for legal immigration (allowing migrants to avoid costlier illegal entry routes and
costly wait times imposed by quotas).17
    Express migration costs in “time-equivalent” units (as a fraction of the present
value of income flows in the foreign country):

                                                    C (n)
                                        π (n) =           .
                                                     wf
Assuming π is small, individuals migrate if:

                                       
                                 ln w f − π (n) > ln (wh ) .

Because migration costs C (n) decrease with migrant network size, so do time-
equivalent migration costs π (n). Express the natural log of time-equivalent mi-
gration costs as ln (π) = µ − γn, where γ > 0.
    Now, the condition for migration can be written as:
  17 These  points have been emphasized by Massey (1988), Orrenius (1999), Orrenius and Zavodny
(2005), Comola and Mendola (2015), and Dolfin and Genicot (2010). Networks could also provide
financial assistance with paying fixed migration costs, which would be important in contexts where
potential migrants are liquidity or credit constrained.



                                                7
                                   
                             ln w f − eµ−γn > ln (wh ) .                          (1)

In this set-up, we can represent the individual’s choice graphically. In Figure 1,
the size of the migrant network n is on the horizontal axis, while the vertical axis
is monetary value in logs. The right hand side of inequality (1) is the solid line
at ln w0h , which is horizontal because home-country income does not depend on
         

network size. The left hand side of inequality (1) is represented by the solid upward-
sloping curve: because migration costs decline in n, the net present value of the
income stream in the foreign country rises in n. Individuals who choose to migrate
are those with network size above the threshold n0 , whose migration fixed costs are
low enough to make migration worthwhile.
    Now consider the impact of a negative shock to home economic conditions, so
that the present value of the home income stream declines from w0h to w1h . (In the
empirics, we will interpret hurricanes as having this effect.) This is represented by
a downward shift of the horizontal line representing the value of not migrating to
the horizontal dashed line at ln w1h .
                                    

2.2   Negative home shock does not affect migration costs
If the negative home-country shock has no effect on migration costs, the analysis is
straightforward. This leads a new set of individuals to choose to migrate, since now
the threshold network size for migration has fallen from n0 to n1 in Figure 1.
     Within the population of those who had not migrated prior to the negative shock
to the home economy, those migrating will be those with differentially higher net-
work size (in the range from n1 to n0 ). Those with lower network size (below n1 )
will continue to remain in the home country.
2.3   Negative home shock affects migration costs
Predictions on the hurricane effect become ambiguous if the negative shock to the
home economy does affect migration costs. It is most plausible that negative home-
country shocks would raise migration costs. Loss of assets due to hurricanes could
make it more difficult for credit-constrained households to pay the fixed migration
costs. Negative shocks at home could make it more difficult to obtain credit to pay


                                          8
for the fixed costs of migration (Yang, 2008c), or could raise the opportunity cost
of departure (Halliday, 2006). Negative aggregate shocks could also have general
equilibrium effects that make it more difficult to pay the fixed costs of migration,
such as reductions in asset prices (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1993) or wages (Jay-
achandran, 2006). In addition, increased demand for legal migration assistance
as well as illegal migration services (migration smugglers or coyotes) could raise
equilibrium prices for those services.
    Imagine simply that the negative shock, a hurricane, raises the natural log of
time-equivalent migration costs by H, so that ln (π) = µ − γn + H. We can rewrite
this as π = eµ−γn+H , so the condition determining migration becomes:

                                        
                                  ln w f − eµ−γn+H > ln (wh )                                    (2)

    It now becomes possible for a negative shock to either increase or decrease
migration. These possibilities are also represented in Figure 1. A negative shock
now also leads the curved line (the left hand side of inequality 2) to shift down-
ward. If the increase in the log of time-equivalent migration costs is low (say Hlo ),
the downward shift is small, illustrated by the shift to the dashed curve labeled
       
ln w f − eµ−γn+Hlo . The net effect is still for migration to increase: the threshold
network size for migration falls from n0 to n2 .
    On the other hand, if the shift is large enough (such as to the dotted curve in
Figure 1, representing a larger increase in the log of time-equivalent migration
costs Hhi ), then, migration can actually decline—the threshold for migration ac-
tually rises from n0 to n3 .
    In sum, then, the theoretical predictions are ambiguous: negative shocks to eco-
nomic conditions in the home country could increase migration by increasing the
return to migration. It is also possible for negative home-country shocks to reduce
migration, if such shocks themselves increase the fixed costs of migration, or reduc-
ing ability to pay migration fixed costs. Crucially, however, regardless of whether
negative income shocks induce or impede migration, the interaction effect between
these shocks and network size is unambiguously positive.18 We thus seek to both

which we turn in Section 5.

3    Immigration Policy During the Sample Frame
Before moving to our analysis, we summarize U.S. immigration policy from 1980
through 2004. The workings of U.S. immigration policy help us highlight features
of immigrant stock networks that help facilitate immigration.
    The outline of today’s U.S. immigration policy regime has its origins in the
1965 Amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act. This legislation abol-
ished preferential treatment for Europeans and created a system in which a majority
of visas were allocated to relatives of U.S. citizens of residents. It was also the first
law to distinguish between immediate relatives (spouses, children under age 21,
and parents) of U.S. citizens, who became exempt from quotas, and other types
of immigrants who fell into one of seven new preference tiers subject to numeri-
cal limitations (Kandel, 2016). Further, by 1979, all country-specific quotas were
abandoned in favor of an overall quota. In 1981, the overall quota stood at 270,000
for all those subject to the cap (Clark et al., 2007). Among the capped tiers, first
preference goes to unmarried adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, second pref-
erence goes to spouses and children of green card holders (LPRs), third preference
goes to married sons and daughters of U.S. citizens, and fourth preference goes to
siblings of U.S. citizens. Thus, while green card holders can sponsor a limited set
of relatives from home, they are substantially constrained in this ability relative to
naturalized immigrants.
    The major change to policy that occurred during our sample period was the
Immigration Act of 1990, which increased allowable total immigration to 675,000
and increased the limit of family-based immigrants subject to quotas from 290,000
to 480,000 (Kandel, 2016). Technically, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens came
under this 480,000 cap for the first time, but in practice, the cap is “permeable”
and inflows of such migrants remain uncapped to the present day. The remaining
                                                                       d2 L
is from reaching the cutoff that causes her to migrate. We then have   dHdn   = γeµ−γn+H > 0 where
                  d 2 ln(wh )
we have assumed dHdn = 0. Evidence for this assumption is shown in Section C of the Appendix.
Thus, an individual below the cutoff is pushed further towards it when a hurricane hits if they have
a larger pre-existing network.


                                                10
195,000 allotments are slotted for employment visas (140,000) and a new category
of “diversity” visas (55,000) allocated to countries that did not send many migrants
to the U.S. between 1965 and 1990 (Clark et al., 2007).
    An additional change that occurred during our sample period was the 1986 Im-
migration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which granted legal status to millions
of undocumented workers. While this legislation had many consequences, it mainly
affects our results through its disproportionate legalization of migrants from certain
countries, perhaps creating a positive shock in the effective stock of network capital
in the United States for these countries. This is especially true given how important
legal status and citizenship are to being able to serve as a beach head for compatriots
under the current regime. A more minor point is that the legal permanent resident
(LPR) status granted to these previously undocumented workers clearly did not re-
sult from new entries into the United States. We will thus subtract these “inflows”
from our overall measure of LPR admissions in the DHS data.

4     Data
4.1     Sample Definition
Our sample consists of foreign territories listed in Table A1 of the Online Appendix.
Given how often many of these areas are hit by hurricanes and because of the level
of detail our data affords us, we treat many non-sovereign territories as separate
countries (e.g., Guadeloupe or Martinique).19 We drop countries that are U.S. ter-
ritories because of their preferential treatment in immigration policy. We also drop
countries from the former Soviet Union and the European land mass.20 North Ko-
rea and Eritrea are excluded because of a lack of reliable migration information
for the entire sample period. Additionally, some countries that contain inconsis-
tent migration information due to border redefinition are combined to retain consis-
tency throughout the sample period. These include the Netherlands Antilles minus
    19 From
          this point forward, use of the word “country” includes these non-sovereign territories.
    20 The
         splitting of the Soviet Union does not enable us to have reliable migration information for
these countries throughout the sample period. Europe is rarely hit by hurricanes, and because it
contains mostly developed countries is not likely to provide a useful migration counterfactual.

Aruba,21 Sudan,22 and Guadeloupe.23 Finally, we also drop any country without an
immigrant stock estimate from the 1980 Census. This left us with a balanced panel
of 159 countries.
4.2   Hurricane Index
Hurricanes are storms that originate over tropical oceans with wind speeds above 33
knots.24 These severe storms create damages through storm surges, strong winds,
and flooding, and their radius of impact can be anywhere from 60 to 900 miles.
Thus, depending on the severity of the storm, there is a wide scope for hurricanes
to inflict extensive damage, particularly when infrastructure is weak and production
is agriculture-oriented. Hurricanes occur in six basins: Atlantic, East Pacific, West
Pacific, South Pacific, South Indian, and North Indian. Yang (2008a) provides a
more detailed definition of hurricanes and their architecture.
    We construct a hurricane index representing the average hurricane exposure of
residents in a given country-year following Yang (2008a). This index uses data from
meteorological records, rather than impact estimates compiled from news reports,
governments, or other similar sources due to concerns about measurement error and
potential misreporting of hurricane damages (motivated, for example, by a desire to
attract greater international disaster assistance). The meteorological data on hurri-
canes consists of “best tracks” compiled by Unisys from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration’s Tropical Prediction Center (for the Atlantic and East
Pacific hurricane basins) and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (for the West Pa-
cific, South Pacific, South Indian, and North Indian hurricane basins).25 The best
tracks contain information on the hurricane’s maximum wind speed and the geo-
graphic coordinates of its center (or “eye”) at six-hour intervals. Figure 2 displays
all hurricane best tracks from 1980 through 2004.
    The best track data naturally take hurricanes as the unit of analysis, and so
  21 Curacao,   Bonaire, Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. The Netherlands Antilles was not
dissolved until 2010.
   22 South Sudan and Sudan. South Sudan broke off from Sudan in 2011
   23 Guadeloupe and St. Barthelemy. St. Barthelemy broke off from Guadeloupe in 2003.
   24 Hurricanes are also known in different regions as typhoons and cyclones. For simplicity, in this

paper hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclones will all be referred to as hurricanes.
   25 http://weather.unisys.com/hurricane/. From this point forward hurricanes, typhoons, and cy-

clones will all be referred to as hurricanes.

in their raw form give no indication of countries affected. Section A of the Online
Appendix describes in detail how we turn this best track data into a country-by-year
index. Other papers have utilized similar hurricane indices to study their impacts on
various outcomes on land masses (Strobl, 2011; Strobl and Walsh, 2009; Ouattara
and Strobl, 2014; Hsiang and Jina, 2014; Hsiang, 2010). All use a model based on
best tracks to simulate the wind speed faced by geographical areas a certain distance
away from the best track line.26
    The resulting index can be described as “intensity-weighted hurricane events per
capita,” in which intensity is a nonlinear function of hurricane-force wind speed.
The key features of this index are that it measures the average “affectedness” by
hurricanes for residents of a country in a given year. It rises in the number of hurri-
canes affecting a country, the share of the population affected, and in the intensity
(wind speed) of the hurricanes to which people were exposed. In Table 1 we pro-
vide basic summary statistics of the hurricane index. Out of 3,895 country-year
observations, 641 have non-zero values of the index. The standard deviation of the
non-zero values is 0.0520.
4.3     Immigrants in the United States: Stocks and Inflows
4.3.1    U.S. Census Bureau
The primary source for our immigration data is confidential data provided by the
U.S. Census Bureau, who granted us access to the full set of responses from the
1980 and 2000 Long Form Censuses along with the 2005 through 2015 American
Community Survey (ACS) 1-year files. The 1980 and 2000 Census Long Form pro-
vide 1 in 6 counts of all persons living in the United States along with demographic
information. The ACS 1-year files provide a one percent sample of all persons
living in the United States in a given year. Online Appendix Section B describes
how we utilize these data sources to construct two key variables: sending-country-
by-year estimates of migration inflow rates (m jt ) and sending country estimates of
1980 U.S. immigrant stocks (s j,1980 ).
  26 Strobl (2011) uses population weights when measuring the effect of hurricanes on economic
activity, while Hsiang and Jina (2014) do not.




                                             13
4.3.2   Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Our second source of migration inflow data comes from the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS). In addition to producing the annual Yearbook of Immigration
Statistics (1996-2015), the DHS houses the records of the former Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS), who produced similar publications for past years ti-
tled the Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (prior
to 1996). Starting in 1982, these annual publications contain counts of legal perma-
nent residence (LPR) statuses granted by country of last residence, which we use to
construct an alternate measure of migration inflows. They also contain information
on non-immigrant entries into the U.S. by country of birth and class of admission
starting in 1983, which we use to construct a new panel that measures potentially
temporary migration.27 Data through 1996 are available only as hard-copy portable
documents. We thus double-entered and cross-checked each relevant table to ensure
accuracy in these outcome variables.28
    The DHS data provides some important advantages over our confidential Cen-
sus data beyond their use as a robustness check. First, the counts were all taken offi-
cially during the year of a given immigrant’s receipt of LPR status or non-immigrant
entry and thus do not suffer from attrition due to death or return migration. Second,
in the case of LPR entries, country of last residence provides a more direct indicator
of hurricane-induced migration than country of birth. Third, the DHS data allows
us to separate classes of LPR admission, such as uncapped family reunification,
capped family sponsorship, and refugees. This allows us to examine whether eligi-
bility for immigration due to family-reunification policies is a mechanism through
which our effects operate.
    Finally, the non-immigrant entry panel allows us to understand two additional
facets of hurricane-induced migration into the United States. First, it helps us assess
whether there is a component of such migration that is potentially temporary. Sec-
ond, it helps us elucidate the phenomenon of conditional entry followed by either a
  27 According to the DHS Office of Immigration Statistics, non-immigrant data is not available in

1997 due to concerns about data quality in that year.

Library’s General Collection.

switch of status or an overstay on a temporary visa, a process through which much
legal and illegal permanent migration occurs.
    There are, however, also drawbacks to the DHS data that highlight its comple-
mentarity with our estimates from the confidential Census Bureau data. First, the
DHS LPR measures do not distinguish between new inflows and changes in status
from temporary to permanent residence. Second and relatedly, backlogs and back-
log reduction efforts create uncertainty around how reliably the DHS estimates can
be used to measure changes in actual entries—as compared to switches in status
from temporary to permanent—over time. Third, the DHS data cannot shed light
on undocumented entries, while these may be captured by the Census and ACS sur-
veys (which purposely do not inquire about legal status.)29 Fourth, while it contains
information about class of admission, the DHS does not allow us to examine many
other important demographic characteristics of migrants, such as age. Finally, nei-
ther the Census nor the DHS data can correct for migrants who still live abroad but
whom obtain a green card (LPR status) to engage in repeated circular migration
(Redstone and Massey, 2004).

5      Analysis
5.1     Specification
In order to test the theoretical implications described in Section 2, we exploit the
exogeneity of our objective hurricane index and conduct reduced form analyses that
test its impact on migration inflows to the U.S. For this purpose, we rely primarily
on two specifications:

                     y jt = β0 + β1 H jt + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt                           (3)
                     y jt = γ0 + γ1 H jt + γ2 (H jt × s j,1980 ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt   (4)

where y jt is an outcome and t runs from 1980 through 2004. Our primary results are
for y jt = m jt where m jt is the number of immigrants from country j to the U.S. in
year t as a proportion of country j’s population in 1980. Analogously, s j,1980 is the
stock of immigrants from country j already in the U.S. in 1980 as a proportion of
    29 Individuals
                 who are captured in the DHS non-immigrant data may enter legally and then later
overstay their visas, becoming undocumented.

                                                      15
country j’s population in 1980. Including stocks as a proportion of 1980 population
also allows us to interpret s j,1980 as a rough measure of likelihood a given migrant
knows someone in the U.S.
    The inclusion of year fixed-effects (δt ) accounts for time-varying changes in
the overall ability of foreigners to migrate to the United States. Common issues
such as changing demand in the U.S. economy and back-logs in the immigration
system that are not country-specific are important components of δt . Country-fixed
effects, η j control for fixed factors that affect how likely denizens of country j are
to migrate to the U.S., such as distance. They also absorb the main effect of s j,1980 .
We also allow for differential country-specific linear time trends with the inclusion
of φ j t, which account for long-run linear trends in migration from country j to the
U.S. Standard errors are clustered at the country level (Bertrand et al., 2004).
    Our main hypothesis is that γ2 > 0 when y jt = m jt . Exogenous natural disasters
such as hurricanes will serve as an impetus for migration when there is a sufficient
stock in the U.S. to facilitate the process. The coefficients β1 and γ1 are theoretically
ambiguous. In the presence of credit constraints, an asset or income shock created
by a hurricane could prevent migration by reducing the ability of sending country
denizens from paying the fixed costs necessary to leave. On the other hand, the
income shock could exacerbate the income gap for unconstrained sending country
denizens, pushing those at the margin to engage in migration. We do, however,
expect that γ1 < β1 , given that β1 absorbs the effect for high-stock countries.
5.2   Results
In Online Appendix Section C, we first establish that our hurricane index captures
events that create economically relevant losses in potential sending countries. In
the context of our theoretical framework from Section 2, we interpret these losses
as an increase in the return to migration to the U.S. by decreasing wh in the form
of asset losses, personal harm, and longer-run declines in economic growth. We
focus here on our primary results, with m jt —immigrant inflows from country j in
year t as a proportion of country j’s 1980 population—as the outcome of interest.
As described in Section B of the Online Appendix, m jt is created using access
to confidential data from the U.S. Census Bureau. These data allow us to create


                                           16
accurate counts of immigrant inflows to the U.S., even for small countries that often
go overlooked in such studies. Additional results demonstrating that our results are
not due to outlier countries, either on the migration or hurricane dimension, are
available upon request.
5.2.1      Primary Results on Migration
Table 2 presents the results of estimating Equations (3) and (4) with m jt as the out-
come. Column 1 of Panel A demonstrates that, on the whole, hurricanes induce
positive levels of migration across our sample of 159 countries (β1 > 0). Column
2 illustrates that this effect operates largely through the stock channel: γ2 > 0, sug-
gesting that the ability of sending-country denizens to use migration as an ex-post
response to hurricanes relies heavily on the presence an established network within
the United States. This indicates a potentially crucial role for family reunification
and other forms of sponsorship from within the U.S. in response to natural disasters
abroad, motivating further investigation along these margins below.30
     We further split m jt into separate age bins to investigate the characteristics of
these hurricane-induced migrants. Table 3 shows that the youngest migrants—aged
0 to 12—as well as prime-aged migrants—aged 18 to 44 account for the majority
of the effect seen in Table 2. Qualitatively, this aligns with the notion that working-
aged adults and their children are most likely to respond to the combined impetus
of an income shock and the pre-existence of a migration network.
5.2.2      Citizenship Status of Stock
To begin exploring how these networks operate, we examine how the citizenship
status of the 1980 stock affects the response to hurricanes. Differences in the abil-
ity of citizens versus non-citizens in promoting immigration allow us to roughly
distinguish between different types of migrant network benefits. While both cit-
izens and non-citizens can provide informational, financial, or psychic benefits,
prior migrants who are citizens have the greatest ability to sponsor relatives for
legal immigration (legally enshrined in the 1965 Amendments to the Immigration
and Nationality Act.) For example, in 2004, 42.9 percent of the 946,142 legal immi-
  30 SeeSection E in the Online Appendix for placebo tests which demonstrate that future hurricane
index values are not correlated with current migration flows.


                                               17
grants admitted to the U.S. were able to bypass numerical quotas because they were
immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Another 12 percent were subject to numeri-
cal limitations, but also gained entry due to family sponsorship by a U.S. citizen
(Department of Homeland Security 2006).31 Thus, in the specification

 m jt = π0 + π1 H jt + π2 (H jt × scitizen                non-cit
                                   j,1980 ) + π3 (H jt × s j,1980 ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt (5)


we expect π2 > π3 . Table 4 shows evidence for this differential effect: only the the
interaction term on the U.S.-citizen portion of the migrant stock has a positive and
statistically significant coefficient. This motivates a deeper look into how different
classes of legal entrants respond to natural disasters.
5.2.3   DHS Results
For this purpose, we turn to data from the Department of Homeland Security’s an-
nual Yearbook of Immigration Statistics, and the former Immigration and Natural-
ization Service’s annual Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which allow us to separately examine entries of legal permanent residents
(LPR) and legal non-immigrants—those who are only granted temporary visas.
This generates two new outcome variables, mDHS   jt  where DHS = {LPR, non-imm}.
Our specification remains the largely the same, with one exception. The DHS data
does not allow us to distinguish between new entries and changes of status. Well-
known back-logs in the immigration processing system can therefore create lag
between shocks in sending countries and the enumeration of a migrants who gain
LPR status if they enter as temporary residents first. In 2013, for example, 54 per-
cent of family-based immigrants adjusted status from temporary to LPR compared
to 46 percent who actually represented new entries (Kandel, 2016). We therefore
increase the lag order in our specification by taking a simple average of H jt and
H j,t−1 , which we denote H j,t,t−1 . Our modified specifications become:

            mDHS
             jt  = β0 + β1 H j,t,t−1 + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt                                (6)
            mDHS
             jt  = γ0 + γ1 H j,t,t−1 + γ2 (H j,t,t−1 × s j,1980 ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt   (7)
  31 Note   that these “admissions” include new arrivals and changes of status.



                                                  18
The results from these models are presented in Table 5, where the first two columns
present the results using our restricted-access estimates of migration inflows for
comparison.32
    There is a robust, positive effect of the stock interaction term on legal migra-
tion: γ2 is estimated to be positive for both immigrant and non-immigrant entries.
Temporary, non-immigrant entries also experience a large increase in response to
the combined effect of existing stocks and hurricane shocks. In fact, in the year
during and after a hurricane strike, respondent non-immigrant entries represent a
much larger inflow than legal permanent residents. However, given that they are
only admitted temporarily, only a small fraction of these non-immigrant entrants
may end up staying in the United States long enough to be enumerated in the 2000
Census or one of the ACS surveys we use to calculate the original m jt variable.
    In the row titled “Prop. of Census Inflows,” we calculate the proportion of
inflows implied by the second column, produced by restricted-access migration
counts m jt , that can be explained by inflows reflected in the fourth and sixth columns,
produced by data from the DHS (mDHS     jt ). This is done by obtaining predicted val-
ues from Equation (7), then multiplying by 1980 country population and summing
over these fitted values to produce aggregate inflow estimates implied for each out-
come. We then divide these aggregate inflow estimates by the result of the same
calculation from the second column. This exercise reveals that entries at the time
of hurricane incidence in sending countries are substantially larger than those that
are enumerated by later surveys like the 2000 Census and 2005 through 2015 ACS.
Given that a majority of temporary entrants do not stay in the U.S., for example,
we find that non-immigrant entries are more than 50 times greater than those im-
plied by our restricted-access results. We also find that LPR entries, that should be
more permanent, acount for more than twice the number of entries picked up by
our restricted-access measures. Even accounting for death, remigration, and statis-
tical noise, this implies that the effects found in Table 2 and the second column of
Table 5 can be fully explained by a legal immigration response.
    The detail of the DHS data allows us to further probe some of the mechanisms
  32 The  set of countries has been restricted to be the same across all estimated specifications. We
lose three countries to lack of data availability from the DHS.



                                                19
implied by our results thus far. In particular, the citizenship results from Table 4,
the large response of legal, permanent inflows from Table 5, and the realities of the
U.S. immigration system described in Section 3 suggest that family sponsorship
may play a crucial role in allowing immigration to serve as an ex-post response to
natural disaster shocks in sending countries. Table 6 suggests that this is the case.
More than a third of the network interaction effect detected for LPRs in Table 5
can be traced to parents, spouses, or children of U.S. citizens—classes of immi-
grants who are not subject to numerical limitations (mLPR,immed
                                                          jt       ). We further find
that among immigrants who are subject to numerical limitations, the network ef-
fect is especially salient for family-sponsored entrants (mLPR,fam
                                                             jt      ).33 Meanwhile,
categories of entry that should not be affected by hurricanes in sending countries,
such as refugees, employer-sponsored immigrants, or diversity lottery winners do
not show the same heterogeneity with respect to migrant stocks.
5.3     Robustness and Mechanisms
The findings presented in Section 5 are consistent with immigrant stocks reducing
the fixed cost of migration, allowing for a greater migratory response to hurricanes
from source countries. There is, however, a concern of interpretation: the migrant
stock could simply be correlated with omitted variables that are responsible for this
observed heterogeneity. To gauge the robustness of our network-driven interpreta-
tion of the results to omitted variable concerns, we estimate regressions with the
following specification

      m jt = ρ0 + ρ1 H jt + ρ2 (H jt × s j,1980 ) + ρ3 (H jt × c j ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt      (8)

This estimating equation is a modifies of our main specification, (4), by adding an
additional set of interaction terms with time-invariant control variables c j .34
  33 Note  that this data is only available starting in 1992.
  34 We  also include interaction terms with cmissing
                                                 j     , dummy variables that account for some of these
variables being unavailable for certain countries. When a variable is missing for a certain country,
cmissing
 j       = 1 (and is 0 otherwise). When cmissing
                                             j      = 1, we replace the missing value of c j with 0. The
coefficient on the interaction term with cmissing
                                          j       then represents heterogeneity in the responsiveness
to hurricanes among all countries for which that variable is missing. Note the vector of main effects
are not included in the regression because they are absorbed by the country fixed effects.



                                                  20
    Control variables c j include a range of potential omitted variables. For exam-
ple, s j,1980 may proxy for sending country incomes (log real 1980 GDP per capita).
Countries with higher incomes may be expected to both have higher s j,1980 and
more responsiveness to hurricanes if income makes credit constraints less binding
for paying migration fixed costs. Financial development, measured by domestic
credit as a proportion of GDP, may play a similar role. Migrant stocks may also
proxy for distance to the U.S., with closer countries having both a higher s j,1980
and lower migration fixed costs. We may expect that immigrant communities that
are more concentrated geographically (say in migrant enclaves) may be better able
to facilitate new immigration, perhaps due to closer social network connections.
We thus include a measure of within-U.S. geographic concentration of immigrant
stocks in 1980, HHI j,1980 . Larger countries, either in population or area, may nat-
urally offer more opportunities for internal migration, thus creating lower s j,1980 ’s
and lower responsiveness to hurricanes. Similarly, countries that have more alter-
nate international migration destinations, such as those connected to popular desti-
nations in Europe, may feature lower stocks and lower responsiveness, so we utilize
a measure of 1990 immigrant stocks in non-U.S. destinations as a control variable.
    Online Appendix Section D details the construction of each of these variables.
Here, we focus on Table 7, which displays the results of estimating Equation (8)
with each individual control variable as well as with the complete set. The esti-
mated coefficient ρ̂2 remains remarkably stable, and statistically significant, in each
regression. There appears to be a robust effect of the stock of immigrants itself, as
opposed to the many factors it may additionally proxy for.

6   Conclusion
We examine how international migration responds to changes in the returns to mi-
gration, and how this response depends on the costs or barriers that migrants face in
moving. We examine this question in the context of a quarter-century of migration
to the U.S., the world’s largest migration destination, from virtually all other ori-
gin locations worldwide. In our analysis, we exploit the occurrence of hurricanes,
which exogenously increase the returns to migration by making origin areas less at-
tractive, and ask whether the migration response to hurricanes depends on the size


                                          21
of prior migrant stocks from the same country. Our migration outcomes are unusu-
ally precise, measured either from from restricted-access, full-count responses to
the U.S. Census or actual legal immigration counts from U.S. government admin-
istrative data. We find that, on average, countries more affected by hurricanes see
more migration to the U.S. as a result. This migration response is indeed larger (as
a share of origin-country population) among countries with larger stocks of prior
U.S. migrants. This effect can be fully explained by observed increases in legal,
permanent immigration. A key role played by previous migrant networks appears
to be sponsoring relatives for legal immigration.
    This study is among the first testing a basic prediction of models of migration
that derive from Sjaastad (1962): that migration will increase more in response to
an increase in the return to migration when the costs of or barriers to migration are
lower. They are also of substantial policy interest. Immigration has long been one
of the most contentious issues in the public realm, and the policy debate should
be informed by a better understanding of how and when shocks in migrant-origin
countries will actually lead to increased migration.
    Our findings are also relevant for understanding the economic impacts of natural
disasters and the ways in which affected populations cope in their aftermath. Disas-
ters cause extensive human losses and economic damages worldwide. Hurricanes
are among the most damaging, accounting for roughly 40 percent of deaths and
38 percent of monetary damages caused by all natural disasters from 1995 through
2015 (CRED Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters). With climate
change, hurricanes are expected to become more intense (Emanuel, 2005). Our re-
sults highlight a previously under-emphasized role of immigration policy: it affects
the ability of disaster victims to cope with negative shocks by migrating. The ability
of disaster victims worldwide to seek safe haven in the U.S. is highly determined
by U.S. family reunification immigration policies and the presence in the U.S. of
compatriot communities who can take advantage of those policies.

A     Construction of the Hurricane Index
The damage caused by hurricanes depends on the intensity of the hurricane (in
particular, wind speed). In addition, hurricanes should cause more damage if they
strike in more populated areas. An index H jt for country j in year t that has these
features is as follows:

                                                 ∑i ∑s xis jt
                                        H jt =
                                                    N jt
     where xis jt is a measure of person i’s “affectedness” by hurricane s in country
 j, year t. Affectedness is summed over hurricanes and over individuals, and then
divided by total population N jt .
     We define a person’s hurricane “affectedness” in a particular storm is a nonlinear
function of the wind speed to which the individual was exposed.35 There is no data
source for individual-level hurricane affectedness (xis jt ), and so we approximate the
numerator in the hurricane index H jt by estimating wind speeds at evenly-spaced
points on a country’s land area, and combining this with population estimates at
these points.
     The first step in this process is the creation of a 0.25 by 0.25 degree grid of
latitude and longitude points that fall inside large countries and 2.5 minute by 2.5
minute latitude and longitude points that fall inside small countries.36 Then, we
predict the wind speed of each hurricane segment (a connected set of points from
the best tracks) using a model from Dilley et al. (2005):

                                           "                               #
                                                                 dg jst 
              pwg jst = 1{wg jst    > 33} 33 + (wg jst − 33) 1 −                                  (9)
                                                                 pradg jst

Here, pwg jst is the predicted wind speed (in knots) felt at grid point g in country j
from storm s, wg jst is the actual wind speed recorded at the beginning of the storm
segment from the best track, dg jst is the distance between the grid point and the
storm segment, and pradg jst is the predicted radius of the hurricane segment, where
we only calculate pwg jst for grid points for which dg jst < pradg jst .37
    As an example of a pwg jst calculation, consider Figure 3, which shows both
    35 Thepressure exerted by winds is commonly modeled in climatology as rising in the square of
wind speed (Emanuel, 2005).
   36 “Large” countries are defined as those that have at least two 0.25 by 0.25 degree grid points,

and “small” countries are defined as the converse of this large set of countries. Country delineations
are provided by the maptools package in R.
   37 prad
          g jst is calculated based on a model of wind-speed decay given distance from the hurricane,
as in Dilley et al. (2005).


                                                 42
the best track for Hurricane Mitch and its radius of hurricane-force winds. The
black grid points are points in Honduras that did not experience hurricane-force
winds, while the yellow grid points did experience such winds. Consider the grid
point highlighted in blue, g∗. We first calculate the shortest distance between this
point and the nearest storm segment from the Hurricane Mitch best track, repre-
sented by the blue line from the point to the storm best track. This distance is
dg∗,Honduras,Mitch,1998 . Then, since this distance is less than the predicted radius
(pradg∗,Honduras,Mitch,1998 ) of the closest storm segment—represented by the red
width surrounding the storm best track—we proceed to calculating pwg∗,Honduras,Mitch,1998
using Equation (9), where wind speed also comes from this nearest storm segment.
    The effect of hurricane s at grid point g in country j during year t is then:
                                                 "                 #
                                                   (pwg jst − 33)2
                        xg jst = 1{pwg jst > 33}
                                                    (wmax − 33)2
where wmax is the maximum wind speed observed in the dataset (166.65 knots).
Finally, to aggregate this information up to a population-weighted, country-year
level, we utilize the 1990 gridded population data for each 0.25 degree and 2.5
minute grid point from Columbia University’s Socioeconomic Data and Applica-
tions Center (SEDAC).38 This allows us to create the final hurricane index H jt for
country j in year t:

                                           ∑g ∑s xgs jt Ng,1990
                                  H jt =
                                              ∑g Ng,1990
where Ng,1990 is the grid point’s population 1990 given from SEDAC. That is, we
sum up a measure of how affected each country grid point is by each storm across
storms to get each grid point’s affectedness, then take a weighted sum of these grid
points (by population), to obtain the intensity-weighted hurricane events per capita
measure.
     Three additional issues merit mention with respect to the construction if H jt .
First, 1990 is the earliest date for which we have access to worldwide gridded pop-
ulation from SEDAC. Since our sample period is 1980 to 2004, there is the potential
for our estimate to reflect reverse causality created by hurricane-induced migration
from grid points affected in the 1980s. In this case, within-country areas most likely
to be hit by hurricanes would receive weights that are too low, creating values of
H jt that are also too low. This reverse causality would generate a downward bias on
our estimated effect of hurricanes on emigration, making our estimates conserva-
tive. Second, because of a lack of reliable wind speed information in the best tracks,

we only have H jt for countries affected by North Indian basin hurricanes starting
in 1981 and South Indian and South Pacific basin hurricanes starting in 1983. We
therefore drop any observations from countries affected by North Indian hurricanes
prior to 1981 and any countries affected by southern hemisphere hurricanes prior to
1983. Finally, the hurricane season in the southern hemisphere starts in November.
For ease of comparison within year across countries, we include hurricanes from
November and December in the following year’s hurricane index for countries in
the southern hemisphere.

B      Census Bureau: 1980 Stocks and 1980-2004 Inflows
In order to estimate migration inflows, we construct retrospective estimates using
the 2000 Census and 2005 through 2015 ACS 1-year files. This methodology uti-
lizes the combination of questions that asks survey respondents where they were
born and what year they came to live in the United States. Aggregating person
weights by country of birth and year of entry within a given survey thus generates a
set of initial country-year migration inflow estimates for all years before the survey.
That is,

    survey
                   ∑ 1{Person i is from country j}× 1{Person i entered in year t}× pwgtisurvey
                                                                                                
M jt         =
                 i∈survey

where i is an individual respondent to a given survey (2000 Census, 2005 ACS, 2006
ACS, ..., 2015 ACS) and pwgti is that individual’s person weight assigned by that
survey. Given the sheer sample size of the 2000 Census, we use these aggregated
estimates to infer migration inflows for the years 1980 through 1999. In order to
extend our annual sample to 2004 while retaining relatively low levels of noise in
our estimates, we average the estimates generated by the 11 ACS surveys from 2005
through 2015 for the years 2000 to 2004:
                       (
                          M 2000
                            jt
                                 Census            if t ≤ 1999
                M jt =     1 2015       ACS year r
                          11 ∑r=2005 M jt          if 2000 ≤ t ≤ 2004
    Given this methodology, the key advantage of access to confidential data comes
in estimating migration inflows from small countries. Use of smaller Census sam-
ples available publicly can generate accurate estimates of migrant inflows for large
countries with many immigrant survey respondents that appear consistent across
surveys. However, small countries, many of which are heavily affected by hur-
ricanes, often either contain relatively few observations per year of entry or are
aggregated into categories like “Other Caribbean” in publicly available data. This
would generate substantial imprecision in the annual migration estimates. The 1-
in-6 count provided by the confidential 2000 Census and aggregation of multiple
ACS surveys alleviates this issue.
    Despite this novel use of confidential data, a few concerns merit further con-
sideration with this methodology. First, by using the 2000 Census and to look
at inflows as far back as 1980, we are focusing on permanent migrants to the
U.S.—those who remain living in the U.S. (or connected enough through repeated
return trips) to be enumerated by the Census Bureau up to 20 years after arrival.
As estimates from the 2000 Census roll forward from the starting point of 1980,
underestimation due to death and re-migration give way to overestimation of per-

                                                45
manent migrants due to the presence of more temporary migrants closer to the year
2000. Nonetheless, Passel and Suro (2005) find that this methodology tracks other
migration estimates well for large countries in publicly available data, and thus we
find its broader use with confidential data to be appropriate. Furthermore, as de-
scribed in Section 4.3.2, we complement these estimates with data from the DHS
that counts legal permanent resident entries at the time of entry in order to ensure
that our results are robust to these concerns. In this sense, the results from the
Census/ACS panel can be viewed as incorporating undocumented and temporary
migrant response to hurricanes.
    Second, as elucidated by Redstone and Massey (2004), in the presence of cir-
cular migration, the interpretation of year of entry provided by survey respondents
in the Census is not clear. Specifically, in cases where immigrants reported mul-
tiple entries and exits in the New Immigrant Survey, Redstone and Massey (2004)
find that 45 percent of immigrants report a “year that they came to live” that was
not their first entry, and 54 percent of immigrants report a “year that they came to
live” that was not their final entry.39 The answers to this Census question appear to
largely be a combination (across respondents) of first year of entry and the mental
decision to make the United States their permanent home. Given the nature of our
empirical strategy, we understand this as an issue of interpretation rather than bias.
Any effect found on migrant inflows using the Census data should be interpreted
as an effect on the decision to stay permanently in the U.S.—including both literal,
one-time moves and the decision to turn repeated circular migration into permanent
residency in the United States. Furthermore, remaining, pure noise created by in-
accuracy in recalling year of entry causes larger standard errors in our coefficient
estimates, making our estimates of precision conservative.
    We also use access to the confidential, full version of the 1980 Census Long
Form responses to construct a measure of immigrant stocks from each country in
1980, the base year of our analysis:


                                    1{Person i is from country j} × pwgti1980 Census
                                                                                      
       S j,1980 =        ∑
                    i∈1980 Census

These estimates have the advantage of producing more accurate stocks for small
countries due to the large, 1-in-5 count sample size of the confidential data and
do not suffer from either of the concerns of year-by-year migration estimates men-
tioned above.


  39 The wording “year you came to live in the U.S.” used by Redstone and Massey (2004) exactly

mimics the Census wording in order to make this comparison.

C     Income and Damages in Sending Countries
Before moving to our main results, we first establish that our hurricane index cap-
tures events that have tangible, negative consequences in sending countries. In
particular, we estimate the long-run response of incomes in sending countries to
hurricane events, as in Hsiang and Jina (2014). We obtain year-by-year real GDP
per capita estimates from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI),
enabling us to estimate the long-run effect of hurricanes on income.40 Following
Hsiang and Jina (2014), our regression specification is:

                                         10
                          g jt = α +    ∑      α` H j,t−` + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt                 (10)
                                       `=−5
                  10                   10
    g jt = α +    ∑     α` H j,t−` +   ∑      α`stock (H j,t−` × s j,1980 ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt (11)
                 `=−5                  `=−5
             g jt = log(Real GDP per capita) jt − log(Real GDP per capita) j,t−1

We add the α` coefficients from Equation (10) starting at ` =0 to unravel the im-
pulse response of log real GDP per capita to the hurricane index (calibrated to
σH = 0.02). The results are shown in Figure A1, where we see a robust, long-
run effect. Ten years later, a one standard deviation increase in the hurricane index
leads to 5 to 10 percent lower in GDP per capita. This kind of permanent eco-
nomic impact buttresses the notion that hurricanes can cause the kind of permanent
migration we observe.
    We also estimate Equation (11) in order to determine whether the interaction
between hurricanes in sending countries and immigrant stocks in the United States
alters the impact of hurricanes on sending country economic activity. Figure A2
shows that the impulse responses of GDP per capita implied by α`stock coefficients
does not contain any evidence of such an interaction.41 Meanwhile, constructing
the impulse response based on the α` coefficients from Equation (11) yields similar
results to doing so without the stock interaction effect, as in Equation (10). This
strengthens our interpretation of s j,1980 as a pure pull factor for potential migrants.
That is, the stock operates as a network effect, facilitating migration as a response
to hurricanes, but does not appear to alleviate damages at home to the point of
dampening the push factor caused by hurricane-induced income losses.
    Another source of data on impact in sending countries is EM-DAT, as described
    40 See Table A3 for summary statistics.
    41 The  impulse responses for the stock interaction effect are multiplied by the standard deviation
of s j,1980 , 0.03 to retain consistency in units.



                                                      47
in Section 4. Table A2 presents results from estimating equations (3) and (4) with
damages as a proportion of 1980 real per capita GDP, as well as deaths, injuries, and
total number of people affected as a proportion of 1980 population due to meteoro-
logical disasters as outcomes. Table A2 shows a strong, robust effect of hurricanes
on damages reported in potential sending countries. A one standard deviation in-
crease in hurricane incidence in a given year corresponds to a 7.80 percent increase
in damages as a proportion of 1980 GDP. As with our results from estimating Equa-
tion (11), we find no evidence of a stock interaction effect that mitigates the effect
of hurricanes on sending country damages.

D     Control Variables and their Sources
This section describes the sources and construction of control variables, used both
to test robustness of the results found in Table 2 and to highlight mechanisms. Sum-
mary statistics for these variables are presented below in Table A3. Note that we
have not been given permission to publish summary statistics on HHI j,1980 (de-
scribed below).
D.1      GDP Per Capita: Avakov (2015)
Avakov (2015) provides real GDP per capita estimates for the 159 land areas in our
sample, including those that were not yet countries in 1980. These data allow us
to assess robustness of our results to the inclusion of GDP per capita as a control,
as well as how the interaction between migration networks and hurricanes change
with sending country income.
D.2      World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
Beyond GDP per capita, we seek to assess robustness against a bevy of sending
country characteristics that could mitigate the relationship between hurricanes, mi-
grant networks, and migration to the U.S. The WDI aggregates many of these vari-
ables into one database, including remittances as a proportion of GDP and domestic
credit as a proportion of GDP for 142 of the 159 countries in our sample. Because
these variables are often missing for a given country in the year 1980, we employ
a country-level average from 1970 to 1980 (throwing out missing observations) for
these variables.
D.3      United Nations Population Division (UNDP): non-U.S. Immigrant Stocks
The UNDP estimates the stock of immigrants from a majority of our sending coun-
tries living in various destination countries starting in 1990. They construct this
data by combining governmental estimates of immigration and emigration from
each country.42 These estimates allow us to test whether the primacy of the U.S.
as a destination for a given source country affects our results. That is, if a source
country is well-connected in multiple destination countries, the model presented in
Section 2 implies that its hurricane-induced migrants would split their locational
decisions between these countries.
D.4      Land Area and Distance to the U.S.
Proximity and the absence of undamaged land mass available within country can
facilitate hurricane-induced migration to the U.S. In order to both understand the
magnitude of these mechanisms and ensure they are not wholly driving our results,
    42 For
        example, the DHS data is used to generate immigrant stock estimates for the United States.
The data can be found at https://esa.un.org/unmigration/.

     to Washington D.C.
we construct two measures. The first the log of land area in squared kilometers and
the second is the distance from each country’s capital city to the U.S.—meant to
mimic distance measures used in standard trade gravity models (e.g., Feenstra et
al., 2001). Each is constructed using data available in the maptools package in R
(distance to Washington D.C. is calculated using this package after obtaining lati-
tude and longitude coordinates of capital cities from Google Maps).43 For a subset
of countries without land area information available in this package, we employ
land area information provided in the WDI.
D.5    Damages: Center for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED)
In order to verify that our independent hurricane index corresponds to immediate
damages in potential sending countries on a level that could prompt immigration
to the United States, we use data from EM-DAT: the Center for Research on Epi-
demiology of Disasters (CRED) International Disaster Database.44 These estimates
include monetary damages in nominal USD and the number of deaths, injuries, and
total number of people affected by meteorological disasters in a given country and
year. The sources of disaster impact data include national governments, UN agen-
cies, non-governmental organizations, insurance companies, research institutes, and
the media. In order to put the monetary damages in real terms (2010 USD), we em-
ploy the U.S. GDP deflator from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.
The use of these data allow us to establish something akin to a “first stage” effect,
that our objective hurricane index corresponds to monetary and human damages felt
on the ground in potential sending countries. Additionally, we report damages as
a proportion of 1980 real GDP. We obtain the denominator from Avakov (2015),
who collects historic data for land masses small enough to cover our entire country
sample.
D.6    Restricted-Access Census Bureau: 1980 Herfindhal Concentration Index
In theory, we may expect that immigrant communities that are particularly con-
centrated in U.S. areas that are close to hurricane-hit countries—Miami, for exam-
ple—are particularly suited to absorb hurricane-induced inflows. In order to test
whether our stock interaction effect is solely driven by such concentrated commu-
nities, we construct a Herfindhal-style concentration index:
                                                   S           2
                                                      jc,1980
                              HHI j,1980 = ∑
                                              c    ∑c S jc,1980

where c represents a U.S. county and S jc,1980 is the number of immigrants from
country j living in county c in 1980. Note that the denominator is the same as
S j,1980 in this paper’s notation. The ability to construct this variable at the granular,
county level comes from access to restricted-use Census Bureau data.
D.7   Populations: United Nations and U.S. Census Bureau International Data
      Base
Finally, in order to make country-year observations comparable, we use population
data from the set of potential sending countries in our base year, 1980. For this,
we used data publicly available data from the United Nations and the U.S. Census
Bureau’s International Data Base, which between them cover our entire sample.
For most of the countries in our sample, estimates of the 1980 population were
available from both sources, in which case we took a simple average. These 1980
population estimates are then used as denominators for our final migration inflow
outcome variables and our 1980 stock estimates:

                                                M jt
                                       m jt ≡
                                              N j,1980
                                              S j,1980
                                   s j,1980 ≡
                                              N j,1980

m jt is our main outcome of interest from the data constructed using confidential
data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
D.8   Predicting the 1980 Stock
We motivate the potential need for these predetermined control variables by using
them to predict our interacting variable of interest: s j,1980 . Table A4 presents the
result from this exercise. Unsurprisingly, countries that are closer to the U.S. had
higher proportional immigrant stocks in 1980. Somewhat surprisingly, larger coun-
tries, countries with more concentrated immigrant populations, and larger countries
also featured higher immigrant stocks in 1980. Real GDP per capita, our best indi-
cator for development, has a positive, but not statistically significant effect on 1980
proportional stocks.

E    Placebo Tests
In order to verify that the results presented above are not just the result of spurious
statistical noise, we test the following model:

            m jt = p0 + p1 H j,t+1 + p2 (H j,t+1 × s j,1980 ) + η j + δt + φ j t + ε jt
We should not expect hurricanes in the future to affect current migration if they are
unexpected, exogenous events, as the theoretical considerations laid out in Section
2 assume. Table A5 presents the result of this test, and demonstrates that we cannot
reject the hypotheses that p1 = 0 or p2 = 0. This buttresses the notion that H jt is
causing migration through the negative income and asset shock channels that we
propose.
