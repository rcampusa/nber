                                         ABSTRACT

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) not only changed the landscape of health insurance coverage in
the United States, but also affected the relationship between working decisions and health
insurance. In this paper, we estimate the impact of the ACA on the near-elderly (ages 60- 64) in
the five years after the implementation of its key provisions in early 2014. We exploit variation
across geographic areas in the pre-existing level of uninsurance and use 65-69 year olds, whose
insurance coverage was unaffected by the ACA, as a within-region control group. Our findings
indicate that the ACA increased health insurance coverage among the near elderly by 4.5
percentage points and reduced their labor force participation rate by 0.6 percentage points.

I. INTRODUCTION

       The passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010 constituted the largest reform to

the U.S. health care system since the 1965 introduction of Medicare and Medicaid. This reform

aimed to reduce the fraction of non-elderly individuals uninsured in the U.S., which was around

20% in the previous decade. The ACA sought to do so through expanding Medicaid for individuals

up to 138% of the federal poverty line, creating incentives for employers to offer insurance

coverage, establishing new health care exchanges with subsidies for people with incomes within

100 and 400 percent of the of the federal poverty line, and mandating individual health insurance

coverage (though this last provision was later repealed in 2017).

       While the ACA greatly expanded access to health insurance, it may also have also

weakened the relationship between employment and insurance coverage, thereby affecting labor

supply and demand. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) produced a report in 2014

estimating that the ACA would reduce the aggregate hours worked by 1.5 to 2.0 percent between

2017 and 2024, mainly due to a decrease in labor supply. These projections translate into a decrease

in the size of the labor force by about 2.0 to 2.5 million by 2024 (CBO 2014). This paper aims to

understand how the ACA affected not only the health insurance coverage of the near elderly

population, but also whether the higher coverage translated to changes in labor supply.

       There are at least three reasons to believe that the Affordable Care Act may have had

especially large effects on the near-elderly. First, past evidence has shown that older workers have

higher labor supply elasticities (French 2005).       Second, because the ACA caps premium

contributions based on income, those who face the highest premiums (the near-elderly) receive

correspondingly higher subsidies. Figure 1 displays the average effective subsidy faced at

different income levels by age in 2015, and shows that older individuals had much higher effective



                                                 2
subsidies. Finally, the near-elderly generally have higher values of health insurance than younger

workers since their average health care spending is significantly higher. Consistent with this and

as shown in Figure 2, the highest fraction of families in which annual out-of-pocket spending on

health care exceeds $2,000 is among those with 55-64 year olds.

        In this paper, we evaluate whether the additional health insurance coverage induced by the

ACA affected labor market outcomes for the near-elderly. We use individual-level data from the

American Community Survey (ACS) for the 2010 through 2018 period. Our analyses exploit

geographic variation in the pre-existing uninsurance rates across areas. We also use 65-69 year

olds, whose insurance options did not change significantly with the ACA due to their near-

universal Medicare coverage, as a within-region control group. Our empirical approach is similar

to the methodologies of previous work aimed at estimating the effect of Medicare introduction in

1965 (Finkelstein, 2007; Finkelstein and McKnight, 2008) or the 2006 Massachusetts Health

Reform (Kolstad and Kowalski, 2012; Miller, 2012) as well as previous work on the ACA

(Duggan, Goda, Jackson 2019; Courtemanche et. al 2017). Because our variation stems from

differences in pre-ACA uninsurance rates, our methodology may not capture certain labor supply

effects of the ACA. For example, to the extent that people with insurance from employers dropped

out of the labor force due to the availability of insurance through the ACA, our identification

strategy is ill-suited to identify these changes.

        Our results illustrate that the ACA substantially altered the insurance coverage among the

near elderly. We estimate that an increase in the pre-existing uninsurance rate of 10 percentage

points led on average to a post-ACA increase in health insurance coverage of 4.0 percentage points

for 60-64 year olds relative to 65-69 year olds. This coverage increase was driven by increases in

coverage through employers, direct purchase, and Medicaid, and we also find that the number of



                                                    3
types of coverage per person increased differentially. When we look at changes that differentiate

between Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states, we find evidence that the increase in

insurance coverage was significantly greater among expansion states. Furthermore, the

composition of changes differed: increases in directly purchased coverage were larger in non-

expansion states, while Medicaid coverage increases were larger in expansion states.

       We examine the labor market consequences for those gaining coverage from the ACA by

investigating whether there were differential changes in labor market outcomes across areas with

varying baseline levels of uninsurance and across age groups using the same research design. Our

findings indicate that a 10 percentage point greater pre-ACA uninsurance rate led to a 0.5

percentage point larger reduction in labor force participation among 60-64 year olds. This

reduction in labor force participation was driven by statistically significant reductions in both

unemployment and self-employment. Employment appears to have fallen as well, though the

estimates are statistically significant only in non-expansion states. Putting these results for health

insurance and labor force together, our findings indicate that for every additional one hundred 60-

64 year olds who gained insurance coverage as a result of the ACA, approximately 13 individuals

exited the labor force on net.

       There is a long and extensive literature analyzing health insurance takeup decisions

following U.S. healthcare reforms, such as the Medicaid expansions of the 1980s or 1990s (Currie

and Gruber, 1996a; Currie and Gruber, 1996b; Cutler and Gruber, 1996; Aizer and Grogger 2003;

Hamersma and Kim 2013) and examining the link between health insurance and labor market

decisions (Madrian, 1994; Gruber and Madrian, 2002). Given the scope and magnitude of the ACA

reform, a recent and growing literature has also sought to estimate the effect of this policy on

individual health insurance and is generally in agreement in substantial coverage increases for the



                                                  4
overall population (Sommers et. al., 2014, 2015, 2016; Courtemanche et. al 2017; Frean, Gruber,

and Sommers, 2017; Duggan, Goda, Jackson, 2019) and in particular, the near elderly (Freed,

2017; Long et. al., 2017).

        However, previous studies have failed to find that the ACA induced substantial labor

market changes (Gooptu et. al., 2016; Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai, 2019; Kaestner et. al.

2017; Buchmueller, Levy, and Valleta, 2018; among others). Much less work has focused on the

near elderly population close to the age of Medicare eligibility, whose working decisions could be

more responsive on average than the non-elderly adult population. Ayyagari (2019) finds that

individuals adjust their retirement expectations to retiring earlier due to the ACA. With regards to

realized labor supply decisions, with the exception of Wood (2019), who finds a decrease in labor

force participation, existing studies find little to no effect of increased retirement behavior (Levy,

Buchmueller, and Nikpay, 2018; Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai, 2019; Aslim, 2019). It is

worth noting that all of these studies that look specifically at retirement and find small or null

results use either self-reported retirement status (Levy et al. 2018 and Gustman et al. 2019) or an

indicator for receiving retirement income in the past 12 months (Aslim 2019). If some who are

not working do not yet think of themselves as retired, it is possible that focusing on this narrower

outcome could miss some of the effect of the ACA on the labor force for the near elderly. It is

also possible that some of these differences are due to the time periods and empirical strategies

used.

        The main contributions of our study are the focus on the near-elderly and the addition of a

within-region control group whose insurance coverage and labor market outcomes would not be

expected to change as a result of the ACA. While there is an extensive literature on the effects of

the ACA on both insurance coverage and labor market outcomes, existing papers examining labor



                                                  5
market effects generally focus on exploring whether outcomes changed differentially across

Medicaid expansion and non-expansion states. Our approach allows us to flexibly control for

changing conditions in labor markets that may be correlated with the pre-existing share of

uninsured in a region.

       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II provides details regarding the data we

use in the analysis including average characteristics prior to ACA implementation. Section III

describes our empirical strategy. We report our results and robustness exercises in Section IV, and

Section V concludes.

II. DATA AND ANALYSIS SAMPLE

       Our main analysis utilizes the American Community Survey (ACS), an annual survey of

U.S. households as conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. They survey a wide variety of household

and individual level topics. We focus on detailed data on working decisions, demographics, health

insurance coverage, and income sources. The Census mails its survey to approximately 3.5 million

addresses in a given year, and follows up with phone or in person visits for those in addresses who

have not responded. Due to these efforts, the response rate for the ACS is quite high, typically

around 97 percent. We utilize a version of the ACS that is harmonized across years, called IPUMS

(Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) by the University of Minnesota.

       Our main analysis focuses on a sample of observations from 2010 through 2018 for

civilians age 60 to 69, constituting 3,590,073 person-year observations. We therefore limit to 4

years before the implementation of the ACA in January 2014, and use all years of available data

post 2014. The ACS surveys health insurance coverage at the time of the interview, in contrast

with the Current Population Survey, which tracks coverage status over the previous calendar year.

Insurance coverage falls into seven categories: insurance through an employer, insurance directly



                                                6
purchased, Medicare, Medicaid (or other government assisted plan, such as Medical Assistance or

plans for those with disabilities or low incomes), Tricare and other military insurance, Veteran's

Affairs (VA) coverage, or coverage from the Indian Health Service. Individuals self-report their

health insurance status and the type of insurance. Therefore, there is a possibility that there is mis-

reporting and measurement error, due to how individuals might interpret the wording on the

questionnaire. The ACS includes a variable for health insurance coverage overall, which includes

any of the several types of coverage as listed above, with the exception of insurance through the

Indian Health Service (IHS). Note that individuals can also have more than one type of health

insurance coverage, and we create a variable that sums the total number of coverages, with the

exception of IHS. We also utilize a variety of labor market outcomes, such as employment status

in the last week, an indicator for being out of the labor force (defined as not having employment

and not searching for a job over the last four weeks), self-employment, and usual hours worked

per week over the past 12 months. We use hours and employment status to construct an indicator

for working part time, defined as being employed and working less than 30 hours per week. Our

analysis variables are summarized for each year in Table 1.

       Figure 3 illustrates health insurance coverage prior to the implementation of the ACA in

2014, by age group. The sum total of the percentages exceed 100 percent, because some individuals

report coverage from multiple sources. We see that uninsurance rates are higher among younger

age groups in the baseline, where the primary source of insurance is through a private employer.

The elderly saw almost universal coverage by Medicare, but often supplement this with other

sources. Children and young adults also saw higher rates of coverage with insurance through

Medicaid, as Medicaid eligibility requirements were more generous for children.




                                                  7
       Our analysis leverages variation in the pre-ACA share of individuals in a geographic area

without health insurance coverage. The finest possible level of geography that is available in the

public ACS data is a PUMA, or Public Use Microdata Area. PUMAs are delineated so as to not

cross state borders and each must have a population of at least 100,000 in the decennial census.

Since PUMAs are based on population and not area, places like Los Angeles typically have several

PUMAs based on census tract, while PUMAS in rural areas are usually based on counties. PUMAs

are redefined every ten years, due to the introduction of a new decennial census. Within our sample

time frame, the ACS utilized one set of 2,071 PUMAs for 2010 and 2011 data, while switching to

another set of 2,351 PUMAs for 2012 onwards. As a consequence, we utilize IPUM's

harmonization of PUMAs. IPUMS has aggregated 2000 and 2010 PUMAs into consistent PUMAs,

which by construction have the same boundaries across our 2010 through 2018 analysis period.

There are 1,078 consistent PUMAs and no observations are dropped from the data.

       We aggregate the individual level data on health insurance coverage for 60-64 year olds at

the PUMA level to calculate the baseline levels of uninsurance used in our analysis. Figure 4 shows

a "heat map" that illustrates the variation in the baseline levels of uninsurance for this age group.

The average value of baseline uninsurance across PUMAs in this near-elderly age group is 11.7

percent, with a standard deviation of 6.0 percent, and the share varies from a low of 1.5 percent to

a maximum of 52.7 percent.

       We provide the intuition behind our identification strategy in Figure 5, which shows the

trajectory of average health insurance coverage by year for four different groups: 60-64 year olds

living in the bottom and top quartile PUMAs ranked by baseline uninsurance among the near

elderly, and 65-69 year olds living in the bottom and top quartile PUMAs ranked by these same

measures of uninsurance. As shown in the figure, 60-64 year olds living in the top quartile PUMAs



                                                 8
by baseline uninsurance experienced substantially higher increases in health insurance coverage

when the ACA was implemented than did the other three groups.



III. EMPIRICAL METHODS

       Our empirical approach leverages geographic variation in uninsurance among the near

elderly prior to the ACA's implementation, age (due to the fact that the ACA did not change

insurance coverage for 65-69 year olds), and time. In some of our specifications, we also examine

whether the effects varied for Medicaid expansion states versus non-expansion states. Our

baseline regression equation is as follows:

       (1) !"#$ = % $ × # × 60_64" + !"#$ + $ + " + # + "$ + #$ +

           "# + !"#$

in which !"#$ represents an indicator for whether individual i living in PUMA p and age a has

any health insurance, private employer-based coverage, directly-purchased coverage, or Medicaid

coverage in time t; $ is an indicator equal to 1 in 2014 or later and 0 otherwise, #

represents the pre-ACA uninsurance rate among the near elderly for PUMA p, and !"#$ includes

demographic controls for gender, race, education, and ethnicity. Standard errors are clustered at

the PUMA level. The variables $ , " , # , "$ , #$ , and"# represent fixed effects and all lower-

order interaction terms. PUMA-by-year fixed effects account for differential trends in the

outcomes that could be correlated with baseline levels of uninsurance, year-by-age fixed effects

account for differential trends by age, and age-by-PUMA fixed effects account for systematic

differences in ages in different locations. Note that because we include these detailed fixed effects,

the main effects of $ , # and 60_64" drop out of the regression. We hypothesize that




                                                  9
% is positive, that is, insurance coverage grew more rapidly among the near elderly in areas with

higher pre-existing uninsurance for 60-64 year olds relative to 65-69 year olds.

       States are heterogeneous with respect to Medicaid expansion status, so we extend our

empirical specification through interacting with a binary variable, ! , which indicates

whether the state has expanded its Medicaid program by January 1, 2014. Therefore, we

additionally estimate equation (2):

       (2) "#$% = & % × $ × 60_64# + ' % × $ ×

           60_64# × ! + "#$% + % + # + $ + #% + $% + #$ + "#$%

As with (1), geographic areas with higher shares of uninsured individuals prior to ACA ought to

see greater increases in health insurance coverage, and thus, & > 0. In addition, it is plausible

that the overall level of health insurance increased more due to the ACA in Medicaid expansion

states, i.e. ' > 0. In addition, Equation (2) allows the sources of coverage to change differentially

for expansion and non-expansion states.

       To estimate the effect of the ACA on labor market outcomes, we perform an analogous set

of reduced-form regressions as specified in (1) and (2) using labor market outcomes as the

dependent variables instead of health insurance coverage. We investigate whether PUMAs with

larger ACA-induced increases in health insurance coverage among the near elderly also have larger

changes in labor market outcomes for this group. Finally, we perform a subsample analysis to see

if the results for both insurance coverage and labor market outcomes vary across observable

characteristics such as marital status and age.

       The effects of ACA on labor supply is theoretically ambiguous, and we provide a

conceptual framework through which we can interpret our empirical estimates, following Duggan,

Goda and Jackson (2019). Appendix Table A.1 shows a transition matrix, where rows reflect the


                                                  10
individual's status prior to the ACA and the columns reflect possible status after the ACA. Because

our empirical strategy relies on variation in the share of the near elderly population that was

uninsured, the estimates are not designed to reflect any labor market impacts on those already

insured prior to the ACA (bottom half of table). These individuals may substitute away from health

insurance coverage conditional on employment towards health insurance that can be obtained

through other channels and that is no longer conditional on working. Specifically, we interpret our

results as shedding light on labor market transitions associated with movements from uninsurance

to insurance (top right quadrant of table).

       Identification in our empirical strategy relies on the assumption that outcomes in

geographic areas with a higher fraction of baseline uninsurance for aged 60-64 would have evolved

in a similar manner as in areas with low baseline uninsurance, absent the ACA, after controlling

flexibly for changes in area-level insurance coverage and labor market outcomes experienced by

65-69 year olds and person-level demographics. The second specification that allows for

heterogeneity by Medicaid expansion status assumes that for a given baseline share uninsured,

outcomes in expansion states would have evolved in a similar way to states that did not expand.

We emphasize that our analysis does not rule out different levels of insurance coverage or labor

market outcomes across areas for reasons other than the ACA that are changing over time, as long

as they are common to 65-69 year olds. This strategy would account for differential recovery

following the great recession that could be related to the underlying income distribution or the rate

of economic growth in an area.



IV. EMPIRICAL RESULTS

A. Health insurance coverage



                                                 11
       Table 2 displays the results of estimating Equation (1) on outcome variables pertaining to

health insurance coverage and its source. All of the specifications include controls for gender, race,

ethnicity, education, and all one- and two-way interactions between single year-of-age fixed

effects, year fixed effects, and PUMA fixed effects. The outcome variable is listed in the column

header. We include the mean of the dependent variable in the bottom row of the table averaged

over the pre-ACA years for the 60-64 year old sample.

       The results in the table provide evidence that the ACA induced statistically significant

increases in health insurance coverage among the near elderly. In Column (1), we see that PUMAs

with a higher share of the near-elderly population uninsured had larger increases in health

insurance coverage. More specifically, average coverage rates increased by 4.0 percentage points

more for 60-64 year olds relative to 65-69 year olds in areas where the baseline uninsurance among

the near elderly was 10 percentage points higher. In Columns (2) ­ (7), we see that the overall

increase was driven by increases in Medicaid coverage, directly-purchased health insurance, and

employer-based coverage, and there was also an increase in people reporting more than one source

of health insurance coverage.

       When we interact our triple-difference estimate with Medicaid expansion status (Table 3)

we see that coverage increases for 60-64 year olds were more responsive to differences in baseline

uninsurance rates in states that expanded Medicaid relative to states that did not. We also see that

most of the coverage increases in non-expansion states were driven by directly-purchased

insurance and employer coverage, while in expansion states, the coverage increases were primarily

driven by Medicaid.

       Next, we explore heterogeneous effects by minority status, sex, education level, and marital

status, by running our main specifications on subsamples of the population. We maintain the same



                                                 12
definition of fraction uninsured in the PUMA as before, where the fraction uninsured refers to the

overall aged 60-64 population, and not the specific subsample. Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the effect

on insurance coverage and show that the relationship between coverage and prior uninsurance

levels is larger for minorities and those with a high school degree or less. Furthermore, we see that

insurance coverage increased more for expansion states than non-expansion states, across all

subsamples and that the stronger relationship for minorities and those with lower levels of

education is driven primarily by larger increases in non-expansion states.



B. Labor market outcomes

       We next provide evidence regarding the effect of the ACA-induced increases in health

insurance coverage on labor market outcomes in Tables 6 and 7, which display the results of

estimating (1) and (2) on the labor market outcomes summarized in Table 1. As in earlier tables,

the column heading denotes the dependent variable. Pre-ACA means of the dependent variables

are reported in the final rows below the regression results.

       Table 6 indicates that 60-64 year olds in regions with a 10 percentage point higher level of

uninsurance saw reductions in labor force participation of 0.5 percentage points relative to 65-69

year olds. This reduction is statistically significant at the 5 percent level, and appears to be driven

by reductions in both unemployment and self-employment. We do not detect evidence that

employment overall is lower, nor that the fraction of individuals working part-time changed.

When we examine the number of hours conditional on working, we also find no evidence of

reductions for those most-affected by the ACA's provisions.

       When we investigate whether there were differential effects among expansion and non-

expansion states (Table 7), we find that overall, the results were similar in these two sets of states.



                                                  13
The results in this table further suggest that the reduction in labor force participation is driven by

reductions in both unemployment and self-employment. Interpreting these results through the lens

of Table A.1 suggests that the changes in labor market outcomes we observe result from transitions

from employment or unemployment while uninsured to being out of the labor force with insurance

coverage. This could reflect the availability of subsidized health insurance outside of employment

inducing those employed at firms that did not offer health insurance to leave the labor force due to

an income effect. A reduction in unemployment could a result of previously unemployed and

uninsured individuals moving out of the labor force because they stop searching for employment

due to subsidized coverage available outside of employment and/or an income effect.

        In the aggregate, our point estimates suggest that for every one hundred 60-64 year olds

who gained insurance coverage, approximately 13.4 people exited the labor force.1 Our point

estimates further suggest that approximately 7.1 of these 100 people left self-employment and 6.2

stopped searching for work and therefore exited unemployment.

        We perform some "back of the envelope" calculations to gauge the aggregate implications

of our findings. Using the age 65-69 group as our control, we can run a simple differences-in-

differences model, regressing each individual's insured status on a set of age fixed effects, year

fixed effects, and the interaction between an indicator for being in age 60-64 and an indicator for

post-2014 (along with the same set of controls). This regression suggests that the 60-64 age group

experienced an increase in insured status of 4.52 percentage points relative to 65-69 year olds. In

2013, there were 18.3 million 60-64 year olds, and our results therefore suggest that approximately

826,000 non-elderly individuals acquired insurance as a result of the ACA. Using our labor market

estimates from above, we estimate that 110,000 non-elderly individuals left the labor force. This

 This represents the ratio of the coefficient estimate of -0.0536 in Column 1 of Table 6 and the corresponding
estimate of 0.401 in Column 1 of Table 2.

represents a decline of 0.6 percentage points in the near-elderly labor force participation rate, with

58,000 leaving self-employment and 51,000 exiting unemployment. In 2013, there were

approximately 10.1 million 60-64 year olds in the labor force, so that our estimates suggest an

ACA-induced decline of 1.1 percent in the size of the near-elderly (60-64) labor force.

           Tables 8 and 9 examine the effect on labor force participation for subsamples, and these

are analogous to Tables 4 and 5 for health insurance. The reductions in labor force participation

are more pronounced for those with a high school degree or less, and those who are married. The

point estimates suggest that for every one hundred 60-64 year olds with a high school degree or

less who acquired health insurance as a result of the ACA, 18.7 left the labor force.2 When we

include an interaction term for expansion status, we are underpowered to detect significant

differences in our subsamples and do not find strong evidence that the effect differs in expansion

states, consistent with our full analysis.

           In contrast with much of the existing literature, we do find ACA induced reductions in

labor force participation. This paper differs in several regards with prior studies. First, we focus

specifically on the near elderly, as opposed to the general work age population. For several reasons,

as discussed in the introduction, we expect this group to be more elastic and closer to making

retirement decisions. Given that the near-elderly are less likely to have child dependents, this is

also a group that is traditionally not a target of state Medicaid policies. Therefore, ACA potentially

has greater effects for this group both in terms of more generous exchange subsidies and in offering

insurance coverage to a previously untargeted population. Second, much of the prior focus has

been on the Medicaid expansion, which misses out on the effects of healthcare exchanges.

Nationally, 7.3% of 55-64 year olds are enrolled in exchanges. Meanwhile, exchange enrollment

    This corresponds to taking the ratio of 0.0907 and 0.485, the coefficients of column 3 in tables 4 and 8.

                                                            15
rates are 1.5%, 4.1%, 4.5%, and 5.4% for the less than 18, 18-34, 35-44, and 45-54 age groups,

respectively in 2017.3

        One notable exception is Wood (2019), who does find some ACA-induced labor supply

reductions when leveraging the Medicaid expansion and magnitude of the potential exchange

subsidy using income estimates from the ACS. The methodology relies on estimating potential

subsidy based on income, which is prone to measurement error in self-reported income and

endogeneity arising out of labor supply changes affecting the subsidy. The author also uses a

simulated instrument based on income bands and household type to address this issue; however,

the IV strategy assumes that individuals do not exhibit large shifts in income, even though the near

elderly is more elastic in their labor supply. Our study complements this analysis by providing an

alternative way of incorporating both Medicaid expansion and exchange subsidies, using the 65-

69 age group as the within-location control group.



C. Variation by Subsidy Levels

        Our main analysis exploits variation in age and pre-existing levels of uninsurance among

the near-elderly. However, there is also considerable variation in the effective level of the

premium tax credit across areas. As was mentioned earlier, because the ACA caps premium

contributions based on income, those who face the highest premiums receive correspondingly

higher subsidies, as highlighted in Figure 1. In addition, individuals who purchase health insurance

from exchanges in geographic areas where premiums are high also receive higher subsidies. In

this section, we explore whether coverage and labor market outcomes change differentially in areas

where subsidy levels are higher. Theoretically, one might expect the introduction of a larger

effective subsidy to induce a larger behavioral response, all else equal.

       To do this, we must first develop a proxy for the effective subsidy across areas. We obtain

premiums by county for the year 2014 from the Kaiser Family Foundation for the second lowest

cost silver tier plan, which is the plan that is used to determine the subsidy level. We calculate for

each county the subsidy level implied by these premiums for a 60-year-old in a single member

household with modified adjusted gross income of 133% FPL. Because our ACS data lacks county

identifiers but has identifiers for consistent PUMAs, we first use the Missouri Census Data

Center's Geocorr's (Geographic Correspondence Engine) crosswalk from counties to 2012

PUMAs. We use this crosswalk to calculate the average subsidy by 2012 PUMAs, which is the

average subsidy of all counties that overlap with the 2012 PUMA definition, weighted by the

fraction of the 2012 PUMA population in that county. Finally, we convert the average subsidy by

2012 PUMAs to the average subsidy by consistent PUMAs as the average subsidy of all 2012

PUMAs that intersect with it, weighted by the fraction of the consistent PUMA's population that

falls into that intersection. We are left with monthly subsidy levels by consistent PUMAs in 2014,

which are summarized in Figure 6. As shown in the figure, these monthly subsidy levels for a 60-

year old with annual income of approximately $16 thousand vary substantially, from a low of $209

per month to a high of $976 per month. On average, the monthly subsidy level is $502 per month.

       The correlation with baseline uninsurance shown in Figure 4 is 0.163, suggesting that any

variation in outcomes from differences across subsidies can be separately identified from that

stemming from differences across baseline uninsurance rates. Figure 7 shows the fraction insured

in PUMAs with subsidy levels that fall in the top and bottom quartile of the distribution. As shown

in the figure, there is a level difference in the rates of insurance of insurance coverage and both



                                                 17
sets of areas see increases in insurance coverage after the ACA is enacted. However, the spread

between these two areas shrinks after the ACA's enactment, suggesting that places with higher

subsidy levels saw larger increases in insurance coverage.

       We examine this in a regression framework, augmenting our original specification with an

additional interaction term using the demeaned level of monthly subsidy in each PUMA, divided

by $100. Specifically, we estimate the following regression equation:

       (3) "#$% = & % × $ × 60_64# + ' % × $ ×

           60_64# × (MMMMMMMMMMM/100)$ + "#$% + % + # + $ + #% + $% + #$ +

           $,!)* + #%,!)* + $%,!)* + #$,!)* + "#$%



where (MMMMMMMMMMM/100)$ denotes the demeaned monthly subsidy in $100 in PUMA p. The

interpretation of & is the DDD estimate for the average subsidy level, where ' indicates whether

the outcome variable changed differentially in areas with high subsidies.

       We report the results of estimating equation (3) with insurance outcomes in Table 10, and

an analogous equation with labor market outcomes in Table 11. Table 10 shows evidence that

places with higher subsidy levels had larger increases in insurance coverage after the ACA.

Specifically, a $100 change in the effective monthly subsidy increased insurance coverage by 5.2

percentage points for 60-64 year olds relative to 65-69 year olds for a given level of baseline

uninsurance following the ACA. When we split insurance coverage by source, the coefficient

estimates suggest that this increase came from directly purchased insurance and was somewhat

offset by employer coverage; however, the DDDD estimates in Columns (2) ­ (6) are statistically

insignificant.




                                               18
       In Table 11, we examine whether labor market outcomes changed differentially in areas

with higher effective subsidy levels. We find no evidence that labor force participation changed

differentially in areas with higher subsidies, and only employment shows a marginally significant

(p < 0.10) coefficient for the DDDD term across all of the extensive and intensive margin

outcomes. We conclude that while higher subsidy levels induced higher levels of insurance

coverage, this additional coverage does not appear to be associated with changes in labor market

outcomes.

       Note that our results may be attenuated due to the noise in our proxy for subsidy. First,

converting from counties to consistent PUMAs required two separate steps and weighting by

population estimates, so the subsidy values are likely measured with some error. Second, we use

the 2014 subsidy level; however, effective subsidy levels changed each year as premiums changed.

Therefore, it is possible that finer geographic identifiers and more refined premium data would

provide additional precision in the estimates.



D. Robustness Checks

       We explore the sensitivity of our results to several changes in our empirical specification.

First, we examine whether our results continue to hold when we limit our sample to ages 62-67,

allowing for a comparison of age groups that are plausibly more similar than our broader sample

of individuals aged 60 to 69. As shown in Appendix Tables A.2 ­ A.5, these results are

qualitatively and quantitatively similar to our main findings.

       We also perform a falsification test in which we include only those between the ages of 55-

64, and look for changes in 55-59 year olds relative to 60-64 year olds, since both groups were

affected by the ACA. Here, we find results that are small and statistically insignificant, bolstering



                                                 19
the evidence that the results we find when comparing 60-64 year olds to 65-69 year olds represent

meaningful changes for these groups resulting from the ACA (Appendix Tables A.6 ­ A.9).



V. CONCLUSION

       The Affordable Care Act substantially increased health insurance coverage among the non-

elderly in the U.S. Previous work has investigated the effect of the ACA on labor market outcomes.

Taken together, the results from this previous research suggest that this landmark legislation had

little effect on the labor market. However, most studies have considered a much broader age

segment than the 60-64 age group that we consider in our study.

       For three reasons, the near elderly are the group whose labor market outcomes are most

likely to be affected by the ACA-induced increases in health insurance coverage. First, health

insurance is more valuable to the near elderly given their higher expected health care costs. Second,

the premium subsidies provided to the near elderly were on average much higher than those

received by their younger counterparts. Third and perhaps most importantly, the elasticity of labor

supply among the near elderly is higher than among younger adults.

       Our results indicate that the ACA reduced the near elderly (60-64) labor force by about 1.1

percent (110 thousand) from 2014 through 2018. While the ACA may have affected labor market

outcomes for younger adults as well, for the reasons cited above this is the age group most likely

to be affected. In light of this, the reduction that we estimate is substantially smaller than would

be implied by the often-cited CBO estimates of 2.0 to 2.5 million (CBO, 2014). These labor market

effects should be considered in any overall assessment of the ACA along with its effects on health

outcomes and on economic well-being.
