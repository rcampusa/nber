                                           ABSTRACT

Increasingly detailed consumer information makes sophisticated price discrimination possible. At
˝fine levels of aggregation, demand may not obey standard regularity conditions. We propose a new
randomized sales mechanism for such environments. Bidders can "buy-it-now" at a posted price, or
"take-a-chance" in an auction where the top d > 1 bidders are equally likely to win. The randomized
allocation incentivizes high valuation bidders to buy-it-now. We analyze equilibrium behavior, and
apply our analysis to advertiser bidding data from Microsoft Advertising Exchange. In counterfactual
simulations, our mechanism increases revenue by 4.4% and consumer surplus by 14.5% compared
to an optimal second-price auction.

1         Introduction

Advertising technology is changing fast. Consumers can now be reached while browsing the
Internet, playing games on their phone or watching videos on YouTube. The large companies
that control these new media — household names like Google, Facebook and Yahoo! —
generate a substantial part of their revenue by selling advertisements. They also know more
and more information about their users. This allows them to match advertisers to potential
buyers with ever greater efficiency. While this matching technology generates surplus for
advertisers, it also tends to create thin markets where perhaps only a single advertiser has
a high willingness to pay. These environments pose special challenges for the predominant
auction mechanisms that are used to sell online ads because they reduce competition among
bidders, making it difficult for the platform to extract the surplus generated by targeting.
For example, a sportswear firm advertising on the New York Times website may be willing
to pay much more for an advertisement placed next to a sports article than one next to a
movie review. It might pay an additional premium for a local consumer who lives in New
York City and an even higher premium if the consumer is known to browse websites selling
sportswear. Each layer of targeting increases the sportswear firm’s valuation for the consumer
but also dramatically narrows the set of participating bidders to fellow sportswear firms in
New York City. Without competition, revenue performance may be poor (Bergemann and
Bonatti 2011, Levin and Milgrom 2010).
Suggestive empirical evidence for this is provided in Figure 1. The left panel shows the re-
scaled bids in 50 auctions by five large advertisers for the most popular webpage slot sold by
a large publisher through a second-price auction on Microsoft Advertising Exchange.1 The
bids exhibit considerable variation, even though all these impressions were auctioned within
a 3-hour period. We attribute this to matching on user demographics (evidence is provided
later in the paper). Moreover, there is often a large gap between the highest and second
highest bid in the second-price auction: on average the gap is bigger than the sales price.
Consider a simple model that formalizes this narrative: When advertisers “match” with
users, they have high valuation; otherwise they have low valuation. Assume that match
probabilities are independent across bidders, and sufficiently low that the probability that
any bidder matches is small. Then a second-price auction will typically get low revenue,
since the probability of two “matches” occurring in the same auction is very small. On the

Figure 1: Bids over Time, Bid Distribution and Virtual Bids. The left panel shows
the (rescaled) bids of five advertisers in our data, selected at random from the top 50 advertisers
(ranked by purchases) on 50 randomly chosen successive bids for the most popular product. The
set of impressions differs across advertisers; there are no impressions on which all 5 participate.
The right panel overlays a histogram of the bid data from the same product with a line plot of
the “virtual bid” function, which is defined analogously to the “virtual valuation” function as
b = b − 1−Fb(b) . The pdf f and cdf F are estimated by kernel smoothing with bandwidth 0.075.

other hand, setting a high fixed price is not effective since the probability of zero “matches”
occurring is large and many impressions would go unallocated. Allowing user targeting
creates asymmetries in valuations that increase efficiency, but decrease revenue.
But since targeting increases total surplus, platforms would like to allow targeting while
still extracting the surplus this creates. This paper outlines a new and simple mechanism
for doing so. We call it buy-it-now or take-a-chance (BIN-TAC), and it works as follows.
Goods are auctioned with a buy-it-now price p, set relatively high. If a single bidder chooses
buy-it-now, they get the good for price p. If more than one bidder takes the buy-it-now
option, a second price auction is held between those bidders with reserve p. Finally, if no-
one participates in buy-it-now, an auction is held in which the top d bidders are eligible to
receive the good, and it is randomly awarded to one of them at the (d + 1)-st highest price.
In this manner, we combine the advantages of an auction and a fixed price mechanism. When
matches occur, advertisers self-select into the fixed-price buy-it-now option, allowing for
revenue extraction. Advertisers are incentivized to take the “buy-it-now” option because in
the event that they “take-a-chance” on winning via auction, there is a significant probability
they will not win the impression, even if their bid is the highest. On the other hand, when
no matches occur, the impression is still allocated, thereby earning revenue.


                                                                  2
Online advertising is just one example of a market in which randomized price discrimination
mechanisms may be useful. Priceline offers consumers the chance to “name your own price”
when booking a hotel room. But in return they are guaranteed only a certain star rating and
rough location of the hotel — from their perspective, the actual allocation is random. This
allows hotels to dispose of excess inventory, while still providing an incentive to customers
with specific preferences to book at higher fixed prices. More generally, sales have a similar
logic to our mechanism. During a sale, goods are inefficiently rationed: the first person
willing to pay the sales price gets the object. Knowing this, high valuation buyers may buy
at the higher pre-sale prices, knowing that their chance of getting the good on sale is small.
Yet when no-one has high valuation, the sale ensures that the inventory is nonetheless sold.
Despite these examples, randomization is not part of the standard price discrimination
toolkit. This is especially true of the canonical single-unit auction environment under sym-
metric independent private values (SIPV), where Myerson (1981) and Riley and Samuelson
(1981) famously established that the seller’s optimal sales mechanism is just a (deterministic)
second price auction with a reserve price. But in deriving this result it is assumed that the
distribution of valuations is regular : the virtual valuations ψ(v) = v − 1−F  (v)
                                                                           f (v)
                                                                                   are increasing.
And although this holds for many standard distributions such as the normal and log-normal,
it is not hard to violate this assumption in richer environments.
The right panel of Figure 1 shows a histogram of the bids for the most popular webpage
slot, as well as the estimated virtual bids φ(b) = b − 1−F (b) . Notice that the virtual bids
                                                         b
                                            b
                                                            fb(b)
are certainly not increasing, even in regions where we have large numbers of observations.
Interpreting bids as valuations — reasonable since it is weakly dominant for advertisers to
bid their valuations — we can conclude that the distribution is irregular. We suspect that
irregular values are actually quite common in practice. Any kind of “matching” story of
the kind we outlined earlier could lead to bimodal distributions and possible irregularity.
Moreover, it is hard to write down a sensible demand system in which valuations are not
correlated, violating the IPV assumption. For example, if advertisers target users from a
specific geographic region, this will induce positive correlation between advertisers with the
same target region, and negative correlation across advertisers with different target regions.
Randomization will generally be necessary for optimal price discrimination with irregular
values. Moreover, this is exactly the case when price discrimination is most valuable. Bulow
and Klemperer (1996) proved that when valuations are regular, revenues from a simple second
price auction with n + 1 bidders exceeds the revenue from the revenue optimal mechanism

                                                3
with n bidders. This bounds the gain to design. But in the irregular environment this need
not be true: good design can make up for fewer bidders.
With this motivation in mind, we spend the rest of the paper investigating our BIN-TAC
mechanism. We have chosen to focus on it for a number of reasons. First, we believe it is
simple, both in that it is easy to explain to participants and in that it requires relatively little
input from the mechanism designer: a choice of buy-it-now price, randomization parameter
d and a reserve in the take-a-chance auction. It is also reasonably easy to play, as only
the buy-it-now decision requires some strategic thinking (it is weakly dominant to bid one’s
valuation in the auctions).
Second, we will argue that it is approximately optimal for the symmetric independent private
values environment with irregular valuations and robust to different informational environ-
ments. We show that in the simple two-type matching environment outlined earlier, BIN-
TAC is revenue optimal, outperforming the leading alternatives: a second price auction with
reserve, or the “bundling” solution in which the platform withholds targeting information, as
suggested in a number of recent papers.2 In a more general SIPV environment with irregular
valuations, BIN-TAC will not generally be revenue optimal. The optimal mechanism, as
suggested by Myerson (1981), is a direct mechanism that involves pooling groups of types
through “ironing”.3 Numerical simulations show that in mixture distribution environments,
BIN-TAC approximates the allocations and payments of this mechanism, achieving “almost
optimal” performance. In fact, when valuations are negatively correlated across bidders,
inducing bid gaps, BIN-TAC outperforms the ironing mechanism, despite its simplicity.
It is hard to motivate a mechanism based on simulations alone. So to analyze its performance
in a real-world setting, we turn to historical data from Microsoft Advertising Exchange.
Assuming that bids are equal to valuations, we can simulate the effect of introducing the
BIN-TAC mechanism. We find that the optimal BIN-TAC mechanism generates 4.4% more
revenue than the optimal second-price auction, while at the same time improving advertiser
surplus by 14.5%. This is possible because the optimal second-price auction uses a high
reserve to extract surplus from the long tail of valuations, whereas the BIN-TAC mechanism
does this through a high buy-it-now price, which avoids excluding low valuation bidders.

     The Myerson (1981) mechanism is optimal when the buyers know their valuations. If the seller can control
the flow of information, it can theoretically do better by asymmetrically revealing information (Bergemann
and Pesendorfer 2007) or selling the information dynamically (Eso and Szentes 2007).


                                                     4
Surprisingly, BIN-TAC also generates more revenue than the Myerson mechanism in our
simulations, regardless of whether we follow the standard algorithm for ironing the virtual
valuations, or find an optimal ironing region by numerical optimization. This is theoretically
possible because the independent values assumption fails to hold in our data. BIN-TAC
handles the large gap between the highest and second highest valuations better, since the
randomization threat induces buy-it-now even when the gap is large. By contrast, in the
Myerson mechanism the payment charged depends on the bids of the other bidders, and
when the gap is large — which is often the case — the payment is necessarily smaller.
We view the main contribution of our paper as introducing and analyzing a new, simple
and robust price discrimination mechanism that makes use of randomized auctions, and
then evaluating its performance in a realistic environment. Although we have motivated the
mechanism though a particular story about targeting in advertising exchanges, our insights
apply more generally to optimal design in the single unit auction environment with irregular
valuations. A secondary contribution of the paper is to document participation and bidding
behavior in the display advertising market specifically. While there has been theoretical
work on this market (Muthukrishnan 2010, McAfee 2011), and empirical work on the search
advertising market (Ostrovsky and Schwarz 2009, Athey and Nekipelov 2010), there has been
little empirical work of this sort on display advertising. Finally, we believe we are the first
to calculate and simulate revenues from the Myerson (1981) mechanism with ironing using
data from a real market, which may be of interest to the many people working on problems
in optimal mechanism design.


Related Work: Our work is fundamentally related to the work on optimal auction design
(Myerson 1981, Riley and Samuelson 1981, Maskin and Riley 1984, Crémer and McLean
1988). There has also been some recent work on simple designs, showing that they may
be approximately optimal (Hartline and Roughgarden 2009); and on screening problems
where the principal approximates the type space (Madarász and Prat 2010). In the online
advertising context, the seller has an additional choice variable: the decision of whether
or not to reveal information that allows advertisers to target their bids. This is related
to work on optimal information disclosure (Lewis and Sappington 1994, Bergemann and
Pesendorfer 2007, Eso and Szentes 2007). The BIN-TAC mechanism itself has the feel of
a sequential screening mechanism as in Courty and Li (2000), although our environment is
static. The buy-now option has been studied in other contexts, although typically its usage


                                              5
elsewhere is to allow buyers to bypass a lengthy English auction and/or avoid risk (Budish
and Takeyama 2001, Reynolds and Wooders 2009).
We focus on a private values setting, while Abraham, Athey, Babioff and Grubb (2010)
consider an adverse selection problem that arises in a pure common value setting when
some bidders are privately informed. This is motivated by the case when some advertisers
are better able to utilize the user information provided by the platform. They show that
asymmetry of information can sometimes lead to low revenue in this market.
In style our paper is close to Chu, Leslie and Sorensen (2011), who combine theory, simula-
tions and empirics to argue that bundle-size pricing is a good approximation to the optimal
mixed bundling pricing scheme for a monopolist selling multiple goods. Finally from an
empirical perspective, our paper contributes to the growing literature on online advertising
and optimal pricing. Much of the work here is experimental in nature — for example, Lewis
and Reiley (2011) ran a randomized experiment to test advertising effectiveness, while Os-
trovsky and Schwarz (2009) used an experimental design to test the impact of reserve prices
on revenues. There has also been recent empirical work on privacy and targeting in online
advertising (Goldfarb and Tucker 2011a, Goldfarb and Tucker 2011b).


Organization: The paper is in three parts. First, we give an overview of the market for
display advertising. In the second part we introduce a stylized environment, and prove ex-
istence and characterization results for the BIN-TAC mechanism. We also provide analytic
results concerning the revenue maximizing parameter choices, and compare our mechanism
to others using both theory and simulations. Finally, in the third part we provide an em-
pirical analysis using data from Microsoft Advertising Exchange, including counterfactual
simulations of our mechanism’s performance. All proofs are contained in the appendix.



2    The Display Advertising Market

The organization of the display advertising market is depicted in Figure 2. On one side
of the market are the “publishers”: these are websites who have desirable content and
therefore attract Internet users to browse their sites. These publishers earn revenue by
selling advertising slots on these sites. The other side of the market consists of advertisers.
They would like to display their advertisements to users browsing the publisher’s websites.


                                              6

They are buying user attention. Each instance of showing an advertisement to a user is
called an “impression”. Advertiser demand for each impression is determined by which user
they are reaching, and what the user’s current desires or intent are. For example, a Ferrari
dealer might value high income users located close to the dealership. A mortgage company
might value people that are reading an article on “how to refinance your mortgage” more
than those who are reading an article on “ways to survive your midlife crisis”, while the
dealership might prefer the reverse.
Some large publishers, primarily AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo!, sell directly to advertisers.
Since the number of users browsing such publishers is extremely large, they can predict with
high accuracy their user demographics. Consequently, they think of themselves of having a
known inventory, consisting of a number of products in well-defined buckets: for example,
male 15-24 year olds living in New York City viewing the Yahoo! homepage. They can
thus contract to sell 1 million impressions delivered to a target demographic to a particular
advertiser. Provided they have the inventory, they should be able to fulfill the contract.
Transactions of this kind are generally negotiated between the publisher and the advertiser.
Alternatively, content is sold by auction through a centralized platform called an advertis-
ing exchange. Examples of leading advertising exchanges include the Microsoft Advertising
Exchange (a subset of which we examine in this paper), Google’s DoubleClick, and Yahoo’s
RightMedia. These are large marketplaces: for example, in September 2009, RightMedia
averaged 9 billion transactions a day with hundreds of thousands of buyers and sellers
(Muthukrishnan 2010). Advertising exchanges are a minor technological wonder, as they
run all these auctions in real time. When a user loads a participating publisher’s webpage,

                                             7
a “request-for-content” is sent to the advertising exchange. This request will specify the
type and size of advertisement to be displayed on the page, as well as information about the
webpage itself (potentially including information about its content), and information about
the user browsing the page.4
The advertising exchange will then either allocate the impression to an advertiser at a pre-
viously negotiated price, or hold a second-price auction between participating advertisers.
If an auction is held, all or some of the information about the webpage and user is passed
along to ad brokers who bid on behalf of the advertisers. These ad brokers can be thought
of as proprietary algorithms that take as input an advertiser’s budget and preferences, and
output decisions on whether to participate in an auction and how much to bid. The winning
bidder’s ad is then served by the ad exchange, and shown on the publisher’s webpage.5
The bids are jointly determined by the preferences advertisers have, the ad broker interface
and the disclosure policies of the ad exchanges or the publishers they represent. The ad
brokers can only condition the bids they place on the information provided to them: if the
user’s past browsing history is not made available to them, they can’t use it in determining
their bid, even if their valuation would be influenced by this information. Similarly, the
advertisers are constrained in expressing their preferences by the technology of the ad broker:
if the algorithm doesn’t allow the advertiser to specify a different willingness to pay based
on some particular user characteristic, then this won’t show up in their bids.
Ad exchanges economize on transaction costs, by creating a centralized market for selling
ad space. They also allow for very detailed products to be sold, such as the attention of
a male 15-24 year old living in New York City viewing an article about hockey that has
previously browsed articles about sports and theater. There is no technological reason why
the products need to be sold in “buckets”, as publishers tend to do when guaranteeing sales in
advance. This “real-time” sales technology is often touted as the future of this industry, as it
potentially improves the match between the advertiser and their target audience. Currently
ads are sold both through negotiation and advertising exchanges, with the most valuable
impressions sold in advance, and the remainder sold on the exchange — a sequential sales
mechanism that is similar to the BIN-TAC mechanism we will now analyze.
   4
    For example, it may include their IP address and cookies that indicate their past browsing behavior.
   5
    To make things yet more complicated, in some ad exchanges — though not Microsoft Advertising
Exchange — two different pricing models coexist. The first is pay-per-impression, analyzed in the current
paper; the second is pay-per-click, where the payment depends on whether or not the user clicks on the
advertisement. Ad exchanges use expected click through rates to compare these different bids.

3       Model and Analysis

3.1     The Environment

A seller (publisher) has a single impression to sell in real time, and they have information
about the user viewing the webpage, summarized in a cookie.6 The seller is considering
one of two policies: either disclosing the cookie content to the advertiser (the “targeting”
policy), or withholding it (the “bundling” policy). When they allow targeting, bidders know
whether the user is a “match” for them or not. When a match occurs, the bidder has a high
valuation. But the probability of a match is low and matches are assumed independent, so
it is likely that everyone in the auction has a low valuation. Allowing targeting may make
the market “thin” in the sense of bids being relatively low.
Instead the seller may choose to withhold the cookie, so that bidders are uncertain about
whether the user is a match for them or not. The seller thus bundles good impressions with
bad ones, so that bidders have intermediate valuations. This reduces match surplus, but
also reduces the bidder’s information rents and so may be good for revenue.
The formal model is as follows. There are n ≥ 2 symmetric bidders who participate in an
auction for a single good which is valued at zero by the seller. Bidders are risk neutral.7
They have value VH for the good when a match occurs, and value VL for the good if no match
occurs, where VL ∼ FL and VH ∼ FH . We assume that FL has support [ω L , ω L ] and FH has
support [ω H , ω H ], and that these supports are disjoint (so ω L < ω H ). We assume both FL
and FH have continuous densities fL and fH . The Bernoulli random variable X indicates
whether a match has occurred, and the event X = 1 occurs with probability α ∈ (0, 1).
The bidder type is a triple (X, VL , VH ), drawn identically and independently across bidders,
and independently of each other. This implies that a user who is a match for one advertiser
need not be a match for the others. In the case with targeting, each advertiser’s realized
valuation V = (1−X)VL +XVH is private information, known only to the advertiser. Instead
if the seller bundles all impressions, the advertiser knows VL and VH but does not know the
realization of X, implying their expected valuation is E[V ] = (1 − α)VL + αVH .
    6
     Roughly speaking, cookies allow advertisers and data brokers to track the browsing behavior of Internet
users; they can also be linked to basic demographic information.
   7
     Risk aversion will in general improve the performance of our mechanism relative to a second-price
auction, since risk-averse bidders will be more willing to pay a high buy-it-now price to avoid the risk of the
take-a-chance auction.


                                                      9
Most of our analysis concerns the case where the seller discloses the targeting information.
In this case our model is equivalent to a standard SIPV model in which each bidder’s single-
dimensional valuation is drawn from the mixture distribution F , with F (v) = (1 − α)FL (v)
when v ∈ [ω L , ω L ], and F (v) = (1 − α) + αFH (v) when v ∈ [ω H , ω H ]. To avoid analyzing
multiple cases, we make some technical assumptions on the virtual valuations ψ(v) = v −
1−F (v)
 f (v)
        .   We assume that ψ(v) is continuous and increasing over the regions [ω L , ω L ] and
[ω H , ω H ], crossing zero once in the low valuation region; and that ψ(ω L ) ≤ ψ(ω H ). The
virtual valuations are (infinitely) negative over the region (ω L , ω H ) since F is unsupported
on this region. So the virtual valuations are not increasing, and the distribution F is irregular.


Discussion: We assume that the match random variables X and the valuations VL and
VH are independent across bidders. We focus on the independent case because it is canonical
in the price discrimination and mechanism design literatures, and so is a natural starting
point (we will allow for correlated values in later simulations). We also restrict attention to
environments where α is small, so that the probability of zero or a single match is high. This
is the interesting case, reflecting the industry concern that providing “too much” targeting
information reduces competition and hurts revenues. As shown in Figure 1 we observe a large
gap between the highest and second highest bid in our data, which motivates this choice.
An important special case occurs when the distributions FL and FH are degenerate, with all
their mass in atoms at vL and vH respectively. We call this the two-type case, since there
are two types of bidders: those who matched, and therefore have valuation vH , and those
who didn’t, with valuation vL . We will analyze this case before diving into analysis of the
full model, since it provides useful intuition. But first we describe our mechanism.


3.2         Pricing Mechanisms

BIN-TAC works as follows. A buy-it-now price p is posted. Buyers simultaneously indicate
whether they wish to buy-it-now (BIN ). In the event that exactly one bidder elects to buy-
it-now, that bidder wins the auction and pays p. If two or more bidders elect to BIN, a
second-price sealed bid auction with reserve p is held between those bidders. Bidders who
chose to BIN are obliged to participate in this auction. Finally, if no-one elects to BIN, a
sealed bid take-a-chance (TAC ) auction is held between all bidders, with a reserve r. In
that auction, one of the top d bidders is chosen uniformly at random, and if that bidder’s


                                               10
bid exceeds the reserve, they win the auction and pay the maximum of the reserve and the
(d + 1)-th bid (if it exists). Ties among d-th highest bidders are broken randomly prior to
the random allocation. We call r the TAC-reserve, and d the randomization parameter.
To analyze the performance of BIN-TAC, it will be useful to have some benchmarks for
comparison. A natural benchmark is the pricing mechanism that is most commonly used in
practice, the second price auction (SPA). We distinguish between when an SPA is used and
targeting is allowed (SPA-T), and when it is used with bundling (SPA-B).
Another benchmark is Myerson’s (1981) revenue optimal mechanism for the SIPV environ-
ment, which may require ironing.8 Ironing requires that sometimes the allocation is random-
ized among bidders with different valuations, and so — just as in our TAC auction — the
winning bidder need not have the highest valuation. The difference is that in the optimal
mechanism, the randomization only takes place when two or more bidders — including the
highest valuation bidder — have valuations in a given “ironing” region.


3.3     The Two-Type Case

To gain intuition, we start by analyzing the two-type environment. Here the goal is to set
the BIN-TAC parameters in such a way that bidders who match take the buy-it-now option,
and the rest take-a-chance. Then whenever at least two bidders match, they will bid up
the price to their common valuation vH ; whenever a single bidder matches, the revenue will
be the buy-it-now price p; and whenever no-one matches, the revenue will be vL (provided
d ≤ n − 1). Since bidders match independently according to the Bernoulli random variable
X, the number of matches is Binomial(n,α). The buy-it-now price is constrained by incentive
compatibility, as high types must prefer to buy-it-now. Optimally setting the TAC reserve
to vL to economize on math, the remaining BIN-TAC parameters are chosen to solve the
following expected revenue maximization problem:
                       nn       o
                             , 1 (1 − α)n vL + nα(1 − α)n−1 p + 1 − (1 − α)n − nα(1 − α)n−1 vH
                                                                                           
       max = min
        d,p              d
                          1
subject to        vH − p ≥ (vH − vL )           (IC)                                                     (1)
                          d
   8
     As earlier remarked, the seller potentially achieve even higher revenue by selling the information. But
the results of Eso and Szentes (2007) do not immediately apply here, since the buyers start with two pieces
of information VL and VH ; whereas in their model buyers have only one piece of information initially.



                                                    11
The revenue expression follows the logic outlined above, allowing for the possibility that
d > n, so that the good may not be allocated to any of the TAC bidders. The LHS of
the IC constraint is the payoff to a high type from buying-it-now assuming no other types
buy-it-now; and the RHS is the expected payoff from taking-a-chance, again assuming no
other types buy-it-now. Conditioning on no-one else taking the BIN option does not affect
the IC constraint, since if someone does, expected surplus is zero regardless of whether the
buyer elects to BIN or TAC.
Clearly the seller wants to set the BIN price so the IC constraint holds with equality; which
                                    d−1
implies a BIN price equal to         d
                                        vH   + d1 vL . Notice this is strictly increasing in d, which
makes sense since it is the threat of randomization in the TAC auction that makes the BIN
option attractive. Substituting out for the price in the objective function yields an integer
optimization problem in d. The objective function is strictly increasing in d until d = n,
since randomization in the TAC auction is costless (all bidders are willing to pay the reserve
vL ) and the BIN price is increasing. It has a bang-bang solution: either d = n or d = ∞.
The latter is equivalent to setting a reserve at vH and never selling to the low-types, optimal
when αvH ≥ vL (i.e. when a seller selling to a single agent would prefer a price of vH to vL ).
The interior solution is more interesting: the seller randomly allocates the object among the
n bidders if no-one takes the BIN option, charging the low valuation vL . The mechanism
achieves the efficient allocation, since if there is a high type they take the BIN option and get
the object, and otherwise the object is allocated to a low type. Letting qi be the probability of
exactly i matches, expected revenue simplifies to q0 + qn1 vL + 1 − q0 − qn1 vH , a weighted
                                                                               

average of the low and high valuations.
How does this compare to other mechanisms? The SPA-T achieves identical efficiency and
revenue in the case where the gap in valuations vH − vL is sufficiently high that d∗ = ∞.
But in the other case where the low types are not excluded, the SPA-T is equally efficient
but achieves lower revenue. This is because with probability q0 + q1 there will be zero or one
high types, and revenue will be vL , as compared to a weight on vL of q0 + qn1 in BIN-TAC.9
                                                                              

Under bundling the analysis is trivial since all bidders have expected valuations of αvH +
(1 − α)vL , implying random allocation and revenue from the SPA-B of αvH + (1 − α)vL .
One can show that in the interior case the weight on vL under BIN-TAC is lower than than
   9
    This is a neat illustration of the well-known fact that the revenue equivalence theorem fails when the
distribution of valuations is discrete: BIN-TAC and the SPA-T have identical allocations, extract identical
expected payments from the lowest type, and yet generate different revenues.

under SPA-B (i.e.        q0 +   n
                                         < (1 − α)), strictly for n > 2. This implies BIN-TAC has
higher revenues than bundling (and clearly this remains true in the case where exclusion is
optimal). In addition, bundling is less efficient, since the allocation is random.
Finally, BIN-TAC is in fact revenue-optimal within the class of all mechanisms that commit
to targeting (see our online appendix for a proof).10 To summarize, in the two-type case,
BIN-TAC is both efficient and revenue optimal, and dominates both second-price auction
mechanisms on both revenue and efficiency (strictly in some cases). These good properties
motivate an analysis of the general case with a continuum of types.


3.4     General Case: Equilibrium Analysis

Returning to the general environment, we proceed by backward induction to characterize
equilibrium strategies under BIN-TAC. If multiple players choose to BIN, the allocation
mechanism reduces to a second-price auction with reserve p. Thus, it is weakly dominant for
players to bid their valuations.11 Truth-telling is also weakly dominant in the TAC auction.12
Taking these auction strategies as given, we turn to the decision whether to buy-it-now or
take-a-chance. Intuitively, the BIN option should be more attractive to higher types: they
have the most to lose from either random allocation (they may not get the good even if they
are willing to pay the most) or from rivals taking the BIN option (they certainly do not get
the good). This suggests that in a symmetric equilibrium, the BIN decision takes a threshold
form: ∃ v and types with v ≥ v elect to BIN, and the rest do not. This is in fact the case.
Prior to stating a formal theorem, we introduce the following notation. Let the random
variable Y j be the j-th highest draw in an i.i.d sample of size n − 1 from F (i.e., the j-th
highest rival valuation) and let Y ∗ be the maximum of Y d and the TAC reserve r.
  10
     As an example of the Bergemann and Pesendorfer (2007) argument that it may be even better to give
different information to different bidders, consider giving the match information to (n − 1) of the bidders
and making them sequential take-it-or-leave-it offers at price vH , selling to the last (uninformed) bidder at
αvH + (1 − α)vL if none of the others buy. This has higher expected revenue than BIN-TAC.
  11
     Since participation is obligatory at this stage, the minimum allowable bid is p, but no bidder would take
the BIN option unless they had a valuation of at least p. Note, however, that even if a bidder’s value is
above p, they may not choose to take the BIN auction.
  12
     The logic is standard: if a bidder with valuation v bids b0 > v, it can only change the allocation when
the maximum of the d-th highest rival bid and the reserve price is in [v, b0 ]. But whenever this occurs, the
resulting price is above the bidder’s valuation and if she wins she will regret her decision. Alternatively, if
she bids b0 < v, when she wins the price is not affected, and her probability of winning will decrease.




                                                      13
Theorem 1 (Equilibrium Characterization) Assume d > 1. Then there exists a unique
symmetric pure strategy Bayes-Nash equilibrium of the game, characterized by a threshold v
satisfying:
                                         1 
                                  v = p + E v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v
                                                             
                                                                                                (2)
                                         d
where types with v ≥ v take the BIN option; and all types bid their valuation in any auction
that may occur.


Equation (2) is intuitive: Which type is indifferent between the BIN and TAC options?
Since strategies are increasing, the choice is relevant only when there are no higher valuation
bidders (since otherwise those bidders would BIN and win the resulting auction). So if a
bidder has the highest value and chooses to BIN, they get a surplus of v − p. Choosing
to TAC gives d1 E [v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v], since they only win with probability d1 , although their
payment of Y ∗ is on average much lower. Equating these two gives the indifferent type v.
Now we consider the revenue-maximizing choices of the design parameters: the BIN price
p, the TAC reserve r and the randomization parameter d. It is hard to characterize the
optimal d, as it is an integer programming problem which does not admit standard opti-
mization approaches. However for a given d, the optimal BIN price and TAC reserve can be
characterized using first order conditions:

Theorem 2 (Optimal Buy Price and Reserve) For any randomization parameter d,
the revenue-maximizing TAC reserve r∗ is either equal to ω H or is the unique solution of

                                                1 − F (r)
                                           r=                                                   (3)
                                                  f (r)

The optimal BIN price is given by p(v ∗ , r) where p(v, r) = v − d1 E [v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v] and v ∗ is
either equal to ω H or is a solution of the equation below:

           ∂E[v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v]
                                                                    
                                         (d − 1)f (v) (n − 1)f (v)
                                                                         E v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v
                                                                                           
        d−                      =                    +                                          (4)
                  ∂v                      1 − F (v)      F (v)

Equation (3) is familiar: the optimal TAC reserve is exactly the standard reserve in Myerson
(1981), ensuring that no types with negative virtual valuation are ever awarded the object.
This is a little surprising, since BIN-TAC is not the optimal mechanism. But raising the
TAC reserve lowers the surplus from participating in the TAC auction, and so the seller can

                                                 14
also raise the BIN price while keeping the indifferent type v constant. So the trade-off is
the usual one: raising the TAC reserve increases expected payments from types above r∗ —
even those who take the BIN option — at the cost of losing revenue from the marginal type.
On the other hand, the implicit equation for the optimal BIN price is new. Notice that the
BIN price in some sense sets a reserve at v. If two bidders meet the reserve, the seller gets
the second highest bid; if only one, the BIN price; and if none, he gets the TAC revenue. So a
marginal increase in the threshold has three effects. First, if the highest bidder has valuation
exactly equal to the threshold, following an increase she will shift from BIN to TAC. This
costs the seller the difference between the BIN price and the expected revenue from the TAC
auction (which is lower). Second, if the second highest bidder has valuation equal to the
threshold, an increase will knock her out of the BIN auction, and the seller’s revenue falls
by v − p(v, r∗ ). Finally, if the highest bidder is above the reserve and the second highest
                                           ∂p(v,r∗ )
is below, an increase gains the seller       ∂v
                                                     .   Working out the probabilities of these various
                    ∂p(v,r∗ )
events, expanding     ∂v
                                and equating expected costs and benefits, we get the result.
We cannot rule out a corner solution for the buy-price, where it is set equal to ωH . This can
easily occur if the value of a match is high (i.e. ω H  ω L ). In this case it is not profitable
to randomize the allocation for any of the high types: the BIN price is set at p(ω H , r∗ ) so
that the lowest high type at ω H elects to BIN.


3.5    General Case: Performance Comparisons

We now compare the BIN-TAC mechanism to each of the other benchmark mechanisms.
Our first observation is that SPA-T is just a special case of BIN-TAC, and so any outcome
achievable by the SPA-T is also achievable by BIN-TAC. Notice that when d = 1, the TAC
auction is just a second price auction. So any SPA-T with optimal reserve r can be mimicked
by a BIN-TAC mechanism with the same reserve, d = 1 and p = ∞. Moreover, as we saw in
the two-type case, when the objective is revenue maximization, BIN-TAC can sometimes do
strictly better — in fact, we will see in the empirical application a case where the revenue-
optimal BIN-TAC beats the revenue-optimal SPA-T on both revenue and consumer surplus.
We saw earlier that BIN-TAC also dominated the SPA-B when there were only two types.
This is unfortunately not true in general: BIN-TAC trades-off increased revenues from high
types (by providing match information) against lower revenues and inefficient allocations to
low types. This may be less profitable than limiting information rents through bundling. But

                                                         15
in the Monte Carlo simulations presented in Section 3.6, BIN-TAC generally outperforms
bundling.
Clearly BIN-TAC will have (weakly) worse revenue performance than the Myerson mecha-
nism, which is revenue optimal. The question is how close BIN-TAC gets. As we show in
the online appendix, whenever the low types are not excluded, the Myerson mechanism has

the number of other bids in (e
good is allocated uniformly at random to a bidder in the ironing region at price ve. Like
BIN-TAC, this is inefficient, but allows additional revenue extraction from higher types. In
equilibrium bidders bid their valuations. The mechanism is ex-post incentive compatible in
the following sense: no bidder would have an incentive to change their bid if they were told
the other bids prior to the outcome of any randomization.
Having obtained this characterization, we can compare BIN-TAC with the Myerson mech-
anism (OPT). For now, let us focus on a simple environment, where n = 5, α = 0.05, FL
is uniform over [0, 1] and FH is uniform over [3, 4]. Figure 3 shows the interim allocation
probabilities (top panel) and expected payments by type (bottom panel) as a function of
bidder type. The optimal mechanism has a discontinuous jump in the allocation probability
at ve = 0.676, and then irons until the high valuation region on [3, 4]. As you can see, BIN-
TAC is able to approximate the discontinuous increase in allocation probability at ve with
a smooth curve, by randomizing the allocation in that region using the TAC auction. The
important thing is that neither BIN-TAC nor OPT assign the good with high probability
to any of the types in [0, 1]; thereby incentivizing the high types to take the BIN option /
report their high type truthfully. By contrast, the SPA-T offers high allocation chances to
the highest types on [0, 1], and so can’t extract high revenues from the types on [3, 4].
For SPA-B, the figures depict the allocation probabilities and expected payments as a func-
tion of the realized valuations of the agent (which are unknown to the agent under bundling).
For instance, for a given realized high valuation vH (i.e. on [3, 4]), the allocation proba-
bility plotted on the y-axis is equal to the average allocation probability across all types
(1 − α)VL + vH , who will bid their expected valuations in the second-price auction under

bundling. As you can see, this implies that the allocation probability is no longer monotone:
since matches are ex-ante unlikely (α = 0.05), the most aggressive bidders in the bundling
auction are those who have high valuations even without matching (high vL ), and therefore
they are most likely to get the object. This makes the trade-off clear: the bundling mecha-
nism raises expected payments when there is no match (because bidders do not know they
haven’t matched), and substantially lowers them in the case of a match.
Table 1 compares the outcomes of the mechanisms. The expected revenue performance of
BIN-TAC is close to the optimal mechanism (about 96% of OPT), much better than the
optimal SPA-T (85%). SPT-B performs less well than both BIN-TAC and OPT, especially in
terms of consumer surplus. This is because it fails to match advertisers and users correctly.




                                                              17
3.6     Monte Carlo Simulations

We now test our mechanism in a wider range of environments. We drop the assumption that
FL and FH have disjoint support, and consider location families where FH (·) = FL (· − ∆)
for some shift-parameter ∆. ∆ is the difference in mean valuation between the high and
low groups, which we call the “match increment”. We consider two location families: one
where VL is normal, and another where VL is log normally distributed. In both cases VL has
mean 1 and standard deviation 0.5. We allow ∆, n and α to vary across experiments, and
compute r∗ , p∗ and d∗ as discussed. The default parameters we consider are n = 10, ∆ = 5,
and α = .05, and we vary one parameter at a time. Expected revenues are calculated by
simulation: for each case, we sample T auctions (i.e. nT iid valuations); optimize the choices
of parameters such as reserve or buy-price according to the analytic results we or others have
derived, and report the average revenue across the T auctions at the optimal parameters for
each mechanism.13
The results are presented in Figures 5, 6 and 7. On the y-axis we plot the “gain to design”:

                                             E[Rev(M, θ)] − E[Rev(SP A, 0)]
                           GD%(M, θ) =
                                                E[V 1 ] − E[Rev(SP A, 0)]

where M indexes mechanisms and θ parameterizes M . E[Rev(SP A, 0)] is the revenue from
a second-price mechanism without reserve and E[V 1 ] is the expected value of the highest
bidder. This measures the fraction of the available surplus a more sophisticated mechanism
is able to capture, relative to a second price auction without reserve. We use it because it is
invariant under affine transformation of the valuation distribution, which would not be true
of raw revenue numbers or ratios.
This irregular environment has high potential gains to design, often over 20%. For compar-
ison, adding an extra bidder to the default environment and then running an SPA without
reserve (as in Bulow and Klemperer (1996)) is worth between 6-7%, depending on the dis-
tribution. BIN-TAC often performs much better than SPA-T, which is not surprising given
our earlier analysis. More strikingly, BIN-TAC performs very comparably to the optimal
Myerson mechanism, which obtains the maximum gains to design. The bundling mechanism
generally performs very poorly, except in the case where the number of bidders is small.
  13
     We use the optimal reserve in all cases; iron the virtual valuations using the techniques of Myerson (1981);
and get the BIN-TAC parameters (p, r) from Theorem 2 for each d, computing revenues at d ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}
to find the best one.


                                                       18
We also run a more complex simulation in which we allow for correlated values. To model
correlation, we sample from a Gaussian copula with variance-covariance matrix having on-
diagonal elements equal to 1, and off diagonal elements equal to ρ. When ρ is negative,
elements are pairwise negatively correlated, so that valuations are “spaced out” and in
expectation there is a bigger “gap” between the highest and second highest valuation. Con-
versely, when ρ is positive, valuations are clustered. We then inverse transform the sampled
quantile vectors using the mixture distribution F = αFH + (1 − α)FL , where FL and FH
are as above. Holding the baseline n = 10, ∆ = 5 and α = 0.05, we vary ρ in Figure 8.14
We find that BIN-TAC outperforms the Myerson mechanism with negative correlation, and
performs worse when valuations are positively correlated.
Overall, the performance of BIN-TAC is very good, at least for the distributions and param-
eters chosen, and particularly when valuations are “spaced out”. The main caveats are that
it doesn’t perform well with very few bidders (when bundling is preferable), or when matches
are highly probable or very valuable (a second-price auction would do as well). Its niche is
in markets with many bidders but low match probabilities, so that markets are “thin” in the
sense of having relatively low matches and bid gaps in expectation.



4     Empirical Application

Our theoretical analysis has shown that there are cases in which BIN-TAC performs well.
We now test our mechanism’s performance in a real-world setting. We have historical data
from Microsoft Advertising Exchange, one of the world’s leading ad exchanges. Our data
comes from a single large publisher’s auctions on this exchange and consists of a 0.1%
random sample of a week’s worth of auction data from this publisher, sampled within the
last two years. This publisher sells multiple “products”, where a product is a URL-ad size
combination (e.g. a large banner ad on the sports landing page of the New York Times).
The data includes information from both the publisher and the advertiser. On the publisher
side, we see the url of the webpage the ad will be posted on, the size of the advertising space
and the IP address of the user browsing the website. We form a unique identifier for the url-
size pair, and call that a product. We determine which US state the user IP originates from,
  14
     Because we now sample directly from F , comparison to SPA-B is not possible. There is also no guarantee
that the ironing algorithm will work well under correlated values, and so we add in an additional version of
the Myerson mechanism where the ironing region is chosen by numerical optimization, rather than ironing.


                                                    19
and call that a region. We use controls for product and region throughout the descriptive
regressions. Unfortunately, we do not have more detailed information on the product or the
user, as the tags and cookies passed by the publisher to the ad exchange were not stored.
On the advertiser side, we see the company name, the ad broker they employed, a variable
indicating the ad they intend to show, and their bid.15 We see who won each auction and
the final price. We drop auctions in which the eventual allocation was determined by biased
bids and modifiers.16 We also restrict attention to impressions that originate in the US,
and where the publisher content is in English. Finally, we only consider frequently sold
products, those with at least 100 sales in the dataset. This leaves us with a sample of 83515
impressions.
The dataset is summarized in Table 2. For confidentiality reasons, bids have been rescaled so
that the average bid across all observations is equal to 1 unit. Bids are very skew, with the
median bid being only 0.57 units. Perhaps as a consequence of this skewness, the winning bid
— which is more heavily sampled from the right tail of the bid distribution — is much higher
at 2.96 units. There are on average 6 bidders per auction, but there is considerable variation
in participation, with a standard deviation of nearly 3. Bids are not strongly correlated: as
the table shows, the correlation between a randomly selected pair of bids from each auction
is only 0.01. This is not statistically significant at 5% (p-value 0.116, N = 15827).
The advertisers are themselves quite active in the market. On average they bid on 0.7%
of all impressions, and win nearly 40% of those they bid on. But participation is quite
skew, and the median advertiser is far less active, bidding on only 0.02% of impressions;
while the most active advertiser participates in nearly 90% of auctions. Some advertisers
choose to participate in relatively few auctions, but tend to bid quite highly and therefore
win with relatively high probability. Others bid lower amounts in many auctions, and win
with lower probability. The first strategy is followed by companies who want to place their
advertisements only on webpages with specific content or to target specific demographics,
while the latter strategy is followed by companies whose main aim is brand visibility.
  15
     In the overwhelming majority of cases there is a single ad for each company, but some larger firms have
multiple ad campaigns simultaneously. We treat these as being a single ad campaign in what follows because
each firm should have the same per impression valuation across campaigns.
  16
     When the advertiser has a technologically complex ad to display, their bid is modified down (for allocation
purposes) and up (for payment purposes). When the advertiser has a previously negotiated contract with
the platform, their bid may be biased (usually upward for allocation, and downward for payment). It is hard
to know how to treat these auctions since valuations may vary with the kind of ad being displayed; and bids
may depends on what contract each bidder has, what other bidders know about these contracts etc.

4.1     Descriptive Evidence

Before proceeding to the main estimation and simulations, we provide some evidence that
advertisers bid differently on different users (i.e. there is matching on user demographics).
We also show that the platform is doing poorly in extracting this match surplus as revenue.
We introduced our first piece of evidence in the introduction in Figure 1. As we noted, there
is significant variation in the bids of large advertisers over a short time horizon. While this
could be driven by decreases in the advertisers’ available budget, since the bids go both up
and down it seems more likely that this variation arises from matching on user demographics.
A more direct test of advertiser-user matching is to look for the significance of advertiser-
user fixed effects in explaining bids. We estimate an unrestricted model where the dependent
variable is bids and the controls are advertiser-user dummies, versus a restricted model with
just advertiser and user fixed effects, but not their interaction. The restricted model is
overwhelmingly rejected by the data (p-value ≈ 0). This suggests matching on demographics.
Proving that this matching is motivated by economic considerations is a little more difficult.
The only user demographic we observe is the user region, and it is hard to know a priori what
the advertisers’ preferences over regions are. To get a handle on this, we turn to another
proprietary dataset that indicates how often an advertiser’s webpage was viewed by Internet
users in different regions of the country during the calendar month prior to the auction.17
Our intention is to proxy for the advertisers’ geographic preferences (insofar as these exist)
using this pageview data: firms who operate in only a few regions probably attract most
of their pageviews from those regions, and also mainly want to advertise in those regions.
If this is right, advertisers who attract a large fraction of their pageviews from a particular
region should participate more frequently and bid higher on users from those regions.18 We
normalize the pageviews from a particular state by the state population to get a per capita
pageview measure, and construct the fraction of normalized pageviews each region receives,
calling this the “pageview ratio”.
In Table 3, we present results from regressions of auction participation (a dummy equal to
one if the advertiser participated), and bid (conditional on participation) on the pageview
ratio, as well as a number of fixed effects. Because the sheer size of our dataset makes it
difficult to run the fixed effect regressions, we run this on a subsample consisting of the
  17
    For example, if these auctions were in May, the pageview data would be taken from April.
  18
    Since the pageview data dates from a period before our exchange data we are less worried about reverse
causality (i.e. advertisers who win more impressions from region X later get more views from region X).

top 10% of advertisers.19 The first column shows participation as a function of the pageview
ratio, as well as product-region fixed effects, and time-of-day fixed effects (since participation
and bids may vary with the user’s local time). We find a positive but insignificant effect.
But when we include advertiser fixed effects to control for different participation frequencies
across advertisers, we find a much bigger and now highly significant effect. All else equal,
an advertiser is 3.3% more likely to bid on a user from a state that contributes 10% of the
population-weighted pageviews for their site than one that contributes none. This is a large
increase, as the average probability of participation is only around 1%.
Turning to the bids, we get similar estimates and significance levels from the specifications
with and without advertiser fixed effects. We find that firms bid higher on users from more
relevant regions, although this effect is relatively modest in economic terms. Given that our
proxy for advertiser preferences is relatively crude, it is notable that we find these effects.
This provides some evidence that the matching is surplus increasing, in that advertisers are
able to target regions where their most valuable customers are.
Next we ask whether the platform is able to extract most of the consumer surplus. As
discussed in the introduction, the average bid in an auction is 0.88, while the mean gap
between the highest and second highest bid is much larger at 1.89, indicating that there is a
  19
    Fortunately since participation is highly skewed, these advertisers account for 90% of the bids. With
only bidder fixed effects we could use a within transformation to reduce the computational burden; but
unfortunately this is not possible with multiple non-interacting fixed effects.


                                                      22
lot of money left on the table by a second-price mechanism (see Table 2 for other summary
statistics). That gap itself is extremely skewed.
Assuming bids are equal to valuations — an assumption we will motivate in the next section
— figure 4 shows the estimated virtual valuations ψ(v),
                                                  d calculated from a non-parametric
estimate of the marginal distribution of bids. Although the virtual valuations are never
infinitely negative, as in our stylized model, they are certainly non-monotone. This implies
that BIN-TAC may be able to extract more revenue than a second price auction.


4.2     Estimation and Counterfactual Simulations

We want to calculate how platform revenues would change if the platform instead used
a different sales mechanism with optimally chosen parameters. As in Haile and Tamer
(2003), we use an incomplete model of the environment for inference. Because the existing
mechanism is a second price auction, we get pointwise identification of valuations under
relatively weak assumptions that we outline below. But for some — but not all — of the
counterfactual simulations we will need to complete the model by specifying the information
structure in detail. Since we are not sure what the most realistic model is, we consider several
possibilities, including a complete information model, and a symmetric private values model
with correlation. For each of these models, we have to optimize over the various parameter
choices to get the revenue-optimal version of each sales mechanism. In this optimization
step we enforce a uniform parameter choice for all auctions, ruling out different reserves or
randomization parameters by product or user-region.20 The BIN-TAC mechanism performs
well even when the parameter choices are coarse in this way, which alleviates the concern
that our mechanism requires the seller to have detailed knowledge in order to design the
mechanism. Each step in this process is explained more carefully below.


Step 1: Inference: Our original model was of a single auction rather an entire mar-
ketplace. We now offer a richer model that allows us to make sense of the dataset.21 A
sequence of impressions is sequentially auctioned over a time period by second-price sealed
bid auctions. Each impression corresponds to a user-product tuple. We assume there is a
   20
      Although the revenue of all mechanisms increases when we allow the parameters to be chosen “finely”
(product-by-product), BIN-TAC continues to outperform the second price alternatives. We have not tested
it against the Myerson mechanism on a product-by-product basis.
   21
      We rule out search and dynamic behavior — see Backus and Lewis (2012) for a model of that form.


                                                   23
fixed set of N advertisers who are present throughout that time period, and who have zero
costs of participating in an auction. Letting i = 1 . . . N index the advertisers, j = 1 . . . J
index the products, and t = 1 . . . T index the impressions, we assume that advertisers have
valuations of the form vi,t = fi (xt , jt ) where xt is some vector of user characteristics (largely
unobserved by us), and jt is the product being sold (known to us). Conditional on product,
user characteristics xt are sampled identically and independently across impressions (i.e. if
s and t are both auctions of product j, xs is independent of xt ). This implies that the
valuation vectors vt = (v1,t , v2,t . . . vN,t ) are also conditionally independent, with conditional
distributions {Fj }Jj=1 . Advertisers know their own valuations. They get a payoff of vi,t − pt
when they win an impression, where pt is the price paid. Losing bidders get nothing. They
seek to maximize the sum of their payoffs across all T impressions.
We make a single assumption on advertiser behavior: whenever they have a strictly positive
valuation for an impression, they participate and bid their valuation. Given the payoff
structure, this strategy is weakly dominant. This one assumption allows us to make strong
inferences from the data. If advertiser i did not participate in auction t, we deduce their
valuation is vi,t = 0; and if they did, we infer a valuation vi,t = bi,t . Since valuations vectors
are conditionally independent given product identity, we can consistently estimate Fj from
the empirical distribution of bids on that product. This is a high dimensional object, and so
in what follows we will generally use the empirical distribution Fbj,T directly in simulation,
rather than attempting to smooth it using a nonparametric estimation approach.
We get a lot of mileage out of our assumptions, so we briefly note some important caveats.
In assuming that advertisers know their payoffs, we implicitly rule our common values. As
Abraham et al. (2010) note, advertisers can be asymmetrically informed about the user char-
acteristics (e.g. because this user has bought a product from one of the advertisers before),
which can lead to common values. We make the private values assumption for three reasons.
First, we know from our earlier regressions that there is certainly an important private value
component driven by geographic matching. Second, re-targeting was less prevalent in the
advertising industry during the time period of our auctions; and as a result advertisers may
have been less worried about adverse selection, implying minimal bid shading. Finally, from
a practical perspective, it immensely simplifies the inference problem.
Another important assumption is that participation costs are zero. In fact advertisers may
find it costly to fully express their preferences, and therefore issue instructions not to bid
on certain less desirable user groups, rather than precisely delineating how much less those

                                                 24
groups are worth. Instead of inferring a valuation of zero from non-participation, we should
infer π(vi,t ) ≤ ci , where π(vi,t ) is the expected payoff from participating in an auction with
valuation vi,t and ci is the cost of participation for bidder i. But the zero cost assumption
may not be too bad. The 5th percentile of bids in our data is equal to 0.013, which is a
tiny bid in the sense that it has almost zero chance of winning and even lower surplus. So
certainly some bidders have participation costs closely approximated by zero, although we
cannot rule out asymmetries in participation costs across large and small bidders.
The last big assumption is that bidders maximize the sum of their payoffs across all im-
pressions, without any budget constraint. We ignore budget constraints partly to avoid the
dynamic complications they create (but see Balseiro, Besbes and Weintraub (2012) for a
simplifying approach), partly because they are unobserved to us in the data, and partly we
are uncomfortable with treating them as fixed in counterfactuals.22


Step 2a: Simulation for Robust Mechanisms: In two of the benchmark mechanisms
— the second-price auction with targeting, and the Myerson mechanism with ironing —
bidding one’s valuation is weakly dominant, regardless of the reserve price or ironing regions.
So for these mechanisms, we can calculate revenue directly by substituting the inferred
valuations in as bids, without taking a stance on the information structure.


Step 2b: Simulation of BIN-TAC: BIN-TAC is harder, as a bidder’s decision to take
the BIN option depends on their beliefs about the distribution of rival valuations, which
in turn depends on the information structure. We consider three possible approaches. The
first is to generalize the incomplete information model from earlier in the paper, moving
from symmetric independent private values to symmetric correlated private values.23 We
continue to focus on equilibria in threshold strategies: there is some v j = v j (p, d, r) for
each product, above which advertisers will take the BIN option, and below which they
will TAC. As before, the threshold bidder is indifferent between BIN and TAC, implying
v j − p = d1 E[v j − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v j , v j ]. Because of the correlated values, we have to condition on
v j itself on the RHS now. To solve this equation for fixed (p, d, r), we estimate the expected
  22
      Budget constraints are not fixed in the long-run: an advertiser who hits their desired ad metrics with
room to spare may decrease their ad budget, while one who underperforms may increase it.
   23
      The correlation structure in the data is extremely complex and we cannot assume affiliation. Symmetry
is almost certainly violated, but without it we would have to calculate a fixed point in advertiser-specific
thresholds, which is computationally infeasible.


                                                    25
TAC payment as a function of the highest bid in the auction. We do this product-by-product,
using a kernel estimate of the conditional expectation. We then solve for the equilibrium
v j (p, d, r) for each set of BIN-randomization parameters (p, d, r), getting an average revenue
estimate as follows:24

                                   1X            X          (2)                 (2)
                                                                                       X           (1)                 (2)
RevenueBIN-TAC (p, d, r) =                               1(bt ≥ v j (p, d, r))bt +              1(bt ≥ v j (p, d, r) > bt )p
                                   T j
                                                t∈J(j)                                 t∈J(j)
                                                                        d
                                                                                                            !
                                       X           (1)
                                                                        X        (j)
                                   +            1(bt < v j (p, d, r))         1(bt ≥ r) max{b(d+1) , r}                 (5)
                                       t∈J(j)                           j=1



We also consider a complete information environment. Here we follow the logic of Edelman,
Ostrovsky and Schwartz (2007), who suggested that since these players compete with high
frequency and can potentially learn each others’ valuations, a complete information model
may better approximate reality than an incomplete information model. Under complete
information, there can be multiple equilibria: a bidder who knows they will lose is indifferent
between BIN and TAC. We refine away this multiplicity by assuming a positive probability
that a bidder will “tremble” and play TAC instead of BIN; then a bidder will take BIN
whenever this yields higher expected surplus than TAC, assuming all other bidders TAC.25
Finally, following the computer science literature, we perform a worst-case analysis. This
is agnostic as to the particular information structure, and assumes that bidders hold the
“worst-case” beliefs for BIN-TAC revenue. Specifically, each bidder believes that all other
bidders will choose to TAC and then bid zero, making TAC relatively attractive. This implies
that incentives to take the BIN option must be provided directly by the design, through the
randomization parameter d and the reserve price r in the TAC auction.


Step 2c: Bundling Simulation: As we do not observe all the user characteristics that
are provided to advertisers, we cannot consider the optimal bundling strategy. But we
can examine bundling by product and user region, where the platform strips away all user
characteristics except for the region, so that advertisers are buying a random impression of
  24
      Under correlation, finding threshold types v j (p, d, r) no longer suffices for equilibrium, and so we addi-
tionally check that types above and below the threshold do not want to deviate (they don’t). In theory there
may be multiple solutions v j (p, d, r) for each product-parameter pair, but in practice we found only one.
   25
      See the online appendix for a discussion. Multiplicity arises also in the generalized second price auction
— see Edelman et al. (2007) and Varian (2007).



                                                            26
a given size on a given website viewed by a user from a particular US state. This is unlikely
to be optimal, but provides a lower bound on the revenues from the bundling strategy.
Our estimate of a bidder’s willingness to pay for this “bundled” impression is their average
bid across all auctions of this product-region combination, taking their implicit bids when
they didn’t participate as equal to zero. In the counterfactual, we assume that the bundled
impressions are sold by second-price auction without reserve, under full participation.26


Step 3: Optimization: The above steps allow us to get an estimate of the revenue
from BIN-TAC and the benchmark mechanisms for various parameter choices. We want
to optimize those parameter choices at a platform-wide level: finding the optimal reserve
for the SPA-T, the optimal BIN-TAC parameters, and the optimal ironing regions (as ex-
plained earlier, we cannot optimize the bundle). For the SPA-T and BIN-TAC, we find
these parameters by maximizing simulated revenue.27 For the Myerson mechanism, we try
two approaches. In one, we assume that only a single ironing region is used, and find it by
numerical optimization.28 The second is to estimate the marginal distribution of valuations
non-parametrically (not conditioning on product), form the virtual valuations and iron. This
may not be optimal given that the estimated valuations are neither symmetric nor indepen-
dent. But in some sense this is the relevant benchmark, since asymmetric reserves or Crémer
and McLean’s (1988) side bets are not really practical. Recently, Papadimitriou and Pier-
rakos’s (2011) showed that computing the optimal ex-post individually rational mechanism
can be computationally intractable. To get standard errors on our revenue and consumer
surplus estimates, we bootstrap the sample of auctions and re-run the simulation procedure,
holding the parameter choices fixed.29


4.3     Results

The results are in Tables 4 and 5. We find that the optimal reserve when running a second
price auction is high: nearly twice as high as the second highest bid. By contrast, BIN-TAC
  26
     The platform could in principle set a reserve to extract all the consumer surplus (since the willingness
to pay of each advertiser for a bundled impression can be calculated here), but this doesn’t seem realistic.
  27
     This raises an over-fitting concern, in that the parameters are optimized for this specific realization of
the data generating process. However given our sample size, the bias this introduces is likely to be small.
  28
     In contrast to our earlier simulations, this 3D optimization problem turns out to be quite hard; different
starting points converge to different local optima.
  29
     We use 100 bootstrap samples (i.e. samples of T impressions drawn randomly with replacement).


                                                      27
always uses relatively low reserves (all well below the average bid), and instead offers a high
buy price (which is close in magnitude to the optimal SPA reserve). To make this buy price
attractive, the platform threatens to randomize between the top three bidders in each auction
(four in the worst-case scenario), which is significant given that there are only six bidders in
an average auction. The numerically optimized version of the Myerson mechanism has an
ironing region that starts at the reserve, which is a little unusual. The ironed mechanism
shown in Figure 4 is quite complex, with many ironing regions (some are barely visible).
Table 5 shows the mechanisms’ performance. The SPA without reserve earns revenue of
0.98 per auction, and leaves substantial consumer surplus — on average 1.97 per auction.30
Adding the large optimal reserve improves revenue slightly (to 1.03 per auction), but hurts
consumer surplus substantially (it falls to 1.47). Using the incomplete information results,
BIN-TAC does better than both of these mechanisms in terms of revenue: it outperforms the
SPA-T with optimal reserve by 4.4%. As the table shows, the results are quite robust to the
information structure assumed. Interestingly, it also does better on consumer surplus than
the SPA-T (an increase of 14.5%). This happens because the optimal SPA-T reserve price is
very high — to extract revenue from the long right tail — and so many impressions are not
sold, resulting in inefficiency and lower total welfare. By contrast, BIN-TAC has the BIN
price to extract this revenue, and so the reserve is much lower, and more impressions are sold.
Even accounting for distortions owing to the TAC auction, this is a welfare improvement.
The results on the Myerson mechanism are intriguing. The ironing approach performs ter-
ribly; it achieves lower revenue than the SPA-T with optimal reserve. This may be because
the noisy data makes it hard to calculate good ironing regions (even though we used sophis-
ticated adaptive bandwidth estimates of the marginal valuation distribution); or because the
correlation structure makes ironing ineffective. Though the numerically optimized Myerson
mechanism does much better, BIN-TAC still beats it.
To investigate why this occurs, we formed a comparison dataset by sampling bids indepen-
dently from the data, holding the distribution of the number of bidders in each auction
constant. This dataset satisfies the SIPV assumptions by construction. When we simulated
revenue on this data set, using parameters optimized for this data, we found that Myerson
achieved higher revenues, consistent with the theory. The main difference between the real
and simulated data lay in the conditional distribution of the second highest bid given the
  30
   The per auction revenue of 0.98 is lower than the average second highest bid of 1.07 in Table 2 because
some auctions in the data have a single bidder, which will realize zero revenue in an SPA without reserve.


                                                   28
highest bid. Whenever the highest bid is above 2.5, the second-highest bid in the real data
is lower than that in the (independently sampled) simulated data, in the sense of first order
stochastic dominance. In simple terms, the bid “gap” is higher than it would be under in-
dependence. As we saw in the simulations with negative correlation, this makes BIN-TAC
more attractive, as BIN-TAC doesn’t rely on competition from other bidders to set prices
— it relies solely on the threat of randomization.
Finally, the bundling strategy underperforms. Revenues are much lower than the SPA-T,
and consumer surplus falls even more dramatically. This is because there is considerable
variation in match surplus across impressions even after conditioning on product and region,
and so bundling along only these two dimensions destroys a lot of surplus.



5    Conclusion and Future Work

Increasingly detailed consumer information makes sophisticated price discrimination possi-
ble. But at fine levels of aggregation, demand may not obey standard regularity conditions.
We have seen evidence of this on Microsoft Advertising Exchange, where there are large
differences between the highest and second highest bid, and irregular valuations.
Motivated by this, we have introduced a new price discrimination mechanism, designed for
revenue maximization in environments with irregular valuations. As we have shown through
both theory and simulations, it has a number of advantages: it is simple to explain, has good
revenue performance in a variety of settings and can closely approximate Myerson’s optimal
mechanism with ironing. When we tested our approach out on the advertising data, we
found that the BIN-TAC mechanism would improve revenues and consumer surplus relative
to the existing mechanism, a second price auction with reserve; and would even beat the
Myerson mechanism on revenues. We conclude that randomization is an important price
discrimination tool in irregular environments.

Proof of Theorem 1

Let a be a binary choice variable equal to 1 if the bidder takes BIN and zero if TAC. Fix a
player i, and fix arbitrary measurable BIN strategies aj (v) for the other players. Let q be the
                                                                   Q     R                    
probability that no other bidder takes the BIN option, equal to j6=i       1(aj (v) = 0)dF (v) .
Let π(a, v) be the expected payoff of action a for type v given that the bidder bids their
                                                                ∂

                                                                   π(1, v)   ≥ q, as a marginal

by q when taking the BIN option. Similarly we have that              ∂
                                                                     ∂v
                                                                        π(0, v)   ≤ dq , as the probability
of winning when taking-a-chance is bounded above by q/d. Then π(a, v) satisfies the strict
single crossing property in (a, v); it follows by Theorem 4 of Milgrom and Shannon (1994),
the best response function must be strictly increasing in v, which in this case implies a
threshold rule. It follows that any symmetric equilibrium must be in symmetric threshold
strategies. So fix an equilibrium of the form in the theorem, and let the payoffs to taking
taking BIN be πB (v) and to TAC be πT (v). They are given by:

                 πB (v) = E 1(v > Y 1 > v)(v − Y 1 ) + E 1(Y 1 < v)(v − p)
                                                                        
                                                          
                                1         ∗     1       ∗
                 πT (v) = E 1(Y < v)1(Y < v) (v − Y )
                                                d

The threshold type v must be indifferent, so

                        πB (v) = E 1(Y 1 < v)(v − p)
                                                    
                                                                                                       (6)

                                              d

Next, we show a v satisfying Eq. (2) exists and is unique. The right hand side of Eq. (2) is
a function of v with first derivative d1 (1 −   ∂
                                                ∂v

p > 0 and globally has slope less than 1, it must cross the 45◦ line exactly once. Thus there
is exactly one solution to the implicit Eq. (2).


Proof of Theorem 2

To prove the first claim, let us fix d and v. For any reserve price r, let p(v, r) denote the
BIN-TAC price for threshold v. By Equation (2) we have

                              p(v, r) =                                                                (7)

Using first order conditions, we consider the effects of the marginal increase in reserve r on
the revenue of BIN-TAC mechanism denoted by RevBIN-TAC . There are three cases:




                                                  33
• The item is allocated via BIN: If there are two bidders above v, then increase of v does
                                                           ∂p(v,r)
  not change the revenue. But the revenue increases by       ∂r
                                                                     if a bidder wins the item
  at the buy-it-now price. This happens with probability nF (v)n−1 (1 − F (v)). Hence
  the marginal increase in revenue from BIN auctions is equal to

                                     ∂p(v, r)
           nF (v)n−1 (1 − F (v)) ×

• The item is allocated via TAC: The revenue of TAC changes only if the price is equal
  to r. In the event of a bidder winning an item at TAC and then paying the reserve
  price r, the revenue increases by the marginal increase of r. Observe that if there
  are k (1 ≤ k ≤ d) bidders with valuation between r and v (and no bids above v),
  then the revenue of the auction is equal to r with probability kd . By this observation,
  the probability that the revenue is equal to r (and hence the marginal increase in the
  revenue) is given by

                    d                                  !

• The item is not allocated: In the event that the bidder chosen by TAC cannot receive
  the item because his valuation was equal to r (before marginal increase) the revenue




                                            34
      decreases by r. In this case, the marginal decrease in the revenue is equal to

Summing up expressions (8), (9), and (10) we have

                                                d                                       !
  ∂RevBIN-TAC(d,p(v,r))                        X   n n−1
                        = (1 − F (r) − rf (r))                (F (v) − F (r))k−1 F (r)n−k
         ∂r                                    k=1
                                                   d   k − 1

                                                                                    1−F (r)
Therefore, the derivative is equal to zero for the solution of r =                   f (r)
                                                                                              denoted by r∗ . By
assumption, ψ(v) single-crosses zero exactly once from below (in the region [ω L , ω H ]), and
so r∗ is unique. Hence, for any v, the optimal reserve is either r∗ , or is one of the boundaries
ω L , ω L , ω H , and ω H . Note that the derivative is positive at ω L . Also, for reserve equal to
ω H , the item never sells. Moreover, observe that the reserve equal to ω L is dominated by
reserve equal to ω H since no low-type bidder would receive the item. Therefore, the optimal
reserve is either equal to r∗ or ω H .
Again, we use first order conditions again to find the optimal choice of v. There are three
effects on the revenue of the mechanisms by marginally increasing v.

   • The highest valuation bidder now declines to take BIN: This reduces revenue by p(v, r)−
      E [Y ∗ |Y 1 < v] =   d−1
                            d
                               E   [v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v], and happens with probability nf (v)F (v)n−1 .

   • The second highest valuation bidder now declines to take BIN: This decreases revenue
      by v − p(v, r) = d1 E [v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v], and happens with probability n(n − 1)f (v)(1 −
      F (v))F (v)n−2 .

   • Only the highest bidder takes BIN, and pays slightly more: With probability n(1 −
      F (v))F (v)n−1 , the highest bidder may have valuation above v and the second highest
                                                         ∂p(v,r)       d−1       1 ∂E[Y ∗ |Y 1 <v]
      below it. In this case revenue increases by          ∂v
                                                                   =    d
                                                                             +   d      ∂v




                                                    35
Therefore, we have:

                                      ∂E[Y ∗ |Y 1 < v]
                           

                                            ∂v


Re-arranging terms, the optimal choice for v is either at the boundaries or is a solution of
the equation below

              ∂E[Y ∗ |Y 1 < v]
                                                                      
                                           (d − 1)f (v) (n − 1)f (v)
                                                                           E v − Y ∗ |Y 1 < v
                                                                                             
         d−1+                  =                       +
                    ∂v                      1 − F (v)      F (v)

Similar to the previous argument, it is easy to see that the only boundary that would be
optimal is ω H .

Summary statistics for the full dataset, which is a 0.1 percent sample of a week’s worth of auction data
sampled within the last two years. An observation is a bid in the top panel; an auction in the middle panel;
and an advertiser in the last panel. Bids have been normalized so that their average is 1, for confidentiality
reasons. The bid correlation is measured by selecting a pair of bids at random in every auction with at least
two bidders, and computing the correlation coefficient.

Results from OLS Regressions. In the first two columns, the dependent variable is a dummy for participation.
The sample used in the regressions consists of all auction-bidder pairs, limited to the 10% of bidders who
participate most often. In the last two columns, the dependent variable is the bid. The sample used in the
regressions only includes bids from the 10% of bidders who bid most often. The independent variable is the
population-weighted fraction of pageviews of the advertiser’s website that come from the region the user is in.
Time-of-day fixed effects refer to a dummy for each quarter of the day, starting at midnight. Product-region
fixed effects are dummies for the page-group advertised on, and the state the user is located in. Standard
errors are robust. Significance levels are denoted by asterisks (* p < 0.1, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01).

Counterfactual simulations of average platform revenues, advertiser surplus and total surplus. Statistics
outside parentheses are averages across impressions; those in parentheses are standard errors computed by
bootstrapping. Eight different simulations are run. The first is a second price auction without reserve,
while the second is a second price auction with optimal (revenue-maximizing) reserve. The third is the
BIN-TAC mechanism, in a symmetric correlated private values model. In the fourth case we re-simulate the
mechanism, assuming complete information. In the worst-case model, bidders assume they will only have to
pay the reserve price in TAC auction, and therefore take the BIN option more rarely. The sixth and seventh
implement the Myerson (1981) mechanism with ironing. The first time we allow only one region of pooled
virtual valuations, found by numerical optimization; the second time we iron the virtual valuations in the
standard way. The eighth is a no-targeting counterfactual where the impressions are bundled according to
the product (i.e. URL and ad size) and user region, and sold by second-price auction. Where applicable,
the parameters used are the optimal parameters from Table 4.
