Reconciling Hayek's and Keynes Views of Recessions

                                             ABSTRACT

Recessions often happen after periods of rapid accumulation of houses, consumer durables and business
capital. This observation has led some economists, most notably Friedrich Hayek, to conclude that
recessions mainly reflect periods of needed liquidation resulting from past over-investment. According
to the main proponents of this view, government spending should not be used to mitigate such a liquidation
process, as doing so would simply result in a needed adjustment being postponed. In contrast, ever
since the work of Keynes, many economists have viewed recessions as periods of deficient demand
that should be countered by activist fiscal policy. In this paper we reexamine the liquidation perspective
of recessions in a setup where prices are flexible but where not all trades are coordinated by centralized
markets. We show why and how liquidations can produce periods where the economy functions particularly
inefficiently, with many socially desirable trades between individuals remaining unexploited when
the economy inherits too many capital goods. In this sense, our model illustrates how liquidations
can cause recessions characterized by deficient aggregate demand and accordingly suggests that Keynes'
and Hayek's views of recessions may be much more closely linked than previously recognized. In
our framework, interventions aimed at stimulating aggregate demand face the trade-off emphasized
by Hayek whereby current stimulus mainly postpones the adjustment process and therefore prolongs
the recessions. However, when examining this trade-off, we find that some stimulative policies may
nevertheless remain desirable even if they postpone a recovery.

1       Introduction
There remains considerable debate regarding the causes and consequences of recessions.
Two views that are often presented as opposing, and which created controversy in the recent
recession and its aftermath, are those associated with the ideas of Hayek and Keynes.1 The
Hayekian perspective is generally associated with viewing recessions as a necessary evil.
According to this view, recessions mainly reflect periods of liquidation resulting from past
over-accumulation of capital goods. A situation where the economy needs to liquidate such
an excess can quite naturally give rise to a recession, but government spending aimed at
stimulating activity, it is argued, is not warranted since it would mainly delay the needed
adjustment process and thereby postpone the recovery. In contrast, the Keynesian view
suggests that recessions reflect periods of deficient aggregate demand where the economy is
not effectively exploiting the gains from trade between individuals. According to this view,
policy interventions aimed at increasing investment and consumption are generally desirable,
as they favor the resumption of mutually beneficial trade between individuals.2
    In this paper we reexamine the liquidationist perspective of recessions in an environment
with decentralized markets, flexible prices and search frictions. In particular, we examine
how the economy adjusts when it inherits from the past an excessive amount of capital
goods, which could be in the form of houses, durable goods or productive capital. Our goal
is not to focus on why the economy may have over-accumulated in the past,3 but to ask
how it reacts to such an over-accumulation once it is realized. As suggested by Hayek, such
a situation can readily lead to a recession as less economic activity is generally warranted
when agents want to deplete past over-accumulation. However, because of the endogenous
emergence of unemployment risk in our set-up, the size and duration of the recession implied
by the need for liquidation is not socially optimal. In effect, the reduced gains from trade
induced by the need for liquidation creates a multiplier process that leads to an excessive
reduction in activity. Although prices are free to adjust, the liquidation creates a period
of deficient aggregate demand where economic activity is too low because people spend too
cautiously due to increased unemployment risk. In this sense, we argue that liquidation and
deficient aggregate demand should not be viewed as alternative theories of recessions but
instead should be seen as complements, where past over-accumulation may be a key driver
of periods of deficient aggregate demand. This perspective also makes salient the trade-offs
faced by policy. In particular, a policy-maker in our environment faces an unpleasant trade-
off between the prescriptions emphasized by Keynes and Hayek. On the one hand, a policy-
maker would want to stimulate economic activity during a liquidation-induced recession
because precautionary savings is excessively high. On the other hand, the policy-maker also
    1
     In response to the large recession in the US and abroad in 2008-2009, a high-profile debate around
these two views was organized by Reuters. See http://www.reuters.com/subjects/keynes-hayek. See
also Wapshott [2012] for a popular account of the Hayek-Keynes controversy.

     See Caballero and Hammour [2004] for an alternative view on the inefficiency of liquidations, based on
the reduction of cumulative reallocation and inefficient restructuring in recessions.
   3
     There are several reason why an economy may over-accumulate capital. For example, agents may
have had overly optimistic expectations about future expected economic growth that did not materialize,
as in Beaudry and Portier [2004], or it could have been the case that credit supply was unduly subsidized
either through explicit policy, as argued in Mian and Sufi [2010] and Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi [2010], or as a
by-product of monetary policy, as studied by Bordo and Landon-Lane [2013].

needs to recognize that intervention will likely postpone recovery, since it slows down the
needed depletion of excess capital. The model offers a simple framework where both of these
forces are present and can be compared.
    On a more general note, one of the contributions of this paper is to show why an economy
can function quite efficiently in growth periods when it is far from its steady state, while
simultaneously functioning particularly inefficiently when it is going through a liquidation
phase near its steady state. When the economy is far from its steady-state level of capital,
demand for capital is very strong and unemployment risk is therefore minimal. In contrast,
when there is excessive capital, we show that reduced labor demand shows up at least in part
as increased unemployment even if workers and firms bargain pair-wise efficiently on wages
and hours-worked. The increased unemployment risk then causes households to increase
precautionary savings, which in turn amplifies the initial fall in output and employment. The
result is an over-reaction to the initial impetus induced by a need to liquidate capital.4 As
a presentation device, we show how this process can be represented on a diagram somewhat
similar to a Keynesian cross, but where the micro-foundation and many comparative statics
differ substantially from the sticky-price interpretation commonly used to discuss multipliers.
Moreover, by clarifying why this process does not depend on sticky prices, our analysis
suggest that monetary policy may be of limited help in addressing the difficulties associated
with a period of liquidation.
    One potential criticism of a pure liquidationist view of recessions is that, if markets
functioned efficiently, such periods should not be socially painful. In particular, if economic
agents interact in perfect markets and realize they have over-accumulated in the past, this
should lead them to enjoy a type of holiday paid for by their past excessive work. Looking
backwards in such a situation, agents may resent the whole episode, but looking forward after
a period of over-accumulation, they should nonetheless feel content to enjoy the proceeds
of the pass excessive work, even if it is associated with a recession. In contrast, in our
environment we will show that liquidation periods are generally socially painful because of
the multiplier process induced by precautionary savings and unemployment risk. In effect,
we will show that everyone in our model economy can be worse off when they inherit too
many capital goods from the past. This type of effect, whereby abundance creates scarcity,
may appear quite counter-intuitive at first pass. To make as clear as possible the mechanism
that can cause welfare to be reduced by such abundance, much of our analysis will focus on
the case where the inherited capital takes the form of a good that directly contributes to
utility, such as houses or durable goods. In this situation we will show why inheriting more
houses or durables can make everyone worse off. However, as we shall show, this result is a
local result that is most likely to be present around an economy’s steady state. In contrast, if
we were to destroy all capital goods in our model economy, this would always reduce welfare,
as the direct effects on utility would out-weight the inefficiencies induced by unemployment
risk. Accordingly, our model has the characteristic that behavior can be quite different when
it inherits a large or small amount of capital from the past.
   4
     It is now common in the macroeconomic literature to summarize the functioning of model by indicating
where and how they create distortions or wedges, as exemplified by Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan [2007].
Accordingly, one way to view the working of our model economy is as generating an endogenous labor market
wedge driven by unemployment risk, where the size of the wedge reacts to the extent to which inherited
capital is above or below the steady state.


                                                   2
    The structure of our model builds on the literature related to search models of decen-
tralized trading. In particular, we share with Lucas [1990] and Shi [1998] a model in which
households are composed of agents that act in different markets without full coordination.
Moreover, as in Lagos and Wright [2005] and Rocheteau and Wright [2005], we exploit al-
ternating decentralized and centralized markets to allow for a simple characterization of the
equilibrium. However, unlike those papers, we do not have money in our setup. The paper
also shares key features with the long tradition of macro models emphasizing strategic com-
plementarities, aggregate demand externalities and multipliers, such as Diamond [1982] and
Cooper and John [1988], but we do not emphasize multiple equilibrium. Instead we focus on
situations where the equilibrium remains unique, which allows standard comparative statics
exercises to be conducted without needing to worry about equilibrium-selection issues. The
multiplier process derived in the paper therefore shares similarities with that found in the
recent literature with strategic complementarities such as Angeletos and La’O [2013], in the
sense that it amplifies demand shocks. However, the underlying mechanism in this paper
is very different, operating through unemployment risk rather than through direct demand
complementarities as in Angeletos and La’O [2013].
    Unemployment risk and its effects on consumption decisions is at the core of our model.
The empirical relevance of precautionary saving related to unemployment risk has been
documented by many, starting with Carroll [1992]. For example, Carroll and Dunn [1997]
have shown that expectations of unemployment are robustly and negatively correlated with
every measure of consumer expenditure (non-durable goods, durable goods and home sales).
Carroll, Sommer, and Slacalek [2012] confirm this finding and show why business cycle
fluctuations may be driven to a large extent by changes in unemployment uncertainty. Alan,
Crossley, and Low [2012] use U.K. micro data to show that increases in saving rates in
recessions appear largely driven by uncertainty related to unemployment.5 There are also
recent theoretical papers that emphasized how unemployment risk and precautionary savings
can amplify shocks and cause business cycle fluctuations. These papers are the closest to our
work. In particular, our model structure is closely related to that presented in Guerrieri and
Lorenzoni [2009]. However, their model emphasizes why the economy may exhibit excessive
responses to productivity shocks, while our framework offers a mechanism that amplifies
demand-type shocks. Our paper also shares many features with Heathcote and Perri [2012],
who develop a model in which unemployment risk and wealth impact consumption decisions
and precautionary savings. Wealth matters in their setup because of financial frictions that
make credit more expensive for wealth-poor agents. They obtain a strong form of demand
externality that gives rise to multiple equilibria and, accordingly, they emphasize self-fulfilling
cycles as the important source of fluctuations. 6 Finally, the work by Ravn and Sterk [2012]
emphasizes as we do how unemployment risk and precautionary savings can amplify demand
shocks, but their mechanism differs substantially from ours since it relies on sticky nominal
   5
     Using these empirical insights, Challe and Ragot [2013] have recently proposed a tractable quantitative
model in which uninsurable unemployment risk is the source of wealth heterogeneity.
   6
     The existence of aggregate demand externalities and self-fulfilling expectations is also present in the
work of Farmer [2010] and in the work of Chamley [2014]. In a model with search in both labor and goods
markets, Kaplan and Menzio [2013] also obtain multiple equilibria, as employed workers have more income
to spend and less time to shop for low prices. As already underlined, and contrarily to those studies, our
analysis is restricted to configurations in which the equilibrium is unique.

prices.
    While the main mechanism in our model has many precursors in the literature, we believe
that our setup illustrates most clearly (i) how unemployment risk gives rise to a multiplier
process for demand shocks even in the absence of price stickiness or increasing returns, (ii)
how this multiplier process can be ignited by periods of liquidation, and (iii) how fiscal
policy can and cannot be used to counter the process.
    The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows. In Section 2, we present
a few motivating facts regarding the liquidationist view of recessions. In particular, we
document that deeper recessions are highly correlated with preceding periods of very strong
investment, and that this is true whether we focus on housing, durable goods or productive
capital. In Section 3, we present a static model where agents inherit from the past different
levels of capital goods, and we describe how and why high values of inherited capital can
lead to poor economic outcomes. The static setup allows for a clear exposition of the nature
of the demand externality that arises in our setting with decentralized trade. We focus on
the case where the inherited capital is in the form of a good which directly increases utility
so as to make clear how more goods can reduce welfare. In Section 4, we discuss a set of
extensions, including a discussion of the case where the inherited capital takes the form of a
productive good. In Section 5, we extend the model to an infinite-period dynamic setting.
We take particular care in contrasting the behavior of the economy when it is close to and far
from its steady state. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss the trade-offs faced by a policy-maker
when inheriting an excessive amount of capital from the past, while Section 7 concludes.


2      Some motivating facts
The liquidationist view of recessions suggests that the severity and depth of a recession should
reflect the extent to which an economy was in a situation of over-accumulated capital prior
to the downturn. If the economy had gone through a period of substantial over-accumulation
in prior years, then, according to the liquidationist view, the subsequent recession should
be particularly deep and prolonged, as there would be a need to deplete a large amount of
capital. In this short section, we want to present some suggestive evidence in support of
this idea. To this end, in Figure 1 we present scatter plots of the relationships between the
depth of post-War US recessions and a measure of prior over-investment, and between the
length of recoveries with that same measure of over-investment. The depth of a recession
is defined as the percentage change in GDP from the peak to the trough of the recession;
the length of recovery is the time it takes for GDP to again attain its pre-recession peak.
Details about the data and the construction of our measures are presented in Appendix A.
For our measure of capital over-accumulation, we report results for three measures: one for
productive capital, one for housing capital, and one for durable goods. For each case, we
first constructed a measure of capital by cumulating past investment using the perpetual-
inventory method over a rolling period of 10 years. Then, under the assumption that the
economy’s needed level of capital grows with TFP (and population) along a balanced growth
path, we deflated the capital stock by John Fernald’s measure of TFP to obtain a raw measure
of over-accumulation. Finally, we compute the deviation of this series from the trend at the

Note: Horizontal axis is capital “over-accumulation”, defined as cumulated investment over past 10 years,
divided by TFP and detrended using a cubic trend. Vertical axis is either depth of recession, measured as
percentage difference in real GDP from peak to subsequent trough, or length of recovery, measured as the
number of quarters it takes for real GDP to reach again the peak level.

outset of each recession.7 Plots of the data are presented in Figure 1.
    As can be seen in Figure 1, there is a very strong positive correlation between our measure
of capital over-accumulation prior to a recession and either our measure of the subsequent
severity of the recession or our measure of the length of the recovery. While this evidence is
at best only suggestive, it does support the notion that severe recessions have generally been
preceded by periods of very high investment relative to TFP growth. An interesting aspect of
Figure 1 is that we see that severe recessions were generally preceded by high accumulation
of all three classes of capital: housing, durables, and physical capital. This pattern would be
consistent, for example, with over-accumulation caused by periods of excessively lax credit.
For comparison, we also conducted the identical exercise using simulated data from an RBC
model driven by random walk technology shocks. Using the model, we generated 10,000
series of the same length as our data set (after dropping an initial 100 quarters from each
simulation). The average correlation from the simulated data between measured capital
over-accumulation at the peak of a cycle 8 and the subsequent decline was found to be -.01
with a standard error of .3. Similarly, the average correlation between the over-accumulation
measure and the length of the recovery was -.07 with a standard error of .35. We interpret
this finding as indicating that the observations shown in Figure 1 are unlikely to have been
generated from an economy that functions along the lines of an RBC model. Moreover, this
exercise clearly illustrates that the positive correlation shown in Figure 1 is not an mechanical
artifact of the way we construct the data.


3       Static model
In this section, we present a very stripped-down static model in order to illustrate why an
economy may function particularly inefficiently when it inherits a large stock of capital from
the past. In particular, we will want to make clear why agents in an economy can be worse
off when inherited capital goods are too high. For the mechanism to be as transparent as
possible, we focus mainly on the case where the inherited capital produces services which
directly enter agents’ utility functions. Accordingly, this type of capital can be considered
as representing houses or other durable consumer goods. In a later section, we will discuss
how the analysis carries over to the case of productive capital.
    In our model, trades are decentralized, and there are two imperfections which cause
unemployment risk to emerge and generate precautionary savings behavior. First, there will
be a matching friction in the spirit of Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides, which will create the
possibility that a household may not find employment when looking for a job. Second, there
will be adverse selection in the insurance market that will limit the pooling of this risk. Since
the adverse selection problem can be analyzed separately, we will begin the presentation by
simply assuming that unemployment insurance is not available. Later we will introduce the

      We removed a trend from our series since there were evident low-frequency movements in all three of
our series. In Figure 1, we use a cubic polynomial to calculate the trend. Results are robust to using different
trend-removal methods, including an HP filter. However, we believe using a low-order polynomial trend is
more conservative, since it is not much affected by recessions, and therefore less likely to generate a spurious
relationship.

adverse selection problem which rationalizes this missing market, and show that all main
results are maintained. The key exogenous variable in the static model will be a stock of
consumer durables that households inherit from the past. Our goal is to show why and
when high values of this stock can cause the economy to function inefficiently and possibly
even cause a decrease in welfare. We will also explore the role of governement spending in
affecting economic activity in our setup.

3.1     Setup
Consider an environment populated by a mass L of households indexed by j. In this economy
there are two sub-periods. In the first sub-period, households buy good 1, which we will call
clothes, and try to find employment in the clothing sector. We refer to this good as clothes
since in the dynamic version of the model it will represent a partially durable good. The
good produced in the second sub-period, good 2, will be referred to as household services
since it will have no durability. As there is no money in this economy, when the household
buys clothes its bank account is debited, and when (and if) it receives employment income
its bank account is credited. Then, in the second sub-period, households balance their books
by repaying any outstanding debts or receiving a payment for any surplus. These payments
are made in terms of good 2, which is also the numeraire in this economy.9
    Preferences for the first sub-period are represented by
                                              U (cj ) − ν(`j )
where c represents consumption of clothes and ` is the labor supplied by households in
the production of clothes. The function U (·) is assumed to be increasing in c and strictly
concave with limc→∞ U 0 ≤ 0 and U 000 > 0. The dis-utility of work function ν(·) is assumed to
be increasing and convex in `, with ν(0) = 0. The agents are initially endowed with Xj units
of clothes, which they can either consume or trade. We assume symmetric endowments,
so that Xj = X ∀j.10 In the dynamic version of the model, X will represent the stock of
durable goods and will be endogenous.
    Trade in clothing will be subject to a coordination problem because of frictions in the
labor market. At the beginning of the first sub-period, the household splits up responsibilities
between two members. The first member, called the buyer, goes to the clothes market to
make purchases. The second member searches for employment opportunities in the labor
market. The market for clothes functions in a Walrasian fashion, with both buyers and
firms that sell clothes taking prices as given. The market for labor in this first sub-period is
subject to a matching friction, with sellers of labor searching for employers and employers
searching for labor. The important information assumption is that buyers do not know,
when choosing their consumption of clothes, whether the worker member of the household
has secured a match. This assumption implies that buyers will worry about unemployment
risk when making purchases of clothes.
    There is a large set of potential clothes firms in the economy who can decide to search
for workers in view of supplying clothes to the market. Each firm can hire one worker and
   9
      We remain agnostic about the precise details of how good 2 is produced for the time being. One possible
interpretation is discussed in the following sub-section.
  10
     In what follows, we will drop the j index except where doing so may cause confusion.


                                                     7
has access to a decreasing-returns-to-scale production function θF (`), where ` is the number
of hours worked for the firm and θ > 0 is a technology shift factor. Production also requires
a fixed cost θΦ in terms of the output good, so that the net production of a firm hiring `
hours of labor is θ [F (`) − Φ]. For now, we will normalize θ to 1, and will reintroduce θ in its
general form when we want to talk about the effects of technological change and balanced
growth. We will also assume throughout that Ω(`) ≡ F 0 (`)` is increasing in `.11 Moreover,
we will assume that F (`) − F 0 (`)` is strictly increasing in `, with Φ sufficiently small such
that there exists an `? > 0 satisfying F (`? ) − F 0 (`? ) `? = Φ. These restrictions on the
production technology are always satisfied if, for example, F (`) = `α , with 0 < α < 1.
    Firms search for workers and, upon finding a worker, they jointly decide on the number
of hours worked and on the wage to be paid. The fixed cost Φ is paid before firms can look
for workers. Upon a match, the determination of the wage and hours-worked within a firm
is done efficiently though a competitive bargaining process. In effect, upon a match, one
can view a Walrasian auctioneer as calling out a wage w that equilibrates the demand for
and supply of labor among the two parties in the match. Assuming such a process for wage
and employment determination has the feature of limiting distortions that could muddle the
understanding of the main mechanisms of the model. However, the main results of the paper
are robust to alternative bargaining protocols.12 Given a wage, the demand for labor from
the firm is described by the marginal productivity condition
                                                 pF 0 (`) = w
where p is the relative price of clothes in terms of the non-durable good produced in the
second sub-period.13 The supply of labor is chosen optimally by the worker in a manner to
be derived shortly.
   Letting N represent the number of firms who decide to search for workers, the number
of matches is then given by the constant-returns-to-scale matching function M (N, L), with
M (N, L) ≤ min{N, L}. The equilibrium condition for the clothes market is given by
                                   L · (c − X) = M (N, L)F (`) − N Φ
where the left-hand side is total purchases of new clothes and the right-hand side is the total
available supply after subtracting search costs.
   Firms will enter the market up to the point where expected profits are zero. The zero-
profit condition can be written as14
                         M                  M
                            [pF (`) − w`] =   [pF (`) − pF 0 (`)`] = pΦ
                          N                 N
    At the end of the first sub-period, household j’s net asset position aj , expressed in units
of good 2, is given by w`j − p(cj − X). We model the second sub-period so that it is costly
  11
      Because we assume free-entry for clothes firms, the quantity θΩ(`) will equal net output of clothes (after
subtracting firms’ fixed costs) by a single employed worker. The assumption that this quantity is increasing
in ` is satisfied, for example, if F is a CES combination of labor and some other input in fixed supply, with an
elasticity of substitution between these inputs of at least 1, which nests the case where F is Cobb-Douglas.
  12
      See Appendix C.
  13
      As will become clear, p can be given an interpretation as an interest rate.
  14
      We assume that searching firms pool their ex-post profits and losses so that they make exactly zero
profits in equilibrium, regardless of whether they match.


                                                       8
to arrive in that sub-period with debt. For now, we can simply denote the value of entering
the second sub-period with assets aj by V (aj ), where we assume that V (·) is increasing, with
V 0 (a1 ) > V 0 (a2 ) whenever a1 < 0 < a2 ; that is, we are assuming that the marginal value of a
unit of assets is greater if one is in debt than if one is in a creditor position. In the following
sub-section we specify preferences and a market structure for the second sub-period that
rationalizes this V (·) function.
     Taking the function V (a) as given, we can specify the household’s consumption decision
as well as his labor-supply decision conditional on a match. The buyer’s problem in household
j is given by
                max U (cj ) + µV (w`j − p (cj − X)) + (1 − µ)V (−p (cj − X))
                 cj

where µ is the probability that a worker finds a job and is given by µ ≡ M (N, L)/L.
From this expression, we can see that the consumption decision is made in the presence of
unemployment risk.
    The worker’s problem in household j when matched, taking w as given, can be expressed
as choosing a level of hours to supply in the first sub-period so as to solve
                              max −ν(`j ) + V (w`j − p (cj − X))
                                `j


3.2     Deriving the value function V (a)
V (a) represents the value function associated with entering the second sub-period with a net
asset position a. In this subsection, we derive such a value function by specifying primitives
in terms of preferences, technology and market organization. We choose to model this sub-
period in such a way that if there were no friction in the first sub-period, there would be
no trade between agents in the second sub-period. For this reason let us call “services” the
good produced in the second period household, with preferences given by
                                           U  c) − νe(`)
                                           e (e       e

where ec is consumption of these services, U
                                           e (·) is increasing and strictly concave in e
                                                                                       c, `e is the
labor used to produced household services, and νe(·) is increasing and convex in `.  e
    To ensure that a unit of net assets is more valuable when in debt than when in surplus,
let us assume that households in the second sub-period can produce services for their own
consumption, using one unit of labor to produce θe unit of services. However, if a household
in the second sub-period has to produce market services – that is, services that can be sold
to others in order to satisfy debt – then to produce θe units of market services requires them
to supply 1 + τ units of labor, τ > 0. To simplify notation, we can set θe = 1 for now and
return to the more general formulation when talking about effects of technological change.
The continuation value function V (a) can accordingly be defined as

                                     V (a) = max U  e − νe(`)
                                                 e (c)     e
                                              c,`e
                                              e

subject to
                                        c = `e + a if a ≥ 0
                                        e

                                                     9
and
                                         c = `e + a(1 + τ ) if a < 0
                                         e
     It is easy to verify that V (a) is increasing in assets and concave. If νe(`)
                                                                                 e is strictly convex,
then V (a) will be strictly concave, regardless of the value of τ , with the key property that
V 0 (a1 ) > V 0 (a2 ) if a1 < 0 < a2 ; that is, the marginal value of an increase in assets is greater
if one is in debt than if one is in surplus.15 In the case where νe(`) is linear, then V (a) will
be piecewise linear and will not be differentiable at zero. Nonetheless, it will maintain the
key property that V 0 (a1 ) > V 0 (a2 ) if a1 < 0 < a2 . We will mainly work with this case, and
in particular, will assume that νe(`)    e = v · `,
                                                  e which implies that V (a) is piecewise linear with
a kink at zero.

3.3       Equilibrium in the first sub-period
Given the function V (a), a symmetric equilibrium for the first sub-period is represented by
five objects: two relative prices (the price of clothing p and the wage rate w), two quantities
(consumption of clothes by each household c and the amount worked in each match `), and
a number N of active firms, such that

   1. c solves the buyer’s problem taking µ, p, w and ` as given.

   2. The labor supply ` solves the worker’s problem conditional on a match, taking p, w
      and c as given.

   3. The demand for labor ` maximizes the firm’s profits given a match, taking p and w as
      given.

   4. The goods market clears; that is, L · (c − X) = M (N, L)F (`) − N Φ .

   5. Firms’ entry decisions ensure zero profits.

   The equilibrium in the first sub-period can therefore be represented by the following
system of five equations:

       To avoid backward-bending supply curves, we will also assume that νe(·) and U
0. This assumption is sufficient but not necessary for later results. Note that a sufficient condition for
V 000 (a) ≥ 0 is that both U
                           e 000 (·) ≥ 0 and νe000 (·) < 0.


                                                       10
In the above system,16 equations (1) and (2) represent the first-order conditions for the
household’s choice of consumption and supply of labor. Equations (3) and (5) represent
a firm’s labor demand condition and its entry decision. Finally, (4) is the goods market
clearing condition.
    At this level of generality it is difficult to derive many results. Nonetheless, we can com-
bine (1), (2) and (3) to obtain the following important expression regarding a characteristic
of the equilibrium,
                     ν 0 (`)                  V 0 (−p (c − X))
                                                                  
                        0
                              1 + (1 − µ)     0
                                                                −1      = F 0 (`)             (6)
                    U (c)                   V (w` − p (c − X))
From equation (6), we see that as long as µ < 1, the marginal rate of substitution between
leisure and consumption will not be equal to the marginal productivity of work; that is, the
labor market will exhibit a wedge given by
                                         V 0 (−p (c − X))
                                                             
                             (1 − µ)                        −1
                                       V 0 (w` − p (c − X))
In fact, in this environment, the possibility of being unemployed leads to precautionary sav-
ings, which in turn causes the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and consumption
to be low relative to the marginal productivity of labor. As we will see, changes in X will
cause this wedge to vary, which will cause a feedback effect on economic activity. Obviously,
in this environment there would be a desire for agents to share the risk of being unemployed,
which could reduce or even eliminate the wedge. As noted earlier, the reason that this type
of insurance may be limited is the presence of adverse selection, an issue to which we will
return.
    Our main goal now is to explore the effects of changes in X on equilibrium outcomes.
In particular, we are interested in clarifying why and when an increase in X can actually
lead to a reduction in consumption and/or welfare. The reason we are interested in this
comparative static is that we are interested in knowing why periods of liquidations – that
is, periods where agents inherit excessive levels of durable goods from the past – may be
socially painful.
    To clarify the analysis, we will make two simplifying assumptions. First, we will assume
that the matching function takes the form M (N, L) = min{N, L}; that is, matches are
determined by the short side of the market. This assumption creates a clear and useful
dichotomy, with the economy characterized as being either in an unemployment regime if
L > N or in a full-employment regime if N > L. We will also assume that V (a) is piece-wise
linear, with V 0 (a) = v · a if a ≥ 0 and V 0 (a) = v · a · (1 + τ ) if a < 0, with τ > 0 and v > 0.
This form of the V (·) function corresponds to the case discussed in subsection 3.2 where the
dis-utility of work in the second sub-period is linear. The important element here is τ . In
effect, 1 + τ represents the ratio of the marginal value of an extra unit of assets when one
is in debt relative to its value when one is in surplus. A value of τ > 0 can be justified in
many ways, one of which is presented in subsection 3.2. Alternatively, τ > 0 could reflect a
financial friction related to the cost of borrowing versus savings.
  16
     To ensure that an employed worker’s optimal choice of labor is strictly positive, we assume that

    Under these two functional-form assumptions, the equilibrium conditions can be reduced
to the following:

This system of equations now has the feature of being block-recursive. Equations (7), (8) and
(9) can be solved for c, ` and N , with equations (10) and (11) then providing the wage and the
price. From equations (7) and (8), one can immediately notice the complementarity that can
arise between consumption and employment in the case where N < L (the unemployment
regime). From (7) we see that, if N < L, agents will tend to increase their consumption
if they believe there are many firms looking for workers (N expected to be large). Then
from equation (8) we see that more firms will be looking to hire workers if they believe
that consumption will be high. So greater consumption favors greater employment, which
in turn reinforces consumption. This feedback effect arises as the result of consumption and
employment playing the role of strategic complements. Workers demand higher consumption
when they believe that many firms are searching to hire, as they view a high N as reducing
their probability of entering the second sub-period in debt. It is important to notice that this
multiplier argument is implicitly taking `, the number of hours worked by agents, as given.
But, in the case where the economy is characterized by unemployment, this is precisely
the right equilibrium conjecture. In particular, from (9) we can see that if the economy
is in a state of unemployment, then ` is simply given by `? , the solution to the equation
F (`? ) − F 0 (`? )`? = Φ, and is therefore locally independent of X or c. Hence, in the presence
of unemployment, consumption and firm hiring will act as strategic complements. As is
common in the case of strategic complements, multiple equilibria can arise. This possibility
is stated in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. There exists a τ̄ > 017 such that (a) if τ < τ̄ , then there exists a unique
equilibrium for any value of X; and (b) if τ > τ̄ , then there exists a range of X for which
there are multiple equilibria.

      The proofs of all propositions are presented in Appendix B.

   While situations with multiple equilibria may be interesting, in this paper we will mainly
focus on the case where the equilibrium is unique, as we believe this is more likely to be

the empirically relevant case. Accordingly, Proposition 1 tells us that our setup will have a
unique equilibrium if the marginal cost of debt is not too large. For the remainder of this
section, we will assume that τ < τ̄ . Proposition 2 focuses on this case and provides a first
step in the characterization of the equilibrium.

Proposition 2. When τ < τ̄ , there exists an X ? such that if X ≤ X ? then the equilibrium
is characterized by full employment, while if X > X ? it is characterized by unemployment.
Furthermore, there exists an X ?? > X ? such that if X > X ?? , then employment is zero and
agents simply consume their endowment (i.e., c = X).18

    The content of Proposition 2 is very intuitive as it simply states that if agents have a low
endowment of the consumption good, then there are substantial gains from trade, and that
will favor full employment. In contrast, if the endowment is very high, this will reduce the
demand for the good sufficiently as to create unemployment. Finally, if X is extremely high,
all trade among agents will stop as people are content to simply consume their endowment.
    Proposition 2 can also be used to provide insight regarding the relationship between the
labor wedgeh in this economy i 0 and the inherited endowment of X, where the labor wedge is

As can be seen, for X < X ? ,19 the labor wedge is zero, while for X ∈ [X ? , X ?? ], the labor

wedge rises monotonically, reaching a peak at the point X ?? where trade collapses. Then,
for X > X ?? , we enter the no-employment zone and the wedge declines gradually until it
reaches zero anew at a point where the no-employment outcome is socially optimal. This
figure nicely illustrates that the degree of distortion in this economy varies with X, with low
values of X being associated with a more efficient economy, while higher values of X generate
a positive and growing wedge as long as trade remains present. From this observation, we can
see how a higher inherited capital stock can increase inefficiency. Proposition 3 complements
Proposition 2 by indicating how consumption is determined in each regime.

Proposition 3. When the economy exhibits unemployment (X ?? > X > X ? ), the level of
consumption is given as the unique solution to
                                    0 ?                    

                                    F 0 (`? )        F (` )`

When the economy exhibits full employment (X ≤ X ? ), consumption is the unique solution
to                                      0 −1             

                                        F 0 (Ω−1 (c − X))
Finally, when X ≥ X ?? , consumption is given by c = X.

    Given the above propositions, we are now in a position to examine an issue of main
interest, which is how an increase in X affects consumption. In particular, we want to ask
whether an increase in X, which acts as an increase in the supply of goods, can lead to a
decrease in the actual consumption of goods. Proposition 4 addresses this issue.

Proposition 4. If X ?? > X > X ? , then c is decreasing in X. If X ≤ X ? or X > X ?? , then
c is increasing in X .

    The content of Proposition 4 is illustrated in Figure 3. Proposition 4 indicates that,
starting at X = 0, consumption will continuously increase in X as long as X is compatible
with full employment. Then, when X is greater than X ? , the economy enters the unem-
ployment regime and consumption starts to decrease as X is increased. Finally, beyond X ??
trade collapses and consumption becomes equal to X and hence it increases with X. The
reason that consumption decreases with a higher supply of X in the unemployment region
is precisely because of the multiplier process described earlier. In this region, an increase
in X leads to a fall in expenditures on new consumption, where we define expenditures as
e ≡ c − X. The decrease in expenditures reduces the demand for goods as perceived by
firms. Less firms then search for workers, which increases the risk of unemployment. The
increase in unemployment risk leads households to cut their expenditures further, which fur-
ther amplifies the initial effect of an increase in X on expenditures. It is because of this type
of multiplier process that an increase in the supply of the good can lead to a decrease in its
total consumption (X + e). Note that such a negative effect does not happen when the econ-
omy is at full employment, as an increase in X does not cause an increase in precautionary
savings, which is the key mechanism at play causing consumption to fall.

    The link noted above between household j’s expenditure, which we can denote by ej ≡
cj − Xj , and its expectation about the expenditures by other agents in the economy, which
can denote by e, can be captured by rewriting the relations determining ej implied by the
elements of Proposition 3 as

Here, e? ≡ Ω(`? ) is the level of output (net of firms’ search costs) that would be produced if
all workers were employed, with hours per employed worker equal to `? . In equilibrium we
have the additional requirement that ej = e when Xj = X for all j.
    The equilibrium determination of e is illustrated in Figure 4, which somewhat resembles
a Keynesian cross. In the figure, we plot the function ej = Z(e) − X for two values of X: a
first value of X which places the economy in an unemployment regime, and a second value
of X which places the economy in a full-employment regime. An equilibrium in this figure
corresponds to the point where the function ej = Z(e) − X crosses the 45◦ line. Note that
changes in X simply move the ej = Z(e) − X curve vertically.
    There are several features to note about Figure 4. First, in the case where X ∈ (X ? , X ?? ),
so that the equilibrium of the economy is in an unemployment regime with positive trade
(i.e., 0 < e < e? ), the diagram is similar to a Keynesian cross. We can see graphically

how an increase in X by one unit shifts down the Z(e) − X curve and, since the slope of
Z(e) − X is positive and less than one, a multiplier process kicks in which causes e to fall
by more than one. Because of this multiplier process, total consumption of clothes, which
is equal to e + X, decreases, which is the essence of the first part of Proposition 4. Second,
when X < X ? , so that the economy is in a full-employment regime (i.e., the equilibrium
is such that e > e? ), the diagram is different from the Keynesian cross. The most notable
difference is the negative slope of the function Z(e) − X for values of e > e? . This reflects
the fact that unemployment risk is not present in this regime. In fact, when X is sufficiently
small so that the economy is in the full-employment regime, an increase in X by one unit
leads to a decrease in e that is less than one, compared to a decrease of greater than one as
exhibited in the unemployment regime. Here, expenditure by others actually plays the role
of a strategic substitute with one’s own expenditure – as opposed to playing the role of a
strategic complement as is the case in the unemployment regime – through its effects on real
wages and prices. Accordingly, in this region, an increase in X leads to an increase in total
consumption of clothes. Another more subtle difference with the Keynesian         0 ?
                                                                                     cross is in how
the intercept of Z(e) − X is determined. The intercept is given by U 0−1 ( Fν 0(`(`?)) (1 + τ )) − X.
The X term in the intercept can be interpreted as capturing a pure aggregate-demand
effect, whereby
          0 ?
                       higher values of X reduce aggregate demand. However, the remaining term,
  0−1 ν (` )
U ( F 0 (`? ) (1 + τ )), reflects technology and preferences. In particular, we can generalize this
term by0 ?re-introducing the technology parameter θ, in which case the intercept becomes
         ν (` )

intercept, and will lead to an increase in expenditures. This feature of the Z(e) − X curve
illustrates its equilibrium nature, which incorporates both demand and supply effects, as
opposed to a Keynesian cross that only reflects demand effects.

3.4     Is there deficient demand in the unemployment regime?
In the case where X is large enough for the economy to be in the unemployment regime
(X ? < X < X ?? ), we have already noted that the marginal rate of substitution between
consumption and leisure is greater the marginal product of labor, with this distortion in-
creasing the larger is X . In this sense, the economy is clearly working inefficiently in the
unemployment regime. In this section, we want to examine whether this regime can also
be appropriately characterized as suffering from deficient aggregate demand. In particular,
suppose the structure of markets were not changed and X ? < X < X ?? . Now suppose that
all households deviated from their equilibrium strategies by increasing slightly their demand
for consumption goods. If in this case the expected utility of the household would be in-
creased, then it appears reasonable to characterize the situation as one of deficient demand.
Using this definition, Proposition 5 indicates that the unemployment regime of our model is
in fact characterized by deficient demand.

Proposition 5. When the economy is in the unemployment regime (X ? < X < X ?? ), a
coordinated increase by households in the purchase of the first sub-period consumption good
increases the expected utility of all households.

    Proposition 5 can alternatively be interpreting as confirming that the consumption choices
of individual households play the role of strategic complements in the unemployment regime.

3.5     Effects of changes in X on welfare
We have shown that when X is high enough, then the economy will be in the unemployment
regime, where a local increase in X causes consumption to fall. We now want to ask how
expected welfare is affected in these cases, where expected welfare is defined as U (c) +
µ [−ν(`) + V (w` − p(c − X))] + (1 − µ)V (−p(c − X)). In particular, we want to ask whether
welfare can decrease when the economy is endowed with more goods. Proposition 6 answers
this question in the affirmative. Proposition 6 actually goes a step further and indicates two
sufficient conditions for there to exist a range of X in the unemployment regime where an
increase in X leads to a fall in welfare.

Proposition 6. An increase in X can lead to a fall in expected welfare.  ?
                                                                                  In particular, if
either (i) τ is close enough to τ̄ or (ii) the average cost of work ν(``? ) is low enough relative
to the marginal cost of work ν 0 (`? ), then there is always a range of X ∈ [X ? , X ?? ] such that
an increase in X leads to a decrease in expected welfare.

    Proposition 6 provides a step toward answering whether more goods can make everyone
worse off. In effect, the proposition indicates that the economy can function in a very perverse
fashion when households have inherited many goods. We saw from Proposition 4 that an

                                                17
increase in X always leads to a decrease in consumption when we are in the unemployment
regime. In comparison, Proposition 6 is weaker as it only indicates the possibility of a fall
in welfare in the unemployment region when X rises. In response to a rise in X in the
unemployment regime, there are three distinct channels through which expected welfare
is affected. First, as discussed above, consumption falls, which tends to directly decrease
welfare. Second, this fall in consumption is associated with a fall in the probability of being
employed. It can be verified that the net benefit of being employed is strictly positive,
so that this second effect also tends to decrease welfare. Finally, a rise in X means that
a given quantity of consumption can be obtained with a lower level of expenditure, which
increases assets for the employed and decreases debt for the unemployed, and therefore tends
to increase welfare. Whether this final effect is outweighed by the first two depends on the
factors discussed in Proposition 6.
    As noted in Proposition 6, the effects of an increase in X on welfare depends, among
other things, on the difference between the marginal utility cost of work and the average
utility cost of work. This distinction is relevant because an important component of the net
benefit of being employed is the utility value of wages earned, net of the value of foregone
leisure.21 In the current model, the average utility cost of work can be arbitrarily small
relative to its marginal cost. When the average cost of work is low, the net benefit of being
employed is large, and therefore a rise in the unemployment rate caused by a rise in X will
have a larger negative effect on welfare (i.e., the second channel discussed above becomes
more important). Hence, in our model, when employment is not perceived as very painful,
and we are in the unemployment regime, then an increase in X leads to decreased welfare.

3.6      Allowing for offers of unemployment insurance
In our analysis thus far, we have assumed that agents do not have access to unemployment
insurance. It may be thought that allowing for the private provision of unemployment
insurance would necessarily eliminate the mechanisms we have highlighted. For this reason,
in this subsection we want to briefly indicate how our analysis can be extended rather tri-
vially to include an adverse selection problem that will justify the absence of unemployment
insurance, without changing the main results. In particular, suppose there is a fraction
ρ of households that behave as the households we have modeled to date, which we call
participant households, and suppose the remaining (1 − ρ) fraction of households, which
we can call the non-participant households, are simply not interested in work within the
period. These latter households are happy to consume their endowment without wanting
to search for work. Now suppose that some private agent wanted to offer unemployment
insurance before the matching process, but could not differentiate between the two types
of households. In this case, an insurer will not be able to offer contracts that will only
be attractive to the participant households, because any unemployment insurance contract
with a positive net payment to unemployed individuals will be desirable to non-participants.
Therefore, as indicated in Proposition 7, as long as ρ is sufficiently low, this type of adverse
selection problem implies that the only equilibrium outcome is one where no insurance is
  21
     The other component is the net welfare gain that stems from consumption expenditures being made in
the positive-asset state rather than the more costly (in utility terms) negative-asset state.



                                                  18
offered. Accordingly, in this setup, the mechanisms we have emphasized regarding how
changes in X affect outcomes will directly apply.

Proposition 7. In the presence of both participant households and non-participant house-
               1
holds, if ρ < 1+τ , i.e., if the fraction of participant households is sufficiently low, then no
unemployment-insurance contracts are traded in equilibrium.



3.7      Introducing government spending
We now turn to examining how changes in government spending can affect economic activity.
To do this, we extend the model by simply adding a government to the first sub-period.
The government undertakes two activities in this sub-period: it buys goods, and it taxes
employed individuals. We assume that the government runs a balanced budget so that its
expenditure on goods is equal to the lump-sum tax per employed worker times the number of
employed workers. It turns out that the effects of government spending in this setup depend
crucially on what the government does with the goods. Accordingly, we will consider two
types of government purchases: wasteful, and non-wasteful. Wasteful government purchases,
denoted Gw , are not valued by households, 22 while non-wasteful purchases, denoted Gn , are
assumed to directly affect agents’ utility by entering as a substitute to private consumption.
Note that Gw and Gn are per-capita government expenditures. If we return to the set of
equilibrium conditions given by equations (7) to (11), the only condition that changes with
the introduction of a government is equation (8), the goods-market equilibrium condition.
The other conditions remain the same once the variable c is interpreted as total consumption
including consumption of non-wasteful government purchases. The goods market equilibrium
condition, equation (8), therefore has to be rewritten as 23

                                      min{N, L}   c − X + Gw
                                                =
                                          L          F 0 (`)`
since c − X + Gw now represents the total purchases of clothes in the sub-period. If we again
allow e to represent these total purchases (e = c − X + Gw ), then the determination of e
takes a form almost identical to that described previously by equations (12)-(14). In fact,
the determination of total expenditures e is now given by the solution to

                                          e = Z(e) − X + Gw                                           (15)

where Z(e) was defined in equation (13).
    There are two key things to notice about equation (15). First, non-wasteful government
expenditure Gn does not enter into this condition, and therefore does not affect the equilib-
rium level of economic activity e; that is, non-wasteful government expenditure crowds out
private expenditure one-to-one. Second, in contrast, wasteful government expenditure will
  22
    We can as well assume that they are valued by households but that utility is linearly separable in Gw .
  23
     We assume throughout this subsection that τ < τ̄ , and that total government expenditures are suffi-
ciently low so that the lump-sum tax on employed workers is not so large as to cause households to prefer
to be unemployed.


                                                    19
tend to stimulate activity in a manner parallel to a decrease in X. To understand why non-
wasteful government purchases do not affect activity, it is helpful consider how people would
behave simply if they conjectured the outcome. In this case, since they would conjecture that
unemployment risk is not changing, they would want to consume at the same overall level
as before the increase in Gn . But if they consume at the exact same overall level, it requires
households to decrease their private purchases by exactly the same amount as the purchases
made by the government. Hence, activity will not be increased and agents’ initial conjecture
is rationalized. This is why non-wasteful government purchases do not affect activity in
our setup, even when the economy exhibits unemployment. Note that this logic does not
hold in the case of wasteful government purchases. If government purchases are wasteful,
and people conjecture that unemployment risk is unaffected, their overall consumption will
be unchanged, and, with no increased utility from government purchases, private purchases
would also be unchanged. But total purchases – including those made by the government
– would necessarily be increased. If the economy were in the unemployment regime, this
additional demand would be met by a rise in the employment rate µ, and hence households’
conjecture that unemployment risk is unchanged would be false. Recognizing that unem-
ployment risk in fact fell, households would reduce their precautionary savings and increase
their private purchases, further increasing demand, and leading to a multiplier greater than
one. If the economy had instead been in the full-employment regime, the additional demand
would be met by a rise in hours per worker l, which is associated with a rise in the price
p and a corresponding fall in private purchases, mitigating to some extent the rise in de-
mand caused by the government and leading to a multiplier less than one. These results are
summarized in Proposition 8.

Proposition 8. An increase in non-wasteful government purchases has no effect on eco-
nomic activity. An increase in wasteful government purchases leads to an increase in eco-
nomic activity. If the economy is in the unemployment regime, wasteful government pur-
chases are associated with a multiplier that is greater than one, while if the economy is in
the full-employment regime, wasteful government purchases are associated with a multiplier
that is less than one.

    From Proposition 8 we see that the multiplier associated with wasteful government pur-
chases depends on the state of the economy and the type of purchases. In particular, the
multiplier for wasteful government purchases is greater than one when the economy has a
high level of X and is therefore in the unemployment regime. In contrast, when the econ-
omy has a low level of X and is therefore in the full-employment regime, the multiplier for
wasteful government purchases is less than one. The interesting aspect of Proposition 8 is
that it emphasizes why the effects of government purchases may vary drastically, from zero
to more than one, depending on the circumstances.
    While wasteful government purchases increase economic activity, this does not imply that
they increase welfare. In fact, it can be easily verified that an increase in wasteful government
purchases necessarily decreases welfare when the economy is in the full-employment regime,
as it reduces private consumption and increases hours worked. On the other hand, when the
economy is in the unemployment regime (due to a high value of X), the effect on welfare
depends on a number of factors, in much the same way that the effect on welfare of a change

                                               20
in X depends on a number of factors. For example, the change in welfare depends on the ratio
of the average dis-utility of labor relative to the marginal dis-utility of labor. As discussed
earlier, when this ratio is low, the net benefit to being employed is high, and since one of the
effects of an increase in wasteful government purchases is to increase the employment rate,
the resulting increase in welfare through this channel is also high. As such, welfare is overall
more likely to increase when the average dis-utility of work is low.
    It turns out that sufficient conditions under which an increase in wasteful government
purchases increases welfare are given by those contained in Proposition 6 regarding the
welfare effects of a change X. This is stated in Proposition 9.

Proposition 9. If the economy is in the unemployment regime and if X is in the range such
that a fall in X would increase welfare, then an increase in wasteful government purchases
will increase welfare.



4     Further discussions and relaxing of assumptions
4.1     Relaxing functional-form assumptions
To derive simple results from the model, we have made two salient functional-form assump-
tions. First, we have assumed that the matching function takes the “min” form, and second,
we have assume that the dis-utility of work in the second sub-period is linear so as to obtain
a piecewise linear V (a) function. The former allowed us to generate a simple dichotomy be-
tween an unemployment regime where changes in output occur along the extensive margin
of labor, and a full-employment regime where changes in output occur along the intensive
margin. Similarly, the latter assumption proved useful in simplifying both the characteriza-
tion of the equilibrium and the comparative statics results. However, we want to emphasize
that the flavor of our results is robust to departures from these assumptions, as long as the
departures are not too great. For example, if the matching function does not take the “min”
form, then the economy will in general always exhibit positive unemployment. In such a
case, the dichotomy of behavior we identified with respect to the effects of changes in X
will obviously not depend on whether the economy exhibits unemployment or not. Instead,
there will be a cut-off level of unemployment, above which an increase in X leads to decrease
in c, while below that level of unemployment an increase in X will lead to an increase in
c. However, if the matching function departs substantially from the “min” form, it is pos-
sible for more complicated configurations to arise with more than two sub-intervals. This
possibility does not seem very interesting to us, but it cannot be ruled out if we allow for a
general matching function. Similarly, if we depart substantially from the linearity assump-
tion for second-sub-period dis-utility of labor, income effects can reverse some of our simple
characterizations, but again, these mechanisms do not seem very interesting to us.

4.2    A version with productive capital
We have shown how a rise in the supply of the capital good X, by decreasing demand for
employment and causing households to increase precautionary savings, can perversely lead

                                              21
to a decrease in consumption. While thus far we have considered the case where X enters
directly into the utility function, in this section we show that Proposition 4 can be extended
to the case where X is introduced as a productive capital good. To explore this in the
simplest possible setting, suppose there are now two types of firms and that the capital
stock X no longer enters directly into the agents’ utility function. The first type of firm
remains identical to those in the first version of the model, except that instead of producing
a consumption good they produce an intermediate good, the amount of which is given by M.
There is also now a continuum of competitive firms who rent the productive capital good X
from the households and combine it with goods purchased from the intermediate goods firms
in order to produce the consumption good according to the production function g(X, M).
We assume that g is strictly increasing in both arguments and concave, and exhibits constant
returns to scale. Given X, it can be verified that the equilibrium determination of M will
then be given as the solution to

                                  gM (X, M)U 0 (g(X, M)) = Q(M)                                        (16)

where Q(·) is defined in equation (14).
    Note the similarity between condition (16) and the corresponding equilibrium condition
for the durable-goods version of the model, which can be written U 0 (X + e) = Q(e). In
fact, if g(X, M) = X + M, so that the elasticity of substitution between capital and the
intermediate good M is infinite, then the two conditions become identical, and therefore X
affects economic activity in the productive-capital version of the model in exactly the same
way as it does in the durable-goods model. Thus, a rise in X leads to a fall in consumption
when the economy is in the unemployment regime. In fact, as stated in Proposition 10,
this latter result will hold for a more general g as long as g does not feature too little
substitutability between X and M.24

Proposition 10. If the equilibrium is in the full-employment regime, then an increase in
productive capital leads to an increase in consumption. If the equilibrium is in the unem-
ployment regime, then an increase in productive capital leads to a decrease in consumption
if and only if the elasticity of substitution between X and M is not too small.

    The reason for the requirement in Proposition 10 that the elasticity of substitution be
sufficiently large relates to the degree to which an increase in X causes an initial impetus
that favors less employment. If the substitutability between X and M is small, so that com-
plementarity is large, then even though the same level of consumption could be achieved at a
lower level of employment, a social planner would nonetheless want to increase employment.
Since the multiplier process in our model simply amplifies – and can never reverse – this
initial impetus, strong complementarity would lead to a rise in employment and therefore a
rise in consumption, rather than a fall. In contrast, if this complementarity is not too large,
then an increase in X generates an initial impetus that favors less employment, which is in
  24
     We assume throughout this section that an equilibrium exists and is unique. Conditions under which this
is true are similar to the ones obtained for the durable-goods model, though the presence of non-linearities
in g makes explicitly characterizing them less straightforward in this case.



                                                    22
turn amplified by the multiplier process, so that a decrease in consumption becomes more
likely.25
    Let us emphasize that the manner in which we have just introduced productive capital
into our setup is incomplete – and possibly unsatisfying – since we are maintaining a static
environment with no investment decision. In particular, it is reasonable to think that the
more interesting aspect of introducing productive capital into our setup would be its effect
on investment demand. To this end, we now consider extending the model to a simple two-
period version that features investment. The main result from this endeavor is to emphasize
that the conditions under which a rise in X leads to a fall in consumption are weaker than
those required for the same result in the absence of investment. In other words, our results
from the previous section extend more easily to a situation where X is interpreted as physical
capital if we simultaneously introduce an investment decision. The reason for this is that, in
the presence of an investment decision, a rise in X is more likely to cause an initial impetus
in favor of less activity.
    To keep this extension as simple as possible, let us consider a two-period version of our
model with productive capital (where there remains two sub-periods in each period). In this
case, it can be verified that the continuation value for household j for the second period is
of the form R(X2 ) · X2,j , where X2,j is capital brought by household j into the second period
and X2 is capital brought into that period by all other households. In order to rule out the
possibility of multiple equilibria that could arise in the presence of strategic complementarity
in investment, we assume we are in the case where R0 (X2 ) < 0. The description of the model
is then completed by specifying the capital accumulation equation,
                                          X2 = (1 − δ)X1 + i                                          (17)
where i denotes investment in the first period and X1 is the initial capital stock, as well as
the new first-period resource constraint,
                                           c + i = g(X1 , M)                                          (18)
    Given this setup, we need to replace the equilibrium condition from the static model
(equation (16)) with the constraints (17) and (18) plus the following two first-order condi-
tions,
                                gM (X1 , M)U 0 (c) = Q(M)                               (19)
                                            U 0 (c) = R(X2 )                                          (20)
Equation (19) is the household’s optimality condition for its choice of consumption, and
is similar to its static counterpart (16), while equation (20) is the intertemporal optimality
condition equating the marginal value of consumption with the marginal value of investment.
    Of immediate interest is whether, in an unemployment-regime equilibrium, a rise in X1
will produce an equilibrium fall in consumption and/or employment in the first period. As
Proposition 11 indicates, the conditions under which our previous results extend are weaker
than those required in Proposition 10 for the static case, in the sense that lower substitution
between X and M is possible.
  25
     Note that a rise in X also increases output for any given level of employment. To ensure that consump-
tion falls in equilibrium, we require that the substitutability between X and M be large enough so that the
drop in employment more than offsets this effect.


                                                    23
Proposition 11. In the two-period model with productive capital,26 an increase in capital
leads to a decrease in both consumption and investment if and only if the elasticity of sub-
stitution between X and M is not too small. Furthermore, for a given level of equilibrium
employment, this minimum elasticity of substitution is lower than that required in Proposition
10 in the absence of investment decisions.

    The intuition for why consumption and investment fall when the elasticity of substitution
is high is similar to in the static case. The addition of the investment decision has the effect
of making it more likely that an increase in X leads to a fall in consumption because the
increase in X decreases investment demand, which in turn increases unemployment and
precautionary savings.


4.3      Multiple equilibria
Before discussing the welfare effects of changes in X, let us briefly discuss how multiple
equilibria can arise in this model when τ > τ̄ . It can be verified that, when τ > τ̄ , the
equilibrium determination of expenditures can still be expressed as the solution to the pair
of equations ej = Z(e) − X and ej = e. The problem that arises is that this system may no
longer have a unique solution. Instead, depending on the value of X, it may have multiple
solutions, an example of which is illustrated in Figure 5. In the figure, we see that, for this
value of X, there are three such solutions.

equilibrium, with at least one in the unemployment regime and one in the full-employment
regime. When this is the case, the selection of the equilibrium will depend on people’s sen-
timent. If people are pessimistic, they cut back on consumption, which leads firms to cut
back on employment, which can rationalize the initial pessimism. In contrast, if households
are optimistic, they tend to buy more, which justifies many firms wanting to hire, which
reduces unemployment and supports the optimistic beliefs. This type of environment fea-
turing multiple equilibria driven by demand externalities is at the core of many papers. On
this front, this paper has little to add. The only novel aspect of the current paper in terms
of multiple equilibria is to emphasize how the possibility of multiple equilibria may depend
on the economy’s holding of capital goods.


4.4     The role of beliefs
There is another aspect in which the current model differs from a Keyesnian-cross setup,
and that is with respect to the role of beliefs. The current setup should be thought of as
part of the family of coordination games, and accordingly can potentially be analyzed with
the tools and concepts used in the global games literature. Because of our assumption of
homogeneity across households, we have not been very specific about agents’ beliefs up to
now. Nonetheless, it is worth emphasizing that the type of multiplier process present in
the unemployment regime is the equilibrium outcome of a simultaneous-move game, rather
than the outcome of events occurring sequentially over time. As such, prior beliefs of the

                                                              25
players in the game are potentially a key driving force in the multiplier process. To clarify
the potential role of these beliefs in our setup, it is helpful to briefly consider the case where
agents have different holdings of X. For example, suppose that each agent j has an Xj
drawn from a distribution with mean χ. The first-order condition for household j, assuming
he thinks he is in the unemployment regime, can then be stated as

                                               ν 0 (`? )
                            U 0 (ej + Xj ) =             (1 + τ − Ej [µ]τ )
                                               F 0 (`? )

What is unknown to the household in this setup is the match probability µ, and therefore
the expenditure decision, ej , depends on household j’s expectation of µ, which we write as
Ej [µ]. But µ in turn depends on firms’ entry decisions, which depends on firms’
                                                                              R expectation
of aggregate consumption. This latter expectation can beRexpressed as Ef [ ei di], where
the operator Ef [·] represents expectations by firms, and ei di is the aggregate level of
expenditures. So the first-order condition for household j would be given by
                                                             R
                                    ν 0 (`? )
                                                                         
                       0                             Ej [Ef [ ei di]/L]
                     U (ej + Xj ) = 0 ? 1 + τ −                         τ
                                    F (` )                 Ω(l? )

We can now see that agent j’s consumption decision will depend on his expectation of firms’
expectation of the aggregate level of expenditure. This type of setup therefore involves
forecasting the forecasts of others. If we assume that U (·) is quadratic and all relevant
random variables jointly normally distributed, then this problem can be solved analytically,
and will lead agent j to have a decision rule for consumption which depends on both Xj and
χ, the prior about the average level of Xi across all other agents. Hence, both actual Xj ’s
and beliefs regarding the average value of Xj in the economy will be main forces that drive
expenditure and employment. For example, if agents believe that other agents have a high
holding of X, this will depress consumption for all agents regardless of the actual holdings of
X. Furthermore this effect can potentially be large because of the amplification mechanisms
running through precautionary savings.



5     Dynamics
In this section we want to explore a dynamic extension of our static durable-goods model
where current consumption contributes to the accumulation of X. In particular, we want to
consider the case where the accumulation of X obeys the accumulation equation

                  Xt+1 = (1 − δ)Xt + γet           0<δ≤1 ,           0<γ ≤1−δ                (21)

where the parameter γ represents the fraction of current consumption expenditures, et =
ct − Xt , which take the form of durable goods. Since we do not want to allow heterogeneity
between individuals to expand over time, we will allow individuals to borrow and lend only
within a period but not across periods; in other words, households are allowed to spend
more than their income in the first sub-period of a period, but must repay any resulting


                                                  26
debt in the second sub-period.27 The problem facing a household in the first sub-period
of a period is therefore to choose how much clothing to buy and, conditional on a match,
how much labor to supply. We model the second sub-period as in sub-section 3.2, where
households use labor to produce household services either for their own consumption or, at
a level of productivity that is lower by a factor 1 + τ , for the consumption of others. In
each second sub-period, then, the household chooses how much to consume of household
services and how much to produce of household services to both satisfy his needs and to pay
back any accumulated debt. In order to keep the model very tractable, we will continue to
assume that dis-utility of work in the second sub-period is linear (i.e., equal to v · `).
                                                                                       e Under
this assumption, all households will choose the same level of consumption of household
services in each second sub-period, while the production of household services will vary
across households depending on whether they entered the sub-period in debt or in surplus.
Since there are no interesting equilibrium interactions in second sub-periods, we can maintain
most of our focus on equilibrium outcomes in the sequence of first sub-periods.
    Relative to the static case, the only difference in equilibrium relationships (aside from
the addition of the accumulation equation (21)) is that the first-order condition associated
with the households’ choice of consumption of clothes is now given by the Euler equation

           U 0 (Xt + et ) − Q (et ) = β [(1 − δ − γ)U 0 (Xt+1 + et+1 ) − (1 − δ)Q (et+1 )]           (22)

where Q is as defined in equation (14). In this dynamic setting, an equilibrium will be repre-
sented as a sequence of the previous equilibrium conditions (8) to (11) plus the accumulation
equation (21) and the Euler equation (22).
    There are many complications that arise in the dynamic version of this model, which
makes characterizing equilibrium behavior difficult. In particular, there can be multiple
equilibrium paths and multiple steady-state solutions. Luckily, the problem can be simplified
if we focus on cases where δ is small; that is, on cases where the durability of goods is long. In
addition to simplifying the analysis, focusing on the low-δ case appears reasonable to us, as
many consumer durables are long-lived, especially if we include housing in that category. In
the case where δ is sufficiently small, as stated in Proposition 12, the economy will have only
one steady state and that steady state will have the property of exhibiting unemployment.

Proposition 12. If δ is sufficiently small, then the model has a unique steady state and this
steady state is characterized by unemployment.

   Proposition 12 is very useful, as it will allow us to analyze the equilibrium behavior
around the steady state without worrying about equilibrium selection. Accordingly, for the
remainder of this section, we will assume that δ is sufficiently small so that Proposition 12
applies. However, before examining local properties in some generality, we believe that it is
helpful to first illustrate global equilibrium behavior for a simple case that builds directly
on our static analysis. The reason that we want to illustrate global behavior for at least
one example is to emphasize that local behavior in our setup is likely to differ substantially
  27
     This lack of borrowing across periods can be rationalized if one assumes that the transaction cost of
intermediating loans across periods is greater than 1 + τ .



                                                   27
and meaningfully from global behavior. Moreover, the example will allow us to gain some
intuition on how the latter local results should best be interpreted.
     Before discussing the transitional dynamics of the model, we first briefly discuss the
conditions under which the model would exhibit a balanced growth path. In particular,
suppose production in the first sub-periods is given by θt F (`t ) where θt is a technology index
that is assumed to grow at a rate gθ . Then it is easy to verify that our economy will admit an
equilibrium growth path where both e and X grow at rate gθ if the following three conditions
are satisfied (i) the fixed cost of creating jobs grows at rate gθ , (ii) the productivity of labor
in the second sub-periods grows at rate gθ , and (iii) the utility of consumption is represented
by the log function. These conditions are not surprising, as they parallel those needed for a
balanced growth path in many common macro models. The important aspect to note about
this balanced-growth property is that the notion of high or low levels of capital should be
interpreted as relative to the balanced growth path. In other words, the key endogenous
state variable in the system should be viewed as the ratio of Xt to the growth component of
θt . Accordingly, this justifies why, in the initial empirical motivation section of the paper,
we deflated the measures of capital by a technology index.

5.1     Global dynamics for a simple case
The difficulty in analyzing the global dynamics for our model is related to the issue of
multiple equilibria we discussed in the static setting. If the static setting exhibits multiple
equilibria then the dynamic setting will likely exhibit multiple equilibrium paths. To see this,
it is useful to recognize that our problem of describing equilibrium paths can be reduced to
finding the household’s decision rule for consumption. Since the only state variable in the
system is Xt , the household’s decision rule for consumption will likely be representable by
a relationship (which may be stochastic) of the form c(Xt ). Given c(Xt ), the equilibrium
dynamics of the system are given by

                                Xt+1 = (1 − δ − γ)Xt + γc(Xt )                                (23)

    If the relationship c(Xt ) is a function, then equilibrium dynamics are deterministic. How-
ever, if we consider the case with β = 0 – so that households are not forward-looking and
thus the dynamic equilibrium is simply a sequence of static equilibria – we already know
that the household’s decision rule c(Xt ) may not be a function. For example, if τ > τ̄ , then
the household’s decision rule may be a correspondence of the form given in Figure 6. There-
fore, even for the rather simple case where β = 0 and τ > τ̄ we know that the equilibrium
dynamics need not be unique, in which case some equilibrium-selection device will be needed
to solve the model. In contrast, for the case where β = 0 and τ < τ̄ , then we know from
Proposition 3 that c(Xt ) is a function. Hence, in the case where β = 0 and τ < τ̄ , we can
describe the global dynamics of the system rather easily, and this is what we will do in this
section. In particular, when β = 0 and τ < τ̄ , the stock of durables evolves according to
equation (23), with c(Xt ) given by the value of c obtained using Proposition 3 with Xt in
place of X.
    Figure 7 plots the equilibrium transition function for X for three cases; that is, it plots
(1 − δ − γ)Xt + γc(Xt ) for different possible c(Xt ) functions. The figure is drawn so that


                                                28
the steady state is in the unemployment region, which is consistent with a low value of δ as
implied by Proposition 12. As can be seen from the figure, when Xt is not too great (i.e., less

than X ? ) the economy is in the full-employment regime and Xt+1 > Xt . So if the economy
starts with a low value of Xt it will generally go through a phase of full employment. During
this phase, we know from Proposition 3 that consumption is also increasing. Eventually,
Xt will exceed X ? and the economy enters the unemployment regime, at which point the
dynamics depend on the derivative of the equilibrium decision rule, i.e., c0 (Xt ), where in this
regime c(Xt ) solves

slope near the steady state and the economy will converge monotonically to its steady state.
However, note that even if X converges monotonically to its steady state in such a case, this
will not be the case for consumption. Again, from Proposition 3 we know that consumption
is decreasing in X in the unemployment region. Hence, starting from X = 0, in this case
consumption would initially increase, reaching a maximum just as the economy enters the

                                                                          29
unemployment regime, then decline towards its eventual steady-state level which is lower
than the peak obtained during the transition. If instead −c0 (Xt ) > 1−δ−γ
                                                                        γ

function for X will exhibit a negative slope in the unemployment regime. In this case, X will
no longer converge monotonically to the steady state. In fact, if the slope of this function
(which depends on the elasticity of c with respect to X at the steady state ) is negative
but greater than -1, the system will converge with oscillations. However, if this slope is
smaller than -1, which can arise for very large negative values of c0 (Xt ), then the system will
not converge and instead can exhibit rich dynamics, including cycles and chaos. In general,
however, even in the case where c0 (Xt ) is very negative, the system will not necessarily be
explosive, since once it moves sufficiently far away from the steady state, forces kick in that
work to push it back. Such rich dynamics, with the possibility of limit cycles, are certainly
intriguing, but we will not dwell on them since it appears unlikely to us that this type of
configuration is relevant.
    There are two main messages to take away from exploring the global dynamics in this
special case with β = 0. First, the behavior of the state variable X can be well-behaved,
exhibiting monotonic convergence throughout. Second, the behavior of consumption (and
therefore possibly welfare), can nonetheless exhibit interesting non-monotonic dynamics,
with steady-state consumption actually being below the highest level it achieved during the
transition. It is worth noting that if the steady state were to be in the full-employment
regime (due, for example, to a higher δ), then from X = 0 both Xt and ct would always
converge monotonically to the steady state when β = 0 and τ < τ̄
    The most interesting aspect about the global dynamics in this case is that it allows us
to illustrate the following possibility: If the economy is near its steady state, then a small
reduction in Xt will increase consumption and can potentially increase welfare, while a large
decrease in Xt will certainly decrease welfare. In this sense, the model exhibits behavior
around the unemployment steady state that can differ substantially from behavior far away
from the steady state, with the behavior far away from the steady state being more akin
to that generally associated with classical economics, while behavior in the unemployment
regime being more similar to that suggested by a Keynesian perspective.28

5.2      Local dynamics in the general case
In this subsection, we explore the local dynamics of the general model when β > 0, still
assuming that δ is sufficiently small so that the steady state is unique and in the unemploy-
ment regime. From our analysis of the case with β = 0, we know that local dynamics can
exhibit convergence or divergence depending on how responsive consumption is to X around
the steady state. The one question we could not address when β = 0 is whether dynamics
could exhibit local indeterminacy. In other words, can forward-looking behavior give rise to
an additional potential source of multiple equilibria in our setup? Proposition 13 indicates
that this is not possible; that is, the roots of the system around the unique steady state can
  28
     It is worth noting that this type of synthesis, which emphasizes differences between being near to the
steady state versus far from the steady state, is substantially different from the new neo-classical synthesis,
which emphasizes differences in the long run and the short run because of sticky prices.




                                                      30
not both be smaller than one.29

Proposition 13. The local dynamics around the steady state can either exhibit monotonic
convergence in c and X, convergence with oscillations, or divergence. Locally indeterminacy
is not possible.

    Proposition 13 is useful as it tells us that the decision rule for consumption around the
steady state is a function. Accordingly, we can now examine the sign of the derivative of this
function. The question we want to examine is whether the decision rule for consumption
around the steady state has the property that a larger X leads to a lower level of consumption,
as was the case in our static model when in the unemployment regime. In other words, we
want to know whether the results regarding the effect of X on consumption we derived for
the static model extend to the steady state of the dynamic setting with β > 0. Proposition
14 indicates that if τ is not too large, then local dynamics will exhibit this property. Note
that the condition on τ is a sufficient condition only.

Proposition 14. If τ is sufficiently small, then in a neighborhood of the unique steady state,
consumption is decreasing in X, with the dynamics for X converging monotonically to the
steady state.

    From Proposition 14 we now know that, as long as τ is not too big, our model has the
property that when the economy has over-accumulated relative to the steady state (i.e., if X
slightly exceeds its steady-state value), then consumption will be lower than in the steady
state throughout the transition period toward the steady state, which we can refer to as
a period of liquidation. In this sense, the economy is overreacting to its inherited excess
of capital goods during this liquidation period, since it is reducing it expenditures to such
an extent that that people are consuming less even though there are more goods available
to them in the economy. While such a response is not socially optimal, it remains unclear
whether it is so excessive as to make people worse off in comparison to the steady state,
since they are also working less during the liquidation phase. It turns out that, as in the
static case, the welfare effect of such a liquidation period depends, among other things, on
whether the average dis-utility of work is small enough relative to the marginal dis-utility.
For example, if the average dis-utility of work is sufficiently low relative to its marginal value,
then it can be verified that a liquidation period induced by inheriting an excess of X relative
to the steady state will make average utility in all periods of the transition lower than the
steady state level of utility. This result depends in addition on the unemployment rate not
being too large in the steady state.
    While we do not have a simple characterization of the global dynamics when β > 0,
Propositions 13 and 14 suggest to us that the intuition we gained from the case where β = 0
likely extends to the more general problem as long as τ is not too large and δ is small. In
particular, we take our analysis as suggesting that, starting from X = 0, the economy will
  29
     In this section we only consider local dynamics around a unique unemployment-regime steady state.
Nonetheless, it is straightforward to show that if the unique steady state is in the full-employment regime,
then the local dynamics necessarily exhibit monotonic convergence.

generally go though a phase of full employment, with both X and c increasing over time.
The economy then enters into the unemployment range once X is large enough. Then, as
long as τ is not too great, X will continue to monotonically increase, converging toward its
steady state. In contrast to X, upon entering the unemployment regime, consumption starts
to decrease as unemployment risk leads to precautionary savings which depresses activity.
Eventually, the economy will reach a steady state where consumption, employment, and
possibly period welfare are below the peak levels reached during the transition.
     In the above discussion of liquidation, we have taken the level of inherited capital as
given and have only examined how the economy responds over time to a situation where X
is initially above its steady state. In particular, we have shown that such a liquidation phase
can be associated with excessively low consumption, low welfare and high unemployment, all
relative to their steady state values. While the focus of the paper is precisely to understand
behavior during such a liquidation phase, it nonetheless remains interesting to ask how
welfare would behave if we were to view the whole cycle, both the over-accumulation phase
and the liquidation phase together. To briefly examine this issue, we build on the news-noise
literature and consider a case where agents in an economy start at a steady state and then
receive information about productivity.30 Agents have to make their consumption decision
based on the news, and we assume that they subsequently learn that the news is false. This
leads to an initial high level of consumption during the period where agents are optimistic,
followed by a period of low consumption during the liquidation phase after realizing that
they had mistakenly over-accumulated. Details of this extension are presented in Appendix
D.
     In Figure 8 we report for illustration purposes two impulse responses associated with a
simple calibration of such a noise-driven-boom-followed-by-liquidation model. We plot the
dynamics for the stock of durables and the average period utility of households relative to the
steady state. From the figure, we see that during the first period, when agents are acting on
optimistic beliefs about productivity, their period welfare increases even if they are working
hard to ramp up their stocks of durable goods. After one period, they realize their error since
productivity has not actually improved, and consequently cut back on their expenditures to
start a liquidation process. The welfare of households from the second period on is lower
than in steady state because of the excessively cautious behavior of households, which stops
the economy from taking advantage of the excessively high inherited capital stock.
     It is interesting to contrast this path with that which would happen if unemployment risk
were perfectly insured or if matching frictions were absent. In such a case, the news would
still lead to a boom, and the realization of the error would lead to a recession. However, the
dynamics of period welfare would be very different. Instead of the boom being associated
with high period welfare and the recession being associated with low period welfare, as
in our model with unemployment risk, the opposite would happen. The boom would be
associated with low period welfare, as agents would be working harder than normal, while
in the recession welfare would be above the steady-state value since agents would take a
vacation and benefit from past excess work. While evaluating welfare is certainly difficult,
the path for period welfare in our model with unemployment risk appears to us as more in
line with common perceptions about boom-bust cycles than that implied by a situation with

6      Policy trade-offs
In this last section, we turn to one of our motivating questions and ask whether or not
stimulative policies should be used when an economy is going through a liquidation phase
characterized by high unemployment. In particular, we consider the case where the economy
has inherited from the past a level of X above its steady-state value and, in the absence of
intervention, would experience a period of liquidation, with consumption below its steady-
state level throughout the transition. Obviously, the first-best policies in this environment
would be to remove the sources of frictions or to perfectly insure agents against unemploy-
ment risk. However, for a number of reasons, such-first best policies may not be possible. We
therefore want to consider the value of a more limited type of policy: one that seeks only to
temporarily boost expenditures. In particular, we are interested in asking whether welfare
would be increased by stimulating expenditures for one period, knowing that this would
imply a higher X tomorrow and therefore lower consumption in all subsequent periods until
the liquidation is complete. This policy question is aimed at capturing the tension between
the Keynesian and Hayekian prescriptions in recession. In answering this question, we will
be examining the effects of such a policy without being very explicit about the precise policy
tools used to engineer the stimulus, as we think it could come from several sources. However,
it can be verified that the stimulus we consider can be engineered by a one period subsidy
to consumption financed by a tax on the employed.
    Examining how a temporary stimulus to expenditures affects welfare during a liquidation
turns out to be quite involved. For this reason, we break down the question into two parts.
First, we ask whether a temporary stimulus would increase welfare if the economy were
initially in a steady state characterized by unemployment. Second, we ask whether the effect
on welfare of such a stimulus would be greater if the economy were initially in a state of
liquidation (i.e., with X0 above its steady state) than in the case where it is initially at a
steady state.
    When looking at how a temporary boost in expenditures would affect welfare, one may
expect it to depend on many factors, including the extent of risk-aversion and the dis-utility
of work. However, since the level of expenditures represents a private optima, the present
discounted welfare effect of a temporary boost in expenditures turns out to depend on a
quite limited set of factors. In particular, if the economy is initially at a steady state in the
unemployment regime, then to a first-order approximation the direction of the cumulative
welfare effect depends simply on whether the stimulus induces an increase or decrease in the
presented discounted value of the output stream. This is stated in Proposition 15.

Proposition 15. Suppose the economy is in steady state in the unemployment regime. Then,
to a first-order approximation, a (feasible) change in the path of expenditures from this steady
state equilibrium will increase the present discounted value of expected welfare
                                                                               P if and      only if
it increases the presented discounted sum of the resulting expenditure path, ∞    i=0 β i
                                                                                          e t+i .

   The logic behind Proposition 15 derives mainly from the envelope theorem. Since the
consumption stream is optimally chosen from the individual’s perspective, most of the effects

                                                34
of a change in the consumption path are only of second order and can therefore be neglected
when the change is small. Moreover, in the unemployment region, prices, wages and hours
worked are invariant to changes in expenditures. Hence the only effects needed to be taken
into account for welfare purposes are the induced changes in the match probabilities times
the marginal value of changing these match probabilities. When the economy is initially
in a steady state, the marginal value of changing the match probabilities is the same at
each point in time. Further, since the match probabilities are proportional to expenditures,
this explains why welfare increases if and only if the perturbed path of expenditures has a
positive presented discounted value. With this result in hand, it becomes rather simple to
calculate whether, starting from steady state, a one-period increase in expenditures followed
by a return to equilibrium decisions rules results in an increase in welfare. In particular,
recall that the law of motion for X is given by

                              Xt+1 = (1 − δ)Xt + γe(Xt )            0<γ<1

where the function e(Xt ) is the equilibrium policy function for et . Now, beginning from
steady state, suppose at t = 0 we stimulate expenditures by  for one period such that the
stock at t = 1 is now given by
                                       e1 = (1 − δ)X0 + γ(e + )
                                       X

As as result of this one-period perturbation, the path for expenditures for all subsequent
periods will be changed even if there is no further policy intervention. The new sequence
for X, which we denote X                       et+1 = (1 − δ)X
                         et , will be given by X                     et ) for all t ≥ 1. From
                                                             et + γe(X
Proposition 15, this perturbation increases present discounted welfare if and only if
                                                ∞
                                                X        h          i
                                        >−           β t e(X
                                                            et ) − e                                     (24)
                                                t=1

For  small, we can use the linear approximation of the function e(·) around the steady
state to make this calculation. Note that e0 (X) = −(1 − δ − λ1 )/γ, where λ1 is the smallest
eigenvalue of the dynamic system in modulus.31 Thus, in this case, one may show that
condition (24) becomes
                                      1 − β(1 − δ)
                                                   >0
                                        1 − βλ1
If the system is locally stable, then λ1 < 1, and therefore this condition will always hold.
Hence, if we are considering a situation where the economy is in an unemployment-regime
steady state, and this steady state is locally stable, then a one-period policy of stimulating
household expenditures will increase welfare. This arises even though most of the effect of
the policy is to front-load utility by creating an initial boom followed by a liquidation bust.32
While we knew that the initial steady state was sub-optimal, and that a policy that increases
expenditures in all periods would likely be desirable, it is interesting to learn that a policy
  31

  32
     Note that this result does not depend on the welfare factors considered earlier in the static model, such
as the magnitudes of τ and of the difference between the marginal and average disutility of work.


                                                      35
that favors expenditure today over expenditure tomorrow – when in the economy is in the
unemployment regime – tends to increase welfare.
     The question we now want to examine is whether the gains in welfare of a temporary
stimulus are greater when the economy is initially in a liquidation phase than in steady state.
We believe this is a relevant question since a case for stimulus during a liquidation can best
be made if the gains are greater than when the economy is in steady state. Otherwise, there
is no particular reason to favor stimuli more when unemployment is above normal than when
it is at a normal level. Somewhat surprisingly to us, as long as U 000 is not too big,33 the answer
to this question is negative, as stated in Proposition 16.
Proposition 16. Assuming the economy’s steady state is in the unemployment regime and
U 000 is not too big, then, to a second-order approximation around the steady state, a temporary
stimulus increases the presented discounted value of welfare less when implemented during a
liquidation phase then when implemented at the steady state.
    Although a period of liquidation is associated with a higher-than-normal level of un-
employment, and the degree of distortion as captured by the labor wedge is higher in such
periods when compared to the steady state, Proposition 16 indicates that the gains to a tem-
porary stimulus are not greater during a liquidation period than in normal (steady-state)
times. At first pass, one may be puzzled by this result, as one might have expected the
gains to be highest when the marginal utility of consumption is highest. However, when the
economy is in a liquidation phase, while the benefits from current stimulus are high, so are
the costs associated with delaying the recovery. In fact, because consumption levels are at
a private optimum, these two forces essentially cancel each other out. Moreover, when in
the unemployment regime, the direct gain from employing one more individual – that is, the
value of the additional production, net of the associated dis-utility of work – is the same
regardless of whether unemployment is high or low. Hence, the only remaining difference
between the value of stimulus in high- versus low-unemployment states relates to the net
utility gain from employed workers entering the second sub-period in surplus rather than
debt. In a lower-unemployment regime, households take less precaution, so that unemployed
workers end up with more debt, which is costly. It is this force which makes postponing an
adjustment particularly costly when in a liquidation phase.34
    With respect to the policy debate between the followers of Hayek and Keynes, we take
our results are clarifying the scope of the arguments. On the one hand, we have found that a
policy that stimulates current consumption at the cost of lower consumption in the future can
often be welfare-improving when the economy features unemployment. However, at the same
time, we have found that the rationale for such a policy does not increase simply because
the level of unemployment is higher. Hence, if one believes that stimulus is not warranted
in normal times (because of some currently un-modeled costs) and that normal times are
characterized by excessive unemployment, then stimulus should not be recommended during
liquidation periods. While this insight will likely not extinguish the debate on the issue, we
believe it can help focus the dialogue.
  33
     Note that this condition on U 000 is sufficient but not necessary for this result.
  34
     There is an additional force at play here, which relates to the fact that the magnitude of the amplification
mechanism will in general be different when the economy is away from the steady state. However, as long
as U 000 is not too big, this effect can safely be ignored.


                                                       36
7       Conclusion
There are three types of elements that motivated us to write this paper. First, there is
the observation that most deep recessions arise after periods of fast accumulation of capital
goods, either in the form of houses, consumer durables, or productive capital. This, in
our view, gives plausibility to the hypothesis that recessions may often reflect periods of
liquidation where the economy is trying to deplete excesses from past over-accumulation.35,36
Second, during these apparent liquidation-driven recessions, the process of adjustment seems
to be socially painful and excessive, in the sense that the level of unemployment does not
seem to be consistent with the idea that the economy is simply “taking a vacation” after
excessive past work. Instead, the economy seems to be exhibiting some coordination failure
that makes the exploitation of gains from trade between individuals more difficult than in
normal times. These two observations capture the tension we believe is often associated with
the Hayekian and Keynesian views of recessions. Finally, even when monetary authorities
try to counter such recessions by easing policy, this does not seem to be fully effective. This
leads us to believe that there are likely mechanisms at play beyond those related to nominal
rigidities.37 Hence, our objective in writing this paper was to offer a framework that is
consistent with these three observations, and accordingly to provide an environment where
the policy trade-offs inherent to the Hayekian and Keynesian views could be discussed.
    A central contribution of the paper is to provide a simple macro model that explains, using
real as opposed to nominal frictions, why an economy may become particularly inefficient
when it inherits an excessive amount of capital goods from the past. The narrative behind
the mechanism is quite straightforward. When the economy inherits a high level of capital,
this decreases the desire for trade between agents in the economy, leading to less demand.
When there are fixed costs associated with employment, this will generally lead to an increase
in unemployment. If the risk of unemployment cannot be entirely insured away, households
will react to the increased unemployment by increasing saving and thereby further depressing
demand. This multiplier process will cause an excess reaction to the inherited goods and
can be large enough to make society worse off even if – in a sense – it is richer since it has
inherited a large stock of goods. Within this framework, we have shown that policies aimed
at stimulating activity will face an unpleasant trade-off, as the main effect of stimulus will
simply be to postpone the adjustment process. Nonetheless, we find that such stimulative
policies may remain desirable even if they postpone recovery, but these gains do not increase
simply because the rate of unemployment is higher. As noted, the mechanisms presented in
the paper have many antecedents in the literature, but we believe that our framework offers
a particularly tractable and clear way of capturing these ideas and of reconciling diverse
  35
     Note that this is a fundamentalist view of recessions, in that the main cause of a recession is viewed as an
objective fundamental (in this case, the level of capital relative to technology) rather than a sunspot-driven
change in beliefs.
  36
     An alternative interpretation of this observation is that financial imbalances associated with the increase
in capital goods are the main source of the subsequent recessions.
  37
     We chose to analyze in this paper in an environment without any nominal rigidities so as to clarify the
potential role of real rigidities in understanding behavior in recessions. However, in doing so, we are not
claiming that the economy does not also exhibit nominal rigidities or that monetary policy is ineffective. We
are simply suggesting that explanations based mainly on nominal rigidities may be missing important forces
at play that cannot be easily overcome by monetary policy.

B       Proofs of Propositions
Proof of Proposition 1
We first establish that there always exists an equilibrium of this model. Substituting equation
(8) into equation (7) and letting e ≡ c − X yields

                                            ν 0 (`)
                                                                  
                               0                               e
                             U (X + e) = 0            1+τ −τ                              (B.1)
                                            F (`)            Ω(`)

                                              41
where Ω(`) ≡ F 0 (`)` is output net of search costs per employed worker, which is assumed
to be strictly increasing. When N < L (i.e., the full-employment constraint is not binding),
equation (9) implies that ` = `? , and equation (8) implies that e < e? , where e? ≡ Ω(`? ).
On the other hand, when N > L (i.e., the full-employment constraint binds), equation (8)
implies that ` = Ω−1 (e). Further, since min{N, L} < N and F (`) − F 0 (`)` is assumed to be
strictly increasing in `, equation (9) implies that ` > `? , and thus, by strict increasingness
of Ω, we also have e > e? . Substituting these results into equation (B.1) yields that e > 0 is
an equilibrium of this model if it satisfies

                                       U 0 (X + e) = Q(e)                                  (B.2)

where the function Q(e), defined in equation (14), is the expected marginal utility cost of
consumption when aggregate expenditures are e = c − X. Note that Q is continuous, strictly
decreasing on [0, e? ], and strictly increasing on [e? , ∞).

Lemma B.1. If U 0 (X) ≤ Q(0), then there is an equilibrium with e = 0.

Proof. To see this, suppose aggregate conditions are that e = 0. Then the marginal utility
of consumption when the household simply consumes its endowment is no greater than its
expected marginal cost, and thus households respond to aggregate conditions by making no
purchases, which in turn validates e = 0.

Lemma B.2. If U 0 (X) > Q(0), then there is an equilibrium with e > 0.

Proof. We have that min Q(e) = ν 0 (`? )/F 0 (`? ) > 0. Since we have assumed limc→∞ U 0 (c) ≤ 0,
it necessarily follows that for any X, there exists an e sufficiently large that U 0 (X + e) <
min Q(e), and therefore, by the intermediate value theorem, there must exist a solution e > 0
to equation (B.2).
     Lemmas B.1 and B.2 together imply that an equilibrium necessarily exists. We turn now
to showing under what conditions this equilibrium is unique for all values of X. As in equa-
tion (12), we may represent household j’s optimal expenditure when aggregate expenditure
is e as ej (e) = U 0−1 (Q(e)) − X, so that equilibrium is a fixed point ej (e) = e. The function
ej (e) is continuous everywhere, and differentiable everywhere except at e = e? , with

                                                      Q0 (e)
                                   e0j (e) =
                                               U 00 (U 0−1 (Q(e)))

Note that e0j (e) is independent of X, strictly increasing on [0, e? ] and strictly decreasing on
[e? , ∞).

Lemma B.3. If
                                          lim e0j (e) < 1                                  (B.3)
                                          e↑e?

then e0j (e) < 1 for all e.




                                                  42
Proof. Note first that e0j (e) < 0 for e > e? , so that this condition is obviously satisfied in
that case. For e < e? , note that
                                        00         000
                                                                     0 2
                                       Q   (e) − U     (X + ej (e))  ej (e)
                            e00j (e) =             00
                                                 U (X + ej (e))

Since Q00 (e) = 0 on this range and U 000 > 0, we have e00j (e) > 0, and thus e0j (e) < lime↑e? e0j (e),
which completes the proof.

Lemma B.4. Inequality (B.3) holds if and only if

                                        f 0 (`? )       ν 0 (`? )

Proof. We have that

                                                               ν 0 (`? )τ
                       lim? e0j (e) =                             
                       e↑e                                ν 0 (`? )
                                        −U 00 U 0−1       f 0 (`? )
                                                                        f 0 (`? ) [f (`? ) − Φ]

which is clearly less than one if and only if τ < τ̄ .

Lemma B.5. If τ < τ̄ , then there always exists a unique equilibrium regardless of the value
of X. If τ > τ̄ , then there exists values of X ∈ R such that there are multiple equilibria.

Proof. We have already established that there always exists an equilibrium. Note that equi-
librium occurs at the point where the ej = ej (e) locus intersects with the locus characterizing
the equilibrium condition, i.e., ej = e. To see the first part of the lemma, suppose τ < τ̄ so
that inequality (B.3) holds. Then since the slope of the equilibrium locus is one, and the
slope of the ej = ej (e) locus is strictly less than one by Lemma B.3, there can be at most
one intersection, and therefore the equilibrium is unique.
     To see the second part of the lemma, suppose that τ > τ̄ and thus (B.3) does not hold.
Then by strict convexity of ej (e) on (0, e? ), there exists a value e < e? such that e0j (e) > 1
on (e, e? ). Define X(e)
                     e   ≡ U 0−1 (Q(e)) − e, and note that e is an equilibrium when X = X(e).
                                                                                            e
                                                                                  ?
We show that there are at least two equilibria when X = X(e)  e     with e ∈ (e, e ). To see this,
choose e0 ∈ (e, e ), and note that, for X = X(e0 ), ej (e0 ) = e0 and e0j (e) > 1 on (e0 , e? ).
                   ?                              e
Thus, it must also be the case that ej (e? ) > e? . But since ej (e) is continuous everywhere
and strictly decreasing on e > e? , this implies that there exists some value e > e? such that
ej (e) = e, which would represent an equilibrium. Since e0 < e? is also an equilibrium, there
are at least two equilibria.
   This completes the proof of Proposition 1.

Proof of Proposition 2
Lemma B.6. If τ < τ̄ and X is such that e > 0, then de/dX < 0.



                                                      43
Proof. Totally differentiating equilibrium condition (B.2) with respect to X yields

                                   de      U 00 (X + e)
                                      = 0                                                   (B.4)
                                   dX  Q (e) − U 00 (X + e)

From Lemma B.4, we see that Q0 (e) > U 00 (U 0−1 (Q(e))). In equilibrium, U 0−1 (Q(e)) = X + e,
so that this inequality becomes Q0 (e) > U 00 (X + e), and thus the desired conclusion follows
by inspection.
   Given Lemma B.6 and the fact that the economy exhibits unemployment when e < e?
and full employment when e ≥ e? , it is clear that the economy will exhibit unemployment if
and only if X is smaller than the level such that e = e? is the equilibrium; that is, if X ≤ X ? ,
where                                        0 ? 
                                        0−1  ν (` )

                               X ≡U                    − F 0 (`? )`?
                                             F 0 (`? )
This completes the proof of the first part of the proposition.
    Next, from 0 ?
                      Lemma B.1, we see that there is a zero-employment equilibrium if and only
if U 0 (X) ≤ Fν 0(`(`?)) (1 + τ ), which holds when X ≥ X ?? , where

                                                         ν 0 (`? )
                                                                          
                                     ??        0−1
                                 X        ≡U                       (1 + τ )
                                                         F 0 (`? )

This completes the proof of Proposition 2.

Proof of Proposition 3
If X < X ?? , we know from Proposition 2 that e > 0, and therefore e solves equation (B.2).
Substituting e = c − X for e yields the desired result in this case. From Proposition 2, we
also know that if X ≥ X ?? then e = 0, in which case c = X, which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 4
If X > X ?? , so that the economy features zero employment and therefore c = X, then clearly
c is increasing in X. Thus, suppose X < X ?? , so that e > 0. Totally differentiating the
expression c = X + e with respect to X and using equation (B.4), we obtain

                                   dc         Q0 (e)
                                      = 0                                                   (B.5)
                                   dX  Q (e) − U 00 (X + e)

Since the denominator of this expression is positive (see the proof of Lemma B.6), the sign
of dc/dX is given by the sign of Q0 (e), which is negative if e < e? (i.e., if X ? < X < X ?? )
and positive if e > e? (i.e., if X < X ? ). This completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 5
Letting U(e) denote welfare conditional on the coordinated level of e, we may obtain that

                                            ν 0 (`? )                   ν 0 (`? )

where µ(e) = e/[F 0 (`? )`? ] denotes employment conditional on e. Using the envelope theorem,
it is straightforward to see that the only welfare effects of a marginal change in e from
its decentralized equilibrium value are those that occur through the resulting change in
employment. Thus,
                                               ν 0 (`? )
                                                        
                                 U (e) = L + τ 0 ? e µ0 (e) > 0

                                               F (` )
where L? ≡ ν 0 (`? )`? −ν(`? ) ≥ 0, and therefore a coordinated rise in e would increase expected
utility of all households.

Proof of Proposition 6
Denote welfare as a function of X by

                U(X) ≡ U (X + e) + µ [−ν(`) + V (w` − pe)] + (1 − µ)V (−pe)

If X < X ? , so that the economy is in the full-employment regime, or if X > X ?? , so that
the economy is in the zero-employment regime, we may show that U 0 (X) > 0 always holds.
Thus, we focus on the case where X ∈ (X ? , X ?? ). When this is true, some algebra yields

                                            ν(`? )    ν 0 (`? )       ν 0 (`? )

Using the envelope theorem, we may differentiate this expression with respect to X to obtain

then there exists a range of X such that U 0 (X) < 0.
Proof. Since U is convex by Lemma B.7, U 0 (X) < 0 for some values of X if and only if
limX↓X ? U 0 (X) < 0. Taking limits of equation (B.7), and using the facts that

Substituting in from the definition of L? , straightforward algebra yields that this expression
is less than one if and only if τ > τ .
    Note that, by convexity of ν(`) and the fact that ν(0) = 0, we have ν(`? ) ≤ ν 0 (`? )`? , and
thus τ < τ̄ , so that there always exists values of τ such that τ < τ < τ̄ . From the definition
of τ , we also see that, holding τ and ν 0 (`? ) constant, if ν(`? )/`? is small, this inequality is
more likely to be satisfied.

Proof of Proposition 7
We suppose there is a competitive insurance industry offering a menu of unemployment
insurance contracts. A typical contract is denoted (h, q), where h is the premium, paid in
all states, and q is the coverage, which the purchaser of the contract receives if and only if
he is unemployed. Both h and q are expressed in units of good 1. Since insurance is only
potentially useful when 0 < µ < 1, we henceforth assume that this is true. Note also that
zero profit of insurers requires that h = (1 − µρ̂)q, where ρ̂ is the fraction of purchasers of
the contract that are participant households. This implies that non-participant households
will not purchase any such zero-profit contract featuring q < 0.

                                                 46
Lemma B.9. In any separating equilibrium, no contracts are purchased by participant house-
holds.38
Proof. Suppose there is a separating equilibrium, and let (hp , qp ) denote the contract pur-
chased by participant households, and (hn , qn ) that purchased by non-participant households.
From the insurer’s zero-profit condition, we must have hp = (1 − µ)qp and hn = qn . Since
non-participant households will always deviate to any contract with hp < qp , this implies
that we must have qp < 0 in such an equilibrium.
    Next, for any zero-profit separating contract, the assets of employed participant house-
holds are given by Ae = w` − p[(1 − µ)qp + e] and of unemployed participant households by
Au = p(µqp − e). Note that, since qp < 0 and from the resource constraint wl > pc, we must
have Au < 0 < Ae . Also, the derivative of the household’s objective function with respect
to qp along the locus of zero-profit contracts is given by
                               ∂U
                                   = pµ(1 − µ) [V 0 (Au ) − V 0 (Ae )] > 0
                               ∂qp
wherever such a derivative exists. Since Au < 0 < Ae , this derivative must exist at the
candidate equilibrium, and therefore in a neighborhood of that equilibrium the objective
function is strictly increasing on qp < 0. Thus, given any candidate zero-profit equilibrium
contract with qp < 0, there exists an alternative contract (h0p , qp0 ) with qp0 > qp which satisfies
that h0p − (1 − µ)qp0 is strictly greater than but sufficiently close to zero so that participant
households would choose it over (hp , qp ), while non-participant households would not choose
it, and therefore insurers could make a positive profit selling it. Thus, (hp , qp ) cannot be an
equilibrium contract. Since this holds for all qp < 0, it follows that no separating equilibrium
exists in which contracts are purchased by participant households.
    Next, consider a pooling equilibrium, so that ρ̂ = ρ. As argued above, we must have q ≥ 0
in any such equilibrium. Assets of an employed worker when choosing a zero-profit pooling
contract (h, q) = ((1 − µρ)q, q) are given by Ae = w` − p[(1 − µρ)q + e], while Au = p(µρq − e)
are those of an unemployed worker. Let U(q) denote the value of the household’s objective
function when choosing such a zero-profit pooling contract.
Lemma B.10. If U(q) is strictly decreasing in q whenever Ae > Au , then a pooling equilib-
rium does not exist.
Proof. Note first that if Ae ≤ Au , then being unemployed is always strictly preferred to
being employed by participant households, so that this cannot represent an equilibrium.
Furthermore, as argued above, we must have q ≥ 0 in any pooling equilibrium. Thus,
suppose Ae > Au and q > 0. We show that such a q cannot represent an equilibrium. To
see this, let (h0 , q 0 ) denote an alternative contract with 0 < q 0 < q and h0 = (1 − µρ)q 0 . Since
U is strictly decreasing in q, this contract is strictly preferred by participant households.
Furthermore, since non-participant households would get net payment µρ(q 0 − q) < 0 from
deviating to this new contract, only participant households would deviate to it, and therefore
the expected profit to an insurer offering it would be (1 − ρ)µq 0 > 0. Thus, this deviation is
mutually beneficial for participants and insurers, and so q cannot be an equilibrium.
  38
      Technically, agents are always indifferent between not purchasing a contract and purchasing the contract
(0, 0). For ease of terminology, we will assume that the contract (0, 0) does not exist.


                                                     47
Lemma B.11. If ρ < 1/(1 + τ ), then there is no equilibrium in which an insurance contract
is purchased by participant households.
Proof. Note that U(q) is continuous, with
                      U 0 (q) = pµ [(1 − µ)ρV 0 (Au ) − (1 − µρ)V 0 (Ae )]
wherever this derivative exists (i.e., whenever Ae Au 6= 0). If Ae Au > 0, then V 0 (Ae ) =
V 0 (Au ), and therefore U 0 (q) = −pµ(1 − ρ)V 0 (Ae ) < 0. Suppose on the other hand that
Ae Au < 0. If in addition Ae > Au , we must have Au < 0 < Ae , and therefore U 0 (q) =
−pvµ{1−ρ[1+τ (1−µ)]}. Since ρ < 1/(1+τ ), it follows that U 0 (q) < 0. Thus, U(q) is strictly
decreasing whenever Ae > Au , and therefore by Lemma B.10, no pooling equilibrium exists.
Since, by Lemma B.9, there does not exist a separating equilibrium either, no equilibrium
exists.

Proof of Proposition 8
We may re-write the equilibrium condition (15) as
                                  U 0 (X + e − Gw ) = Q(e)                                  (B.8)
where Q(e) is as defined in equation (14).
    That non-wasteful government purchases have no effect on economic activity can be seen
directly from the fact that Gn does not appear in equation (B.8). Totally differentiating
equation (B.8) with respect to Gw , we obtain
                               de     −U 00 (X + e − Gw )
                                  = 0
                              dGw  Q (e) − U 00 (X + e − Gw )
Under the assumption that τ < τ̄ , the denominator of this expression is positive, and thus
de/dGw > 0. Further, if the economy is in the unemployment regime, then Q0 (e) < 0 and
therefore de/dGw > 1, while if the economy is in the unemployment regime, then Q0 (e) > 0
and therefore de/dGw < 1, which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 9
First, note that a balanced budget requires that employed workers be taxed (Gn + Gw )/µ.
Letting ep = e − Gn − Gw denote private expenditures, we may therefore obtain welfare as
a function of X, Gn and Gw as

where as before L? ≡ ν 0 (`? )`? − ν(`? ). Taking derivatives with respect to Gw and applying
the envelope theorem, we may obtain that
                                       ν 0 (`? )
                                                  0 ?                      

                                              48
Meanwhile, differentiating (B.9) with respect to X, applying the envelope theorem and using
the equilibrium condition U 0 (X + ep + Gn ) = Q(ep + Gn + Gw ), we may obtain that
                                                                            −1

                                                                         dµ

      ν 0 (`? )           ν (` )                  F (` )                dX
We may also obtain from the equilibrium condition that dµ/dGw = −dµ/dX. Substituting
this and (B.11) into (B.10), we may obtain
                                         ν 0 (`? )
                       U3 (X, Gn , Gw ) = 0 ? (1 − µ)τ − U1 (X, Gn , Gw )
                                         F (` )
Since the first term on the left-hand side is positive, if X is in the range such that U1 (X, Gn , Gw ) <
0, then we necessarily have U3 (X, Gn , Gw ) > 0, which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 10
The following result will be useful.
                 g
Lemma B.12. Let EXM denote the elasticity of substitution between X and M embodied in
g. Then
                           g      gX (X, M)gM (X, M)
                         EXM   =                                              (B.12)
                                  gXM (X, M)g(X, M)
Proof. Letting H k denote homogeneity of degree k, note first that, since g is H 1 , for a, b ∈
{X, M}, ga is H 0 and gab is H −1 .
   Next, by definition, we have
                                                               −1

                          M [gXM (X, M)gM (X, M) − gX (X, M)gMM (X, M)]
where the last line follows from H 0 of ga and H −1 of gab . Adding and subtracting gXM (X, M)gX (X, M)X
in the denominator and grouping terms yields
 g                                    gX (X, M)gM (X, M)
EXM =
        gXM (X, M) [gX (X, M)X + gM (X, M)M] − gX (X, M) [gXM (X, M)X + gMM (X, M)M]
The first bracketed term in the denominator equals g(X, M) by H 1 of g, while the second
bracketed term equals 0 by H 0 of gM , and thus equation (B.12) follows.

                                                 49
   Next, let W (X, M) ≡ U (g(X, M)). Then the equilibrium condition (16) can be written

                                   WM (X, M) = Q(M)                                   (B.13)

Note that

            WMM (X, M) = [gM (X, M)]2 U 00 (g(X, M)) + gMM U 0 (g(X, M)) < 0

so that the left-hand side of equation (B.13) is strictly decreasing in M. To ensure the
existence of an equilibrium with M > 0, we assume that WM (X, 0) > Q(0). We further
assume that gMMM (X, M) ≥ 0, which ensures that QMMM > 0, and therefore, similar to
in the durable-goods model, there are at most three equilibria: at most two in the unemploy-
ment regime, and at most one in the full-employment regime. Additional conditions under
which we can ensure that there exists a unique equilibrium are similar in flavor to in the
durable-goods case, though less easily characterized explicitly. We henceforth simply assume
conditions are such that the equilibrium is unique, and note that this implies that

                                  WMM (X, M) < Q0 (M)                                 (B.14)

at the equilibrium value of M. Define also

                                       Q     Q0 (M)M
                                      EM ≡
                                              Q(M)

as the elasticity of Q with respect to M.

Proof. Totally differentiating the equilibrium condition (B.13) with respect to X yields that

                              dM      WXM (X, M)
                                 = 0                                                  (B.16)
                              dX  Q (M) − WMM (X, M)

Doing the same with the equilibrium condition c = g(X, M) yields

            dc                         dM
               = gX (X, M) + gM (X, M)

                                   Q0 (M) − WMM (X, M)

where the second line has used (B.16). By (B.14), the denominator is positive, so that this
expression is of the same sign as the numerator. Substituting in for WMM and WXM and
using the equilibrium condition (B.13), we may obtain that dc/dX < 0 if and only if

                                             50
The term in square brackets, meanwhile, can be written as

gXM (X, M) [gX (X, M)X + gM (X, M)M] − gX (X, M) [gXM (X, M)X + gMM (X, M)M]
                             gX (X, M)gM (X, M)M

By H 0 of gM , the second term in the numerator equals zero, and thus by H 1 of g, we have
that
                  gXM (X, M) gMM (X, M)           gXM (X, M)g(X, M)
                              −               =
                   gX (X, M)      gM (X, M)     gX (X, M)gM (X, M)M
Substituting this into (B.17) and using (B.12) yields (B.15).
                                                       Q                             g
    If the economy is in the full-employment regime, EM   > 0 and therefore, since EXM    >
0, condition (B.15) cannot hold. Thus, from Lemma B.13, if the economy is in the full-
employment regime, dc/dX > 0. If instead the economy is in the unemployment regime,
        Q                                                          g
then EM   < 0, and therefore condition (B.15) can hold as long as EXM is sufficiently large,
which completes the proof of the proposition.

Proof of Proposition 11
Let y = g(X1 , M) denote output of the final good in the first period. Furthermore, let
B(X2 ) ≡ U 0−1 (R(X2 )) + X2 denote the total resources (output plus undepreciated first-
period capital) that would be required for the choice X2 to satisfy the constraints (17) and
(18) as well as the intertemporal optimality condition (20), and note that

                                               R0 (X2 )
                                 B 0 (X2 ) =            +1>1                         (B.18)
                                               U 00 (c)

where the inequality follows from the assumption made that R0 (X2 ) < 0. Since total re-
sources actually available are (1−δ)X1 +g(X1 , M), we have X2 = B −1 ((1−δ)X1 +g(X1 , M)),
and therefore from condition (19) equilibrium can be characterized by a solution to

                                    G(X1 , M) = Q(M)                                 (B.19)

for M, where G(X, M) ≡ gM (X, M)R(B −1 ((1 − δ)X + g(X, M))). Note that

                                                R0 (X2 ) [gM (X1 , M)]2
             GM (X1 , M) = gMM (X1 , M)R(X2 ) +                         <0
                                                        B 0 (X2 )

Similar to in the static case, we assume that G(X, 0) > Q(0) so that there is an equilibrium
with M > 0, and further, conditions are such that this equilibrium is unique, which implies
that
                                    GM (X1 , M) < Q0 (M)                              (B.20)
at the equilibrium value of M.

Lemma B.14. If dX2 /dX1 < 0 then dc/dX1 < 0 and di/dX1 < 0.



                                                51
Proof. Since in equilibrium c + X2 = B(X2 ), we have that
                                    dc                   dX2
                                       = [B 0 (X2 ) − 1]
                                   dX1                   dX1
Since B 0 (X2 ) > 1, if dX2 /dX1 < 0 then dc/dX1 < 0. Further, if X2 falls when X1 rises, from
the capital accumulation equation (17) we see that i must also fall.

Proof. Totally differentiating the equilibrium condition (B.19) with respect to X1 yields that
                                dM       GX (X1 , M)
                                    = 0                                                 (B.22)
                                dX1  Q (M) − GM (X1 , M)
Doing the same with y = g(X, M) yields

                                = gX (X1 , M) + gM (X1 , M)                             (B.23)

while differentiating X2 = B −1 ((1 − δ)X1 + g(X1 , M)) yields

                                    B 0 (X2 ) [Q0 (M) − GM (X1 , M)]
where the second line has used equations (B.22) and (B.23). Since the denominator of this
expression is positive by (B.18) and (B.20), the sign of dX2 /dX1 is given by the sign of the
numerator. Substituting in for GM and GX and using (B.19), some algebra yields that this
expression is negative if and only if condition (B.21) holds.
    Lemmas B.14 and B.15 together indicate that dc/dX1 < 0 and di/dX1 < 0 both hold if
and only if condition (B.21) holds. Further, for a given equilibrium level of M, it is clear
                             g
that the minimum level of EXM     needed to satisfy (B.21) is (weakly) greater than that needed
to satisfy (B.15) in the static case.

Proof of Proposition 12
It can be verified that the steady-state level of purchases e solves

Lemma B.16. For δ sufficiently small, a steady state exists and is unique.

Proof. Similar to in the static case, we may express individual j’s optimal choice of steady-
state expenditure ej given aggregate steady-state expenditure e as

                                               δ
                                   ej (e) =       U 0−1 (ζQ(e))
                                              δ+γ

As before, we can verify that e0j (e) < 0 for e > e? , while e0j (e) > 0 and e00j (e) > 0 for
e < e? . Thus, an equilibrium necessarily exists and is unique if e0j (e) < 1 for e < e? , which is
equivalent to the condition that lime↑e? e0j (e) < 1. This is in turn equivalent to the condition
τ < τe, where                                0 ?  0 ?
                                                          F (` ) [F (`? ) − Φ]
                                    

                    τe ≡ −      U U            ζ 0 ?                                        (B.25)

As δ → 0, τe approaches infinity, and thus it will hold for any τ , which completes the
proof.
   Note for future reference that if e0j (e) < 1 then

                                  (δ + γ)U 00 (X + e) < δζQ0 (e)                            (B.26)

Lemma B.17. For δ sufficiently small, there exists a steady state in the unemployment
regime.

Proof. Since U 0 (0) > Q(0) by assumption, we also have U 0 (0) > ζQ(0). Thus, if
                                              
                                     0   δ+γ ?
                                   U        e < ζQ(e? )
                                          δ

then by the intermediate value theorem, equation B.24 holds for at least one value of e < e? .
Note that
                                           δ+γ ?
                                       lim    e =∞
                                       δ→0  δ
and limδ→0 ζt = (1 − β)/(1 − β + βγ) > 0. Thus, since limc→∞ U 0 (c) ≤ 0 by assumption, it
follows that                               
                                  0   δ+γ ?
                            lim U          e ≤ 0 < lim ζZ (e? )
                            δ→0          δ          δ→0

and thus the desired property holds for δ close enough to zero.
   Lemmas B.16 and B.17 together prove the proposition.

where aeX and aee are the coefficients on X̂t and êt in the expression for êt+1 . The eigenvalues

                              1 − δ + aee − (1 − δ + aee )2 − 4β −1

                                                   2
                                              p
                               1 − δ + aee + (1 − δ + aee )2 − 4β −1
                        λ2 ≡
                                                   2
We may obtain that
                                        λ1 λ2 = β −1 > 1                                     (B.27)
so that |λi | > 1 for at least one i ∈ {1, 2}. Thus, this system cannot exhibit local indetermi-
nacy (see, e.g., Blanchard and Kahn (1980)), which completes the proof.

Proof of Proposition 14
Note for future reference that (B.27) implies that if the eigenvalues are real then they are of
the same sign, with λ2 > λ1 .
Lemma B.18. The system is saddle-path stable if and only if
                                                                  1+β
                                            |1 − δ + aee | >                                    (B.28)
                                                                   β
in which case the eigenvalues are real and of the same sign as 1 − δ + aee .
Proof. To see the “if” part, suppose (B.28) holds, and note that this implies
                                                    2
                                                1+β
                                           2
                             (1 − δ + aee ) >           > 4β −1
                                                 β

and therefore the eigenvalues are real. If 1 − δ + aee > (1 + β)/β, then this implies that
λ2 > λ1 > 0, and therefore the system is stable as long as λ1 < 1, which is equivalent to the
condition                                   p
                        (1 − δ + aee ) − 2 < (1 − δ + aee )2 − 4β −1                  (B.29)
Since 1 − δ + aee > (1 + β)/β > 2, both sides of this inequality are positive, and therefore,
squaring both sides and rearranging, it is equivalent to
                                                                  1+β
                                             1 − δ + aee >                                      (B.30)
                                                                   β

                                                             54
which holds by hypothesis. A similar argument can be used to establish the claim for the
case that −(1 − δ + aee ) > (1 + β)/β.
    To see the “only if” part, suppose the system is stable. If the eigenvalues had non-zero
complex part, then |λ1 | = |λ2 | > 1, in which case the system would be unstable. Thus, the
eigenvalues must be real, i.e., (1 − δ + aee )2 > 4β −1 , which in turn implies that
                                                       p
                                    |1 − δ + aee | > 2 β −1
                  p
If 1 − δ + aee > 2 β −1 , then, reasoning as before, λ2 >p   λ1 > 0, and therefore if the system
is stable then (B.29) must hold. Since (1 − δ + aee ) > 2 β −1 > 2, then again both sides of
(B.29) are positive, and thus that inequality is equivalent to (B.30), which in turn  p implies
(B.28). Similar arguments establish (B.28) for the case where −(1 − δ + aee ) > 2 β −1 .
Lemma B.19. The system is saddle-path stable with positive eigenvalues if and only if
                              (1 − δ − γ)U 00 (X + e) < (1 − δ)Q0 (e)                         (B.31)
Proof. Note that the system is stable with positive eigenvalues if and only if (B.30) holds.
We have that
                        1+β      [1 − β(1 − δ − γ)][δζQ0 (e) − (δ + γ)U 00 (X + e)]
          1 − δ + aee −       =
                          β          β[(1 − δ)Q0 (e) − (1 − δ − γ)U 00 (X + e)]
Since the numerator is positive by (B.26), inequality (B.30) holds if and only if (B.31)
holds.

                                        

then the system is saddle-path stable with positive eigenvalues.
Proof. Note that condition (B.31) always holds around a full-employment steady state. If
the steady state is in the unemployment regime, then it can be verified that condition (B.31)
holds if and only if
                                              δ     1−δ−γ
                                  e0j (e) <       ζ           ∈ (0, 1)
                                            δ+γ      1−δ
where ej (e) is as defined in Lemma B.16. As before, this condition holds for all e if it holds
for lime↑e? e0j (e), which it can be verified is equivalent to the condition τ < τe? . Note also that
τe? < τe, where τe was defined in equation (B.25), so that this condition is strictly stronger
than the one required to ensure the existence of a unique steady state.
   Lemmas B.19 and B.20 together establish that, for τ sufficiently small (e.g., τ < τe? ), the
system converges monotonicaly to the steady state. It remains to show that consumption is
decreasing in the stock of durables. Assuming τ is sufficiently small so that the system is
saddle-path stable with positive eigenvalues, it is straightforward to obtain the solution
                                            X̂t = λt1 X̂0
                                             êt = ψ X̂t
                                          ĉt = (1 + ψ) X̂t

                                                 55
where ψ ≡ −(1 − δ − λ1 )/γ. Thus, consumption is decreasing in the stock of durables if and
only if ψ < −1.
Proposition 17. If (B.31) holds and the steady state is in the unemployment regime, then
ψ < −1.
Proof. We may write
  1 − δ − γ − λ1
           p
             [aee + 2γ − (1 − δ)]2 + 4β −1 [β(1 − δ − γ)(aee + γ) − 1] − [aee + 2γ − (1 − δ)]
        =
                                                    2
Now, aee + 2γ − (1 − δ) > aee − (1 − δ) > 0, so that 1 − δ − γ − λ1 is positive if and only if
β(1 − δ − γ)(aee + γ) > 1. We have
                                          [1 + βγ(1 − δ)]Q0 (e) − U 00 (X + e)
                  β(1 − δ − γ)(aee + γ) =           
                                                1−δ
                                               1−δ−γ
                                                       Q0 (e) − U 00 (X + e)
Note by earlier assumptions that this expression is strictly positive, and that
                   1−δ                        1 − β(1 − δ)(1 − δ − γ)
                        − [1 + βγ(1 − δ)] = γ                         >0
                  1−δ−γ                              1−δ−γ
Thus, if Q0 (e) < 0 (i.e., the steady state is in the unemployment regime) then β(1 − δ −
γ)(aee + γ) > 1, in which case 1 − δ − γ − λ1 > 0 and therefore ψ < −1.

Proof of Proposition 15
Without loss of generality, assume the alternative path begins at t = 0, and let eet (∆) ≡
e + ∆ · t denote the alternative feasible path of expenditures, where t is the change in
the path of expenditures, and ∆ is a perturbation parameter, which is equal to zero in the
steady-state equilibrium and equal to one for the alternative path. Let X        et (∆) denote the
associated path for the stock of durables, and note that X0 (∆) = X, i.e., this alternative
                                                             e
path does not affect the initial stock of durables. Welfare can then be written as a function
of ∆ as
            ∞     
                      et (∆) + eet (∆)) + eet (∆) [−ν(`? ) + V (w? `? − p? eet (∆))]

  U(∆) =       β U (X
           t=0

                                                                                            
                                                                      eet (∆)           ?
                                                           + 1 − 0 ? ? V (−p eet (∆))

From the envelope theorem, beginning from the steady state path (i.e., ∆ = 0), for a marginal
change in ∆ the net effect on welfare through the resulting changes in U and V in each period
is zero. Thus, we need only consider effects that occur through changes in the employment
rate term, eet (∆)/[F 0 (`? )`? ]. A first-order approximation to U(1) around U(0) is therefore
given by
                                                                   ∞

Substituting in ee0t (0) = t , the desired result obtains.

                                                  56
Proof of Proposition 16
Let eet () and X et () denote alternative paths for expenditure and the stock of durables, with
eet () ≡ e(X                 et+1 () = (1 − δ)X
             et ()) + t and X                 et () + γe
                                                          et (). Here, e(·) is the equilibrium policy
function for expenditures, while 0 =  and t = 0 for t ≥ 1. Letting U(X0 , ) denote the
corresponding welfare as a function of X0 and , we may write a second-order approximation
to this function around (X0 , ) = (X, 0) as
                                                        1h                   i
                 U(X0 , ) ≈ U(X, 0) + UX X̂0 + U  +     UXX X̂02 + U 2 + UX X̂0 
                                                        2
where variables with hats indicate deviations from steady state and partial derivatives of U
are evaluated at the point (X0 , ) = (X, 0). Clearly, to a second-order approximation, the
welfare effect of a temporary stimulus is smaller when the economy is in a liquidation phase
if and only if UX < 0.
    Next, using the envelope condition as in the proof of Proposition 15, it is straightforward
to obtain that                             ∞

where Xt (X0 ) indicates the equilibrium value of Xt given X0 . Taking the derivative of this
expression with respect to X0 and evaluating at X0 = X yields
                                        1       ν 0 (`? ) 1 − βλ1 (1 − δ)

where ψ ≡ e0 (X) < 0, which was computed above, and Ξ is some strictly positive number.
Since λ1 < 1, the first term on the right-hand side of this expression is clearly negative. Thus,
there is a strictly positive number ξ such that if e00 (X) < ξ we will have UX (X, 0) < 0, which
is the desired result.
    Letting χ(Xt ) denote the equilibrium value of Xt+1 given Xt , we may re-express the
equilibrium equations governing the dynamics of the system (i.e., equations (21) and (22))
as
                                  χ(Xt ) = (1 − δ)Xt + γe(Xt )

                                                   57
and

  U 0 (Xt + e(Xt )) − Q(e(Xt )) = β [(1 − δ − γ)U 0 (χ(Xt ) + e(χ(Xt ))) − (1 − δ)Q(e(χ(Xt )))]

Taking derivatives of both sides of these equations twice with respect to Xt , evaluating
at Xt = X and solving for e00 (X), we may obtain that e00 (X) = bU 000 (X + e), where b is
some number that does not depend on U 000 (X + e). Thus, if U 000 is sufficiently close to zero,
e00 (X) < ξ and the desired result holds.


C       Introducing Nash bargaining
Here we consider the static model of section 3 and replace the “competitive” determination
of w and ` within a match by Nash bargaining.
    The gain from a match for a firm is pF (`) − w` while outside option is zero. The gain for
the household is −ν(`) + V (w` − p(c − X) while the outside option is V (−p(c − X)). Using
the piecewise linear specification for V , the Nash-Bargaining criterion W is:
                                 ψ                            ψ
                   W = pF (`) − w`     − ν(`) + vw` + vτ p(c − X)

Maximizing W w.r.t. ` and w gives the following F.O.C.:
                                                                          
            ψW          0                       (1 − ψ)W                 0
                     pF (`) − w    =                               vw − ν (`)
        pF (`) − w`                    −ν(`) + vw` + vτ p(c − X)
                          ψW                    (1 − ψ)W
                                   =                             v
                      pF (`) − w`      −ν(`) + vw` + vτ p(c − X)

Rearranging gives the two equations

                     vpF 0 (`) = ν 0 (`)
                        vw` = (1 − ψ)vpF (`) + ψν(`) − ψvτ p(c − X)

Assuming that the matching function is “min”, the equilibrium is given by the five following
equations:

                   min{N, L}F (`) = L(c − X) + N Φ                                      (C.4)

Main difference with the model of the main text is that (C.11) does not determine ` inde-
pendently of (C.9) and (C.10). But it is still the case that, assuming ` is fixed, (C.9) implies
that if N is high, c will be high and (C.10) implies that if c is high, N will be high. As far
as (C.11) implies that ` does not vary too much, subsequent results of section 3 hold. This
can be illustrated with a numerical example that reproduces Figures 3, 4 and 5.
                                             `1+ω
    Consider the functional forms ν(`) = ν11+ω    , F (`) = θ1 A`α , u(c) = ln c, V (a) is ν2 /θ2 if
a ≥ 0 and (1 + τ )ν2 /θ2 if a < 0. Common parameters values are ψ = .5, ω = 1.2, ν1 = .5,
α = .67, A = 1, Φ = .35, L = 1. Solving for the equilibrium in such a case produce Figures
9, 10 and 11, which are qualitatively similar to Figures 3, 4 and 5.

D       Noise shock extension
For the extension discussed at the end of Section 5.2, we re-introduce the first-sub-period (θ)
and second-sub-period (θ) e productivity factors to the model, and assume that θet = θt . We
assume that the economy is always in the unemployment regime, and that all agents come
into the first sub-period of period t with the same belief about the value of θt , but that after
the household splits to go to market, the true value is revealed to the workers and firms,
while the shoppers retain their initial belief.
    To abstract from issues relating to uncertainty about the true value of θt , we assume
that all agents are subjectively certain – though possibly incorrect – about the entire stream
of productivity values θt , only updating such a belief if they receive some information that
contradicts it. One may verify that, in the unemployment regime, shoppers’ prior beliefs
are never contradicted until re-uniting with the workers after making their purchases. We
denote agents’ belief about θt at the beginning of date s by θ̄t|s
    In the example constructed, we assume that productivity is constant at θt = 1 for all
t ∈ Z, but that at the beginning of t = 0, agents receive information such that θ̄t|0 = θ > 1
for all t ≥ 0, i.e., that productivity has risen permanently. After the households split,
workers and firms learn that in fact productivity has not changed, nor will it in the future.
Shoppers do not receive this information until after making their purchases, so that for one
shopping period they are overly optimistic. In all subsequent periods s ≥ 1, however, we
have θ̄t|s = θt = 1.
