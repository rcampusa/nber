                                           ABSTRACT

Using time-diary data from four countries we show that the unemployed spend most of the time not
working for pay in additional leisure and personal maintenance, not in increased household production.
There is no relation between unemployment duration and the split of time between household production
and leisure. U.S. data for 2003-2006 show that almost none of the lower amount of market work in
areas of long-term high unemployment is offset by additional household production. In contrast, in
those areas where unemployment has risen cyclically reduced market work is made up almost entirely
by additional time spent in household production.

I. Introduction—the Problem

    Over the past two decades research in macroeconomics has occasionally gone beyond

the dichotomy between market work and all other time (usually called leisure) to consider

how the trichotomy—market work, household production and all remaining time—might

inform the modeling of macroeconomic fluctuations. Among the leading studies in

modeling this problem have been Greenwood and Hercowitz (1991) and Greenwood et al

(1995); and others (Baxter and Jermann, 1999) have linked it to permanent-income

explanations of cyclical fluctuations in consumption. In terms of unemployment policy

the very simple question is whether household production is readily substitutable for

market production. If this is the case, a cyclical reduction in the latter generates little or

no loss in total output, measured broadly to include non-market activities, and would

imply small welfare costs of cyclical reductions in market output.1 This could be true

even if the aggregate intertemporal elasticity of labor supply were not very large.

    Given the data that were available until recently, the theoretical literature had to rely

on very sparse information to draw its conclusions. The bases for the literature and our

views on this question have been attempts to estimate substitution elasticities between

market and household production. The underlying data have either been from the Panel

Study of Income Dynamics (Benhabib et al, 1991) or from time-diary surveys (Rupert et

al, 2000). The former data set only contained information on time spent on child-care

and some house-keeping chores. The time diaries in the latter data sets were very few in

number.      Moreover, no study has examined how unemployment, both long-term

differences and cyclical fluctuations, affects the split among market work, household

1
 While there are claims (Freeman and Schettkat, 2005) using population averages that most differences in
the average amount of market work between countries generate offsetting differences in non-market work,
more detailed evidence (Burda et al, 2008) refutes this.
production and other uses of time in an entire labor market; and even the simpler and not

directly relevant question, how the employed and unemployed differ in their use of time,

has received little attention.2

    Our purpose here is take advantage of a new set of data to provide information on this

crucial issue that could not heretofore have been considered in this way. While we do

offer a brief interpretation of the simple evidence that we provide, our main goal is to

present these new facts as a challenge to refine and restrict the scope of models

admissible for explaining employment and output over the business cycle.

II. The Facts on Time Use and Unemployment

    A. Unemployment Levels and the Mix of Work

    Time-diary studies, which have become increasingly widespread, ask the respondent

to keep a comprehensive diary of activities showing what s/he was doing at each moment

of the previous day. In the diaries used here the individual noted the activity, either

begun at a specific time or occurring during a short time interval, which was then

classified into a set of categories defined by the survey agency. Throughout this Section

we use 2003-2006 data from the United States, which offers the only frequently collected

set of time diaries in its American Time Use Survey (ATUS) (see Hamermesh et al,

2005). Because this data set is very large and contains detailed geographic information, it

allows us to go beyond an examination of the differences in time use between employed

and unemployed individuals to study how differences in long-term unemployment across

labor markets, and cyclical shocks to labor markets, affect time use. In the initial

examination, of differences in time use of the employed and unemployed, we also use

See, however, Ahn et al (2005), using time-diary data for Spain, and Gronau (2006), using recall data for
Russia, for evidence related to this last question.

                                                                                                            2
data from: Australia, 1992 (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1993); Italy, 2002 (ISTAT,

2005); and Germany, 2001/02 (Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und

Jugend, 2005). The Australian and German studies obtained data from individuals on two

or more days, so that potential problems induced by observing people on atypical days

are reduced.

    To begin examining these data we define the concepts market work and household

production. Because we use data sets from four different countries in the first part of the

analysis, the definition cannot be uniform—each country classifies activities somewhat

differently. Indeed, that is the best justification for using several countries’ data: The

idiosyncrasies of each country’s choices about how to classify time use and the need for

aggregation of what are in each case over 200 individual types of activities require where

at all possible that we use many data sets if we are to claim that we have demonstrated a

general fact.3 In general we follow standard practice and define market work as time

spent for pay (or in unpaid household production for the market). We count as household

production those activities that satisfy the third-party rule (Reid, 1934) that substituting

market goods and services for one’s own time is possible. Such activities have the

common characteristics that we could pay somebody to perform them for us and that we

are not paid for performing them for ourselves. The Appendix lists the choices we have

made in categorizing activities in each data set.

    As a first cut at the question of how unemployment alters the mix of market work and

household production, Table 1 presents the average time spent on these two aggregates of




3
An alternative when using only one country’s data, as in Aguiar and Hurst (2007), is to experiment with a
wide variety of definitions of the important aggregates.


                                                                                                        3
activities for each of the four countries.4 The means and their standard errors are listed

for all respondents ages 15 through 59, and separately for men and women. We restrict

the analysis to this age range to mitigate effects that may be induced by retirement

incentives.     The results indicate that each hour of market time not worked by an

unemployed individual corresponds to only 16 (60 x 0.27) minutes of additional

household production. Even the largest extra household production observed among the

unemployed, performed by German women, represents only 52 percent of the difference

in time spent in market work between them and those German women who report

themselves employed.

    One might be concerned that differences in time use between the employed and the

unemployed arise from differences in underlying demographic characteristics.                              To

examine this possibility we estimate regressions “explaining” time spent in market work

and in household production. For each country and, again, separately by gender, we add

controls for age, educational attainment and the numbers of children present, plus other

variables as they are available in the individual data sets. Evidently, the conclusions from

Table 1 are robust to conditioning on other observables: The parameter estimate on the

indicator for unemployment status in the equation describing household production

ranges from 12 to 51 percent of its size in the equation describing market work. Even

adjusting for personal characteristics it is reasonable to conclude that most of the lesser

market work among the unemployed in the data sets that we use is not compensated by

increased household production.

 In all tables presented in this section the data are weighted by the sampling weights provided in the data
set.

                                                                                                              4
   Despite these results it would be premature to conclude that most of the time released

from market work due to unemployment is accounted for by leisure—it may be that the

unemployed are unobservably different from the employed. Nor do our results address

the role of cyclical unemployment on the amount of total work. One cannot use cross-

sectional differences between the unemployed and the employed to draw conclusions

about the impact of cyclical changes on an entire labor market. Instead, to answer the

macroeconomic question one needs to examine how the degree of slack affects all

individuals in that market—the unemployed, the employed and non-labor-force

participants. Only with the creation and continuation of the ATUS has this become

possible.

   We use the Current Population Survey (CPS-MORG) for each year 2003-2006 to

calculate unemployment rates for use in inferring the impacts of unemployment on time

use. In the first column of Table 3 we present the current unemployment rate averaged

across all ATUS respondents aged 15-59 and resident in the 107 metropolitan areas in

which there were more than 500 respondents in the CPS-MORG in a particular year. As

the data show, there is substantial cross-sectional geographic variation in unemployment

rates in these data. Column (2) of the Table presents unemployment rates in these same

areas averaged over the current and the preceding five years, which might be interpreted

as measuring long-run unemployment across labor markets. Not surprisingly, the cross-

section variation in these long-run rates is below that in the annual rates of

unemployment, although there is still substantial geographic variation. The final column

of the Table presents the unemployment shock—the difference between the current

year’s unemployment rate and the unemployment rate averaged over the previous five




                                                                                       5
years. We interpret this as the cyclical shock to the labor market in the area; and here too

we observe substantial geographic variation.

   In Table 4 we examine how time use is related to unemployment in the labor market

where the individual resides.      As before, we divide total time into market work,

household production, and the excluded category, all other uses of time, for all

individuals ages 15-59 in the ATUS 2003-06.            We linked the records of ATUS

respondents to the long-term and current unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas in

which they reside. Each regression also includes a wide variety of demographic controls

describing the individual. The upper panel of the table shows the results for the long-term

(six-year) average unemployment rate. As expected, higher average unemployment in an

area is associated with less market work: Each one percentage-point increase in

unemployment is associated with the average person working 3.3 fewer minutes per day

in the market. Full-time workers work about 300 minutes in the market on the average

day, so that this decline is quite consistent with the expected difference that would occur

mechanically where unemployment is higher.

   As the results in the top panel of Table 4 show, there is almost no response of

household production to higher long-term unemployment in a labor market. Indeed, the

parameter estimate is unexpectedly negative, implying that where unemployment has

been higher for a long time people engage in slightly less household production. Given

the size of the effect and its statistical insignificance, the appropriate conclusion here is

that the long-term differences in market work generated by long-term differences in

unemployment are not accompanied by any offsetting differences in household

production. These results corroborate and strengthen the results in Tables 1 and 2

comparing employed and unemployed individuals.


                                                                                           6
    The middle panel presents estimates for the same regressions, but with the current

unemployment rate substituted for the long-term unemployment rate.5 Here we see that,

as with long-term unemployment, market-wide increases are associated with reductions

in market time for the typical individual, with the effect almost identical to that of

differences in long-term unemployment across areas.                     For household production,

however, the results are totally changed:                  Each one-percentage-point shock to

unemployment increases the average adult’s household production by 2.5 minutes, an

increase that is not significantly different from the negative of the effect on market work.

The point estimates suggest that a one-hour decline in market-based production

associated with cyclical increases in unemployment is matched by an increase in

household production of 46 minutes; and we cannot reject the hypothesis that the offset is

one-for-one.

    In the bottom panel of the Table we include both the lagged five-year average rate of

unemployment in each area and its current value.                    Our estimates corroborate the

inferences drawn above: Higher long-term unemployment is associated with both less

market work in an area and less household production.                     Areas of long-term high

unemployment are those where the average individual has chosen to spend more time on

personal activities and in leisure. When unemployment is temporarily higher, however,

the resulting reduction in market work at the individual level is associated with increased

household production, with no increase in personal activities or leisure. Evidently,

permanent and temporary differences in local employment conditions evoke strikingly

different responses in household behavior.

 We could just as easily have included the shock to unemployment, since it is calculated as the difference
between current and long-term unemployment. The conclusions from equations using any two of the three
measures would be the same as those based on the results in Table 4.

                                                                                                        7
   B. Time Use and the Duration of Unemployment

   We can shed additional light on the relationship between unemployment and patterns

of household production by examining patterns of time use among the unemployed

distinguished by the duration of their spells of unemployment. We stress that we are

unable to hold constant those unobservable characteristics likely to affect the duration

dependence of spells of unemployment (Katz and Meyer, 1990); all we can do is ask

whether workers with longer spells of unemployment use time differently from those

with shorter spells.   One possibility is that individuals engaged in market work

accumulate a stock of unfinished home projects that cannot be completed on weekends or

during off-work hours. Early in a spell of unemployment the unemployed worker would

use the extra time to engage in the household production that was postponed while

working for pay, but that as an unemployment spell lengthens more non-market time

would be used as (unwanted) leisure.        This would suggest that the burden of

unemployment rises with the duration of unemployment spell (as argued by Hurd, 1980).

Alternatively, individual households evidence non-separability of the utility of leisure

over time, as proposed by Kydland and Prescott (1982). People would then use short

periods of unemployment to relax from the stresses of any kind of work, and only later

begin to substitute household production for the market work in which they are no longer

engaged.

   To examine this issue we take all the individuals in the ATUS who report being

unemployed on the diary day.       We assume that those who stated that they were

unemployed and who reported unemployment in the eighth (their final) month in the CPS

(two to five months before the diary day) have unemployment duration equal to the

duration reported in the CPS plus the interval between that eighth month and the diary


                                                                                      8
day. For those unemployed ATUS respondents who were not unemployed in their eighth

CPS month, we make two polar assumptions: 1) Maximum duration—all became

unemployed immediately after they were interviewed in their eighth CPS month, so that

their unemployment duration equals the interval between that interview and the ATUS

diary day; and 2) Minimum duration—all became unemployed on the diary day and have

an unemployment duration of zero.

   Table 5 shows the means of time use among the ATUS unemployed distinguished by

their duration of unemployment. There is no monotonic relationship between household

production and unemployment duration, although it is true (at least under the assumption

of maximum duration) that the long-term unemployed spend significantly more time in

household production than all those currently less far into their unemployment spells. A

similar conclusion can be drawn when comparing the long-term unemployed to those

ATUS respondents who became unemployed after their eighth CPS month (those with

minimum duration of 0-4 weeks).

   Even these small differences disappear when we estimate regressions of household

production on a large number of covariates and indicators of the duration of

unemployment, as shown in Table 6. None of the parameters on the duration indicators

has a t-statistic greater than one, and all are tiny in absolute value.   A reasonable

conclusion is that the time-diary data provide no evidence that the split of non-market

time use between household production and all other unpaid activities varies with

unemployment duration. Theories of labor supply based on non-separability of utility

over leisure across time periods appear of little use in explaining the intertemporal

behavior of leisure and household production. Similarly, the absence of any dependence




                                                                                      9
of household production on unemployment duration negates an “unfinished projects”

approach at the individual level.

III. An Interpretation

      We have demonstrated that the employed do not spend much less time in household

production than do observationally identical unemployed workers, so that the

unemployed engage in much less total work. Similarly, in geographic areas where

unemployment is consistently higher, the average individual spends less time in market

work and no more time in household production than counterparts in areas where

unemployment is consistently lower. In areas where unemployment has suddenly risen,

however, the average resident spends less time in market work, but offsets most of this

decline by an increase in time spent in household production rather than leisure or

personal maintenance.

      How can we rationalize the apparent absence of any effect of long-term differences

in unemployment on time spent in household production with the nearly complete offset

of lost market work by increased household production that occurs when an entire labor

market experiences a negative shock, presumably associated with a cyclical downturn?

One possibility is that they arise in a world in which there is easy short-run substitution

between market work and home production, yet where social norms about preferences for

work (market and household) and leisure differ geographically, possibly in ways which

are dependent on the past history of unemployment. No doubt a number of other theories

can also rationalize these quite surprising facts. The next step would be to test these

theories on the increasingly available and appropriate data that would allow

distinguishing among them.
