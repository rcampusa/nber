                   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Economic Growth


                                       ABSTRACT


      Early tax reform proposals listed economic growth as a major goal, and

some even gave explicit estimates of the expected increase in the long run

output path that would follow from enactment.        The 1986 Tax Act does not

mention growth, much less give estimates      of the expected increase, for good

reason.     The 1986 Tax Act will likely reduce the long-run output path by two to

four percent.

      A revenue-neutral tax reform that raises the standard deduction and

personal exemption    cannot, in general,   increase the bundle of goods one can

purchase with an additional hour worked.      Cuts in marginal personal tax rates

can be achieved by broadening the tax base and shifting the tax burden to

businesses.     However, while the after—tax wage will increase,      so will the

after—tax    cost of goods consumed, both currently and in the future, and thus

work effort is unlikely to rise.     Similarly,    a tax reform that shifts the tax

burden from labor and existing capital to new investments will likely lower

saving and reallocate capital away from industrial uses.         While the Tax Act

will increase the efficiency of business investment,         the potential efficiency

gains are so small that actual gains will be swamped by the direct effect of a

smaller business capital stock.

                   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and Economic Growth


                                Patric H. Hendershott


      Both economic and productivity growth declined sharply in the 19705.       For

the 1959-73 period, real output and productivity growth averaged over four and

two percent, respectively;    since 1973, each has been one and a half percentage

points less.1     Productivity growth has rebounded in recent years, but

substantial concern still exists regarding the long-run output path of the

United States' economy. Major tax reform has the potential to alter that path

significantly.

      In the long run, the growth rate of an economy is determined by the rates

of technological progress and of growth in labor supply.     These rates are

difficult to influence with tax policy.     In the short run, however, economic

growth depends on changes in both the capital/output ratio and the level of

work effort, variables that can be affected by tax policy.     Moreover,   a higher

growth rate for even a few years translates into a higher level of output, or

output path, over time.

      The 1986 Tax Act will have a negative impact on economic growth.      A

revenue-neutral tax reform that raises the standard deduction and personal

exemption cannot, in general, increase the bundle of goods one can purchase

with an additional hour worked.     Cuts in marginal personal tax rates can be

achieved by broadening the tax base and shifting the tax burden to businesses.

However,   while the after—tax wage will increase,   so will the after—tax cost of

goods consumed,    both currently and in the future, and thus work effort is

unlikely to rise.     Similarly, a tax reform that shifts the tax burden from

labor and existing capital to new investments will likely lower saving and

reallocate capital away from industrial uses.     While the Tax Act will increase
                                            —2—


the efficiency of business investment, the potential efficiency gains are so

small that actual gains will be swamped by the direct effect of a smaller

business capital stock.

        My analysis is divided into three basic parts and a conclusion.        The

basic parts discuss the likely impact of the 1986 Tax Act on work effort,

saving, and the quantity and quality of business investment.          I begin each pert

with an analysis of potential gains from tax changes and then examine the 1986

Tax Act.2    The conclusion summarizes the earlier analyses and briefly discusses

future policies to stimulate economic growth.


                          I.   Tax Reform and Labor Supply

        One touted benefit of tax reform is greater work effort in response to a

reduction in marginal tax rates on labor income.           While economists disagree on

many issues, there is substantial consensus that labor supply, especially that

of secondary workers, is highly responsive to increases in the return from

work.    Because greater labor supply expands national income, many advocated tax

reform on this basis.


                                    A.   Potential Gains

        A revenue-neutral, distributionally—neutral        tax reform can lower marginal

tax rates on labor income in just three ways:         by broadening the tax base, by

shifting thestatutory tax burden from households to businesses, or by reducing

the effective progressivity of the tax burden.         However, an increase in labor

supply is likely only if the tax rate reductions are achieved by reducing the

system's effective progressivity because only in this case will most workers be

able to purchase more goods for an extra hour of work (Browning and Browning,

1985, and Slemrod, 1987) .     In   the other two cases, the price of some goods, as

well as the after-tax wage rate, will rise, making an increase in the real

return from work uncertain.
                                              —3.-




      Base broadening consists of either taxing previously untaxed sources of

income or disallowing existing deductions.           If the previously untaxed sources

are labor income, including them in the tax base and using the revenues to

lower statutory tax rates doesn't lower effective marginal tax rates and won't

increase labor supply.      A change from a 50 percent tax rate applied to 50

percent of income to a 25 percent rate applied to all income reduces the

incentive to take income in the previously nontaxed form but shouldn't affect

labor supply.       In either case, 25 percent of a marginal dollar of income goes

to the Treasury and 75 percent is retained by the worker.

      Disallowing existing deductions or taxing previously untaxed capital

income and using the funds to lower tax rates also probably doesn't increase

labor supply.       The incentive to work depends on the amount of goods one can

purchase with an additional nour of work, not just the after-tax wage rate.

While a cut in marginal tax rates increases after-tax income from the hour of

work (and thus the reward in terms of goods not included in the base

broadening)   ,   disallowing   deductions   increases the 'after-tax" prices of goods

that were previously tax—favored, reducing the reward for work in terms of

these goods.       Thus the quantity of goods one can purchase with the greater

after-tax wage does not necessarily increase, and no increase in hours worked

should be expected.

      To see this point more clearly, consider some specific deductions.            The

largest is that for home mortgage interest.          The revenue raised from

disallowing this deduction would allow a significant reduction in marginal tax

rates and thus would increase the after—tax wage.          But the annual coat of

financing housing would rise from the after—tax mortgage rate, say three—

quarters of 10 percent, to the full before—tax rate, 10 percent in our example.
                                               —4—


Would people work herder in response to an increase in their after-tax marginal

wage rete, even though the cost of a major component of their consumption has

increased even more sharply?          Probably not.

      What about the deductibility of state and local income, sales or property

taxes?     First of all, loss of the state and local income tax deduction would

not necessarily permit lower marginal total tsx rates when federal, state and

local tsxes are considered.          For example, a 30 percent federal rate along with

a fully deductible 5 percent state rate gives a 33.5 percent total rate.

Removing the deductibility and lowering the federal rate to 28.5 would leave

the total rate unchanged.          Second, while loss of the sales tax deduction would

allow a reduction in marginal tax rates, for itemizers it would also raise the

effective price of goods subject to the tax (and for nonitemizers                it wouldn't

raise any revenue) .      Third,    loss of the property tax deduction would raise the

effective price of municipally—provided              services that property taxes finance.

Because the prices of some goods and services rise, even a higher marginal

after-tax wage rate need not trigger greater work effort.

         But what if lower household tax rates are achieved by shifting the tax

burden to business?       This doesn't change the argument because business taxes

are ultimately paid by households, either as lower wages              (if   an increase in

profit taxes is shifted to workers) or higher prices.              If excise taxes are

increased    (or   become nondeductible)   ,   the   price of current consumption rises; if

profit taxes are increased and capital income (rents, dividends, interest,

etc.) falls, the price of future consumption              (the after-tax return to saving)

increases.    In either case, greater labor supply would not be likely to follow;

a higher price would tend to offset the positive incentive of a higher after-

tax marginal wage rate on work effort.
                                            —5—



      Browning and Browning    (1985)    make the case with a simple example.       If the

tax liability under both old and new law is $3,000 on an income of $30,000 and

$5,000 on an income of $40,000 (the tax change is distributionally neutral)

then the effective marginal tax rate applied when income rises from $30,000 to

$40,000 is 20 percent for both laws.        And work effort will likely be the same

even if one law has low marginal rates applied to a broad base and the other

has higher rates applied to a narrower base.


                                B.      The 1986 Tax Act

      Slemrod (1987)   suggests two means by which the distribution of tax

burdens within income clssses could be altered so as to increase labor supply

within the context of a revenue neutral reform         reductions in the minimum

standard deduction and in the personal exemption.          Both would increase marginal

tax rates (from zero to the lowest marginal rate) for a subset of taxpayers who

paid no taxes prior to the reductions but now would pay taxes.          The revenue

pick-up from these taxpayers would allow the marginal tax rates of all others

to be cut.   The positive labor response of the latter group should roughly

offset the negative response of the former group.          In addition, though, the

reduction in standard deduction and/or personal exemptions of those who

previously paid taxes would allow a further reduction in their marginal tax

rates, and this should then lead to an increase in total labor supply.

      Lowering the personal exemption has another advantage.          Because the

number of personal exemptions per tsx return rises with income, marginal tax

rates could be reduced without changing the distribution of the tax burden by

income class.

     The 1986 Tax Act will not provide labor supply incentives through either

of these channels.     In fact, the 1986 Act went in the opposite direction,

raising the standard deduction and personal exemption in order to increase

fairness.    Moreover, partly because of these changes the Tax Act is likely not
                                                        —6—



distributionally neutral.              In fact, if the increased corporate taxes era

assumed to fall entirely on capital income recipients, then the tax burden is

noticeably ahifted from those earning under $tO,000 to those earning over

(Aaron,    1987) .    A reduction       in   labor   supply    should    be expected   from such a

redistribution.

      In a widely cited study (possibly because it seems to be the only one)

Hausman and Poterba           (1986(   report that the Tax Reform Act would increase labor

                                                                      that this
supply of the average married man by 0.9 percent, and they conjecture

is a good estimate of the aggregate effect on male labor supply.                          They then

consider the average married woman married to the average married man and

compute a 2.6 percent increase in labor supply.                         Here they are reluctsnt to
                                                                                               -


extrapolate to total female labor supply.

      Slemrod        (1987(   contends that this analysis is flawed because the

underlying model is based on a two—good world where the two goods are leisure

and s non-tax-preferred consumption good.                     Thus the negative effect on labor

                                 ——                  the   increase in after—tax prices of

ignored.     While the "average" married man may not hold large quantities of

stock (although he must have stock in his retirement aaving( , one would not

want to extrapolate from such an individual to the full population.                           Thus the

Hsuaman—Poterba study does not really conflict with the prior argument that the

1986 Tax Act will not increase labor aupply.


                                                  II.      Saving

          Mother possible        benefit of tax reform is greater saving in response to

lower tax rates on capital income.                   Economista are in less agreement on the

                                                     than they are on the
sensitivity of saving to increases in its net return
                                               —7—


responsiveness of labor Supply to increases in the return to work.                   I begin

with a general discussion of economists              views on this issue and then turn to

the specifics of the 1986 Tax Act as it affects first personal saving and then

corporate and foreign saving.          Assuming the Tax Act is revenue neutral, changes

in total saving will occur only if private or foreign saving change, and the

change in total saving determines          the change in total investment.


                      A.    After-Tax Returns and Personal Saving

      Most economists believe personal saving to be relatively insensitive to

net returns to saving.        While economists have constructed models in which

saving is highly sensitive          (Summers, l981a), alternative models        give a   small

sensitivity    (Evans, 1983) .      Moreover, econometric studies generally report low

responses.     Hoskins     (1978)   widely cited study reports an interest—rate

elasticity of 0.2 to 0.6; sore recently, Hall                (1985)   finds virtually no

response.     A major difficult with all empirical studies is the measurement of

the after-tax return (von Furstenburg, 1981) .               With so many   alternative saving

vehicles, with widely varying taxation and risk, how this return should be

measured is far from obvious.

      Because of the measurement problems, many economists look directly to

historic periods where net rates of return clearly changed for evidence on the

sensitivity.     The first half of the l980s is just such a period.               The 1981 Tax

Act both cut marginal tax rates and greatly expanded the scope of tax-preferred

retirement accounts      (which surged in response)      .     Moreover, real pretax interest

rates rose sharply.        Thus many point to the post-1981 period as one where the

saving rate should have risen noticeably if saving is interest sensitive.

However, the officially reported personal saving rate has plummeted from 7.3

percent of income in 1980-81 to about 4.4 percent in 1985-86, a decline of 40

percent.     On this basis, Blinder       (1985)   and Hauaman and Poterba (1986)        conclude

that personal saving is not sensitive to net rates of return.
                                            —8—


         This conclusion rests on two premises;       the official savings rate is a

reasonable measure of household saving and other forces were not deterring

saving in the lgBQ5.        Both presumptions are incorrect,    Hendershott and Peek

(1988)    have examined the official computation of this saving rate and found it

lacking for three reasons:        (1) purchases   of durable goods are treated as pure

consumption,    (2) contributions    to government retirement plans are counted as

government, not household, saving, and (3) the inflation-generated           premium in

interest rates, which simply compensates for expected capital losses on fixed—

dollar financial assets, is included in household income.          When Nenderahott and

Peek recompute the personal saving rate in the 1980s, it is flat, not plunging.

         Moreover, the rise in the stock market between the summer of 1982 and the

end of 1986 added over a trillion dollars to household wealth.           Such an

increase would be expected to reduce saving out of current income.           The

constancy of the personal saving rate, correctly measured, in the face of this

wealth increase, suggests a positive response to the net return on saving.            The

1981 expansion in retirement saving incentives may have stimulated household

saving in spite of the observed decline in the official aaving rate.


                       B.    The 1986 Tax Act and Personal Saving

         Numerous provisions    in the 1986 Tax Act affect the return to saving.

These include changes in tax rates on dividends, interest and capital gains,

changes in the taxation of tax shelter activities, and changes in the

deductibility of IRA and 40l)k) retirement contributions.          I first discuss the

tax rate changes and attacks on tax shelters and then turn to the changed

deductibility of retirement saving.

         Table 1 contains marginal tax rates (federal plus net state and local)

under both 1965 tax law and the Tax Act of 1986 for homeowners           with different

incomes in 1988 and different household status.          The after—tax   incomes are for

households if they rented; if they owned they would have lower tax liabilities.
                                         -9—


The marginal tax rates are for owners and reflect substantial housing-related

deductions; for renters the marginal rates would be higher.    As can be seen,

tax rates on marginal dividend and/or interest income are cut by   5   to 15

percentage points for married owners with incomes between $35,000 and $45,000

and above $65,000.   For household heads and singles, respectively, such cuts

occur for incomes above $50,000.    This represents about 25 percent of married

couples but only 10 percent of single and other household heads.       Such rate

declines tend to raise the after-tax return to savers.    On the other hand, the

statutory capital gains tax rate is increased by 8 to 15 percentage points for

these same households.

      Also acting to lower returns to savers are the anti—tax shelter

provisions of the new law.   For many years, different sources of income have

been taxed differently under the federal tax code.    For example, until 1981

"unearned" (nonlabor( income was subject to a far higher maximum tax rate than

was   earned' or labor income.   Also, capital gains have generally been taxed

less heavily than other income, owing both to the gains exclusion and deferral

until realization.   Moreover, portfolio capital losses, while fully deductible

against portfolio capital gains, have been deductible against only $3,000 of

other income.

      The 1986 Act introduces a new income class, passive income, with

restrictions somewhat analogous to those on portfolio capital losses.      Passive

income is defined to include income generated from business and trade

activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate and from

rental activities such as real estate.    For individuals, partnerships, trusts,

and personal service corporations, losses from passive activities can be used

to offset income from other passive activities, but not other income (e.g.,

wages, interest, etc.(.   Losses that cannot be claimed in a particular    year can
be "banked" and uaed to offset passive income in foture years.3         Also,

cumulative losses are deductible in full at the time of sale of the property,

icrespective of whether a gain or less is recognized.

       The 1986 Act also strengthened the minimum tax considerably.         Individuala

must pay the higher of their regular tax liability or their minimum tax

liability.   Under the new law, the minimum tax liability is 21 percent (up from

20)   of an individual's income base —-     regular taxable   income plus apecified tax

preferences less a $40,000 exemption for married taxpayers         ($30,000 for singles

or individual filers)   .   The exemption is reduced 25 cents for aach dollar by

which the income base exceeds $150,000; during this phaseout the effective tax

rate is 26.5 percent.4

       The 1986 Act expands the list of tax preferences to include accelerated

depreciation on equipment     (the difference between 200 percent declining balance

and 150 percent declining balance)    ,   tax—exempt interest on new private activity

bonds, and the appreciation component of charitable contributions.          These

expansions will increase the likelihood of taxpayers paying the minimum tax.

       On net, the anti-shelter provisions and increase in capital gains

taxation would appear to more than offset the decline in marginal tax rates on

interest and dividends.     The declines are significant for only the fifth of

households with the highest incomes, and these households are just those most

likely to have been using tax shelters and paying capital gains.          The net

return to saving is probably decreased.

        The 1986 Act also reduces the tax    advantages of retirement saving.       IRA

contributions for those with established pensions will no longer be deductible

for households with incomes above $35,000 (singles)       or $50,000 (married

couples, and they will be only partially deductible for singles with incomes

between $25,000 and $35,000 and marrieds with incomes between $40,000 and

$50,OO0. Also, the maximum deductible annual contributions to supplemental
                                         —11—


retirement accounts [40l(k)s) has been lowered from $30,000 to $7,000.            These

changes certainly reduce the net return to savers, but many contend the

reduction affects few on the margin.      For high savers, IRA contributions are

not the marginal dollars saved because the contributions are limited to $2000 a

year.    Moreover, previous saving can be transferred from taxable accounts to

tax-exempt accounts.6    Thus the surge in retirement contributions in the early

1980s (roughly $40 billion to IRAa and $20 billion to 401(k)s in 1985 alone)

may not have reflected an incentive-induced increase in saving, and removing

these tax incentives may not reduce aaving.

        While these observations are relevant, a significant part of these

contributions baa likely affected behavior at the margin.        Nearly 40 percent of

IRA contributors made contributions below the maximum amount, and half of

401(k) contributions may have been by individuals contributing over the $7,000

limit (Nauaman and Potarba, 1986)   .   For these households, the reduced

deductibility limits will lower the marginal return to saving.

        Overall the marginal return to saving will decline.     Nigher taxation of
returns on aaving vehicles used by higher income houaeholds ——         IRAs,   40l(k)a,

real estate tax shelters and capital gains generally     ——   will   lower the net

returns on these assets unless pretax returns rise sharply.          In the absence of

negative wealth effects of the tax changes, which would act to raise household

saving, this saving will decline.


              C.   The 1986 Tax Act and Corporate and Foreign Saving

        The effects on corporate and foreign saving are
                                                        likely to be even more

important than those on personal saving.     The 1986 Act substantially increases

the tax burden on corporations while lowering it on households.         Over the

1987—92 period, the shift is $120 billion.      This will certainly lower corporate
                                              —12-



saving, at laast until pretax corporate returna rise to offset the impact on

after-tax earnings.     The issue is whether household saving will rise to offset

the decline in corporate saving.

         If the greater cofporate taxation were on existing capital, then we would

expect stock prices to decline and thus household wealth to fall.              In response,

households would increase their saving.          This increase, plus the normal saving

owing to the $120 billion increase in disposable income, would likely offset

the decrease in corporate saving.         However, under the 1986 Tax Act existing

capital is taxed more favorably; Summers (1987)             estimates that taxes on old

capital will be $70 billion less in bhe 1987—91 period, while taxes on new

capital will be $190 billion more.         With old capital less heavily taxed, stock

prices will rise, not fall, and household saving should be depressed as a

result

         An alternative analysis of the impact of the increase in corporate

taxation on household saving asks whether households             "pierce the corporate

veil" without specifying the process through which this piercing occurs.                 Using

official personal and corporate saving data, Hendershott and Peek (1988)            ,    like
von Furstenberg    (1981) ,   find   nearly a 50 percent offset, i.e., the coefficient

of corporate saving in a personal ssving equation is —0.43.              However, both

personal and corporate saving are mismeasured during inflationary periods, and

the measurement errors are negatively correlated because households are net

creditors and corporations are net debtors.          When the saving series are

corrected —- when personal saving is lowered by the household inflation premium

(and augmented by other adjustments) and corporate saving is raised by the

corporate inflation premium, the coefficient of adjusted corporate saving

switches to slightly positive.         That   is, changes    in corporate saving do not

affect household saving directly, but only indirectly through wealth changes.
                                               -13—


To illustrate, if existing capital were taxed less heavily, corporate saving

and stock prices would both rise.         The increase in stock prices would, through

a wealth effect, lower household      saving.

      Finally, a word or two on foreign saving is appropriate.                      If interest

rates tend to decline, as model simulations that assume constant national

saving suggest they will, then the returns to foreign investors in the                     US.
will decline   (these investors do not pay U.S. taxes) .             As a result, foreign

saving will decrease, the decline in interest rates will be dampened, and the

U.S. capital stock will grow less rapidly.             Kruqman    (1985)    suggests that half

of the potential rate decline would be offset by reduced foreign saving, and

Summers   (1985)   analysis is consistent with this.


                                     III.     Investment

      Probably the most widely—cited economic benefit of tax reform is the

efficiency gain from a better allocation of capital.                The double taxation of

corporate capital, the zero (or low) taxation of owner-occupied housing and

state and local capital, the investment-credit bias in favor of equipment over

structures, all lead to misallocations.            A more efficient capital stock would

be a more productive capital stock.


                                A.   Potential Benefits

      A major conclusion of the extensive research in recent years on

efficiency is that the potential gains from a more efficient allocation of

capital are not nearly as large as once thought.                More specifically, the

potential gains are probably less than one percent of GNP (Fullerton and

Henderson, 1988) .   A simple   example     will   illustrate     why the   gains    are so small.

Say that the economy has equal amounts of two types of capital with equal

depreciation rates earning gross returns of 11 percent at the margin in one

case and 9 percent in the other owing to a tax preference.                  A productivity gain
                                           —14-


can be achieved by equating returns in the two uses.         Assuming Cobb-Douglas

technology, roughly one-tenth of the currently tax-preferred capital earning

between 9 and 10 percent would be shifted into the currently tax-diacriminated

capital.    The shift is one-tenth because the marginal groaa return is changing

by one-tenth-    The return on the shifted capital would rise from the g to 10

percent range to the 10 to 11 percent range.        That is, the one—tenth of the

capital stock reallocated would earn an additional percentage point.         Thus, the

initial 2 percentage point tax wedge reduced the average rate of return on the

capital stock by only a tenth of a percentage point.         With an average rate of

return on capital of 10 percent and an output/capital        ratio below unity, the

output gain is less than one percent.

      This is not an unrealistic example.         While net returns on apecific types

of capital under old tax law may have differed by as much as four percentage

points (as shown in Table 2( ,    the   average net returns on the higher-earning

half of the capital stock was less than two percentage points more than that on

the lower-earning half.

      A second source of productivity enhancement is an increase in the rate of

business investment owing to either greeter total investment or a reallocation

of a given investment level from housing to business outlays.         Here, the

potential    output gains are more substantial.

      Summers   (1981b)   provides some illustrative computations again assuming

Cobb-Douglas technology.      With exogenous technological growth, an increase in

the share of output devoted to net business investment would temporarily raise

the rate of productivity growth as the economy moves to a higher output level.

Eventually, though, a new output/capital ratio will be achieved, and the rate

of growth of output and capital will return to the long-run rate given by the

growth rates of labor supply and technology.        With a one—third increase in the

business-investment   share of output, the productivity growth rate increases by
                                           —15—


only 0.1 percent per year in the first decade and lesser amounts thereafter.

The long—run output path, however, is 7½ percent higher.8           If instead

technological progress is embodied in capital goods, the same increase in

investment has a larger short—run impact because it accelerates the

introduction of new technology.       The increase in the productivity growth rate

is nearly 0.2 percent per year during the first decade.           However, the long-run

output path is not any higher; the economy just gets there quicker          (Phelps,

1962)

         This output gain is not free.     If an increase in saving is the source of

the greater business investment, then consumption is reduced during the

transition to the new equilibrium.        If reduced housing investment is the

source, then the consumption-of-housing-services          path is lower forever.


                                     B.   1986 Tax Act

         The Tax Reform Act of 1986 has negative direct implications for virtually

every type of capital good.       Longer depreciation lives raise the investment

hurdle rates (annual rental costs) for all structures except owner—occupied

housing, the elimination of investment tax credits increases hurdle rates for

equipment and public utility structures, the decrease in the corporate tax rate

increases the hurdle rate for intangible capital          (advertising and research and

development)   ,   and the cut in personal tax rates lowers the demand for owner—

occupied housing.       Only inventories (and land)    are unaffected.   With the demand

for all investment goods either falling or being unchanged,          interest rates will

certainly decline.      The magnitude of the decline depends on the interest

sensitivities of both the supply of domestic and foreign saving and of

investment demand itself.       Hendershott   (1987)   constructed a model in which

total saving is independent of rates of return and the demands for capital are

approximately unitary elastic with respect to the rental prices of capital

goods.     In this model, interest rates have to decline by well over a percentage
                                               —16—


point to offset the negative capital provisions of the Aot.                   That is, rates

have to decline by this much to maintain the aggregate demand for capital at

its   pre—refo          level.6

            Of course, interest rates will decline less if the supply of ssving is

reduced, and a reduction should be anticipated.             As discussed above, a decline

in private saving should be expected owing to the reduction in retirement

saving incentives and the shift of the tax burden from low saving households to

higher saving corporations.           Moreover, a tendency toward lower interest rates

will be mitigsted by decreased foreign saving.

            Figure 1 illustrstes the general impsct of the Tax Act on interest rates

(i) and net investment, both business           (BUS)   and the sum of business and other

(SUM)   .       The downward sloping solid schedules, BUS and SUM, are net investment

demands under old law, and the solid           SW   schedule is net saving under old law.

For convenience SAV is drawn vertically.              The level of net investment and net

saving is SUM°, the business component of investment is BUS°, and the interest

rate level is i°.

            The 19B6 Tax Act shifts the SUM and BUS schedules leftward to SUM    and
                                                                             new

would be reallocated from business to other investment under the assumption

that the Tax Act disfavors business investment more than other investment.

Model simulations (see below) generally give estimates of this decline in rates

and reallocation of investment.           If, however, net saving is positively              related

to interest rates, owing either to domestic or foreign behavior, and the

domestic component of saving shifts leftward (as argued above)                  ,   then   the net

saving schedule under the 1PB6 Tax Act becomes             SWnew   .   The leftward shift and

flendershott

      Table 2 contains estimates of the changes in investment incentives

contained in the 1986 Tax Act.      The first column reports net (of depreciation)

pretax required annual returns (investment hurdle rates) for a variety of

corporate and noncorporate investments under 1985 law.         The next two pairs of

columns report estimated changes in these returns under two assumptions

regarding tax—induced changes in interest rates, a percentage point decline and

no change (the appendix contains the specifics of these calculations).             As can

be seen, under 1985 tax law the especially tax-favored assets were owner—

occupied housing of high-income households, equipment, and intangible capital;

the especially tax-disadvantaged assets were corporate inventories and

industrial structures.     The investment tax credit gave equipment its advantage,

the expensing of advertising and R&D outlays accounts for the intangible

advantage, and the nontaxation of owner housing returns explains that large

advantage for high tax bracket households.       Corporate    investments are generally

disfavored by their 'double'     taxation ——   taxation   at both the business

(corporate) and investor    (personal) levels.

      The 1986 Tax Act is effective in reducing disparities among hurdle rates

within each broad sector.      In every case, the hurdle rate of the previously

most tax—favored asset rises the most (equipment and owner housing of high—

income households) and that of the least tax-favored asset falls or rises the

least (inventories and owner housing of low-income households)        .   In   fact, the

investment hurdle rates for business capital under the 1986 Act are remarkably

close, expect for intangible capital.      In contrast, the Tax Act is perverse in

terms of sectors.   Hurdle rates for the most heavily taxed corporate sector are

increased the most, while those for the least heavily taxed sector, owner—
                                            —18—


occupied housing, deccesse or incresse the lesst.            According to my

calculations, the losses from less equal trestment of sectors exceed the gsins

from more equal trestment of assets.

Fullerton, Henderson and Mackie

        Fullerton, Henderson and Hackie (1987)         have made comparable calculations

using a far more detailed general equilibrium model.            The model contains 15

consumer goods produced by 18 producers goods which, in turn, have labor and 38

types of both corporate and noncorporste capital as imputs.            The 38 capital

goods include 20 types of equipment, 5 utility structures, 10 other structures,

inventories, and 2 types of land.         In contrast, all owner housing       is presumed


to be held by a single, aversge tax-bracket household.

        The Fullerton-Henderson-Mackie      (FilM)   model gives results remarkedly

similar to my simple model.         Their average changes in hurdle rates for the

investment aggregates under two model specifications for corporations are

listed in column 4 of Tsble 2.         The chsnges are generally in between those in

columns 2 and 3, which is just as expected because their calculations presume a

30 basis point decline in interest rates.

        The   FilM   model simulation actually computes a 60 basis point interest rate

decline to maintain the aggregate demand for capital.            Host of the difference

between this and my larger estimated decline stems from their ihclusion of

land.    Land constitutes 60 percent of noncorporate capital and 30 percent of

all capital.         Because land is not taxed more heavily under the 1986 Tax Act,

including land in the model as an elastically supplied good greatly dampens the

interest rate decline needed to maintain the aggregate demand for capital.

        The inclusion of land is also important to         FilM's capital stock   and

efficiency results.        With no saving response, corporate capital decreases by 8

percent, noncorporate—nonhousing        capital increases by 7 percent, and housing

rises by 2 percent.        Honcorporate capital rises because most land is in this
                                            —19—


sector and the demand for land rises absolutely when interest rates decline.

With land excluded, corporate and noncorporate-nonhousing capital decrease by

10 percent and 2 percent, respectively, giving a decline in total business

capital of 8 percent.

      If one views nonland business capital as the key total capital variable

because one does not accept the assumption that land is as easily produced as

plant and equipment (or because new technology is not embodied in land)      ,    then

the Tax Act has a significantly negative effect.        The decline in business

capital, and thus the negative impact of the Tax Act, will be magnified by the

anticipated decreases in private and foreign saving.

      Fullerton, Henderson and Mackie find that the efficiency gains from

better asset allocation within sectors outweigh the greater losses from poorer

sectoral allocaticn)°     One might expect the far more detailed asset treatment

to lead to such a result if different classes of equipment or of structures

were taxed far more differently under old law than new.        In fact, though,

different classes were not taxed all that differently under old law and do not

seem to be taxed more evenly under the 1986 Tax Act (compare the differences in

effective tax rates in FHM, Table 3)    .    The greater FHM gains come from the

inclusion of land which, with inventories, was the heaviest taxed asset under

old law and is about averaged—taxed under the new 1986       Act1
Galper, Lucke and Toder

     Galper, Lucke and Toder    (GLT)   take an approach nearly opposite to FHM.

GLT emphasize financial behavior, risk taking, and taxation at the personal,

rather than, business level.    All housing is assumed to be owner-occupied,        and

it and consumer durables are held by 400 different households, differentiated

by income, wealth, marital and itemization status.        In contrast only, single,

conglomerated corporate and noncorporate business capital stocks, rather than

38 classes, are analyzed.
                                        —20—


      The GOT model computes a percentage point decline in interest rates to

maintain the aggregate demand for capital.     The major capital stock changes are

a 12 percent decrease in state and local government capital and a roughly

offsetting, in dollar amounts, 6 percent increase in consumer durables,    two

assets not included in the FHM model.    Corporate and noncorporate capital each

decline by a single percentage point.     These declines could rise to as much as

5 percent when a decline in private saving and an endogenous fall in foreign

saving in response to the decline in interest rates is incorporated.

Summary

      All three models suggest five to ten percent declines in business

investment.   A ten percent decline, lowering the share of net business

investment in net output from 0.045 to 0.04, would, from the growth

calculations discussed earlier, lower the long—run output path by three

percent.


                                 IV.    Conclusion

      The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will lower the share of net output channeled

into net investment and will tilt net investment from industrial to other uses.

Both effects will reduce the long-run output path.     On the other hand, the

industrial investment made will be marginally more efficient.     Labor supply

will be largely unaffected.   On net, the long—run output path will be reduced

by two to four percent, and productivity growth will slow until this lower path

is reached.   That legislation shifting the tax burden from labor and existing

capital to new investment would have this result should hardly come as a

surprise.

      Let me expand briefly on these conclusions.     Interest and dividend income

is generally taxed at a lower rate.     On the other hand, capital gains are taxed

more heavily, tax shelters are restricted (new passive loss rules and a more

inclusive minimum income tax base( , and deductible contributions to retirement

                                      will be worth less, the consumer
advantages: remaining tax preferences

durables and housing stocks will be allocated more efficiently among

                                                                      sensitive
houaeholds   (GLT, 1988), the taxation of capital income will be less

to inflation (Henderson, 1986), and risk will be borne more efficiently

(GLT, 1988).    Keeping the enlarged standard deductions and personal

                                            the lower/flatter tax rate
exemptions and aaintaining at least most of

schedule seems highly desirable)2 What then could be done to increase saving

and ensure that it is channelled into industrial capital?

     Within the given constraints, a growth policy would be the following.

First, additional   tax revenues would be raised, either by increaaing all tax

rates a faw points or introducing a new consumption   tax)3   Second, part of

the revenues would be earmarked to reduce the federal deficit (increase

national saving) and part would be used to reintroduce business investment

incentives to ensure that most of the increased national saving flows into

business investment, rather than being offset by a decline in foreign saving

or being diverted into other capital.

    Bosworth )1984)   contains a useful discussion of many of the general topics

addressed in this paper.

    An exception applies to 'small landlords' Taxpayers who actively manage

residential rental investments may deduct up to $25,000 in losses against

nonpassive income     f    their adjusted gross income computed without regard to the

losses is less than $l00,000             This amount is phased out one dollar for two

dollars of income for taxpayers with incomes above $100,000 so that no losses

are allowed for anyone who earns above $l50,000

    For a detailed discussion of both the individual and corporate minimum taxes,

see Graetz and Sunley (1988)

    At an 8 percent interest rate and a 25 year investment horizon, elimination

of the deductibility, but continuation of the tax deferral on interest earned,

removes half of the tax benefit.

    Venti and Wise (1987)       estimate that only 20 percent of contributions

constitute transfers of assets

    Downs and Hendershott       (1987)   estimate that   he   stock market should have

increased by 10 to 15 percent.

    The output—labor ratio equals (s/n)exp[(la)/al,             where s is the fraction of

net output devoted to net investment, n is the rate of growth in labor, and a

is the elasticity of output with respect to labor (Solow, 1956)                The ratio of

new   output   (based on   *)    to old output is then (s*/s)exp((l_a)/a1        With a =

0.045,   s     0.06, and a =      0.8,   the ratio is l075,

     Much of the rate decline should have occurred prior to enactment of the Tax

Act.    All tax reform plans considered in 1986 proposed elimination of the

investment tax credit for equipment and public utility structures retroactive

to ths beginning of 1986, and the likelihood of some version of tax reform

passing was high virtually all year.      Thus the decline in interest rates and

the weakness in equipment expenditures experienced in 1986 was partially

attributable to the anticipeted removal of this provision.         Indeed, half of

model—calculated decline in interest rates is due solely to the elimination of

this credit.
10
     Their analysis   (like Hendershott's) does not include intangible cspital and

does not reflect the negative impact of the vsrious accounting and specific

industry rule changes on investment demand.         Inclusion of tangible capital and

incorporation of these other impacts could easily reverse the FilM results.

     It is worth noting thst both the   FilM   gain and Hendershntt loss are small;
the difference is importent only when an undue emphasis is placed on the sign

of the efficiency change.
12
       would view extension of the current maximum rate of 33 percent to the

highest income, or even a maximum rate of 35 percent at very high incomes, aa

being consistent with maintaining the lower schedule.
13
     Meedless to say, most everyone would prefer to generate the increeee in

government saving by cutting spending.         I will not burden the reader with my

preferred spending cuts.

APPENDIX:       THE CALCULATION OF PRETAX REQUIRED RETURNS

        The decision to invest depends on whether the present value of the

expected revenue from investment, net of direct operating expenaes and indirect

taxes, exceeda the outlay on the investment.                                  On marginal investments, the

present value will equal the outlay.                          Put another way, in the absence uf taxes,

the net operating incume from an investment must cover the real interest rate

plus depreciatiun.                Aftec allowance fur taxatiun, the equilibrium cunditiun fur

investment is

the greater will be pruductiun uf the asset and the lower will be the

would be the same fur all assets.                           That is, the net marginal productivity uf

all investmenta would be equal at the margin.

        The real after-tax financing rate )r) depends on the pre—tax debt rate,

the rate at which interest is deductible, the required return on equity )which

depends on capital gains taxation)                      ,    the   loan-to—value ratio, and the inflation

rate.       In general, r is higher for industrial )curpurste) structures tnan for

nonconporate real estate because the required equity rate is higher owing to

the double taxation of dividends.                           For nuncorporate structures I assume a real

after-tax interest rate of 0.0275 both before and after tax reform )the cut in

tax rates tends to raise r but a decline in pretax interest rates lowers                                         r)       a

real rate of 0.0375 is assumed for corporate investments.

     The present value of tax depreciation, in the absence of trading, is

simply the tax depreciation stream, with the basis adjusted for the tax credit

received, discounted by nominal after-tax interest rates:


                    L           TAXDt
      z = (1—kB)                                                                    (2)

where B is the fraction of the tax credit by which the basis is reduced, TAXDt

is the depreciation in year t, and                 it   is   the expected inflation rate, assumed to

be 0.045.    Tax—based trading will occur if the tax benefits from the trade, rz,

As it turns out, trading was advantageous under 1985 law but will not be under

the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

      In this analysis, we assume that the marginal tax rate of the marginal

investor was 0.45 (including state and local income taxes) under old law and

0.36 under new.     The 0.0275 real rate and 0.045 expected inflation rate are

consistent with a 0.09 percent risk—free interest rate and a 0.023 percent risk

premium under old law and a 0.08 percent risk-free rate under new law.                            With no

decline in interest rates, the real rate is raised by (1—. 36) .01 to 0.0339

(0.0439 for corporations)

      For owner-occupied housing, the -ta in equation                      (1) are zero    (imputed

rents are not taxed and no depreciation is deductible for tax purposes)

Moreover, the real after-tax financing rate and the value of property tax

deductions vary with the households tax bracket.                     To make the analysis

comparable to that of depreciable properties, we compute the net (of

depreciation) marginal product for owner-occupied housing as
