                                            ABSTRACT


       The Q-theory of investment says that a firm's investment rate should rise with its Q. We argue
here that this theory also explains why some firms buy other firms. We find that


1. A firm's merger and acquisition (M&A) investment responds to its Q more -- by a factor of 2.6 --
   than its direct investment does, probably because M&A investment is a high fixed cost and a low
   marginal adjustment cost activity,


2. The typical firm wastes some cash on M&As, but not on internal investment, i.e., the "Free-Cash
   Flow" story works, but explains a small fraction of mergers only, and


3. The merger waves of 1900 and the 1920's, `80s, and `90s were a response to profitable reallocation
   opportunities, but the `60s wave was probably caused by something else.

    The Q-theory of investment says that a firm’s investment rate should rise with its
Q. We argue here that this theory also explains why some firms buy other firms. We
find that

   1. A firm’s merger and acquisition (M&A) investment responds to its Q more —
      by a factor of 2.6 — than its direct investment does, probably because M&A
      investment is a high fixed cost and a low marginal adjustment cost activity,

   2. The typical firm wastes some cash on M&As, but not on internal investment,
      i.e., the “Free-Cash Flow” story works, but explains a small fraction of mergers
      only, and

   3. The merger waves of 1900 and the 1920’s, ‘80s, and ‘90s were a response to
      profitable reallocation opportunities, but the ‘60s wave was probably caused by
      something else.

    Two distinct used-capital markets.–Used equipment and structures sometimes
trade unbundled in that firm 1 buys a machine or building from firm 2, but firm 2
continues to exist. At other times, firm 1 buys firm 2 and thereby gets to own all
of firm 2’s capital. In both markets, the traded capital gets a new owner. In a sale
of used “disassembled” capital, the capital also gets a new manager, whereas in the
M&A market, capital gets a new manager when a merger entails a restructuring.
Such a merger is reallocative in the same sense that a used capital trade is.
   Mergers as used-capital trades.–Our model treats M&As like used-capital-market
transactions. This seems apt, since trading volume in the two markets for used capital
— bundled and disassembled — moves together. Figure 1 shows this fact. It plots
acquired capital and direct purchases of used capital among exchange-listed firms as
percentages of their investment. The series cover all firms common to the University

Figure 1: Used and Acquired Capital as Percentages of Total Investment, 1971-2000

of Chicago’s Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) database and Standard
and Poor’s Compustat.1 The two series do not overlap in coverage, and so they add
up to the fraction of investment spent on buying used capital. This fraction was 10
percent in 1975, and a much higher 43.5 percent in 2000. The correlation coeﬃcient
between the two series is 0.45. Clearly, the merger waves of the ‘80s and ‘90s coincided
with waves of trading disassembled used capital.
    Prior evidence.–High-Q firms usually buy low-Q firms. Gregor Andrade, Mark
Mitchell and Erik Staﬀord (2001) report that in more than two-thirds of all mergers
since 1973, the acquirer’s Q exceeded the target’s Q. And Henri Servaes (1991) finds
that total takeover returns (defined as the abnormal increase in the combined values
of the merging parties) are larger when the target has a low Q and if the bidder had
a high Q. Thus mergers are a channel through which capital flows to better projects
and better management, and our model reflects that fact.

    Capital sales include property, plant, and equipment (Compustat item 107). Acquisitions include
funds used for and costs related to the purchase of another company in the current year or an
acquisition in a prior year that was carried over to the current year (item 129). Investment is the
sum of acquired capital (item 129) and direct capital expenditures (item 128). We compute the
ratios in Figure 1 after summing each data item across active firms in each year.


                                                2
                                           I. Model
     A firm’s state of technology is z and its capital stock is K. Its production function
is
                                         output = zK.                                 (1)
The parameter z follows the Markov process

                              Pr {zt+1 ≤ z 0 | zt = z} = F (z 0 , z) ,                (2)

and it is firm-specific.
    Markets for K.–Firms can buy new or disassembled used capital at a price of
unity. The cost of disassembly is 1 − s per unit of capital, and any firm that disas-
sembles its K gets a salvage value of s < 1 per unit of K. The firm can also place
itself on the M&A market where all acquired capital trades at a common price of q
per unit. If the salvage and the acquired capital markets are both open, we must
have q = s, and this is what we shall assume.
    No markets for z.– The firm must accept whatever z−draw that nature endows
it with each period.
    Growth of capacity.–Let X be the firm’s direct investment in capital (new or used
but unbundled) and Y its acquisitions of bundled capital. Next period, its capital
stock will be
                              K 0 = (1 − δ) K + X + Y.                            (3)


    Costs of growth.–Aside from the payment for X and Y , the firm also faces the
following foregone-output cost of growth:
                                                      X          Y
                        C (x, y) K,      where x =      , and y = .                   (4)
                                                      K          K

     Merger gains.–The firm transfers its z to all new and all used capital that it
buys. The joint gains to a merger are thus largest when the target’s z is low, and
the buyer’s z is high. Let the bidder’s state be (z1 , K1 ) and let the target’s state be
(z2 , K2 ). The output of the combined firm would be z1 (K1 + K2 ), which is higher
than the sum of the two firms’ pre-merger outputs by the amount (z1 − z2 ) K2 .
     The Q equation.– Because (1) and (4) are homogeneous of degree one in K, X,
and Y , the aggregation condition (2.8) of Fumio Hayashi and Tohru Inoue (1991)
holds. The value of K inside a firm is of the form Q (z) K. The price of new capital is
unity, and the price of used capital is q < 1. A unit of K has a profit of z − C (x, y) −
x − qy, and a market value of

            Q (z) = max {z − C (x, y) − x − qy + (1 − δ + x + y) Q∗ (z)} ,            (5)
                    x≥0,y≥0


                                                 3
where Q∗ (z) is the discounted expected present value of capital tomorrow given the
firm’s z today. Since the firm has the option of selling its capital in the next period
on the merger market at a price of q dollars per unit of capital,
                                      Z
                        ∗      1
                      Q (z) =              max {q, Q (z 0 )} dF (z 0 , z) .            (6)
                              1+r

   Interior maxima.–At an interior maximum, the optimal x and y satisfy the first
order conditions
                            c1 (x, y) = Q∗ (z) − 1.                           (7)
and
                                 c2 (x, y) = Q∗ (z) − q.                               (8)
If z is positively autocorrelated, Q∗ is increasing in z, and high-z firms will grow
faster and, if there are no fixed costs of investment, use both x and y to achieve that
growth. If we control for Q∗ , K does not matter. That is, a large firm grows as easily
as a small one, and no optimal firm size exists — just optimal growth.
    Fixed costs of mergers.–Assume a fixed cost, φ, of acquiring the capital of other
firms:                               (
                                        c (x, y) + φ if y > 0,
                          C (x, y) =
                                        c (x, 0)      if y = 0.
This cost is per unit of K, and therefore returns to scale remain constant. Let i = x+y
be the gross investment rate in eﬃciency units. A low-i firm will avoid the cost φ
by setting y = 0 and using only x, whereas a high-i firm will use both margins. The
value of i, call it i∗ , at which the firm is indiﬀerent between buying in the acquisitions
market and staying out of it, solves for i the equation

                  i + c (i, 0) = φ + min {(i − y) + qy + c (i − y, y)} .               (9)
                                      y


The left-hand side of (9) is lower when i is small, and the right-hand side is lower
when i is high. Of course, i itself depends on the firm’s z.
    Disappearance of firms.–A firm may disappear either by exiting and disassem-
bling its capital, or by being acquired. Either way, it gets q per unit of K. Let ze be
the point of indiﬀerence between staying in business and exiting. Then

                                          Q (ze ) = q.


    Four regions for z.–Figure 2 portrays a steady state in which the distribution
of z over firms replicates itself period after period. Sustaining such a steady state
requires an entry process as modeled by Hugo A. Hopenhayn (1982). Our focus is
on the fate of the incumbents. Each period, firms with z’s below ze dissolve or are

acquired. In the region between ze and z ∗ firms remain in the market but invest only
in x because the fixed cost φ deters them from setting a positive y. Beyond z ∗ (the
value of z that corresponds to i∗ ) they also set y > 0, and beyond the “overtaking”
level zO , y exceeds x.
    Investment-expansion path.–Figure 3 shows the expansion path for x and y as the
eﬃciency-units-investment rate i, represented by the parallel dashed iso-investment
lines, rises. At i∗ , x drops from i∗ to x∗ , and y jumps from zero to ymin . The figure
reflects the assumption that cy is small relative to cx , so that the share of y in the
firm’s investment portfolio grows, and the expansion path approaches the 450 line.
At the overtaking point, x = y = iO /2. Beyond iO , in Figure 3, y exceeds x.
    Engel curves for x and y.–Figure 4 shows how investment in x and y varies with
i. The two schedules add up to the 45o line. When i reaches iO , y overtakes x.
    Evidence on overtaking.–The prediction of Figure 4 is confirmed by the evidence
in Figure 5. Between 1971 and 2000, small expansions did, indeed, come mainly
through x, while large expansions came mainly through y. The vertical axis measures
the HP-filtered means of x and y for firms that fall within each percentage point of
the range of i.2 Overtaking occurs at iO = 1.12, which, after depreciation, is roughly
a doubling of capacity. Data on individual years (not shown) indicate that iO has
   2
    In Figure 5, we pool 118,127 observations from 1971-2000. The sample thins out as i∗ gets large:
only 193 observations involve x + y between 1.5 and 2, and 96 observations lie between 2 and 2.5.

fallen over the past two decades from 1.43 in 1980, to 1.09 in 1989, and to just 0.5 in
1998. This suggests that φ has also been falling.
    The M&A deflator.–The acquirer’s y is its M&A spending divided by q. In the
model, q is the targets’ market values divided by their K’s. A measure of q is market-
to-book value of the acquired firms but, since firms usually write down the capital on
their books as quickly as possible so as to bring the depreciation allowances forward,
their market-to-book ratios are often much higher than unity. This is true for each
subgroup of firms pictured in Figure 2. In Figure 6 we plot the average Q’s for these
groups, while pooling the middle two into a single “x ≥ y” group, and we denote
these averages by q̄, Q̄x>y , and Q̄y>x respectively. All three averages stay well above
1, probably because the targets’ books underreport their capital. If so, the q̄t series
plotted in Figure 6 badly overestimates the price of used capital on the acquisitions
Another 182 observations, not shown in Figure 5, involve x + y > 2.5. We use book value of assets
(Compustat item 6) in the previous year to proxy for K, and linearly interpolate between missing
points in the range of i∗ before filtering. We interpolated between 5 annual averages in building x
and 10 annual averages in building y. In all cases, the interpolations involved x + y > 1.5.

in the regression analysis below that a dollar spent on x buys the same eﬃciency
units of capital as a dollar spent on y.

   II. Estimates of Investment and Acquisitions Equations
    Assume that c (x, y) is additively separable. Then (7) and (8) are of the form
x = f (Q∗ ) , and y = g (Q∗ − q) . The Q’s may all be biased upward, but Qj − q̄
should still measure firm j’s incentive to acquire the capital from other firms at the
price q̄. Linearized, f and g assume the same form as eq. (30) of Hayashi (1982):
                             Xj,t
                   xj,t ≡          = αx0 + αx1 Qj,t−1 + αx2 t , and                  (10)
                            Kj,t−1
                             Yj,t
                   yj,t   ≡        = αy0 + αy1 (Qj,t−1 − q̄t−1 ) + αy2 t,
                            Kj,t−1
where t is a linear time trend. The model predicts that αx1 and αy1 should be positive.

use the market-to-book ratio for Q.3 For q̄t we use average market-to-book value of
disappearing firms — the series plotted in Figure 6.
    The results support the Q-theory. Hayashi had estimated the eﬀect of Q on
investment at 0.045. Our dependent variables are multiplied by 100. Our estimate
of the eﬀect of Q on x is one-sixth as large as Hayashi’s, perhaps because we use
total firm assets as the denominator (K) rather than the stock of durable equipment
and structures. More to the point, our estimate of the eﬀect of Q − q̄ on y is highly
significant and nearly three times the coeﬃcient-estimate of Q in the x equation.

                     A. Which Way Does “Free” Cash Flow?
       A firm’s manager may try to pursue his own objectives — growing the size of his
   3
    To compute market values from the Compustat files, we start with the value of common equity
at current share prices (the product of items 24 and 25), and then add in the book value of preferred
stock (item 130) and short- and long-term debt (items 34 and 9). Book values are computed similarly,
but use the book value of common equity (item 60) rather than the market value. We omitted firms
with negative values for net common equity from the plot since they imply negative market to book
ratios, and eliminated observations with market-to-book values in excess of 100, since many of these
were likely to be serious data errors.

                                                 9
firm, for example — at shareholders’ expense. Direct investment cannot expand a
manager’s empire as fast as a merger can, and Michael C. Jensen (1986) argues that
managers of firms with excess cash on hand are more likely to spend it on acquisitions
than to pay it out in dividends, even if an acquisition has a negative net present value.
    Do firms spend their extra cash mergers? It seems so. We add cash (Compustat
item 1) normalized by firm capital (again proxied by item 6) to the regressions de-
scribed in (10). The results are in Table 2. Cash has little eﬀect on x, but a positive,
significant eﬀect on y. Still, Q retains the lion’s share of explanatory power.

               III. Merger Waves as Reallocation Waves
    If firms all had the same z, Q would equal q, and no M&A’s would take place.
M&A’s should rise, says the model, when the interfirm dispersion of Q is high. We
now ask: Was Q more dispersed during merger waves? We confirm this in two
diﬀerent ways. The first test is summarized by Figure 7, which shows that Qy>x − q
leads movements in acquisitions.4 The correlation between Qy>x − q at the end of
year t and acquisitions in the following year, which is the timing shown in the Figure
7, is 0.12, but the correlation rises to 0.22 if we lag Qy>x − q by another period, and
rises to 0.31 if we lag it yet again.
   4
    We project mergers for 2001 by observing that their value fell by 57 percent between 2000 and
2001 (Wall Street Journal, Jan. 2, 2002) and by assuming that firm assets in our Compustat sample
grew at the same rate as GDP between the second quarters of 2000 and 2001.

              Figure 7: Acquired Capital and the Dispersion of Q, 1975-2001

    Our second, and less direct test is in Figure 8. The Compustat covers too few
book values before 1975 to allow a reliable estimate of the dispersion of Q before then.
Instead, we infer the dispersion of Q in year t < 1998 by computing the standard
deviation of the year-1998 Q’s among firms of vintage t, and then repeating this
exercise for each t between 1890 and 1998. If the distribution of entrants’ Q’s is more
dispersed in years when the market at large has more dispersion of Q, and if the z
process is fairly persistent, this estimate will provide a useful rough guide to waves
of dispersion of Q. But because high-z firms are more likely to survive, our estimator
is biased increasingly towards zero the older the vintage of the firms.
    Our estimate of Q-dispersion is the dashed line in Figure 8. This HP-filtered series
is indeed upward sloping as a function of vintage. The solid line in Figure 8 shows
the HP-filtered acquisition series as a fraction of total capitalization, as a function of
time.5 Thus the two series derive from two diﬀerent populations. The solid line is a

    The dashed line in Figure 8 is reproduced from Figure 2 in Jovanovic and Rousseau (2001b, pp.
338, 340). The solid line is based primarily on merger data from CRSP for 1926-1998, and from work
sheets for the manufacturing and mining sectors underlying Ralph L. Nelson (1959) for 1890-1930.
The series includes the market value of targets acquired by exchange-listed firms in the year prior to
merger. Market values after 1925 are from CRSP. Before that, they are from our extension of CRSP

historical series, whereas the dashed line is a vintage representation of the 1998 cross
section. Both lines may trend upward for reasons that the model leaves out, but even
the detrended series have a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.64! But for the “hubris” wave
of the 1960’s, each merger wave was preceded by a rise in the dispersion of Q. Thus
the waves of 1900, the 1920s, 1980s and 1990s were probably reallocation waves.
