Liquidity Risk and Syndicate Structure

NBER Working Paper No. 13802

JEL No. G2,G32

                                              ABSTRACT

We offer a new explanation of loan syndicate structure based on banks' comparative advantage in
managing systematic liquidity risk. When a syndicated loan to a rated borrower has systematic liquidity
risk, the fraction of passive participant lenders that are banks is about 8% higher than for loans without
liquidity risk. In contrast, liquidity risk does not explain the share of banks as lead lenders. Using
a new measure of ex-ante liquidity risk exposure, we find further evidence that syndicate participants
specialize in liquidity-risk management while lead banks manage lending relationships. Links from
transactions deposits to liquidity exposure are about 50% larger at participant banks than at lead arrangers.

Introduction

        Over the past 20 years the syndicated lending market has grown rapidly, with originations in 2006

surpassing $1.6 trillion (Loan Pricing Corporation). This market offers large firms access to long-term

debt finance as well as liquidity support in the form of lines of credit and loan commitments. Many large

firms use these lines both to reduce their need for cash and to support their commercial paper programs

(Sufi, 2007; Gatev and Strahan, 2006). While financial institutions such as investment banks, insurance

companies and hedge funds play an important role in funding syndicated loans, commercial banks

maintain a fundamental advantage over other lenders in products that expose lenders to systematic

liquidity risk.1 We show that this advantage shapes the structure of loan syndicates. Banks dominate in

lending on lines of credit to rated firms. In contrast, their dominance is much less pronounced in credit

lines to other firms (where liquidity risk is more idiosyncratic), as well as in term lending that is fully

funded at origination and thus brings no liquidity risk at all. Existing studies have shown that syndicate

structure varies with borrower attributes related to credit risk and transparency, but ours is the first to
                                                                           2
demonstrate how liquidity risk management shapes syndicate structure.


        Why do banks dominate in the market for credit lines? 3 Kashyap, Rajan and Stein

(2002) explain the combination of transactions deposits and credit lines with a risk-management

motive. In their model, as long as liquidity demands from depositors and borrowers are not too

correlated, the bank reduces its costly buffer stock of cash by serving both customers.4 Thus,

their model yields a synergy because combining transactions deposits with unused loan

commitments allows banks to diversify away liquidity shocks. Gatev and Strahan (2006) extend

this idea, showing that banks are endowed with a unique hedge for the systematic risk that occurs

when many large borrowers simultaneously increase their demand for bank credit during

episodes of reduced market liquidity: offsetting inflows into government-protected transactions

deposits. Banks’ structure allows them to sell excess liquidity to firms at precisely those times


                                                       1
when they need cash because markets are tight. Thus, deposits afford banks a comparative

advantage in offering liquidity insurance relative to other financial intermediaries.


       Based on these models, we argue that banks’ advantage in syndicated lending ought to

show up most strongly in their role as passive participants investing in lines of credit to rated

borrowers. Rated firms tend to draw on lines when credit supply dries up in the commercial

paper and bond markets (Gatev & Strahan, 2006). Hence, lines of credit to rated borrowers

create more systematic liquidity exposure to lenders than lines issued to unrated borrowers.

Moreover, risk management considerations – such as the advantage of transactions deposits -

matter more for passive participants compared to lead arrangers. In general, participants provide

funds but otherwise rely on the lead lenders for negotiation and pricing of loans and, to a certain

degree, in cases of covenant violations or default. Lead lenders therefore must account not only

for risk management concerns associated with loan funding, but also with their ability to

understand the borrower and to monitor over the life of the loan. Thus, for a lead lender

systematic liquidity-risk management is likely to be second order in importance.


       Table 1 illustrates our main finding in a simple way. Using the Dealscan data on

syndicated loans, we present the average share of lenders that are banks for term loans and lines

of credit, and then break these difference out based borrower type (rated v. unrated) and based on

the role of the lender (lead v. participant). Across all cells, banks dominate in lines of credit

relative to term loans. Their dominance is most pronounced, however, for rated borrowers and

as participants. For example, the bank share is 20 percentage points greater for lines of credit to

rated borrowers than for term loans to these same borrowers. This difference becomes even

more pronounced – 24 percentage points - when we focus only passive participants, where the

risk management considerations are paramount. Non-bank lenders, lacking the systematic

                                                  2
liquidity risk-hedging externality of bank transaction deposits, avoid credit lines, especially to

rated borrowers. Another way of making the same point: non-bank investors can successfully

compete with banks in term lending to rated borrowers, where they have around 1/3 of the

market share. In contrast, they have little impact on lending to those same borrowers in the

market for lines of credit because of the liquidity risk.


       In the first part of this paper, we validate the simple comparisons in Table 1 using

regressions of banks’ share of lenders within a very large sample of syndicated loans. In these

regressions, the key explanatory variables are the type of loan (lines v. term loans), the size of

the line and the type of borrower (rated v. unrated), and the interaction of these two

characteristics with the lines of credit indicator. We show that bank dominance is greatest in

lines of credit to rated borrowers, and that this effect can not be explained by borrower, lender,

loan, or deal characteristics. The link between systematic liquidity risk and bank dominance is

highlighted when we explicitly consider the size of the credit lines because larger tranches

expose the lenders to more systematic liquidity risk. We find much stronger dominance of bank

participant lenders when the systematic liquidity risk exposure is higher. In contrast, the

exposure has no effect for the lead banks. Because many of the deals come with two or more

facilities, we can compare banks’ share in lines v. term loans after sweeping out any

unobservable aspect of the deal with fixed effects. Our key results are robust to the inclusion of

these fixed effects. We then show that these results are driven completely by the role of banks as

participants, where risk management considerations are likely to dominate. In contrast, bank

share of all lead lenders does not vary at all with loan type or borrower type (or their interaction)

once we add control variable to the regressions.




                                                   3
       In the second part of the paper, we extend the bank specialization hypothesis by

comparing investment decisions across banks. We test how transactions deposits affect bank

originations in lines of credit relative to their total originations. Our approach has three

advantages over existing studies. The main advantage is that we measure banks’ ex ante

liquidity exposure in banks’ new lending.     The existing evidence relies on the stock of off-

balance sheet commitments relative to on-balance sheet loans from all past lending. These data

(from Call Reports) do not allow researchers to separate ex ante exposure (i.e. supply) from ex-

post realizations of liquidity demands because when borrowers draw funds, those funds move

onto the lender’s balance sheet. In contrast, our dependent variable measures the maximum

potential future exposure from lines of credit relative to a bank’s total exposure from all new

lending (i.e. lines of credit plus term loans). Our new ex ante measure is important because it

reveals qualitatively different results. For example, the dollar-weighted share of new loans with

liquidity exposure ranges up to 76% for the average bank in a given year, as opposed to 26% as

reported in prior studies. Second, we control for rated versus unrated borrowers, because credit

risk is evaluated more precisely for rated borrowers than for unrated borrowers. Third, we

separate our measure into exposures faced by lead banks v. participants. This helps us

distinguish between relationship management and liquidity-risk management motives. In

contrast to lead banks, participants concentrate on funding alone and thus focus on liquidity-risk

management to the exclusion of other factors.


       We find that bank investments in credit lines, as a fraction of total lending, increase with

transactions deposits5.   We then split liquidity exposure into two parts, depending on whether

borrowers are rated or unrated. The link from transactions deposits to liquidity exposure is

driven completely by the rated firms, suggesting that transactions deposits hedge systematic


                                                  4
liquidity shocks. Next, we contrast lending decisions by lead versus participant banks to

distinguish between liquidity risk management and relationship management. We find that

transactions deposits are positively related to liquidity exposure for both leads and participants,

but this effect is about 50% larger for the participant banks.


Background


       What is the nature of the deposit-lending synergy that allows banks to provide liquidity to

both borrowers and depositors? Kashyap et al. (2002) explain the combination of transactions

deposits and loan commitments with a risk-management motive. While holding cash raises costs

for both agency and tax reasons (Myers and Rajan, 1998), Kashyap et al. present a model where

as long as liquidity demands from depositors and borrowers are not highly correlated, an

intermediary will reduce its costly cash buffer by serving both customers. Thus, the KRS model

yields a diversification synergy between transactions deposits and unused loan commitments.

KRS report empirical evidence of a positive correlation across banks between unused loan

commitments and transactions deposits. However, they do not test the key implication of their

model that by exposing themselves to asset-side and liability-side liquidity risks simultaneously,

banks can benefit from a diversification synergy.


       Gatev and Strahan (2006) suggest a stronger hypothesis, supported by findings that the

correlation is not only low but is often negative. They show that a hedging externality can be

attributed to transaction deposits because flows into these accounts offset the systematic liquidity

risk exposure associated with origination of loan commitments and lines of credit. Gatev and

Strahan (2006) extend KRS by considering the possibility that liquidity production could expose

banks to systematic liquidity risk. A bank with many open credit lines may face a problem if


                                                  5
systematic increases in liquidity demand occur periodically.6 Gatev and Strahan (2006) show

that funding to banks increases when market liquidity declines, meaning that liquidity demands

become negatively correlated in tight markets. There are several reasons why banks enjoy

funding inflows when liquidity dries up. First, the banking system has explicit guarantees of its

liabilities.7 Second, banks have access to emergency liquidity support from the central bank.

Third, large banks such as Continental Illinois have been supported in the face of financial

distress (O’Hara and Shaw, 1990). Thus, funding inflows occur because banks are rationally

viewed as a safe haven for funds. Consistent with this notion, Pennacchi (2006) finds that during

the years before the introduction of federal deposit insurance, bank funding supply did not

increase when spreads tightened.


       Gatev, Schuermann and Strahan (2006) find evidence that supports the notion that

inflows into transaction deposits increase the capacity of banks to bear systematic liquidity risk.

They show that lower stock return volatility for banks with high levels of both unused

commitments and transactions deposits. The results suggest that bank risk, measured by stock

return volatility, increases with unused loan commitments, reflecting asset-side liquidity risk

exposure. This increase, however, is mitigated by transactions deposits. In fact, risk does not

increase with loan commitments for banks with high levels of transactions deposits. Gatev et al.

also show that these results are stronger during the 1998 ‘flight to quality’.


       The ability of banks to absorb liquidity shocks is especially important during market

crises. In a case study, Gatev, Schuermann and Strahan (2005) focus on the behavior of deposit

flows across banks during the 1998 crisis. During the three-months leading up to the crisis, bank

stock prices where buffeted by news of the Russian default, followed by the demise of LTCM in

late September, and finally by the drying up of the commercial paper market in the first weeks of

                                                  6
October.8 To understand how banks weathered the 1998 storm, Gatev et al. (2005) explore the

cross-sectional patterns in deposit flows. They found that first, investors moved funds from

markets into banks; second, banks with higher levels of transactions deposits before the crisis

had the largest flows of new money during the crisis; and third, that all of the flows of new

money were concentrated in bank demand deposits. This evidence indicates that banks

structured to bear increased demands for liquidity from borrowers (i.e. banks with transactions

deposits) could meet those demands easily (because money flowed into those accounts). Thus,

while government safety nets can explain why banks generally receive funding during crises, the

evidence from Gatev et al. as well as Kashyap et al. suggests that the structure of banks also is

important.


       Before the introduction of government safety nets, transactions deposits tended to expose

banks to liquidity risk when consumers removed deposits en-masse, either to increase

consumption or because they had lost confidence in the banking system. This bank-run problem

has traditionally been viewed as the primary source of liquidity risk and creates a public policy

rationale for FDIC insurance as well as reserve requirements for demand deposits (Diamond and

Dybvig, 1983). Today, in crisis investors run to banks, not away from them (at least they do in

the U.S.). And, banks funded with transactions accounts receive the inflow. Thus, rather than

open banks to liquidity risk, transactions deposits today help banks hedge that risk, which now

stems more from the lending side.




                                                 7
Research Design


       We report two sets of results. The first uses loan-level data to test whether loan type and

size determines banks’ share within loan syndicates. The second uses bank-level data to test how

banks’ investments across loan types vary with transactions deposits.


       To test whether liquidity risk exposure explains bank involvement in the loan syndicates,

we use Dealscan from 1991 to 2005 to build a facility-level dataset. We estimate regressions

with the following general structure:


       Fraction of bank lendersi,j,t= β1 Rated Borroweri,t + β2 Liquidity exposurei,j,t

               + β3 Tranche Sizei,j,t + β4 Rated Borroweri,t * Liquidity exposurei,j,t

               + β5 Liquidity exposurei,j,t * Tranche Sizei,j,t + εi,j,t   ,             (1)



where i is an index specific to the deal, and hence also specific to the borrower; j is an index

specific to the facility within each deal; and t is an index for years. We estimate the model with

three versions of the dependent variable. In the first, we compute Fraction of bank lenders = the

number of banks in the syndicate / total number of lenders.9 We then compute this ratio using

first just lead arrangers in the numerator and denominator, and second using just participants.

The explanatory variables of interest are indicators for Rated Borrower, Liquidity exposure

(equal to a credit line indicator), and Tranche Size = Logarithm of the tranche amount

(normalized by the log of all loans for that year), and also add interactions between Rated

Borrower and Liquidity exposure and between Liquidity exposure and Tranche Size in some

models. In the simple models (no interactions), systematic liquidity risk management gives



                                                     8
banks a comparative advantage, so β2 > 0. In models with the interactions, if that advantage is

more pronounced when the systematic liquidity risk exposure is greater, then β4 > 0 and β5 > 0.


       Equation (1) has some aspects of a panel regression, and we use panel techniques to

sweep out many potentially confounding variables. Dealscan contains facility-level data, with

more than one facility per deal in many cases (there are 1.4 facilities per deal on average). In

many cases, a deal will be composed of a term-loan and a line of credit. Moreover, the same

borrower may have many deals at different times. Given this structure, we can include annual

time dummies to sweep out market trends. We can also include borrower fixed effects to sweep

out variation in credit risk or other unobservable aspects of relationships between the borrower

and potential lenders. And, in some models we replace the borrower effects with deal-level fixed

effects. By including deal effects, we compare banks’ share of two facilities from the same deal.

The effects of liquidity exposure and its interaction with the rated indicator are identified because

many deals have both a lines of credit and a term loan. However, the direct effect of the rated

indicator (as well as all other borrower characteristics, even those that vary over time) are not

identified with deal-level fixed effects.


       Beyond the fixed effects, we also include additional loan terms in some models,

including Loan Price = Log of all-in spread; Loan is secured indicator; Loan Maturity = Log of

loan maturity. In addition, we control for lead arranger fixed effects in all models, and we also

include loan purpose fixed effects in all models. Finally, because the market for lead arrangers is

highly concentrated, and because lead arrangers directly shape the structure of the syndicate, we

also cluster the error in equation (1) at the level of the lead arranger. This is a very conservative

way to build standard errors because there are only 61 lead arrangers in the dataset.



                                                  9
       In our second set of tests, we construct data at the level of the bank-year, rather than at

the loan level. In these regressions, we test whether transactions deposits provide a hedge for

liquidity risk exposure, as follows:


       Incremental liquidity exposurei,t= αt + β1 Transactions Deposit/Total Depositsi,t-1 +

       β2 Prior liquidity exposurei,t-1 + Other controlsi,t-1 + εi,t ,                       (2)


where i is an index for banks; t is an index for years; and αt equals a year-specific intercept. We

include the annual time dummies to sweep out trends such as the gradual decline over time in

bank deposits. We follow KRS in using the ratio of transactions deposits to total deposits as our

measure of the potential hedge afforded by combining liquidity exposure on both sides of the

bank balance sheet. Based on the notion that transaction deposits hedge liquidity risk exposure,

we expect that β1 > 0. On the other hand, prior commitments could be negatively correlated with

incremental liquidity risk exposure (reflecting a bank’s hesitance to become too exposed to

liquidity), or positively correlated with incremental liquidity exposure (reflecting a bank’s

market specialization).


       The dependent variable in (2) equals the relative importance of liquidity to a bank’s total

new lending during the year, where: Incremental Liquidity Exposurei,t = (New commitments on

lines of crediti,t) / (new commitments on linesi,t + new commitments on term loansi,t). We use

four proxies to construct new commitments for bank i in year t:


       (1) New commitmentsi,t = Σj Commitmenti,j,t*sharei,j,t               (j indexes new loans)
       (2) New commitmentsi,t = Σj Commitmenti,j,t*maturityi,j,t*sharei,j,t
       (3) New commitmentsi,t = Σj Commitmenti,j,t*(1/Ni,j,t)
       (4) New commitmentsi,t = Σj Commitmenti,j,t*maturity*(1/Ni,j,t)                        (3)




                                                   10
        As noted, the numerator of our liquidity measure includes commitments on just lines of

credit, whereas the denominator includes commitments for all types of new loans. Thus, the

ratio measures the relative importance of new lending that exposes the bank to liquidity risk.

The first measure uses the Dealscan data on each bank’s share of funding (sharei,j,t). This

variable, however, is missing for a large number of observations (more than 50%), so we

construct a second measure in which each bank’s share is assumed to equal 1/number of

participants (Ni,j,t). The other two measures weight the commitment amounts by the maturity of

the loan.


        For control variables, we include bank characteristics (from the fourth quarter of the year

before banks’ new loans were originated, labeled t-1) and contemporaneous borrower

characteristics. The bank characteristics include the following: Prior liquidity Exposure =

Existing un-drawn commitments / (loans + commitments); Deposits = Total deposits / assets;

Bank size = Log of assets; Capital ratio = Book value of equity / assets; Balance-sheet liquidity

= (Cash + securities) / assets .


Data


        We build our measures of banks’ share of loan syndicates and bank liquidity exposure

from Loan Pricing Corporation’s Dealscan. These data offer the most complete record of bank

lending to large businesses currently available. Dealscan provides data on the identity of the

borrower; whether or not the borrower has a credit rating (as well as borrower sales and

industry); the name, type (bank v. non-bank) and role of each lender (lead v. participant); the

percentage of each loan funded by each lender; the loan amount and type (lines of credit versus

term loans); and price and non-price terms (collateral & maturity).10 We use data for 1991 to


                                                11
2005. This sample period reflects several data limitations. First, prior to 1991, Dealscan

coverage was relatively poor. Second, there are no data from Call Reports on unused

commitments prior to 1991, which we use in our second set of tests.


       In our first set of regressions (recall equation 1 above), we build the share of banks in the

syndicate for each loan facility in Dealscan. We then decompose this share into banks’ share of

lead arrangers, and banks’ share of participants. In classifying lenders, we rely on Dealscan’s

lender role variable. We define any lender that plays an active role as a ‘lead’. The Dealscan

variable takes on many different values for lenders that are ‘active’. For example, 18% of the

observations are coded as ‘admin agent’; 7.5% are coded as ‘co-agent’; 6.5% as ‘documentation

agent’, and so on. In about 46% of the observations, a lender is coded as a ‘participant’. We

define a lender as playing some kind of active role if Dealscan does not code the bank as

‘participant’. For lender type, we define the following types as banks: ‘US bank’; ‘African

bank’; ‘Asia-Pacific bank’; ‘East. European / Russian Bank’; ‘Foreign bank’; ‘Middle Eastern

Bank’; and ‘Western European Bank’. The vast majority of the observations are either US banks

or Western European banks. For loan type, we code the following three types as facilities as

lines of credit: “Revolver/Line < 1 Yr.”, “Revolver/Line >= 1 Yr.,” and “364-Day Facility.”

There are some facilities that are neither liquidity nor standard term loans such as standby letters

of credit. Our results are robust to dropping these loans.


       For our final dataset, we keep all loans with at least one lead arranger and one participant.

In our simplest specifications, this filter yields a dataset with more than 42,000 loans made over

the 1991 to 2005 period. When we add controls for other loan terms, the sample falls to about




                                                 12
34,000 loans. However, as noted earlier, we cluster by the small number of lead arrangers in all

of the models, so the large sample size does not lead to unreasonably small standard errors.


       For the analysis at the level of the bank-year (equation 2), we compute the total amount

of new lending made by each bank lender by summing across the dollar amount committed by

that lender during each year from 1991 to 2005. We then split the commitments into amounts

with liquidity risk (lines of credit) and amounts without liquidity risk (other loans). For bank

characteristics, we merge the Dealscan annual aggregate data to the Call Reports from the end of

year previous year.11 Call Reports contain data on bank size (assets), unused existing loan

commitments, liability structure, capital, and balance-sheet liquidity, all of which we use in our

main tests. After combining the two datasets we are left with an unbalanced panel spanning

1991 to 2005, with bank-year as the unit of observation. The final sample includes about 120

(mostly large) banks per year, or between 1,400 and 1,700 bank-year observations overall

(depending on the set of controls included in the model).


Syndicate Structure: Banks dominate in lending with systematic liquidity risk


       As we describe in the introduction, Table 1 highlights the overwhelming importance of

banks in syndicated loans, particularly those with liquidity exposure. We now report rigorous

tests of our main hypothesis with a series of fixed effects models, where the dependent variable

is the overall fraction of lenders that are banks. Table 2 reports summary statistics for the

explanatory variables in the model. About 58% of the facilities are lines of credit, and about one

third of these are to rated borrowers (18% of the whole sample), where we argue that systematic

liquidity risk exposure is greatest. For the other loan terms, the average facility size is $187

million, the average all-in spread is about 220 basis points over LIBOR, 38% of the loans are


                                                 13
secured, and the average maturity is 49 months. There are 1,658 lenders across the sample of

loans; 772 of these lenders are banks and the others are non-bank institutions.


       In Table 3, we report four specifications for banks’ share, with borrower or deal fixed

effects and with and without the other loan terms (log of the facility size, log of the all-in spread,

a secured loan indicator and the log of the loan maturity). All specifications include time, lead

lender, and loan purpose fixed effects.12 The results show that the fraction of bank lenders in

syndicated loans to rated borrowers increases with liquidity risk. For the simple specifications

without the size of the tranche amount (columns 1 and 3), the coefficient on the lines of credit

indicator ranges from 0.023 to 0.048, meaning that banks hold 2.3% to 4.8% more in lines of

credit to unrated borrowers, relative to term loans. This result is refined in the other two

specifications that include a measure of the size of the liquidity risk exposure. When we include

the size of the tranche amount and its interaction (columns 2 and 4), the interaction between the

credit line indicator and the log of the tranche amount is highly significant and ranges between

0.228 and 0.347. Thus, larger lines that expose lenders to more liquidity risk are syndicated with

a larger share of bank lenders than smaller lines. Next, the interaction between the credit line

indicator and the rated borrower indicator is statistically and economically powerful, ranging

between 0.047 and 0.058. The coefficient of 0.058 can be interpreted as showing that the

fraction of bank lenders is about 6% higher for lines of credit with systematic liquidity risk

compared to lines of credit where liquidity risk is more idiosyncratic. The effect is robust across

the four models, as the coefficient increases with the inclusion of controls for loan terms and

deal, loan-purpose, borrower and lead-lender effects. Taken together the results show that banks

as a fraction of all lenders dominate syndicated credit lines to rated borrowers.




                                                  14
       Table 4 sharpens the results in Table 3 by separately considering participant lender share

versus lead lender share. The table shows that as passive participants, banks dominate rated

borrower syndicates (loans with systematic liquidity risk exposure). For participant lenders, the

coefficient on the interaction between the credit line indicator and the rated borrower indicator is

statistically and economically significant, ranging between 0.063 and 0.079. The coefficient of

0.079 can be interpreted as showing that on average, when a syndicated loan to a rated borrower

has systematic liquidity risk, the fraction of passive participant lenders that are banks is about 8%

higher than for lines with idiosyncratic liquidity risk. The key comparison is with lead lenders,

where both the direct effect of the lines of credit indicator (in 3 of the 4 models), as well as its

interaction with the rated borrower indicator are not significant. The results are robust across

specifications that include controls for loan terms, and deal, borrower and lender effects.


       The crucial link between higher systematic liquidity risk exposure and stronger bank

dominance of the syndicate becomes evident in the more detailed specifications including the

size of the systematic liquidity risk exposures. For participant lenders, the coefficient on the

interaction between the credit line indicator and the size of the tranche is statistically and

economically significant, ranging between 0.311 and 0.471. In contrast, that interaction is not

significant for the lead lenders. As before the results are robust across specifications that include

controls for loan terms, and deal, borrower and lender effects. Thus, syndicate structure for

participation – where funding and the associated credit and liquidity risks are all that matter - is

driven by the comparative advantage of banks to manage liquidity exposure. The identity of lead

arrangers, in contrast, does not vary across loan or borrower types, suggesting that risk

management concerns are less important relative to relationship considerations between

borrowers and their lenders.


                                                  15
       The distribution of loan exposure reflects a risk-sharing arrangement where banks bear

the systematic liquidity risk exposure, while non-banks shoulder credit risk exposure that can be

securitized and dispersed further among investors. This is consistent with activity in loan

secondary markets, where Drucker and Puri (2007) find that only 34% of loans traded are lines

of credit, while over 70% of the loans in their comparison group of non-traded loans are lines of

credit. Much of the demand to purchase these loans comes from non-bank financial institutions,

which explains the low level of volume for lines of credit.


Bank specialization stems from access to transaction deposits


       To link banks’ dominance in lending on lines of credit to their access to transactions

deposits, we now test how investments vary with the structure of bank balance sheets. Table 5

reports summary statistics for the bank-level data. This analysis is similar to Kashyap et al.

(2002), but we use Dealscan as our source for the dependent variable, rather than relying on

unused loan commitments from Call Reports. Table 5 illustrates the advantage of using

Dealscan. The dollar-weighted share of new loans with liquidity exposure ranges from 65% to

76% for the average bank in a given year. In contrast, KRS report a median value of just 26%

for large banks from Call Report; this figure is close to the 30% mean we report for existing

exposure (undrawn commitments / (undrawn commitments + loans)). Part of this difference

between existing commitments and new liquidity exposure occurs because the Call Report data

include draw-down realizations; once a borrower draws funds from a line, those funds move

from the off-balance sheet accounts onto the lender’s balance sheet. Thus, the old variable

contains substantial measurement error. This commitment ratio could be low, for example,

either because the bank chose not to supply much liquidity, or because the bank experienced an



                                                16
unusually high realization of liquidity demand. Table 5 also highlights the fact that our sample

focuses mainly on the largest banks. The mean size, for example, equals $33 billion in assets.

       Table 5 also reports summary statistics for the lead share for each bank-year. This

variable is constructed in a similar way to our measure of liquidity exposure, where for each

bank we sum its total lending in which it acts as the lead lender, relative to its total new lending

during the year. The four measures range from 0.28 to 0.37, although some of our banks are

almost always lead lenders while others are almost always participants. For example, in 2001

Dealscan reports that First Merit bank participated in 10 loans, but only as a participant. In

contrast, Dealscan records that Citibank acted as a lead bank in 95% of its total 2001 lending

(almost 1,000 loans).


       Table 6 reports the main bank specialization regression results. We estimate the model

using the information on each bank’s actual lending shares within the syndicate (see equation3,

measure 1 above). Loans for which the share is missing are not included. Each regression

includes unreported time effects, and we cluster the residual at the bank level in computing

standard errors. To establish the main result, moving from the left to right columns we report a

series of models in which we introduce an increasing number of control variables. As the table

shows, the effect of transactions deposits on the liquidity exposure variable is stable across these

six specifications. The coefficient on transactions deposits equals 0.44 in the simplest model,

which includes only annual time indicators, falls to 0.37 when we add the log of bank assets, and

then remains at that level as we add past commitments, total deposits to assets, capital to assets,

and the balance sheet liquidity ratio. The fit of the model improves with these additional

variables, but the basic finding does not. In all six models the key coefficient is statistically

significant at better than one percent. Moreover, the effect of transactions deposits is


                                                  17
economically large. A standard deviation increase in this variable comes with an increase in

lending that exposes the bank to liquidity risk of about 4.3 percentage points (0.36 * 0.12 =

0.043). This effect is similar in magnitude to the effect of a standard deviation increase in the

log of bank assets (σ = 1.48), where a standard deviation increase comes with an increase in

liquidity exposure of about 4.4 percentage points (1.48 * 0.03 = 0.044).


       In Table 7, we test whether the results vary with the way we construct our measure of

liquidity exposure, the dependent variable. In this table, we report regressions using each of the

four measures of bank liquidity exposure defined above. (Column 1 of Table 7 replicates

column 6 of Table 6.) The table shows that banks with more transactions deposits expose

themselves to more liquidity risk in subsequent lending relative to other banks across all four

measures. Coefficient magnitudes are larger when we use all loans to build the dependent

variable (comparing columns 1 & 3 with 2 & 4). This difference makes sense because columns 2

& 4 implicitly give more weight to participant banks relative to lead banks (lead-bank share

averages around 30%, compared to about 10% for participants), and, as we show below, the

relationships that we estimate are stronger for participant banks. Magnitudes are not affected by

whether or not we weight commitments by maturity (comparing columns 1 & 2 with 3 & 4).

This similarity may reflect the distinction between contractual maturity (observable) and de facto

maturity (unobservable). Contractual maturity for 22% of the lines of credit equals 364 days

exactly, presumably to avoid a capital requirement on the un-drawn funds under the Basel I

Capital Accord.13 Banks routinely roll over these “364-day facilities” each year, however, so the

de facto maturity may be much longer than what we can observe.


       Tables 6 & 7 also show that large banks are more active suppliers of liquidity facilities

than smaller banks, which may in part reflect the greater demand for liquidity from large

                                                 18
borrowers that are more likely to be served by large banks. In addition, large banks may be

better able to manage systematic liquidity risk than smaller banks. For example, large banks

typically have better access to overnight liquidity in the Federal Funds market than smaller

banks. Also, we find a negative correlation between the capital ratio and the relative importance

of liquidity. This negative relationship could in part reflect the impact of the Basel I capital

treatment for un-drawn commitments (zero for loans with maturity less than one year), and

because the expected loss on lines of credit is lower than expected losses on term loans.


Robustness Tests


       We have conducted several (unreported) robustness tests on the statistical procedure that

we have used to estimate the models in Tables 6 & 7. First, we have estimated a weighted least-

squares procedure, where weights depend on the number of loans originated by a bank during the

year. The logic of this weighting scheme is that there may be less error in the dependent

variable, and hence less variance in the residual, for banks making more loans. This weighting

approach, however, essentially means giving more weight to large banks. These results are

qualitatively consistent for the transactions deposit coefficient and remain statistically significant

(t-statistics > 3), although the coefficient magnitudes decrease. The effect of bank size in the

weighted regression falls and loses statistical significance.


       In a second set of tests, we have added a bank-specific component to the error term and

compute both the ‘within’ and ‘between’ estimator. Here we again find similar results. Relative

to the pooled OLS model in Table 7, column 1 (transaction deposit coefficient = 0.36), the

between estimator equals 0.49 (t-statistic = 3.12) and the within estimator equals 0.26 (t-statistic

= 2.04). The ‘between’ estimator essentially builds off a single cross-section, based on the time-



                                                  19
series averaged data for each bank. As an alternative, we have estimated year-by-year cross

sectional regression and find that the positive effect of transactions deposits is consistent over

time.


        Third, we have compared the relative share of liquidity risk born by non-bank lenders in

the Dealscan sample to the share of all banks (even those that we are not able to match to Call

Report). If transactions deposits afford banks a special ability to bear liquidity risk, then banks

should expose themselves to more liquidity risk relative to other intermediaries without access to

deposits. The non-bank lenders include investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds and

finance companies. As shown in Table 5, about 75% of banks’ overall exposure in lending is

associated with liquidity in our sample. This percentage is similar using all banks in Dealscan.

For non-banks, the percentage of exposure in liquidity facilities is only around 30%; and the 40

percentage point gap remains stable over time. In particular, there is no trend toward

convergence in these portfolio shares.14


Borrower Characteristics: Rated versus Unrated Firms


        If banks with high levels of transactions deposits have a comparative advantage in

bearing liquidity risk, we would expect to see this advantage shape not only the type of product

offered but also the kinds of borrowers served. Banks with liquidity hedging capacity should tilt

their lending toward larger firms and rated firms – firms where credit quality is relatively easy to

assess and where liquidity risk, particularly systematic liquidity risk, is likely to be more

important.


        Table 8 decomposes the liquidity exposure into two components, one stemming from

rated borrowers and the other stemming from unrated borrowers. Liquidity demanded from rated


                                                  20
borrowers should capture systematic liquidity risk exposure of the lender better than unrated

borrowers’ demand because rated borrowers normally rely on markets for their primary source of

funds and only use bank liquidity as insurance against market pullbacks. The results indicate

that all of the positive association between transactions deposits and liquidity exposure comes

from these large rated firms.15 The coefficient on the exposure from unrated firms is consistently

small, negative and not statistically significant. This result is consistent with the implications of

KRS and Gatev and Strahan (2006) - transactions deposits provide a hedge for the liquidity risk

exposure of the bank, and this hedge acts most powerfully when borrower demands for liquidity

are likely to impose a systematic risk on the lender.


Lead vs. Participant Banks


       As shown earlier, banks’ share in loan syndicates varies with liquidity risk of the loan

only for participations; we find no consistent effects of liquidity risk on banks’ share among lead

arrangers. This suggests that the portfolio allocation decisions of participant banks ought to

reflect their access to transactions deposits much more than banks that act mainly as lead

arrangers. So, we next consider separately each bank’s exposure to liquidity risk, depending on

whether the bank acts mainly as a lead lender (i.e. the bank has above-median share of loans as a

lead) or not (i.e the bank has below-median share of loans as a lead). Our identifying assumption

is that participant banks rely on the lead lender for negotiation and pricing of loans, and they also

rely to a large though not perfect degree on the lead in cases of covenant violations or default.

Thus, the pure risk management advantage of transactions deposits ought to matter more for

banks that act mainly as passive participants, while the lead bank has to take account not only of

diversification but also its ability to understand the borrower and monitor over the life of the

loan. Lead banks as monitors of the borrower face a moral hazard problem relative to

                                                 21
participants. This problem is solved in part through incentives (e.g. lead banks keep some ‘skin’

in the game by holding the largest piece of syndicated loans, and they do so more when

borrowers are opaque) and in part through reputation. Thus, given a large transaction deposit

base, systematic liquidity-risk management is likely to be second order in importance for lead

banks.


         In Table 9, we re-estimate our model of liquidity exposure after splitting the sample

based on the lead-bank share. We split at the median of the actual lead-bank share.16 We find a

larger effect of hedging-capacity on loan portfolio decisions for passive investor banks. For the

participants, the coefficient on transactions deposits ranges from 0.38 to 0.49. In contrast, for

banks that specialize in leading loan syndicates, the coefficient ranges from 0.21 to 0.32. These

results confirm our central argument that transactions deposits are critical for systematic liquidity

risk management, which in this case is the primary risk management objective of syndicate

participant banks.


         In another set of (unreported) tests, we have also decomposed our initial dependent

variable into two parts, one reflecting the total commitments made on lines where a given bank

acts as the lead lender, and the other reflecting total commitments on lines where the bank acts

only as a passive participant.17 In this approach, there are two liquidity measures for each bank.

We use the same denominator as before (total exposure), so the sum of these two variables

equals the original measure of liquidity exposure from the prior tables. This decomposition

allows us to separate the relationship management motive (attributed to the lead bank) from the

pure liquidity risk management motive (which we assume drives the portfolio decisions of

participant banks) without splitting the sample. In other words, we are testing whether banks

manage their own liquidity exposure differently depending on whether or not they act as lead on

                                                 22
a given loan. These results are similar to the approach where we split the sample based on a

bank’s overall emphasis on lead lending. That is, we find that the effect of transactions deposits

is about 50% larger for banks’ liquidity exposures as participants compared to their exposures as

leads.


Conclusions


         The structure of loan syndicates typically involves banks, whose unique capacity to

hedge systematic liquidity risk allows them to fund credit lines with little competition from

outside the banking system. In contrast, non-bank lenders, who do not enjoy the systematic

liquidity risk-hedging externality of transaction deposits, avoid syndicated credit lines but

shoulder much of the credit risk exposure than can be securitized and dispersed further among

investors (e.g. term lending). Banks bear the systematic liquidity risk exposure because their

access to funds expands elastically in response to declines in market liquidity. This competitive

advantage stems largely from the government safety nets protecting the banking system.


         Within the banking system, those banks with more transactions deposits in turn have a

comparative advantage in supplying lines of credit over other banks. The advantage stems from

two sources. First, by combining transactions deposits and loan commitments, a bank can hedge

out the idiosyncratic demands for liquidity from depositors and borrowers. Second, investors

tend to move money into transaction deposits during periods of market turmoil. These funding

inflows provide a generic hedge for unexpected liquidity shortages during market-wide shocks,

and they help banks supply credit when markets would not do so.


         Our results show that banks’ funding advantage shows up most notably in lines of credit

to rated firms, where liquidity risk is likely to contain a significant systematic component, and

                                                 23
also when banks act mainly as passive participants. Lead banks are responsible for information

production and monitoring the relationship with the borrower over time; hence, their specific

liquidity position is less important in driving their portfolio decisions. Our results support the

idea that syndicate structure is explained by credit and systematic liquidity risk management.

Banks participation in syndicates is driven by their competitive advantage in hedging systematic

liquidity risk that stems from a key synergy linking deposits to lending.

This table reports regressions of the number of banks as a share of total lenders for syndicated loans, where the shares are computed separately for lead banks and for participant banks. Explanatory
variables include indicators for rated borrowers, lines of credit and their interaction, along with borrower and loan control variables. Observations vary at the loan level, rather than at the bank level, but
standard errors clustered by lead arranger (61 clusters).

This table reports a regression of the share of a bank's new loans that are lines of credit and thus expose the bank to future liquidity exposure, as a function of the
prior year's characteristics. The unit of observation varies by bank-year. The sample includes about 120 banks per year, from 1991 to 2005. All regressions include
year indicator variables.

  Nandy and Pei (2007) and Ivashina and Sun (2007) study the role of institutional investors in the syndicated
lending market. Nandy and Pei focus on the fact that many institutional investors participate in high risk and high
yield loans. Ivashina and Sun offer evidence that such lending in some cases gives investors access to private
information.
2
  For example, Dennis & Mullineaux (2000), Lee & Mullineaux (2004), Jones, Lang and Nigro (2005) and Sufi
(2007) all report evidence that the share of the lead bank and the concentration of the syndicate reflect borrower
opacity and the resulting moral hazard problem. Ivashina (2007) uses risk management concerns (industry-level
diversification) as an instrument that shifts a lead bank’s willingness to fund a fraction of a loan and finds that prices
reflect the lead bank’s incentive to monitor effectively. Her study suggests that lead banks trade off risk
management concerns against their need to preserve monitoring incentives.
3
  Early literature attempts to understand how banks’ role in liquidity production leads to fragility. Diamond and
Dybvig (1983) argue that by pooling their funds in an intermediary, agents can insure against idiosyncratic liquidity
shocks while still investing most of their wealth in high-return but illiquid projects. This structure leads to the
potential for a self-fulfilling bank run and sets up a policy rationale for deposit insurance. More recent theoretical
and empirical studies focus on liquidity risk from the asset side. For example, Berger and Bouwman (2006)
document the importance of banks in liquidity production on both sides of bank balance sheets, and show that this
role has grown sharply over time. There is also a growing literature showing the liquidity-risk management or
liquidity shocks to banks affect loan supply. See Paravisini (2004), Kwaja and Mian (2005), Loutskina (2005) and
Loutskina and Strahan (2006).

    Holding cash raises costs for both agency and tax reasons (Myers and Rajan, 1998).
5
 The result holds under four measures of exposure (the dependent variable) and under various statistical models and
specifications (e.g. GLS v. OLS; within v. between regressions; with or without controls for bank and borrower
characteristics).
6
  For example, during the first weeks of October 1998, following the coordinated restructuring of the hedge fund
Long Term Capital Management, spreads between safe Treasury securities and risky commercial paper rose
dramatically. Many large firms were consequently unable to roll over their commercial paper as it came due,
leading to a sharp reduction in the amount of commercial paper outstanding and a corresponding increase in take-
downs on pre-existing lines of credit (Saidenberg and Strahan, 1999). As a result of this market pullback, banks
faced a spike in demand for cash as many of their largest customers drew funds from pre-existing backup lines of
credit.
7
 Deposit insurance limits have recently been expanded for the first time sine 1980. In addition, some small banks
have begun to avoid binding limits on deposit insurance by splitting very large deposits across multiple institutions.
For a broad discussion for deposit insurance and policy ramifications, see Kroszner and Strahan (2005).

 For policy discussion on LTCM, see Edwards (1999). For a discussion of bank exposure to the hedge fund, see
Kho, Dong and Stulz (2002) and Furfine (2002).

 Note that this is equivalent to assuming equal dollar shares for each bank. The results are qualitatively similar if we
use actual dollar weighted shares, but these are not available for 60% of the data (see below). Moreover, the
correlation between the dollar weighted and equal-weighted bank shares is around 0.99, for both lead and participant
banks, so we use the full sample and report equal-weighted bank shares.

  Since many loans have more than one lead lender, we include a fixed effect for the lead holding the largest share
of the loan. If the share is missing, we select one of the lead arrangers randomly to define the fixed effect. Note that
the results do not change if we drop the lead arranger fixed effects.
13
  Under the 1988 Basel I Capital Accord, capital requirements for un-drawn loan commitments under one year
equal zero. For off-balance sheet loan commitments above one year, however, banks are required to hold capital
reflecting the credit quality of the counterparty (crudely measured). This regulatory loophole will be closed under
the revision to the Capital Accord (“Basel II”).
14
  This difference is even evident controlling for borrower fixed effects. In other words, there are many deals with
both a liquidity facility and a term loan. Typically banks fund most of the liquidity facility, while non-bank lenders
are more likely to specialize in funding only the term loan piece.
15
  Because the sum of dependent variables in Table 6 equal those used earlier, the coefficients in the model for rated
and unrated exposures (e.g. columns 1 & 5, 2& 6, etc.) add up to the coefficients from Table 3.
16
  As a robustness test not reported here, we also split at the median of the predicted lead-bank share. This second
split depends only a bank’s characteristics in the prior year. Also, this second split is not based on bank size. The
results are similar to the ones reported in the paper.
17
     This last test is not reported here but is available from the authors.
