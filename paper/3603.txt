        DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF EXC}IANGE—RATE ESCAPE CLAUSES


                               ABSTRACT

        This paper studies the merits of policy rules with escape

clauses, analyzing as an example fixed exchange-rate systems that
allow member countries the freedom to realign in periods of

stress. Motivating this example is the debate within the
European Monetary System over how quickly to move from the

current regime of national currencies, linked by pegged but

adjustable exchange rates, to a single European currency.
        The paper's main point is that while well—designed rules

with escape clauses can raise society's welfare in principle,
limited credibility makes it difficult for governments to

implement such rules in practice. An EMS-type institution -

which presumably imposes a political cost on policytnakers who
realign — may lead to an optimal escape-clause equilibrium, but

may just as well lead to alternative equilibria far inferior to

an irrevocably fixed exchange rate. Countries can suffer periods

in which no realignment occurs, yet unemployment, real wages, and
ex post real interest rates remain persistently and suboptimally

high.

     Institutional restraints on monetary policy typically make

special provision for exceptional circumstances. In times of

economic crisis, a gold standard may be suspended, a monetary

growth target breached, or an exchange rate realigned despite a

previous international agreement fixing its level. Underlying such

escape clauses is the idea that while institutional discipline is

on the whole a good thing, social welfare may be improved if

policymakers are granted discretion in the face of unusually

severe shocks.t

     This paper studies the merits of policy rules with escape

clauses, analyzing as an example fixed exchange-rate systems that

allow member countries the freedom to realign in periods of

stress. Motivating this example is the debate within the European

Monetary System over how quickly to move from the current regime

of national currencies, linked by pegged but adjustable exchange

rates, to a single European currency.

     The paper's main point is that while well-designed rules with

escape clauses can raise welfare in principle, limited credibility

makes it difficult for governments to implement thea in practice.

The problem is that an EMS-type institution — which presumably

imposes a political cost on policymakers who realign — may lead to

an optimal escape-clause equilibrium, but may just as well result

in alternative equilibria far inferior to an irrevocably fixed

exchange rate.2 Countries can suffer periods in which no

(1989, 1990), Lohmann (1990), and Persson and Tabellini (1990).
2Cukierman (1990) shows how multiple equilibria can arise in a
model with a costly devaluation option. In his model, however,
exchange-rate changes play no stabilization role, so rigidly fixed


                                1
realignment occurs, yet unemployment, real wages, and ax post real

interest rates remain persistently and suboptimally high (probably

a good description of Italy's recent experience).3

    The paper is organized as follows. Section I sets out a model

along the lines of Kydlsnd and Prescott (1977) and Barro and

Gordon (1983), in which a policymaker faces an incentive to raise

employment above its natural rate through surprise currency

depreciation. The policymaker has an informational advantage over

the private sector, however, so policy interventions can play some

stabilizing role. But leaving the policymaker free to stabilize

entails a cost, as it imparts an inflationary bias to the economy.

An optimal fixed exchange rate with realignment clauses, analyzed

in section II, efficiently trades off higher mean inflation

against more effective stabilization.

     The policy rule described in section II           i s not time

consistent. Section III describes how a fixed personal cost of



exchange rates are, by assumption, socially optimal. The model
developed below has very different properties. Lewis (1989)
mentions the possibility of multiple equilibria in a model where
governments face fixed costs of entering into temporary
international policy-coordination agreements. For a general
discussion of the drawbacks of non-credible fixed exchange rates,
including possible multiple equilibria, see Obstfeld (1985).
3Despite the stated desire for policy convergence within the EMS,
Italy's 1989 unemployment rate stood at 12.0 percent (compared
with a European Community average of 9.6); its unit labor costs
increased in that year by 6.3 percent (compared with an EC average
of 2.6 percent); and its annualized nominal three-month treasury
bill rate was 12.7 percent (compared with three-month interbank
rates of 9.3 percent in France and 7.1 percent in Germany). (See
International Monetary Fund 1990.) Of course, Italy's large and
growing public debt/GNP ratio must be reckoned as an additional
source of credibility problems; and it may be part of the reason
why Italy has suffered persistent inflation above the EC average.
Calvo (1988) presents a theoretical analysis of multiple
 equilibria in a setting of public-debt devaluation.



                                  2
realigning, imposed on the policymaker by society, may induce him

to implement the socially optimal escape-clause rule.4 But this is

not the only possible outcome, as section IV shows. Even if

society imposes the "correct" fixed cost, there may well be

multiple equilibria, some leading to welfare levels far below the

one achieved under an unconditionally fixed exchange rate.

     Section V summarizes the principal results and concludes.



I. Commitment vs. Discretion in a Standard Model



The analytical framework is a standard model of monetary policy

choice, adapted to a small open economy.

     On each date t, a policymaker sets the (log) exchange rate e

(the price of foreign money in terms of domestic money). At the

same time, the labor market determines an economy-wide nominal

wage w1 (also a log), at which workers agree to supply all the

labor that firms demand on date t+l.

     There is a single consumption good available; because its

foreign-currency price is fixed, the exchange rate can be

identified with the domestic price level. Labor-market equilibrium

is assumed to require a constant expected real wage of 1. Thus if

EJe I   Itll   is the date t—l conditional expectation of the date t

exchange rate, the wage negotiated on date t—l for date t is




4The general idea is related to Rogoff's (1985) argument that
society may be able to increase its welfare, not by altering
policymakers' incentives, but by choosing policymakers with
preferences different from its own.

(1) w E{et I                  Itl}.
The information set 't—l' which is common to the government and

private sector,                includes full and accurate data on the
government's incentives and constraints.

          Labor demand on date t is inversely related to the real wage

      —
          e   and an employment shock                     that is realized at the start

of period t, before date t labor demand is determined but too late

to affect the prenegotiated nominal wage. The equation for date t

employment, n, is



(2)           —   *    +              —
                                          E{et   I
                                                     Itl}] —     — k].



In (2), n* should be thought of as the employment level targeted

by the policymaker, while k > 0 represents a fixed distortion in

the economy that causes employment to deviate systematically from

n*. (Of course,                 Ic will be the source of the policymaker's

credibility problem.) The shock                           is serially uncorrelated with

zero mean.

          The policymaker's preferences entail a tradeoff between

employment levels closer to n* and inflation rates farther from

his target of zero inflation. Specifically, on any date t the

policymaker would like to minimize the present discounted value of

current and future expected period-by-period losses L,

Above, e —     e1         is domestic inflation, 0 < $ < 1, and 0 > 0.

The costs measured by (3) are assumed to be true social costs.

     While labor markets pre-set               in ignorance of the realized

value of u, the policymaker is assumed to set the exchange rate

after having observed the shock. In general the policymaker will

want to use the exchange rate to offset some of the effect of

on employment —        for     example, by unexpectedly depreciating the

currency      (raising e above e1 by an amount exceeding
labor-market expectations) when u turns out to be positive.

     There are at least two distinct policymaking processes that

might govern this management of the exchange rate. Under
discretion authorities choose e each period to maximize

without regard to any policies that might have been announced in

the past; in particular, discretionary policymaking takes past

expectations as given. Since the model assumes no intertemporal

linkages,5 the optimal policy under diacretion is to maximize

Lt given E{et I It_l} as well as u. The exchange-rate change

chosen in a discretionary regime therefore is

     Under commitment, however, the authority binds itself ox ante

for all t     0 to an irrevocable exchange-rate rule of the form



5Note that "reputational" trigger-strategy equilibria              are not
considered.

(5) e —        — e(uk).

In what follows I will use the unconditional expected policy loss

as a "Rawlsian" welfare criterion for ranking policy regimes.

Under commitment, then, the authority solves the problem: Find a

function e(u,k) that minimizes the unconditional expectation

E{A0} subject to e —    e1     —
                                   e(uk)   and E{e I

                                                                   e1 +
E{E(uk) i} for all t        0.6 (Note that the choice of policy

rule is made in ignorance of the initial realization u0.7) In a

linear-quadratic setting the optimal policy rule c(uk) is
linear; it is easy to verify that the rule



                   —
(6) e(uIc) =   e       e1   = Au



is optimal under commitment, where A e [0,1] is defined in (4).

     According to (6), the authority partially counters employment

shocks through exchange-rate surprises, to a degree inversely

related to the relative inflation-aversion coefficient G/m, but it

makes no attempt to offset the systematic employment distortion

k. Mean inflation is zero under this commitment regime, and the

(unconditional) expected policy loss is


61n fact, to obtain the commitment equilibrium it suffices that
for any t 0, the government be able to bind itself on date t—l
to the exchange-rate rule it will follow on date t.
71n reality a government choosing an optimal binding rule might do
so knowing u0 (or more generally, knowing something about the
state of the economy over the near future). This knowledge would
contaminate its choice of rule, with the degree of contamination
depending inversely on the size of the discount factor /3.

        Under discretion the exchange rate is set by (4). Rational

expectations in the labor market ensure that in equilibrium

              YE(1Th



        EAD exceeds EAC for a well-known reason: unless he can commit

to zero mean inflation, the policymaker is free to try offsetting

the distortion k through a surprise reduction in real wages. But

the cost of this distortion, ak2 in (7), is irreducible. Since the

labor market understands the authority's goals, equilibrium wages

incorporate inflation expectations and thus rise at rate Ak/(l —

A) [see eq. (8)]. As a result, the additional policy loss implied

by a discretionary regime is 9A2k2/(l — A)2.

        One particular rule —    suboptimal within the narrow confines
of the present model —      is   a fixed exchange rate: e =        for
all t. The expected loss under this rule is

A fixed rate allows for no policy response to the disturbance u,

so E(AC —     IT) — (a — -y)a2,       the gain due to optimal stabilization.

However, the fixed rate does avoid the secular inflation, at rate

Ak/(l —    A),    implied by a discretionary regime. So in general, a

comparison of ElT (fixed rates) with EAD (pure discretion) is

ambiguous, depending in an obvious way on the values of 9/a, A,

and a.



II. Nondiscretionary Escape Clauses



When the potential gains from stabilization are significant, a

fixed exchange rate regime that allows discretion in exceptional

circumstances may raise welfare compared to an unconditionally

 fixed rate. At the same time, a regime of pure discretion may be

 improved if some statutory limits are placed on the policymaker's

 exchange-rate choices. These observations give rise to the idea of

 policy rules embodying escape clauses.

        This section studies nondiscretionary escape clauses: binding

 rules specifying when the exchange rate must be fixed, and when

 discretion is permissible. There is an obvious problem with such

 rules: How can society enforce thea if policy commitments are not

 feasible? To address this problen, the next section will take up

 discretionary escape clauses, which are invoked when the policy-

 maker chooses, but at a personal cost. The present section remains

 pertinent, though, as its results clarify the welfare inplications


                                               8
of discretionary and nondiscretionary escape clauses alike.9

         Consider a policymaker bound to the exchange-rate rule:




                     t—l
                                                   if —u<ut Cu
(11) e —4                                                                —

               argminL
                                                   if         or uu.


This rule instructs the policymaker to resort to discretion if

assumes an extreme value, i.e., one that lies outside (u,u).

         Expectations under rule (11) reflect the possibility of a

reversion to discretion, and these expectations, in turn, affect

the exchange rate chosen when discretion is indeed "on" [recall

(4)1 .    Let F(u) be the cumulative distribution function for the
i.i.d. shock u, and define


                           U

         it a F(u)    =    fdF(u),   it   — 1— F(u) —   fdF(u).
                                                        U



The expected exchange rate under the assumed regime is




         E(e I   'c—P — !E{eIU              u} + irE{eIu          + (1 — iv —



which can be solved, using (4), for the equilibrium expectation


91t may seem artificial to consider binding escape-clause rules;
after all, once binding rules are admitted to be feasible, many
other rules would be better — for example, keep the exchange rate
fixed within a set interval of u values, but use the optimal rule
(6) outside. The payoff, to repeat, is a benchmark for analyzing
escape clauses that arise in reality and are enforced through
sanctions applied to policymakers. As is discussed further below,
imposing fixed social costs of exercising escape options would
have little substantive impact on the analysis.

        The unconditional expected loss is denoted by EA(u,u), where



(14) EA(u,u) = (1    —               + k
                         — r)aE{[S(u,u)               + U]2   u E (uu)}

        Equation (14) is best understood by reference to the last

section's results.        Under both pure discretion and a fixed

exchange rate, the policymaker's expected loss is proportional to

E( + k + u)2, where ço is the equilibrium expectation of
depreciation —     Ak/(1 —   A) under discretion, zero under a fixed

rate [see equations (9) and (10), respectively] .             With   a fixed rate

the proportionality constant is a, while under discretion it is

the smaller quantity -y, a reflection of the policymaker's ability

to stabilize employment at the cost of secular expected inflation.



'°Even if A = 1 (i.e., C — 0), so that the policymaker puts no
weight at all on inflation, the expected depreciation rate in (13)
is finite as long as at least one threshold is finite. In
contrast, equilibrium depreciation is infinite when A                   1 in the
case of pure discretion [equation (8)].



                                       10
     The loss (14) averages over these two regimes in a particular

way. In states of nature where the fixed rate holds steady, the

expected loss is a times the corresponding conditional expectation

of (p +   k + u)2;    in states where it does not, the expected loss is

y times the conditional expectation of (p +      k + u)2   corresponding
to   discretion.       Overall   expected loss is     the appropriate

probability-weighted average. The trend expected depreciation rate

p — 6(u,u) is constant across realizations of u and leads to a

"peso problem": under fixed rates there is the possibility of a

parity change, while under discretionary exchange-rate management

there is the possibility of a return to fixed rates.1t In general,

6(u,u) may be positive or negative. If negative, it may exceed k

in absolute value; while if positive (as section IV shows), it may

even exceed the trend depreciation rate under pure discretion.

Naturally, the model implies pure discretion as u — u      • 0,   a pure

fixed rate as ii     and —u •

     Nondiscretionary      escape clauses that strictly dominate both

pure discretion and an irrevocably fixed exchange rate often can

be designed.'2 It is thus meaningful to examine interior solutions

for the optimal escape-clause rule. Let f(u) be the derivative of

the distribution function F(u). Differentiation of EA(u,u)


"The expectation p is independent of u because that shock is
i.i.d. Allowing serial correlation in u would complicate the
results (and arguably add to their descriptive realism), but
wouldn't alter any fundamental insights. For example, for given
escape thresholds, positive serial correlation in u would make
wages an increasing function of u. Furthermore, the optimal
thresholds (to be described in a moment) generally would depend on
the previous period's shock realization.
'2See Persson and Tabellini (1990) for a good discussion of            a
special case. By construction, no such rule strictly dominates the
optimal rule (6).

     These conditions actually are not too hard to interpret. A

small increase in u, for example, has two effects. Given market

expectations, it marginally increases the range of shocks over

which the authority can exercise employment-stabilizing policy,

thereby reducing expected losses by (a —         -y)[5(u,u)   + k + u}2f(u).

But it also affects equilibrium expectations across all states of

nature, shifting the entire functional relationship between u and

L. The incremental expectations effect, the sum of the two

stabilization gain at an optimum (so in particular the former

effect must increase expected losses). A similar characterization

applies to (15b).13

     Attaining the optimum described by (15) is problematic,

because the optimization assumes that a a binding rule governs the

circumstances in which discretion is permitted. In effect, the

policymaker, like Saint-Exupdry's Little Prince, is "commanded to

do exactly what he wants to do," but only in certain states of the

world. This policy rule is clearly time inconsistent: absent a

commitment mechanism, the policymaker will always do what he wsnts

to do, namely, exercise full discretion.

     One way to impose a nonzero probability that a steady

exchange rate is optimal ex post is to posit a fixed social cost x

of currency realignment, over and above the costs captured by the

term O(e —
              e1)2     in (3). Even under discretion, such a cost may

induce the policymaker to keep e fixed over a range of u

realizations. The time-inconsistency problem remains, however,

because the policymaker's discretionary behavior generally will

not minimize the ex ante social loss EA — (ir    +
     A fixed private cost of realignment, imposed on the

policymaker    only,     could   reduce    the   divergence   between

discretionary behavior and the ex ante optimal escape-clause rule.

For example, a government might lose political capital if it has

to alter the exchange rate.          When the authority conducts a

optimal bounds are not symmetric: u C —ii        because k > 0. Even
symmetric bounds, such as those analyzed by Persson and Tabellini

cost-benefit analysis of realignment each period, however, its

decision to exercise the escape clause is discretionary. The next

section analyzes escape clauses triggered by discretion rather

than by a rule.




III. Discretionary Escape Clauses



A well-designed escape clause is potentially welfare-improving,

but can fixed political costs of currency realignments induce

policymakers to implement it under discretion? The answer is of

particular interest in light of the EMS, which is often viewed as

an institution that imposes such costs. In this section I argue

that there can be no general presumption that a discretionary

escape clause will reproduce the social optimum.

     Assume that the policymaker faces a cost a    of   revaluing the

currency (lowering e) and a cost c of devaluing (raising e). In a

discretionary regime the authority takes the market's expected

devaluation rate, p, as given; accordingly ex post period loss is



(16) LF(,u) m( + k +


if the fixed exchange rate is maintained, given u, and is
       D                             2
 (17) L (rp,u)    y(ç2   +k   + u)



 if the choice is to realign.'4



 The formulation here assumes that realignment carries no extra
 fixed social costs. These could easily be incorporated without

                                         14
     Since the future is unsffected by decisions made today, the

policymsker's      sole concern             is        the    short-run social-cost

differential, L1' —     iP, net            of the fixed cost of any parity

adjustment. The policymaker's optimal decision rule is simple: it

is to devalue the currency for u                u, where u is the solution to



(18s) LF(w,u) —    LD(,u)    - (a      —   -y)(   +   k +   —)2



and to revalue for u         ii, where      u is the solution to



(18b) LF'(,u) — LD(4,,u) — (a          — y)(ç + k +                 —




Figure   1 illustrates how u and u are determined.

     The relationships shown in the figure suggest a way of

implementing the socially optimal escape-clause rule. Let u and u

be the optimal switch points characterized by (15); then set s and

c at the levels

Faced with market depreciation expectations &(u,u), the authority

will pick the optimal boundaries u and u if the fixed realignment

costs specified in (19) are imposed [compare (18) with (19)].

     There is one problem with this scheme. It works perfectly


changing the analysis below. The key point about such costs is the
one made at the end of the last section: fixed social costs alone
cannot induce the policymaker to implement the ex ante optimal
rule. An incentive structure that penalizes the policymaker
without penalizing the rest of society — for example, a salary
cut that accrues to the government budget —                    is   indispensable.

 well if the market expects the currency to depreciate at rate           —
 6(u,i)   on average. But there may be no way to ensure that this is

 the market's expectation. As (18) shows, changing          to q? ,   say,
 will lead to different switch points, u' and u'   ,   even if the fixed
 realignment costs do not change; and an additional rational-

 expectations equilibrium will arise whenever 92' —        6(u' ,u'). In
 general we would expect such an equilibrium to produce a
                                                               strictly
 lower social welfare level than the one described by (15). In

particular, an equilibrium with a rate of expected depreciation

greater than under the optimal rule will also lead to a higher

real wage and thus to higher unemployment when the escape clause

is not exercised.

     Why should multiple equilibria arise at all? The answer lies

in the policymaker's inability, under a discretionary regime, to

forswear credibly the accommodation of expected        depreciation. A
rise in expected depreciation on date t—l, other things the same,

can push the economy farther from full employment on date t; and

as (4) shows, the policymaker will create some date-t inflation to

mitigate this employment effect, with the propensity to accommodate

measured by A. Under a discretionary
                                          escape clause, different
expected switch points imply different exchange rate expectations.

An accommodative (high A) policymaker may alter his preferred

switch point so as to ratify a change in expectations.

     One might hope to be more successful at
                                                       implementing an
optimal escape-clause rule through more complicated          incentive
structures —   for   example, schemes that make the policymaker's
penalty depend on the size of a realignment. Such
                                                       schemes are not
considered below. As the subsequent
                                      analysis will reveal, state-


                                 16
dependent penalties would help only if they could be designed with

very detailed knowledge of the economy's structure,   Sufficiently

detailed knowledge is not available in practice, and clearly does

not inform the sanctions that real-world policymakers face.

     Even for fixed realignment costs, the multiplicity of

equilibria, and their welfare properties, depend in a complicated

way on the distribution function F(u). For this reason, I now take

a detailed look at a specific, but empirically plausible, example.



IV. Multiple Equilibria: An Example



 To simplify the analysis, I assume thst the fixed cost of

 revaluation is big enough that only large positive realizations of

 u occasion discretion, in which case a devaluation occurs.      This

 assumption leads to a fairly realistic description           of the

 positions of several countries: no one currently places great

 weight on the possibility that the Italian lira will be      revalued

 against the deutschemark. Also, having to solve only for a single

 equilibrium boundary, u, simplifies the algebra considerably.

      A devaluation option of this sort imparts a definite

  inflation bias to the regime; a welfare gain over pure discretion

  can arise only when the mean inflation bias falls as a result of

  the limits on the exchange rate's flexibility. On the negative

  side, the escape clause makes employment more variable compared

  with a free float: in non-devaluation states, employment is below

  the level that would prevail under discretion, while in
  devaluation states, it is higher. Because employment is less

  variable than under a rigidly fixed exchange rate, however, a


                                   17
mixed regime may —            but       need not — dominate either polar regime.

        In line with the simplifying assumption that only devaluation

is possible, define 6(u) as the expected depreciation rate when

the authority holds the exchange rate fixed for u < u, but
devalues otherwise:



        6(u) —   lim          6(u,u)
                                —



[see equation (13)]. All the formulas derived above can be

extended to the present, simpler, setting by replacing 6(u,u) with

6(u). In particular, (15b), so modified, describes a fixed rate

with an interior optimal devaluation option.'5

        The specific distribution assumed for u has the tent-shaped

density function:


                          —   u)/p2            for u C
        f(u) —
                   0                           for u



Under this distribution, a2 —

optimum. In the example of this section, u = —p is always a local
(and sometimes a global) minimum of the expected loss function.

Naturally, 8(u) -. 0 as u -*        p (and the escape option disappears);

while 8(u) -.      Ak/(l     — A) as u -.        —p   (in which case discretion

prevails with probability one).

     Before even searching for equilibria, it is illuminating to

ask how expected depreciation varies with the switch point u.

Figures 2a and 2b illustrate the parameter-dependent answer. In

figure 2a expected depreciation, 8(u), declines monotonically over

[—p,p]; in figure 2b, however, it rises initially before bending

downward and falling to zero.

      The second pattern occurs whenever k/(l — A) < p. In this

second case, there exist values of u negative enough —                  that   is,


positive employment shocks large enough —                    to   cause currency

 appreciation under pure discretion [see (4)]. Under the escape

 clause, however, the exchange rate remains fixed in the face of

 such shocks; the resulting truncation of the exchange rate's

 distribution can raise expected inflation under the adjustable peg

 above its free-float level. (Clearly such a situation is inferior

 to discretion: mean inflation is raised at the same time that the

 authority's ability to offset employment shocks is curtailed.)

      Now consider equilibria. Equation (l8a) describes how the

More simply, equilibria are described by values of u that solve'6



(21) 6(u) +   k +   u    r(u)   - Jc/(a — 7)     a.




Alternative equilibria are most easily studied by graphing the

function 1'(u) defined by (20) and (21). Several different shapes

for this function emerge as the parameters k and A — which

respectively measure the severity of the time-inconsistency

problem and the willingness to accommodate —           are varied. It will
be assumed in the four examples below that a = 3 and z =            0.03.

     1. Equilibrium may be unique. Consider an economy with a

relatively small time-inconsistency problem (k              0.0075) whose

policymaker is fairly averse to accommodation (A =          0.5).      Figure 3

shows the expected loss EA(u) implied by the different possible

switch points u e       [—0.03,0.03)   (upper panel), along with the 1'(u)

function that arises in this case (lower panel).



'6whatabout solutions to 6(u) + k + u — —Jc/(a — -') = —it, which
also satisfy the last equation? These define smallest positive
employment shocks such that the authority would be willing to
revalue — not devalue — at cost c. Such solutions can be
disregarded because revaluations have been ruled out.

      The upper panel's vertical axis measures losses in terms of a

concrete metric. Given an employment distortion of size k and a

disturbance variance of a2, the lowest possible expected loss

under the assumed information structure is EAC = ak2    + i'a2, which

is achieved if commitment is possible [equation (7)]. I measure

loss under any other regime by imagining an authority endowed with

a costless commitment mechanism, and computing the percent
increase in the standard deviation a that would raise his loss to
                                       U

the   level sustained in the alternative regime. If the alternative

regime is one with a devaluation option starting at u, this loss

measure is




       L(u)
              J [g — 0k2]ha2.

       In figure 3 the optimal switch point u* is .0063 (implying a

devaluation probability of 0.312). The policy loss at this point

is 25.6 percent — meaning that the cost of this regime relative to

the optimal regime is equivalent to allowing commitment, but

increasing the standard deviation a        from 0.0122 to 0.0154.
                                       U
       The optimal devaluation rule is an improvement over both pure

discretion (u — —0.03, with an associated cost of 0.323) and an

unconditional peg (u —    0.03, with a cost of 0.414). Note that a
 free float dominates a rigidly fixed exchange rate. The example

 shows that in principle, some limits to exchange-rate flexibility

 can raise welfare, even though a rigidly fixed rate would not.

       Can the optimal switch point be delegated under discretion by

 imposing the appropriate devaluation cost on the policymaker? In


                                  21
this example it can. As the lower panel of figure 3 shows, the

r(u) function is strictly increasing: setting n —               1'(ii*)    [as

equation (21) directs] induces the policymaker to devalue when,

and only when, u      u*. Expected depreciation in this regime is q*
—   0.4   percent per period (compared with 0.75 percent under a free

float, and zero under a fixed rate). And equilibrium is unique:

given s, no expected depreciation rate w' other than 0.4 percent

can lead the policymaker to a switch point u' where rp'       = 6(u').
      2. There may be two equilibria, both of which dominate a

pure fixed rate. To obtain this case, imagine that all parameters

are as in the previous example, except that the policymaker is

much more accommodative: now, A      0.9.

      Figure 4 again graphs the relevant functions. The top panel

indicates the optimal switch point u*         0.0049 (which is below the

last example's boundary at u —     0.0063, in line with the present
authority's greater intereat in stabilization). The loss implied

by this regime is 1.365, lower than under a fixed rate [L(0.03)

2.162] or pure discretion [L(—0.03) =         4.895].   The discretionary

regime does so poorly because it implies inflation at 6.75 percent

per period; under the optimal devaluation rule, however, expected

inflation is only 0.96 percent per period.

      Now, however, the optimal escape-clause rule cannot always be

replicated by imposing a well-chosen cost on a discretionary

policymaker. As the lower part of figure 4 shows, just setting it            =
I'(u*) results     in two   equilibria.   At the switch point ti'            —


—0.00061, expected depreciation is '        = 5(u')   = 1.5 percent >     q* =
8(u*) = 0.96     percent; and since r(u') =    it, it   is just worthwhile

for the policymaker to devalue at this boundary. If markets

believe u' is the devaluation threshold, the policymaker will

ratify that belief rather than tolerate excessive ex post real

wages and unemployment.

     Real wages in this second equilibrium are higher than in the

first in non-devaluation states; accordingly, unemployment is

higher whenever the exchange rate remains fixed. In devaluation

states, too, the real wage turns out to be higher, and employment

lower, in the second equilibrium.'7 Thia is true despite the fact

chat when currency depreciation does occur it is sharper in the

second equilibrium, because nominal wages are further out of line

with the authority's employment goals. A more detailed model would

predict higher ex post real interest rates in non-devaluation

states at the high-depreciation equilibrium, and a real exchange

rste less competitive in either state.

     In this example the cost of being at the second equilibrium

is not too severe: the social cost is 1.504, compared with 1.365

at the optimum and 2.162 under a fixed rate. Because the authority

places so heavy a weight on reducing employment fluctustions, the

greater scope for stabilization at a' offsets to a large degree

the higher expected       inflation there,   leaving the    second

equilibrium still preferable to a pure fixed rate.

    But remember the assumption that k = 0.0075: the time-incon-

sistency problem is not too serious. As the next example shows,

incressing the distortion k can reverse these welfsre rankings.



"tecause devaluation is more likely in the second equilibrium,
however, the expected wage and expected employment are the same
scross equilibria.



                                23
     3. There may be two equilibria, one of which is worse than a

fixed rate. Now set k — 0.015. The optimal switch point, u* —

0.0144,   is considerably above that in the last case (greater

discretion now is more dangerous), and it results in a lower

expected depreciation rate of 0.48 percent per period. (See figure

5). The probability of devaluation is only 0.135. Attempting to

decentralize this optimum, however, may result in the equilibrium

switch point u'       0.00167, with expected depreciation at 1.75

percent per period and a 0.446 devaluation probability.

     The optimal devaluation rule implies a loss of L(u*) — 1.902

compared with a greater loss of 2.162 under a fixed exchange rate.

But the alternative equilibrium is worse than either: L(u') —

2.653.    If there is a substantial risk of ending up at this second

equilibrium, it might be best to go for an irrevocably fixed

exchange rate — perhaps by confronting the policymaker with a

prohibitively high cost of devaluation.

     One might think that the problem just described arises

because a serious distortion is combined with a very high

propensity to accommodate; reducing the latter might show the

escape-clause idea in a better light. My fourth and last example

therefore considers a policymaker who faces the same distortion

level as in the present example (A =      0.015),   but who is somewhat

less accommodative. The answer is quite surprising.

     4. There may be three equilibria, two of which are very bad

compared with the best one or with a fixed rate. Now reduce A from

0.9 to 0.075. The best equilibrium would be at u* = 0.0145 (figure

6), with a baa of L(u*) = 0.867, expected depreciation of ç* =

dominates the fixed-rate solution, since L(.03) —         1.
     Imposing the fixed devaluation cost K                r(u*)   might not

suffice to replicate this relatively attractive equilibrium. The

figure's lower panel indicates two very different additional

equilibria, associated with the boundaries u' = —0.0123 and u"

—0.0256, and with the expected depreciation rates qf = 3.0 percent

and çf' =   4.4   percent, respectively. (Figure 2s used the parameters

of this example to plot expected depreciation.) The implied losses

are L(u') =   2.402,    L(u") =   3.291, both much highar than that under
a pure fixed-rate regime. Indeed, tha low-threshold equilibrium is

little better than unfettered discretion, where inflation runs at

4.5 percent per period and L(—.03) —        3.359.   In this last case, the

market forecasts that the authority has only a minimal chance of

defending the fixed exchange rate; these expectations lead to

nominal wages that are so high (compared with the existing

exchange rate) that devaluation nearly always is the outcome.

      The examples show that attempts to delegate to an agent a

rule with an escape clause can have a wide range of outcomes.

decision makers within frameworks like the EMS, can only multiply

the possibilities.

     In addition, there has been no formal analysia of the most

obvious practical obstacle to implementing schemea like those in

section II: uncertainty over the structure of the economy, which

makes it difficult to judge accurately the appropriate personal

coats to impose on policymakers. Acknowledging that such

uncertainty is pervasive only makes escape options look worse.

     In judging the relevance even of the examples given above,

however, it is useful to have a rough idea of how accommodative

policymakers are likely to be in practice. To this end, imagine a

policymaker   in a nonstochastic environment who faces               no

time-inconsistency problem (k =           0) and has an annual discount
factor of $ — 0.90 (making him rather farsighted).

     How many percentage point-years of unemployment would he be

willing to tolerate to reduce inflation permanently from 1 to 0

percent per year? A dedicated inflation fighter might be willing

to suffer three years of 2 percent unemployment (above the natural

rate) for this reduction. The loss function (3) then implies B —

1.08; and if a = 3,   the policymaker is revealed to have a fairly

high A of 3/(3 + 1.08) = 0.735 [recall (4)]19 Even governments

                                reflect heavier discounting of the
future by politicians (lower values of fi), in which case B would
have to be higher to explain what we see. In one version of the
underlying model that generates equation (2), .f can be identified
with the reciprocal of capital's income share in CNP. This would
imply an estimate of a around 9, which seems unrealistically
large; but supposing a — 3 is reasonable, at least for small
deviations from the natural rate. On the other hand, if a
significant time-inconsistency problem is present, the behavior
described reveals different preferences:              with k —    0.01,
recalculation leads to B =   2.96,    A =   0.503.

to implement adjustable fixed exchange rates.



V. Conclusion



Simple policy rules       can often     be      amended     to   include

welfare-enhancing escape clauses, which allow the exercise of

discretion in well-defined circumstances. But even these emended

rules are inherently time inconsistent. To implement them in a

discretionary regime, society must confront policymakers with

personal (perhaps political) costs of overriding rules.

     Unfortunately,   imposing the    appropriate         cost   on   the

policymaker is necessary, but not sufficient, for reaching a

socially preferred equilibrium. Market expectations can be

self-fulfilling, leading in general to any number of equilibria,

most of which are dominated by the original simple rule.

     This paper illustrated these propositions by analyzing a

fixed exchange rate system amended to include a devaluation

option. Numerical examples suggested that a unique equilibrium may

exist when a fairly non-accommodative policymaker faces a small

time-inconsistency problem. In less favorable circumstances,

however, a multiplicity problem will plague the attempt to

delegate an optimal escape-clause rule. The problem is amplified

in practice by the uncertainty society faces over the accurate

measurement of both policymaker costs and their influence on

policy actions.
