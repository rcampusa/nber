                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the historical evolution of central bank credibility using both historical narrative
and empirics for a group of 16 countries, both advanced and emerging. It shows how the evolution
of credibility has gone through a pendulum where credibility was high under the classical gold standard
before 1914 before being lost and not fully regained until the 1980s. This characterization does not,
however, seem to apply to the monetary history in the emerging markets examined in the paper. Nevertheless,
credibility in all the economies examined has been enhanced in recent decades thanks to the adoption
of inflation targeting. However, the recent financial crisis and the call for central banks to focus more
on financial stability relying on macro prudential regulation may pose significant challenges for central
bank credibility.

1. Introduction

Central bank credibility and reputation is an important topic in modern central

banking. Central banks have been in existence since the seventeenth century. They

have evolved from serving as government fiscal agents, to lenders of last resort, to

preserving the gold standard nominal anchor, to providing macro stability, and

currently to providing financial stability. Central bank credibility has waxed and

waned through this period. In the past two decades, the credibility and reputation of

central banks has been high, at least until the financial crisis of 2007-2008. An

important contributor to the achievement of credibility has been the advent and

adoption of inflation targeting by many countries.

The paper examines the historical evolution of central bank credibility using both

historical narrative and empirics for a group of 16 countries, both advanced and

emerging. It shows how the evolution of credibility has gone through a pendulum

where credibility was high under the classical gold standard before 1914, then

credibility was lost after 1914 and not fully regained until the 1980s. This process

was further enhanced in the last two decades with the advent of IT. The recent

financial crisis and the call for central banks to focus more on financial stability and

especially use the tools of macro prudential regulation may pose significant

challenges for central bank credibility.

In section 2 we define central bank credibility and reputation. In section 3 we then

provide a general overview of the historical evolution of credibility over the past




                                                                                      3
two centuries. Section 3 presents six historical case studies of central bank

evolution. We examine the record of three important advanced countries: United

States, United Kingdom and Germany; and three Latin American emerging countries.

They are: Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In section 4 we turn to the measurement of

credibility as the deviation between observed inflation and the implied objective

rate of inflation derived from a Taylor Rule like framework. We provide evidence on

central bank credibility and its determinants across three broadly demarcated

policy regimes for a panel of 10 advanced countries. The regimes are: the gold

standard; Bretton Woods and the recent era of low inflation since 1980. In section 5

we consider inflation targeting as a credibility enhancer based on enhanced

transparency and communication. We conclude with reflections on the impact on

central bank credibility of the recent emphasis on macro prudential regulation to

provide financial stability.




2. Definitions

We define central bank credibility as a commitment to follow well-articulated and

transparent rules and policy goals. More precisely, credibility refers to the “ …extent

to which the public believes that a shift in policy has taken place when , indeed, such

a shift has actually occurred” (Cukierman 1986 page 6). More generally Karl

Brunner (1983) made the connection between credibility and the performance of

the institutions mandated to carry out policies: “Credibility depends … on the

history of policy making and the behavior of the policy institution.”




                                                                                     4
We interpret credibility in terms of inflation performance. Credibility is a flow like

variable that changes as observed inflation is seen to deviate from a time varying

inflation objective, which need not be explicit or publicly announced. Credibility is

also partially determined by the relative importance the central bank attaches to

real and nominal objectives. Regular economic shocks and the manner in which the

central bank manipulates monetary policy dictate how credibility evolves over time.

Credibility evolves in a non- linear manner, i.e. it is earned slowly and painstakingly

yet is susceptible to evaporate on a moment’s notice. In the words of Benjamin

Franklin “It takes many good deeds to build a reputation, and only one bad one to

lose it.” Identifying and measuring credibility is challenging. Nevertheless, as

Cukierman (1986, page 5) again points out “ …the ability of monetary policymakers

to achieve their future objectives depends on the inflationary objectives of the

public. These inflationary expectations depend, in turn on the public’s evaluation of

the credibility of the monetary policy makers…” Paul Volcker, former Chairman of

the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, once underscored the point “[T]o break the

inflation cycle we must have credible and disciplined monetary policy” (Bernanke

2013 page 35). Indeed Volcker went on to remark that “… inflation undermines trust

in government. “ (Silber 2012, page 266). Therefore, autonomy, transparency,

accountability, and the monetary policy strategy in place each can influence both the

credibility and reputation of the monetary authority.

Credibility builds trust in institutions and helps weather crises. It also helps markets

and the public discern the actual policies being followed. Key determinants of

credibility are the monetary regime in effect and institutional factors such as the



                                                                                      5
mandate of the central bank, its autonomy with respect to the government, the

governance of the institution. These variables are crucial in understanding how a

central bank is able to manage its credibility over time.2

To operationalize our definition of central bank credibility we argue, following

Bordo and Siklos (2014) that a central bank is deemed credible when it delivers,

subject to a random error, the implied inflation rate objective conditional on the

monetary regime in place.

We write equation (1).3

( it   it )2  θΖit + i ( i ,t 1   i ,t 1 )2  uit

Where the dependent variable is our indicator θΖit is the product of a vector of

coefficients. θ and Ζit represents economic and institutional variables that can

explain departures from the inflation target. Thus equation (1) expresses credibility

as the squared differential between the observed inflation rate and the central

bank’s goal.

The basic idea behind our proxy for credibility can be explained intuitively. Readers

interested in more technical details are asked to consult Bordo and Siklos (2014).

We begin with the notion that the stance of monetary policy is set via an instrument

of monetary policy. Over the long history of central banking it is fair to say that

three such instruments have been dominant. They are: an exchange rate, as when

the Gold Standard or the Bretton Woods regimes were in place, a monetary

aggregate such as in, for example, the 1980s and early 1990s when the Bretton

                                                                                   6
Woods system was abandoned, and an interest rate instrument, in place when

exchange rates floated and most countries adopted some kind of price stability

objective.

Of course, actual monetary policy regimes likely were never purely operated as if,

say, the exchange rate regime was a pure float or a strict peg. Moreover, theoretical

economic models are capable of deriving equivalence results that permit one to

think in terms of a central bank that operates as if a preferred instrument was in

place. Hence, it is often the case today that the starting point for an analysis of

monetary policy is the eponymous Taylor rule which expresses the stance of

monetary policy as being a function of an inflation gap and an output gap and is also

conditioned on a target constant neutral real interest rate.

Next, after allowing for a time-varying neutral real interest rate, inflation and output

gaps, we can back out the implied target for inflation the central bank has in mind,

conditional on the chosen instrument. In the case of an interest rate we simply

follow a Taylor rule with interest rate smoothing. In the case of an exchange rate

target we modify the Taylor rule to allow a response to a gap in the real exchange

rate while a money growth target implies that an additional restriction, in the form

of the quantity theory, is presumed to hold. Kozicki and Tinsley (2009) adopt this

basic strategy although our approach differs somewhat from theirs by requiring the

central bank to respond to an output gap, and not an unemployment gap, as well as

by adding the possibility that the central bank also has an exchange rate target.

Note that when we examine the more recent inflation targeting period, and the

connection between transparency and credibility highlighted in the introduction of



                                                                                      7
the paper, a short sample together with data limitations requires us to simplify the

previously discussed empirical strategy to obtain some illustrative econometric

evidence.




3. The historical pattern of credibility and reputation through the ages

The history of central bank credibility is tied up with the history of policy regimes.

We compare credibility in three broadly defined regimes: the gold standard which

includes the pre 1914 classical gold standard; the Bretton Woods era which includes

the years when the US indirectly adhered to the gold nominal anchor and the period

afterwards when the gold anchor was raised leading to the Great Inflation and the

recent fiat money regime with the primacy of low inflation since the 1980s. See

Table 1 which demarcates the dates of adherence to each regime for 16 countries,

both advanced and emerging. Figure 1 shows the patterns of expected and observed

inflation for 10 countries for which we have data for each of the regimes. Figure 1

reveals a pendulum pattern: credibility was high in the gold standard era, less so in

the Bretton Woods era and then back to the pattern of the gold standard under the

current fiat money regime with primacy for low inflation.

The history of central bank credibility is tied up with the history of monetary policy

regimes. The classical gold standard, which prevailed from 1880 to 1914, embodied

a rule based on the commitment to maintain the official peg of domestic currency in

terms of gold. Central banks of advanced countries, which in many cases were

private institutions independent of the fiscal authorities generally adhered to this

rule. The gold standard rule was a contingent rule where temporary suspensions

and the issue of fiat money were permitted in well understood emergencies such as

wars and financial crises. Once the emergency ended the central bank was required

to restore convertibility to gold at the official parity. If it did this it would ensure its

credibility (Bordo and Kydland 1995). Credible adherence to the gold standard rule

allowed central banks to have some leeway to conduct stabilization policies within

the gold points (Bordo and MacDonald 2012). It also insured that it could conduct

lender of last resort actions without engendering capital flight (Eichengreen 1997).

The history of the pre 1914 gold standard shows how important countries,

especially Britain, France, Germany and the United States had credible regimes.

Smaller Western European countries like Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands also

were credible. Other peripheral European countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal

tried to gain credibility but were less successful as were all of the Latin American

countries (Bordo and Schwartz 1994).

World War I ended the classical gold standard and, after the war, many countries

tried to rebuild the prewar system. Restoring the prewar parity after massive

wartime inflation and changes in the political economy (suffrage) delayed the

restoration of the gold standard and the standard that was established—the fragile



                                                                                         11
gold exchange standard—had less credibility. Britain returned to gold at the prewar

parity in 1925 but at an overvalued parity which continually threatened its

adherence. The U.S. never left gold but the newly established Federal Reserve went

through a lengthy learning period to become a fully functioning member of the gold

club (Meltzer 2002). France went through a period of high inflation and its central

bank lost much of its credibility in a scandal. Germany went through a

hyperinflation fueled by the Reichsbank.

By 1926 the gold exchange standard was up and running and its short-lived success

depended upon the reputations of Benjamin Strong, Montagu Norman, Emile

Moreau and Hjalmar Schacht. Despite their efforts the system collapsed during the

Great Depression. In its aftermath central bankers were blamed for the Depression

and central banks lost their independence and became virtual appendages of the

fiscal authorities.

Central Banks regained fiscal independence from the fiscal authorities beginning in

the 1950s. The Fed was the first. It regained independence in the Federal Reserve

Treasury Accord of 1951 when, under Chairman William McChesney Martin it began

following gold standard orthodoxy dedicated to price stability (see section 4 below).

Few other central banks with the principal exceptions of the Bundesbank and the

Swiss National Bank followed suit. The theme linking independence to credibility

and the role of the policy regime in dictating central bank behavior is a recurrent

one throughout the twentieth century (Siklos 2002).

In the U.S. the return to monetary orthodoxy rested on the reputation of Chairman

Martin but the restoration of central bank credibility was, however, short-lived. In



                                                                                  12
the 1960s central banks (with the exception of the Bundesbank and the SNB) began

following Keynesian policies to maintain full employment at the expense of higher

inflation. The subsequent Great Inflation destroyed any vestiges of credibility as

well as the reputations of central bankers such as Arthur Burns (Bordo and

Orphanides 2013). Paul Volcker’s adoption of a monetarist style tight monetary

policy in 1979 broke the back of inflationary expectations at the expense of a deep

recession in the U.S. Previously, inflation had drifted upward in a seemingly

permanent fashion (e.g. see Goodfriend and King 2013, and DeLong 1997) and it

appears that only a form of ‘shock therapy ‘ could restore lower long-run

inflationary expectations (e.g. see Levin and Taylor 2013).

Similar strategies were followed in Canada, the UK, Japan and other countries so

that by the mid-1980s the Great Moderation restored price stability in the advanced

countries along with the reputations of central bankers. However, in all of these

instances (with the possible exception of Switzerland) credibility did not exist in the

immediate postwar. It had to be earned at an economic price over time. Indeed the

lower the credibility of policies, the more adverse the economic costs are (Fellner

1976, Haberler 1980). The commitment to rules focused on low inflation helped to

restore central bank credibility (e.g., see Levin and Taylor (2013) and Goodfriend

1986). What helped these central banks to succeed was that new policies were built

on the reputations of the institutions. In Germany, the Bundesbank (DBB) gained

credibility and a sterling reputation in the postwar period. The DBB was founded in

1948 with the express mandate to pursue price stability. This mandate was a

reaction to the disastrous experience of its predecessor, the Reichsbank, in



                                                                                    13
generating a hyperinflation in the 1920s (see section 4 below).Thus the pendulum

has swung towards greater central bank credibility in recent decades and in many

ways the world has gone back to the future.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 led to massive discretionary intervention in

financial markets by central banks around the world. Many of the actions mixed

monetary with fiscal policy and seemingly contradicted notions of violate central

bank independence.

The changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape that followed have

expanded the role of central banks. Time will tell if their credibility to maintain low

inflation will survive. However, unlike earlier episodes in the monetary history of

the last century or so, it is the fear of deflation and depression that has fueled

central banks’ responses. It is worth contemplating whether the ability of central

banks to ease policies by historically unheard of amounts, without signs that

inflationary expectations are becoming unanchored is a sign of the triumph of

central banking credibility and underscores the strength of their reputation.




4. Historical narratives on the evolution of credibility at six central banks

We present narratives on the evolution of credibility of six central banks: three

major advanced countries (the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States)

and three Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia and Mexico). Following each

narrative we show a figure with the observed inflation rate and expected inflation. It

is measured by mean forecasts from three different models as developed in Bordo




                                                                                    14
and Siklos (2014). For the Latin American countries we were unable to generate a

comparable measure of expected inflation owing to some data limitations.



4.1 United Kingdom

The Bank of England was founded in 1694. It was a private chartered joint stock

bank with a public function. It was designed to aid the British government in placing

its debt. In exchange for being the government’s financier it was given the right to

issue bank notes and to take on other private banking functions. Over time it

evolved into a banker’s bank, taking deposits from the nascent commercial banks

because of its important position. The Bank’s charter required that it keep its notes

convertible into gold at the official price of L 3.17s 9d per ounce of gold. By

maintaining gold convertibility, the Bank gained credibility early on.

The Bank had operational independence but not goal independence, i.e. its main

goal was to stay on the gold standard but it had control of its main policy tool—Bank

Rate (the discount rate)-- and the government could monitor its performance since

its charter was subject to periodic renewal.

The gold standard rule that the Bank followed in the eighteenth and nineteenth

centuries was a contingent rule, in the sense that in times of emergency, such as

major wars, the Bank could request permission from the Treasury to temporarily

suspend convertibility and issue inconvertible bank notes, as was indeed the case

during the Napoleonic wars, during which the Bank suspended convertibility in

1797 and restored it after hostilities had ceased, in 1821. Inflation reached a peak of

10% per year in 1810 and then declined to its prewar level by the time of



                                                                                    15
Resumption. These actions ensured the Bank’s credibility (Bordo and Kydland

1995).

During the nineteenth century the Bank evolved into a lender of last resort in the

face of banking panics. In many crises, beginning in 1825 and ending in the Overend

Gurney crisis of 1866 the Bank lent too little and too late. By the Baring crisis of

1890 the Bank finally learned to follow Bagehot’s (1873) Responsibility Doctrine to

subsume its private interest to its public responsibility (Bordo 1990). This also

enhanced its credibility.

During the heyday of the Classical gold standard 1880-1914 the Bank generally

followed the “rules of the game” using its main policy tool, Bank rate, to speed up

the adjustment to balance of payments disequilibria. On occasion, to make Bank

Rate effective, the Bank used open market operations and gold devices. (Bordo

1981). Because of its credibility the Bank had considerable flexibility to achieve

goals other than convertibility, i.e. to smooth interest rates, output and prices

(Bordo and MacDonald 2005).

World War I in August 1914 led to de facto suspension of the gold standard but not

de jure until 1918. The Bank of England became an engine of inflation by freely

discounting short term Treasury bills at a low pegged interest rate to aid the

Treasury in its war finance. For a year after hostilities ceased, prices kept rising, at

close to 200% in total. The British monetary authorities expressed a strong interest

in restoring the gold standard at the original parity as soon as possible in the

Cunliffe report of 1918. Resumption would require politically unpopular deflation.

The Bank engaged in tight money beginning in 1919 and the UK returned to gold at



                                                                                     16
$4.866 in April 1925. Many argue that sterling was overvalued by at least 10%. This

overvaluation in one of the key reserve currencies, along with other flaws, meant

that the reestablished gold exchange standard would prove to be not as durable as

the classical gold standard but it was as credible, at least until 1931 (Bordo and

Macdonald (2002).

The gold exchange standard broke down in 1931 because of major flaws including

maladjustment, illiquidity and lack of confidence. Under a heavy speculative attack

in summer 1931 the UK left the gold standard. The UK’s experience with deflation

and depression was much less than other countries like the US that had continued to

stay on gold (Eichengreen 1992). After Britain had left gold, devalued and floated

sterling the Bank embarked on a reflationary policy through the 1930s.

During the Second World War the Bank again became an engine of inflation and

subsumed its independence to the Treasury. This led to a period of high inflation

which carried through into the 1950s. The Bank was nationalized in 1945 and

officially lost whatever independence it had. The UK became part of the Bretton

Woods system in 1946 but did not achieve current account convertibility until

December 1958. The 1950s and 60s was a period of stop- go monetary policy. Like

in the interwar, sterling was overvalued and the UK ran persistent balance of

payments deficits, often culminating in currency crises, ended by international

rescues. Once the balance of payment constraint was relaxed the monetary and

fiscal authorities would stimulate the economy leading to a run up of prices and

another sterling crisis. The stop- go pattern ended after the Devaluation of 1967

which also ended sterling’s role as a reserve currency (Bordo 1993).



                                                                                17
During the 1950s and 60s it was widely believed in the UK that monetary policy was

impotent as described in The Radcliffe Committee Report of 1960. Radcliffe

advocated the use of credit allocation policy and fiscal policy rather than monetary

policy to maintain full employment (Capie 2010).

After the Bretton Woods system broke down between 1971 and 1973, sterling

floated and without an external nominal anchor the UK entered the Great Inflation

reaching inflation rates over 20% and a total loss of credibility in the late 1970s. The

Treasury, which controlled monetary policy, believed inflation was caused by non-

monetary, cost push forces and advocated the use of incomes policies rather than

tight money to allay it (Dicicio and Nelson 2013).

The high inflation rate produced a major currency crisis necessitating an IMF rescue

in 1976. The inflation spiral was finally ended in 1980 when Margaret Thatcher

came to power. Thatcher and her advisor Alan Walters adopted monetarist

orthodoxy and greatly reduced money growth, liberalized the financial system, and

removed capital controls. This led to a serious recession in 1980-81 but by the mid-

1980s the policy broke the back of inflation and inflation expectations as was

occurring at the same time in the U.S. Like the US, this was the beginning of a period

of low inflation, later called the Great Moderation. However unlike the Volcker Fed,

the Bank of England did not have independence. That did not occur until 1998 when

it achieved operational but not goal independence from the Treasury. The UK

Treasury and the Bank in the 1980s and 1990s had the primary goal of low inflation

and, following New Zealand’s example, began formal inflation targeting in 1992.

Since then the UK has generally had low inflation and anchored inflationary

expectations.

4.2 Germany

The Reichsbank was founded in 1876 shortly after the Franco Prussian War,

German reunification and Germany’s joining the gold standard. The Reichsbank had

private ownership but public management (Singleton 2008). It had operational

independence within the confines of the gold standard. It was established to unify

the currency, preserve gold convertibility, act as a central bank (to use its discount

rate to provide liquidity for the money market based on bankers acceptances) and

be a lender of last resort.

The Reichsbank was successful in maintaining the gold standard until World War I

and it generally followed the rules of the game (Bordo and Eschweiler 1994). It also


                                                                                          19
was a successful lender of last resort in the financial crises of 1901 and 1907. Thus

the Reichsbank had considerable credibility and the German price level was well

anchored.

Germany abandoned gold convertibility at the start of World War I and the

Reichsbank became part of the government. It freely discounted government paper

at a low interest rate peg, becoming a major engine of inflation. After defeat in 1918

the Reichsbank under its President Havenstein continued to be an engine of

inflation which became hyperinflation by 1923. The basic problem was an

impossible fiscal impasse in which the Weimar government could not raise the tax

revenues needed to pay for reparations and postwar reconstruction and other

expenses so it resorted to the printing press. By 1923 the Reichsbank lost its

credibility and the German mark became worthless. In the Currency Reform of

1923, Havenstein was succeeded by Hjalmar Schacht as President of the Reichsbank.

In 1924 the Reichsmark was created, fiscal balance was restored with the aid of

massive foreign loans, and the currency was pegged again to gold at a vastly

devalued rate from its prewar parity. For 7 years Germany had price stability and

credibility was restored (Bordo and MacDonald 2002). Schacht cooperated with

Montagu Norman (Governor of the Bank of England), Emile Moreau (Governor of

the Banque de France, and Benjamin Strong (Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank

of New York) to maintain the Gold Exchange Standard (Ahmed 2010).

The Great Depression, which began in the US, spread quickly to Germany, which had

borrowed heavily in the US and quickly lost access to the foreign capital inflows

needed to service reparations. Germany had as serious a contraction and deflation



                                                                                   20
as the US. The Reichsbank, following gold standard orthodoxy maintained a tight

monetary policy making things worse (Eichengreen 1992). The Creditanstalt crisis

in Vienna in May 1931, which led to a bailout by the Austrian National Bank and

government, provoked a run on the Austrian schilling, a freeze on foreign deposits

and the imposition of exchange controls (which de facto removed Austria from the

gold standard).The banking crisis then spread to Germany in July 1931. The German

government bailed out most of the commercial banks, froze foreign deposits and

like Austria imposed exchange controls and de facto left gold. The German financial

crisis and the Depression contributed greatly to the victory of National Socialism in

the elections of 1933. Under Hitler, the Reichsbank became the government’s bank

and greatly helped finance rearmament and then World War II. The Bank instituted

a panoply of internal and external controls. World War II led to high (and

suppressed) inflation which continued after defeat.

After the war, the allies established the Deutscher Lander Bank (BdL), which like

the early Federal Reserve was a loose federation of regional banks coordinated by a

Board. The BdL was dedicated to preserving the value of the currency (both external

and internal). It was made independent from the Federal Government. The Currency

Reform of 1948 ended inflation and created a new currency, the Deutschemark. The

BdL based on the stability culture of postwar Germany focused primarily on price

stability and led Germany into a pattern of low inflation. (Beyer et al 2013).

The BdL was superseded by the Deutsche Bundesbank (DBB), established by the

Federal Government of Germany in 1958. Like its predecessor it was dedicated

overall to maintaining the value of the Deutsche Mark (DM). Under the Bretton



                                                                                  21
Woods System the DBB faced a conflict between maintaining the dollar peg and

internal price level stability since under a pegged exchange rate the money supply

becomes endogenous. In the Bretton Woods era, West Germany, because of its rapid

productivity growth and high growth rate, kept running current account surpluses

which would lead to dollar inflows, and unless they were sterilized would lead to

faster money growth and inflation. In response to the inflationary pressure

Germany imposed controls on capital inflows and revalued the DM in 1961 and

1969 (Bordo 1993). Once the Bretton Woods system broke down between 1971 and

1973, The DBB began to focus on maintaining the internal value of the DM. Its

attempts to maintain price stability were not successful with the first oil price shock

in 1973 when inflation rose to 8% per year.

In 1974 the DBB adopted monetary growth targeting to gradually reduce inflation.

The monetary targeting framework was supposed to both control inflation and

influence inflation expectations. The DBB roughly followed monetarist doctrine in

targeting Central Bank Money (similar to M3) and gradually reducing its targets, but

it often missed its targets. According to Beyer, et al 2013) although the DBB missed

its targets, it always explained the misses and hence followed pragmatic

monetarism. The DBB’s policy did succeed in making Germany’s inflation rate (along

with Switzerland) consistently the lowest among the advanced countries during the

Great Inflation. The experience of low inflation and the fact that Germany did not

accommodate the second oil price shock in 1978-79 gave the DBB very high

credibility before the 1980s, in sharp contrast to the US and UK .The DBB kept

following money targeting until the advent of the Euro in 1999. The DBBs monetary



                                                                                     22
targeting approach and its credibility for low inflation were incorporated into the

European Central Bank as its two pillar strategy.

4.3 United States

The Federal Reserve was established in 1913 to act as a lender of last resort and to

preserve the gold standard. The U.S. hadn’t had a central bank since the demise of

the Second Bank of the United States in 1836. The U.S. had been on a specie

standard (bimetallism before 1873, gold thereafter) standard throughout the

nineteenth century with the exception of the Greenback paper money floating


                                                                                 23
exchange rate episode from 1862 to 1879. Under the gold standard, the U.S. had

long-run price stability (alternating periods of rising and falling prices driven by the

vagaries of the gold standard). The U.S’s inflation credibility was nearly as good

(with the exception of the Free Silver threat in the early 1990s) as the advanced

countries of Europe which had central banks (seen in long-term interest rate

spreads on gold bonds Bordo and Rockoff 1996). The main problem in the U.S. was

financial instability manifest in frequent banking panics (1837, 1857, 1873, 1884,

1993 and 1907) in the absence of a true lender of last resort.

The panic of 1907 was the event that broke the camel’s back leading to the

movement for monetary reform. The prototype for a US central bank was contained

in the Warburg Plan of 1910—a loose federal system of regional central banks, each

modeled after the Reichsbank in Germany to be coordinated by a Board in

Washington. The Reserve banks would use their discount rates to freely

accommodate banker’s acceptances and act as a lender of last resort. The Federal

Reserve System founded in 1913 took on many of the aspects of the original

Warburg Plan with a much stronger federal government presence in the Federal

Reserve Board (Bordo and Wheelock 2013).

World War I broke out just before the Fed was to open its doors leaving the U.S. as

one of the few countries still on the gold standard (with the exception of a gold

embargo 1917-1919). Gold inflows from the belligerents’ purchases of US goods

fueled inflation which was aggravated after the US joined the war in April 1917

when the Fed began financing the US Treasury’s bond issues at a low pegged




                                                                                     24
interest rate. By wars end the US price level had increased close to 100%, (the

lowest rate of the belligerents).

After the war the Fed began sharply raising its discount rate in 1919 after its gold

reserves were threatened by continued high inflation. This led to a serious but

short-lived recession and deflation from 1920-21. The period 1921 to 1929 was

characterized by mild deflation and rapid economic growth punctuated by two mild

recessions. Friedman and Schwartz (1963) and Meltzer (2003) gave the Fed high

marks for attenuating the recessions, preventing banking panics and preserving

price stability. The 1920s can be regarded as a period of high Federal Reserve

credibility.

The Great Contraction of 1929-33 can be attributed to several failures of US

monetary policy. These include loose monetary policy in 1927 to aid the UK in its

struggles to stay on the gold exchange standard which may have fueled asset booms

in housing and later stocks (Bordo and Landon Lane 2013); Fed tightening in early

1928 to stem the stock market boom which contributed to a downturn in August

1929 followed by the stock market crash of October (Siklos 2008); c) the failure to

act as lender of last resort and prevent four banking panics from October 1930 to

March 1933. This policy failure contributed greatly to an unprecedented collapse in

money supply, real output and prices. The massive (over 30%) decline in prices led

to a major loss of credibility.

The Great Contraction ended in March 1933 and recovery followed quickly after the

incoming Roosevelt administration declared a one week banking holiday, exited the

then devalued the dollar by 60% a year later. Prices and real output rebounded

rapidly from 1933 to 1937 , interrupted by a sharp recession in 1937-38 which

Friedman and Schwartz (1963) attribute to the Fed’s doubling of reserve

requirements in 1936 to absorb banks excess reserves and the Treasury’s policy of

sterilization of gold inflows.

The Federal Reserve system was reorganized in 1933 and 1935 and the Board of

Governors was given enhanced powers. However during the 1930s the Fed did not

play a very active role in monetary policy which had been taken over by the

Treasury. From the 1930s onward the Fed began following a low interest rate policy

to accommodate the Treasury’s fiscal policies (Meltzer 2003). During World War II

the Fed again became an engine of inflation although prices did not rise as much as

in World War I because of extensive price controls. The interest rate pegs were kept

after World War II and in the 1940s inflation became a problem leading the Fed to

campaign to regain its independence to raise its policy rates. This was achieved after

a considerable struggle with the Treasury and the Administration in the Federal

Reserve Treasury Accord of 1951. The Fed tightened policy in the early 50s and

restored price stability. Under Chairman Martin the Fed followed a policy of low

inflation and the economy performed well through much of the 1950s and early 60s.

During this period the US performed well in keeping inflation low as the provider of

the key currency of the Bretton Woods System.

The era of credible inflation ended after 1965 when, under pressure from the

Johnson administration the Fed began accommodating expansionary fiscal policies

to support the Vietnam War and the Great Society. This led to the beginning of the



                                                                                   26
Great Inflation (1965 to 1982). The Fed also began following Keynesian doctrine

(the Phillips Curve tradeoff) and made achieving full employment (at the expense of

inflation) its paramount policy goal.        As inflation and inflationary pressures

mounted in the 1970s, several attempts by the Burns led FOMC to reduce inflation

faltered when it led to recession and rising unemployment, leading to a ratcheting

up in inflation and inflation expectations (Bordo and Orphanides 2013).

Accommodation of two oil price shocks also contributed to the run up in inflation.

By the late 1970s the Fed had lost considerable credibility for low inflation. This

culminated in a run on the dollar in 1978.

In 1979 President Carter appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Fed with a

mandate to end inflation. Volcker followed a monetarist policy strategy, targeting

non borrowed reserves and letting interest rates be determined by market forces.

Interest rates rose to close to 20% by 1980. Volcker’s tight money policy triggered a

sharp recession in 1979-80. It was aggravated by the Carter administration

imposing controls on credit card expenditures. In reaction the Fed loosened policy

in late 1980. Immediately inflation and inflationary expectations rebounded. Several

months later, with the support of the newly elected President Reagan, Volcker

reapplied the monetary brakes triggering a second recession and this time it did not

stop tightening despite the unemployment rate rising well above 10% until inflation

and inflation expectations abated in 1982. The Fed’s credibility suffered after the

first recession and only was regained after the second (more severe) Fed induced

downturn (Bordo, Erceg, Levin and Michaels 2007).




                                                                                  27
The Fed reestablished its credibility for low inflation by the mid 1980s seen in

declines in nominal interest rates, in the TIPS spread and in various measures of

inflation expectations. The 20 year episode of good economic performance is

referred to as the Great Moderation. Alan Greenspan took over as Fed Chairman in

1987. He quickly prevented a major stock market crash from leading to a banking

crisis and then followed the Volcker approach to maintaining credibility for low

inflation. This policy was put to the test by the inflation scare of 1994 when rising

long-term bond yields signaled a run up in inflationary expectations. The Fed

tightened sharply, raising real interest rates. And then when inflation expectations

eased, the Fed loosened, preventing a recession. (Goodfriend 1993).

The Great Moderation ended with the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008. Loose Federal

Reserve policy of keeping the Federal Funds rate well below the Taylor rule rate

from 2003 to 2005, in an attempt to head off potential deflation, added fuel to a

burgeoning real estate boom which burst in 2006 triggering the crisis. (Taylor 2007,

Bordo and Landon Lane 2013b). The Fed reacted to the crisis by following

aggressive monetary policy of cutting the FFR in the fall of 2007, opening the

discount window to many nonbank financial institutions and non traditional

markets and by a controversial bailout policy in fall 2008 (bailing out Bear Stearns,

AIG and the GSEs ) and letting Lehman fail in October. That action triggered a global

financial crisis. The Fed reacted to the panic by cutting the FFR to zero and

instituting several unorthodox discount window facilities. These policies combined

with the Treasury’s TARP plan, stress tests and an inter central bank swap

arrangement ended the crisis. By late fall 2008 the Fed’s policy rate had hit the zero



                                                                                   28
lower bound and with the recession still on going, the Fed instituted its Quantitative

Easing policy (QE1) -- the purchase of long term Treasuries and mortgage backed

securities. This unconventional policy was followed in the next 4 years by three

other packages in the face of an unprecedented (after a financial crisis) slow

recovery (Bordo and Haubrich 2012). These policies have quadrupled the Fed’s

balance sheet, and many argue could lead to a future inflation policy. The Fed may

have lost considerable credibility with the crisis and time will tell if it regains its

credibility for low inflation by how it exits from QE.

4.4 Chile4

As was the case with other Latin American countries in the nineteenth century Chile

did not have a central bank. It was on a bimetallic standard from 1818 to 1851. It

made a technical change in the mint ratio and stayed on bimetallism until 1861

when it suspended. It resumed in 1870, but by the end of 1874 with the fall in the

price of silver, it was on a de facto silver standard. Bad harvests during the next

three years, and accompanying balance of deficits, were followed by bank runs in

1878. The authorities made bank notes inconvertible in July 1878. For the next 17

years, Chile remained on a paper standard. In 1879 the War of the Pacific began,

with Chile opposing Bolivia and Peru, and ended in 1883 with Chile the victor. The

war was financed by government note issues. Declining prices of nitrate and copper

in the world market led to depreciation of the Chilean peso from 1883 to 1899

(Bordo and Schwartz 1999).

The first attempt to return to a metallic standard was made in 1887, but it failed. In

the next four years bank notes and government notes rose considerably. An eight

month Civil War from January to August 1891 resulted in further monetary

expansion and exchange rate depreciation. A second Conversion Law in November

1892 was strictly implemented and the exchange rate appreciated, but again the

government responded to political discontent by issuing notes. The exchange rate

thereupon depreciated. A new Conversion Law in February 1895 established a

mechanism to accumulate a gold reserve and have notes backed by gold or bonds to

be acceptable for taxes. This reduced the money supply. Following rumors of war

    Much of this discussion was developed by Cesar Tamayo of the IADB.


                                                                                   30
with Argentina and a run on banks in July 1898 led to the end of convertibility until

1925, when it again devalued, and in 1931 it abandoned the gold standard.

Against this checkered history there were several attempts to set up a central bank.

The Central Bank of Chile (BCC) was finally created in 1925 following a mission by

Edwin Kemmerer from the United States5. The BCC was conceived as a private

institution with the government as a minority shareholder. It was granted a

monopoly of the currency issue and as mentioned above convertibility was restored.

Limits were set to credit the BCC could extend to the government to give it a

modicum of independence. With the advent of the Great Depression, Chile

abandoned the gold standard. By the 1930s continuous expansion of central bank

credit to the government and the private sector led to a rapid acceleration of

inflation which reached 30% by 1946. Central bank credibility was greatly

weakened. During the 1950s inflation in Chile reached 80%.

A first attempt to strengthen central bank credibility was a stabilization program

(1959 to 1962) which aimed to eliminate central bank financing of government

spending and restoring a par value of the peso with the US dollar. The policy had

very limited and temporary success and inflation resumed and the dollar peg was

abandoned in 1962 (Corbo and Hernandez 2005).

 Kemmerer was a reputed American economist who spent most of his career at Princeton University.
Although he held various posts within the U.S. government (including Trade Commissioner for South
America), he is best known as the “Money Doctor” for his role as advisor to many developing countries in
monetary and financial matters. He led special commissions that eventually resulted in the creation of
many central banks, starting with his visit to Mexico in 1917 and followed by Guatemala (1919), Colombia
(1923), Chile (1925), Poland (1926), Ecuador (1927), Bolivia (1927), China (1929) and Peru (1931), among
many others (for more details see Howard et. al (1946)).


                                                                                                    31
The problem of central bank financing of government expenditures was difficult to

overcome and the BCC continued to extend credit against various types of

government securities (Bianchi 2009). A second attempt to stabilize the economy

was made in the mid -1960s when the BCC was relieved of its commercial banking

operations and a crawling peg exchange rate was adopted. The 1960s and 1970s

were years with massive fiscal deficits fully financed by the BCC, resulting in money

growth of 66% by 1971. In 1973, under the Allende government, the fiscal deficit

reached 30 % of GDP and inflation topped 600%. By then BCC had lost whatever

was left of its reputation.

The Pinochet regime imposed a severe contractionary policy in 1974-75 which

turned the fiscal deficit into a 4% surplus. Inflation fell to double digits. Thereafter

fiscal imbalances have remained low. This development paved the way for Chile’s

transit towards a moderate and later a low inflation country (Sargent, Williams and

Zha 2009). In 1979 the authorities decided to use the exchange rate as the nominal

anchor for the disinflation process, first under a crawling peg with progressively

decreasing increments (the tablita) and finally under a fixed parity.

Chile’s second attempt to adopt an exchange rate stabilization program was also

constrained, this time by external factors. After some years of sustained growth and

relative macroeconomic stability, the monetary and fiscal policy mistakes of the

sixties and seventies were replaced by concerns over the external accounts. As

foreign trade was basically reinstated toward the end of the seventies, and as the

world economy poured capital toward developing countries, current account

deficits soared, reaching 10% of GDP in 1981. With alarming levels of foreign



                                                                                     32
indebtedness, the Chilean economy then had to face rising costs of servicing its debt

(due to a monetary contraction in the U.S.), and by early 1982 a severe balance of

payments crisis dragged Chile into its most severe post-1929 economic recession.

During 1982-83, virtually the entire financial system collapsed and the government

defaulted on its foreign debt; the cost of the crisis has been estimated to be close to

35% of GDP (Sanhueza 2001). After the fixed exchange rate regime collapsed in

early 1982, the central bank aimed for a crawling peg regime and later introduced a

narrow band in an effort to gain some flexibility in the day-to-day management of

currency and reserves. As with previous attempts to find a nominal anchor, the

credibility in the central bank exchange rate policy was undermined by the

subsequent devaluations of 1984 and 1985 (De Gregorio 1999).

The 1980s financial collapse required massive government intervention which put

an end to the short period of fiscal surpluses, and in 1983 the government deficit

was again close to 3% of GDP (Braun-Llona et al. 1998). This was also the time in

which the central bank became involved with quasi-fiscal operations since the

reconstruction of the financial system required central bank losses and debt

issuance. Recent studies have shown that the persistent negative net worth of the

BCC can be traced back to role of the central bank during this crisis (Restrepo,

Salomo and Valdes 2008). Faced with large negative shocks, the undercapitalization

of the central bank can threaten either its independence (it would require

emergency recapitalization by the executive) or directly the credibility of its anti-

inflationary policies (the central bank could be tempted to increase its revenue from

seigniorage) or, more likely, both.



                                                                                    33
By the mid-1980s, the central bank was already moving toward price-based

instruments and away from the quantity-based instruments (e.g., “encaje”), and near

the end of the decade, the exchange rate band was widened from +/– 2% to +/– 5%.

However, the high degree of inflation inertia and indexation forced BCC to use the

real interest rate as its main policy tool (Morande and Schmidt-Hebbel 2001). It was

also toward the end of the eighties, that the central bank was granted full goal and

instrument independence from the government with the constitutional amendment

of 1989. The BCC was then charged with the stability of the currency and the

payments system. The choice of nominal anchor was the inflation rate itself, leaving

Chile at the vanguard of the inflation targeting strategy (second after New Zealand).

The first inflation target was announced in 1990 to be met at the end of 1991

defined as a range of between 15% and 20%. In time, the exchange rate regime

became increasingly flexible and the exchange rate band became wide enough so as

to accommodate external shocks to a certain extent. However, in the first years

under the IT regime, the credibility of the BCC policies was less than perfect. A

combination of an incomplete adoption of the IT framework and the effective

pursuit of two goals (inflation and the exchange rate band) with one instrument (the

interest rate) may be responsible for this initial lack of credibility. Evidence of this

can be found in the exchange rate-to-inflation pass-through coefficient, which

remained high for the most part of the 1990s (Garcia and Restrepo 2001; Bravo and

Garcia 2002). Thus, throughout the first decade of BCC operation, monetary policy

was conditioned by the central bank’s intervention in the foreign exchange market;

a number of discretionary changes in the width of the exchange rate band were



                                                                                     34
necessary while the capital inflows surge of the early 1990s resulted in a sharp real

appreciation and a four-fold increase in central bank’s foreign reserves between

1990 and 1994 (see Calvo, Leiderman and Reinhart, 1996). It should be stressed,

however, that such strong appreciation of the peso actually contributed to the initial

success of BCC in bringing down inflation almost monotonically throughout the

1990s (for evidence, see, e.g., Corbo, 1998).

The Asian crisis and the subsequent Russian default brought substantial turmoil to

Latin American countries and the Chilean peso depreciated significantly (30%

between 1997 and 1999). In September 1999, the exchange rate band was finally

dismantled and the peso was allowed to float. With this major policy shift began

what De Gregorio, Tokman and Valdes (2005) call Chile’s experience with a full-

fledged IT strategy. This new policy environment included a public announcement

of a long term inflation target range – between 2% and 4%– and      foreign exchange

intervention only under extraordinary circumstances (to be materialized in 2001

and 2002).

By 2001, and due to the systematic fall in inflation and indexation, the BCC was in a

position to begin using the nominal interest rate as the main policy instrument.

More formal measures of success and credibility of the central bank’s strategy can

be found as well. Landerretche, Morande, and Schmidt-Hebbel (1999) show that

one-year-ahead (model-based) inflation forecasts made before the announcement of

the inflation target each year have systematically overstated actual inflation. In

other words, the announcement of a target has helped correct inflation forecasts

which in turn contributes to anchoring actual inflation.



                                                                                   35
Another strategy to assess the credibility of the BCC is followed by Cespedes and

Soto (2005, 2007). These authors formally show that when credibility is low, the

policy tradeoffs are more pronounced (e.g., higher “sacrifice ratio”) and the central

bank would be less aggressive in implementing its monetary policy in order to avoid

large output losses. In the case of Chile, these papers provide evidence that the

monetary policy rule has become more forward-looking in terms of inflation and

more aggressive in fighting deviations of inflation from the target. Inflation

expectations as measured by survey data further reinforce this idea that BCC has

been building credibility during the two decades under an IT regime.6 In fact, until

2002, expected inflation was systematically above the midpoint of the target (except

in 1999) but fallen below the midpoint of the target ever since (see the figure

below). Cespedes and Soto (2007) also point out the market for nominal

instruments, which had existed in Chile for decades, only began flourishing at the

turn of the century once the central bank was perceived to have inflation under

control and started using the nominal interest rate as its main instrument.

  Landerretche, Corbo and Schmidt-Hebbel (2001) offer additional evidence that this gradualism toward a
low stationary inflation rate has served the Chilean economy well.

4.5 Colombia7

The history of monetary policy in Colombia shares many features with that of Chile.

During the 19th century, currency issuance was heavily dependent upon the fiscal

stance; the war of independence as well as civil conflicts meant that coinage

constantly varied in terms of weight and quality, bringing about occasional

monetary instability.

As in Mexico, a strong system of free banking -in which national, state and privately

issued bills coexisted- pre-dated the creation of a monetary authority (1863-1886).

The Treasury was the single issuer of government notes until 1880 when Banco

Nacional was created to operate as the government's bank and with the purpose of

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 38
issuing national currency. However, it was the persistence of fiscal deficits and in

particular the civil war of 1885 which triggered the unification of the monetary

system and greatly undermined the free banking movement. In a clear effort to

appropriate seigniorage revenues and ensure government access to foreign capital,

notes issued by Banco Nacional became in 1885 the only legal tender and all other

monetary standards were removed (Meisel, 1992). Although Banco Nacional was

dismantled in 1894, its non-convertible bills would circulate as medium of exchange

and unit of account until 1905.

The final decade of the 19th century was plagued with political turmoil and another

civil war erupted in 1899. The conflict required a significant increase in government

spending and led to unprecedented levels of paper money issuance. Such

uncontrolled monetary expansion brought about the largest exchange rate

devaluation and inflation rate in Colombian history. Toward the end of the conflict,

the country saw the first systematic effort to enhance credibility in the monetary

strategy when the government finally acknowledged the need to ensure consistency

between monetary and fiscal policies (Lopez 1990).

Unsuccessful attempts to return to the gold standard characterized the first years of

the 20th century. In 1905 the credibility of the monetary strategy received another

lift -at least a temporary one- with the creation of Central Bank of Colombia (CBC).

The CBC was conceived as an autonomous bank (fully owned by the private sector)

and was granted the monopoly of currency issuance. The Bank quickly moved

toward a partially convertible system in a clear effort to reinstate some kind of gold

standard orthodoxy. However, the many extra-monetary tasks and functions that



                                                                                   39
were introduced into the Bank's charter, and the poor management of external

surpluses eventually posed numerous constraints on the ability of CBC to exercise

appropriate monetary control. In due course, paper money issuance was again on

the rise and the CBC was liquidated by Congress in 1909.

The economic effects of the First World War and the ensuing economic crisis of the

1920s made it imperative that the government gained access to external funds. To

secure the confidence -and loans- of U.S. banks, many Latin American countries

would seek a "seal of approval" from international experts in financial matters and

the Kemmerer missions came to being. Although proposals for the introduction of a

single monetary authority were put forth prior to the Kemmerer Mission, in 1922

Congress explicitly instructed the government to promote the creation of a central

bank and the “Money Doctor” was called upon.

The Kemmerer Mission in Colombia culminated in the creation of Banco de la

Republica (BR), which was chartered in 1923 as a mixed entity where government

ownership was expected not to surpass 50%. Private banks and especially foreign

ones (given the strong dependence on external credit) were expected to be

represented within the remaining 50%. The creation of BR was accompanied by

substantial financial legislation which brought a definite end to the era of free-

banking, and regulated the formation and operation of financial institutions.

From its inception, it was acknowledged that BR was to act not just as a government

bank but also as the banker of banks and as the single issuer of legal tender that

could oversee monetary stability. Moreover, a strong sense of independence was

evident in the creation of the Bank with a Board of Directors as its sole ruling body



                                                                                  40
that appointed the governor without government intervention. Unfortunately, as

with most central banks at the time, BR would still act as the Government's lender.

The return to full gold convertibility in 1923 helped tame the inflationary pressures

that would come from excessive lending to the government. By the same token,

however, the "pegged" exchange rate regime and its endogenous money supply

limited the ability of the central bank to manage the surges in capital flows of the

mid 1920s and the ensuing financial crisis of the 1930s. At any rate, following the

events of 1929 and the early 1930s, and after a second Kemmerer Mission, BR

reluctantly abandoned convertibility right after Britain left gold in 1931.

In the post-Depression years Colombia was forced to run trade and fiscal surpluses,

which translated into a moderate growth of money creation and relatively low and

stable inflation. However, Keynesian ideas soon overtook economic policymaking;

by the mid-1940s the economy was again running large fiscal deficits and BR's

functions were successively modified to allow for larger and more frequent loans to

the executive branch (Lopez 1990). This deficit monetization along with the scarcity

of several imported goods that followed the American involvement in World War II

fueled price increases and inflation reached 20% in 1944.

After the unprecedented devaluation caused by the moratorium of 1935, the real

exchange rate appreciated systematically during the 1940s, due to a combination of

growing export revenues and rising domestic prices. The government grew

increasingly worried about this trend and led the efforts to promote exports

through an undervalued currency. However, the several decreed devaluations of the

late 1940s and early 1950s, and the introduction of a multiple exchange rate system



                                                                                  41
did little to prevent further real appreciation in the face of persistent inflationary

pressures. In a desperate effort to control inflation, the government and the central

bank urged the major commercial banks in 1950 to restrict new lending (a so-called

“Gentlemen’s Pact”); as a consequence, the money supply contracted for the first

time since the Great Depression and inflation entered negative terrain for a brief

period.

The real contraction caused by the “Pact” was substantial and compounded with the

appreciation problems already faced by domestic firms. Eventually, BR was called

upon to supply credit to various private initiatives for export promotion as well as

agricultural, industrial and urban development, a strategy that continued to

undermine the credibility and independence of the central bank. At the same time,

the Bank was given little command over the various monetary control instruments,

and it was only after the explicit recommendation of a mission of experts from the

New York Federal Reserve (the "Grove Mission") that BR was allowed to set and

modify the reserve requirement. The latter would remain the principal monetary

policy instrument for the next thirty years (Sanchez et al. 2007).

The late 1950s and 1960s were characterized by persistent macroeconomic

disequilibria reflecting falling coffee prices and recurrent fiscal deficits (with a short

period of surpluses in 1957-60) that the central bank eventually financed with

issuance. After a severe balance of payments crisis in 1957, the government devised

a stabilization plan aimed at rebalancing the external accounts by controlling

devaluation expectations and restricting imports. It was during this period of

marked heterodox economic policymaking and growing state intervention in the



                                                                                       42
economy that BR was stripped of its monetary control function. In 1963 a new

agency -the “Junta Monetaria” or Monetary Board- was created for that purpose, this

time with full government control. The Board was composed of several ministers

and other officials appointed by the president and the governor of BR which

thereafter merely oversaw the execution of the Board's decisions and issued

currency accordingly.

The Government control of the central bank was completed in 1971 when the

central government nationalized the Bank's capital. Many scholars of Colombian

monetary history agree that the inflationary bias that plagued the conduct of

monetary policy throughout most of the second half of the century can be traced

back to the government takeover of the monetary control functions in the early

1960s (Carrasquilla 1996). Indeed, there would not be an autonomous monetary

authority in Colombia for the following three decades.

Shortly after the Board was established, Colombia adopted a crawling peg regime

and during the 1970s and 1980s exchange rate management and capital controls

were the main concern of the monetary authorities. In fact, Echeverry (1996) shows

that shocks to foreign exchange (FX) reserves were the major source of fluctuations

in the money supply and inflation during this period. Moreover, he argues that the

persistence of moderate inflation for more than two decades in Colombia resulted

from timid policy responses to such shocks.

With the spread of the 1982 debt crisis, the Colombian government found it

increasingly difficult to obtain external funds to tackle the ensuing domestic

financial collapse. Thus, BR was called upon to fund the government once again, this



                                                                                 43
time through various financial instruments including explicit guarantees to

government liabilities and direct credit lines to the Treasury. By 1985, the total

government financing provided by the central bank (through the various

instruments) amounted 4.5% of GDP, comparable only with the 2.2% reached in

1932 in the aftermath of the Great Depression (Kalmanovitz and Avella 1998).

The roots of the IT strategy in Colombia can be traced back to 1991, when a new

constitution was drafted reinstating BR as the sole authority in charge of monetary

control. After almost three decades of government-run monetary policy, the

constitution formally made BR an autonomous agency with full operational

independence. This was arguably the single most important institutional change

concerning economic policy of the second half of the 20th century. Furthermore, the

new constitution explicitly mandated the now independent central bank with the

primary goal of maintaining price stability.

Given the importance that the constitution attached to central bank independence,

the structure and composition of BR's Board of Governors became an important

institutional design issue. It was decided that the Board would consist of seven

members, two of which would be the Bank governor and the minister of finance. The

incumbent administration could appoint at most two of the remaining members,

who could serve for four consecutive periods (if reappointed). As in the original

charter of 1923, the governor would be appointed by the Board.

The first step towards enhancing the credibility of monetary policy was to announce

an inflation target which the central bank did for the first time in 1991. The BR

strategy was clearly one of gradual disinflation; the inflation target for the first two



                                                                                     44
years was set at 22% and remained above 15% until 1999. Among the reasons for

this slow adjustment were the relatively low credibility in the policies of the newly

independent BR (Gomez 2000), and the difficult transition toward an intermediate

exchange rate regime that allowed for some moderate flexibility.

With the change in focus toward an inflation target as the nominal anchor, a higher

degree of exchange rate flexibility was required in order to regain monetary control.

However, after a quarter of a century under a crawling peg, political and

institutional constraints to let the currency float were numerous (Urrutia et al.

2014). Accordingly, BR adopted a currency band with positive slope as the exchange

rate regime. During these transition years, monetary bands were used as

intermediate targets, although an interest rate range was also defined in addition to

the currency band. Such multiplicity of intermediate targets sometimes made

difficult the formation of inflation expectations and may have also contributed to the

slow process of disinflation (Reveiz 2002).

With the financial turmoil of 1998 and 1999, the central bank had to intervene

repeatedly in the foreign exchange market and the currency band was adjusted

upwards twice while the band itself was widened once. Eventually, the central bank

was forced to let the currency float amidst large capital outflows and the most

severe economic recession that Colombia has experienced since the 1930s which in

turn called for IMF assistance and the beginning of a stand-by program.

Once the currency was allowed to float, the last requirement for a full-fledged IT

strategy –which BR announced in 2000– was met and the central bank was finally

able to set its monetary policy stance by using a single instrument: the interest rate.



                                                                                    45
Moreover, with the recession at the turn of the century inflation fell steeply down to

a single digit and contributed to breaking inertia in both actual inflation and, more

importantly, expectations. This in turn allowed BR to reduce its inflation target from

15% in 1999 to 10% in 2000 and 6% in 2001. For the last five years (2009-2013)

inflation has hovered around 3%, at the center of the central bank's long term

inflation target of 2%-4%.

Although the first 20 years of the IT strategy in Colombia have been of relative

success, an issue that deserves some discussion is related to the management of the

exchange rate regime. As it happens, the central bank has engaged in several

episodes of capital controls and direct FX market interventions, most of them

associated with protracted periods of currency appreciation. Vargas (2005) points

out that such interventions, especially when aimed at affecting the trend or level

(rather than the volatility) of the exchange rate, have been problematic for BR for

several reasons. First, by implicitly aiming at some exchange rate target, the central

bank sends conflicting messages as to its true priorities in terms of inflation. This in

turn makes the process of communicating policy -a cornerstone of the IT strategy

(Bernanke and Mishkin 1997)- difficult. Moreover, repeated interventions have

usually failed to revert the appreciation trend and instead have resulted in quasi-

fiscal costs through the valuation of reserves. Finally, sterilizing FX interventions

involves selling government securities which has the double effect of reducing the

availability of these instruments for monetary control and pushing up the secondary

market rates which in turn increases the cost of government financing.

Urrutia et al. (2014) argue that the costs in terms of credibility of the IT strategy

have been relatively mild so far. However, these authors also point out that the

overall impact of exchange rate movements on aggregate economic activity are

negligible and that, in any case, the attempts to manage the exchange rate have been

largely unsuccessful. Hence, the motivation for such rather unconventional

interventions seems to be rooted in the political economy constraints faced by the

central bank. This is an issue that remains unresolved since the unbalancing effect

brought about by the introduction of presidential reelection is yet to be addressed.

Mexico 8

Like the other Latin American countries examined in this paper Mexico had a

chaotic monetary history in the nineteenth century.

After a long period of free banking and several episodes of high inflation and

banking crises, the idea of having an official central bank was introduced into the

1917 Mexican Constitution. The details of such scheme were worked out by the

“Comision de Reorganizacion Administrativa y Financiera” led by Edwin Kemmerer,

and Banco de Mexico was finally created in 1925. The Bank grew out of the

“Comision Monetaria”, a government body aimed at containing the hyperinflation

and banking collapse of the tumultuous Revolutionary years (1914-1917) when

Mexico left the Gold Standard and embarked on excessive deficit spending. Before

the creation of Banco de Mexico in 1925, a number of banks, especially Banco

                                                                                48
Nacional de Mexico (Banamex), performed some of the functions currently

associated with central banking (Marichal, 1994; 2006).

The initial period of slow progress toward becoming an operating monetary

authority was suddenly interrupted by the financial turmoil of the 1930s. The

aftermath of the Great Depression brought about the first attempt to enhance the

consistency and credibility of Banco de Mexico’s policies with the introduction of the

1932 Monetary Act. This piece of legislation eliminated the Bank’s retail banking

operation, and let the Mexican currency to float while allowing the central bank to

intervene the gold market. A short period of stability followed and the confidence in

the national currency grew, which in turn allowed the central bank to established

itself as a the sole monetary authority. A second lift to the central bank’s credibility

came in 1936 with the Bank’s new Organic Law which introduced strict limits to the

amount of credit that the Bank could grant the government effectively limiting the

scope of deficit spending that could be financed by the inflation tax.

As in most developing countries, the history of central banking in Mexico has been

intimately linked to its external and fiscal accounts (and by implication to its

exchange rate). In fact, the pass-through effect from exchange rate to inflation has

been   traditionally   large   (Perez-Lopez    Elguezabal,    1996)      and   sovereign

debt/currency crises have usually resulted in (at least temporary) inflationary

bouts. These features of the Mexican economy have often resulted in episodes of

severe fiscal dominance and foreign exchange market interventions, both of which

have undermined the credibility of the (often halfhearted) disinflationary efforts.

While a balance of payments crisis in 1936 forced the bank to devalue the Peso, the



                                                                                     49
wave of capital inflows that came with World War II (as investors sought safe

heaven) put Banco de Mexico to the test regarding its commitment to fend off

inflationary pressures stemming from fast money creation. Open market operations

were used for the first time and, more importantly, the reserve requirement, first

used in 1948, became the main policy instrument. Reserve requirements would be

the backbone of Banco de Mexico’s policy for the following four decades.

By adhering to the Bretton Woods (BW) system in 1944, Mexico again fixed its

exchange rate in a clear effort to borrow credibility from abroad, following a spike in

inflation which reached its (up to then) all-time high in 1944. During the capital

inflows surge of 1949, the policy of high reserve requirements (close to 100% in

some cases) was commonplace. With the inevitable capital flow reversals that

followed, substantial devaluations were needed in 1948, 1949, 1950 and 1955, a

practice that did a poor service to the credibility of the monetary regime, and

ultimately meant that U.S. money growth was not a much of an anchor for Mexican

monetary policy. After the last devaluation in 1955, however, and as a key element

of a recently devised economic stabilization plan (“stabilizing development”), the

central bank strengthened its commitment with the fixed exchange rate regime.

Available estimates suggest that the elasticity of domestic money growth to changes

in U.S. money growth was indeed larger during the 1955-73 period than during

1948-54 (Barro 1979), a clear sign that the central bank intended to increase the

credibility of the regime.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the reputation of the central bank grew hand in

hand with that of two major figures, Rodrigo Gomez and Antonio Ortiz Mena,



                                                                                    50
respectively Governor of Banco de Mexico and Secretary of Finance for most of that

period. Turrent-Diaz (2007) calls this the period of central bank “charismatic

autonomy” since, despite the legal impairments to central bank independence

introduced in the 1930s and 1940s, the Bank’s autonomy was safeguarded by the

intellectual prestige and charisma of its leaders (Gomez and Ortiz-Mena). In other

words, central bank independence was achieved in a de facto matter rather than

assured by de jure means. The strong commitment to the BW system by both

monetary and fiscal authorities resulted in the adoption of policies consistent with

the exchange rate regime. Accordingly, for most of the 1955-70 period, the

government increased its deficit spending only at rates slightly above that of real

economic growth and the central bank did precisely the same with the money

supply (Wilford and Zecher 1979). In turn, the consistency of fiscal and monetary

policies during this period reinforced central bank credibility. These were years of

growth and relative stability: between 1955 and 1970 real income grew at an

average of 7% while inflation averaged 4% per year (see the “charismatic”

autonomy period).

During the 1970s and the early 1980s, severe balance of payments and debt crises

hit the Mexican economy. It was amidst the turbulent events of 1982 (the so-called

“debt crisis”) that the central bank was given a new boost of independence with the

constitutional amendment of Article 28, which now established a “decentralized”

Banco de Mexico. Such institutional reform did little to prevent the damage that

macroeconomic instability would inflict upon the central bank’s credibility,

however. In the years following the debt crisis, Mexico experienced significant



                                                                                 51
financial distress, exchange rate depreciations and the inflation rate climbed to

above 100% per year. While the central bank had not adopted an inflation target

strategy by this time, the inflationary eighties severely undermined its credibility.

All this resulted in a number of sectors (workers, businessmen, policymakers)

coming together in December 1987 to sign an economic pact (“Pacto de Solidaridad

Economica”, PSE) in an effort to make inflation control a policy priority. Although

inflation did not recede immediately -and in fact kept rising until 1988 following

sustained depreciations- it eventually fell to around 20% in mid-1989.

A major enhancement to central bank credibility came in 1993, when Article 28 was

amended again to grant full administrative and operational autonomy to Bank of

Mexico, as well as an explicit mandate to guard purchasing power. This new

amendment was part of a broader wave of market-oriented institutional reforms

that took place during the 1988-1994 “sexenio”. The relative success of the “Pacto”

in terms of falling inflation (which hovered around 7% in 1994) and accelerating

economic growth, along with a generalized shift toward economic liberalism both

inside and outside Mexico were the main forces underlying these important

transformations. In 1988 Mexicans elected Carlos Salinas de Gortari –a Harvard-

trained economist– as their president who, in due course, pursued an aggressive

policy of privatizations and trade liberalization. Moreover, Salinas de Gortari also

favored monetary orthodoxy and financial liberalization, and, in 1993 put forth the

aforementioned amendment aimed at strengthening central bank independence and

monetary policy credibility. The new law also established overlapping appointments

for the Governor and Deputy Governors which are appointed by the incumbent



                                                                                  52
president halfway through the presidential period, but cannot be removed by the

incoming one. With the introduction of these changes in the Bank’s workings and

scope, the period after 1993 is characterized by Turrent-Diaz (2007) as one of

“institutional” central bank autonomy, where independence is rooted on solid legal

and constitutional grounds, as well as on a widespread popular support.

After only three years of relative stability and falling inflation rates, the Tequila

crises put the central bank to the test once again. The years of large capital inflows

and high private and public spending gave way to several months of severe financial

distress. While the short maturity of dollar denominated debt was at the heart of the

debt crisis, it was the capital flows reversal which exposed the conflict between the

Central Bank’s exchange rate policy and its low-and-stable inflation goal (the “tri-

lemma” of international finance). As the need for a large exchange rate adjustment

grew, the credibility of both policies was heavily undermined, which ultimately led

to a currency crisis and a bout of inflation, with the exchange rate depreciating more

than 100% in December 1994 and annual inflation reaching over 40% in early 1995

(Carstens and Werner 2000). These developments forced the Mexican authorities to

pursue a rapid transition toward a floating exchange rate regime and a monetary

regime based solely on price stability.

The need to rehabilitate the much damaged central bank credibility in the face of a

depreciation-fueled inflation spike can help explain why short term interest rates

continued to rise substantially even after abandoning the currency band. However,

regaining credibility in the monetary policy strategy would require a combination of

increasing monetary control and the leadership of Guillermo Ortiz Martínez, the



                                                                                   53
technocrat with a sterling reputation who had weathered the 1994-5 crisis as

Finance Secretary. Once the Peso was allowed to float, the central bank could finally

adopt an inflation targeting (IT) approach in 1996, first as an internal strategy and

finally as a public commitment in 2001. The bank also drifted away from its

quantity-based instrument approach (reserve requirements) and into a price-based

instrument such as short term interest rates in the way modern central banks set

the monetary policy stance. Under the new exchange rate and monetary regime (IT),

a series of additional measures were taken in order to strengthen the credibility of

Banco de Mexico. In particular, Open Market Operations are now more flexible than

before (the equilibrium rate is completely free of intervention), the Bank exerts a

more rigorous control over domestic credit growth, and the entire monetary policy

strategy is now extensively documented and communicated to participants of both

financial and real markets (Werner and Carstens 2000).

All in all, the most recent monetary regime (IT) has enjoyed widespread success. For

one, there is ample evidence that the exchange pass-through has dropped

significantly under the new regime (Cortes 2013). This has reinforced the central

bank’s instrument independence and has made credible announcements that

priority is given to price stability and not exchange rate targeting. Indirect evidence

of such credibility can be found in the systematic efforts by the corporate sector to

reduce their foreign currency debt in the expectation that, when pressed, the central

bank will rather concentrate on inflation than defend any hypothetical exchange

rate level (Martinez and Werner, 2002). Similarly, several characterizations of

inflation through its time-series properties portray the process as non-stationary



                                                                                    54
before the year 2000, but stationary thereafter (Chiquiar et al. 2010), reflecting the

fact that the announcement of inflation targets has served as an effective (credible)

nominal anchor. In fact, 12-month inflation expectations reached its all-time low in

2007, at 3.5% and its dispersion has decreased consistently since the adoption of

the IT regime (Garcia-Verdu, 2012). A final piece of evidence suggestive of the

relatively high credibility of Banco de Mexico’s policies is reflected in the

backward/forward looking nature of price setting by firms (which also embeds the

outcomes of wage bargaining).                  Ramos-Francia and Torres (2006) provide

conclusive evidence that after 1997, the gradual fall in inflation has resulted in firms

adjusting their prices less frequently and becoming more forward-looking (than in

the years prior to 1997) in their price setting-behavior.

A Summing Up

The three narratives for the advanced countries illustrate the pendulum nature of

the evolution of central bank credibility. The case of the three emerging countries is

vastly different. These countries had little exchange rate credibility before they

adopted central banks and this prevailed until at least the 1980s. The record of the

twentieth century was one of high inflation and frequent currency and banking

crises and occasional debt crises. In the 1980s following the example of the

advanced countries the three Latin countries implemented policies to achieve

credibility by aiming for low and stable inflation. In each case the decision to grant

central bank independence from the fiscal authorities and then adopt a form of

inflation targeting in the 1990s has led to a significant reduction so far, in inflation

and the ushering in of central bank credibility.




5. Some Empirical Evidence on the Pendulum of Central Bank Credibility

Our empirical investigation analyzes the credibility performance of 10 central

banks. They are: Canada, France, Japan, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden,

Switzerland, The UK and the US. We rely on annual data going back to when the

central banks were established. The data are described in Bordo and Siklos (2014).

A Summary of Credibility across Regimes

Table 2 presents a summary record of the evolution of credibility across the three

main policy regimes for the ten countries. We compare the means and standard

deviations of observed inflation and a measure of the implicit inflation objective as




                                                                                     56
defined in equation (1) above based on a Taylor Rule as developed in Bordo and

Siklos (2014). The purpose of the table is to determine the differences between

observed inflation and what the model suggests was the implied average inflation

objective of the central bank throughout the regime.

The results in the table suggest that central banks inflation objectives and actual

inflation can be far apart. This could be because central banks practiced

considerable discretion, or because of large shocks which creates a wedge between

the observed and the implicit inflation objective.

In more detail, based on a comparison of mean observed inflation across the gold

standard (GS), Bretton Woods (BW), and price stability regimes (PS), we conclude

that GS has the lowest observed inflation rate; PS delivers the second lowest

inflation rate and BW is the highest. Thus the two regimes that had credible nominal

anchors delivered the best average inflation outcome.

A comparison of the standard deviations of the observed inflation rate shows that:

GS has the highest volatility of observed inflation and PS the lowest. The low

volatility of PS is a reflection of the Great Moderation. The high volatility of GS

relative to the other regimes may reflect the fact that the regime was focused on

price level stability rather than the inflation rate stability that characterizes the PS

regime.

A comparison of central bank implicit inflation rate objectives (based on rolling

estimates of the central bank’s inflation objective) reveals that both GS and PS have

the lowest inflation objectives so that it appears that the GS and PS regimes “tie the

hands“ of policy makers.

Notes: (1) GS is the Gold Standard; BW is Bretton Woods; PS is the price stability objective, and GM is the
Great Moderation; (2) INS means insufficient data to perform the calculations; (3) NA means not available
or no data (e.g., the central bank did not exist); (4) T is the number of observations; (5) With some
exceptions the calculations assume that an interest rate instrument is used. The exceptions are: money
growth instrument for the BW period, exchange rate instrument (BW for Norway and France, GS for Italy).
The calculations are based on the procedures detailed in Bordo and Siklos (2014) where the estimates are
based on a 10 year window that is rolled 5 years at a time. Again, see Bordo and Siklos (2014) for the
details; (4) Standard deviations in parenthesis.


                                                                                                        58
Finally, a comparison of the standard deviation of the central banks’ implicit

inflation rate objective shows that PS has the lowest standard deviation in most

countries. Thus the moderating effect on price variability found for observed

inflation is mirrored by relatively low variability in the central banks’ inflation rate

objective.

A Measure of the Probability a Regime is Credible

Next, we ask how monetary policy regimes impact credibility in probabilistic terms.

We ask if, for example, GS raises or reduces the likelihood that a regime is credible?

We use a Tobit regression where the dependent variable is the measure of

credibility estimated from equation (1) above from Bordo and Siklos (2014). If the

estimate of credibility is greater than 1 (i.e., a 1% difference between actual inflation

and the central bank’s objective) then we assign a value of one to the dependent

variable. Otherwise a zero is assigned. This means that if observed inflation deviates

from the central bank’s inflation objective by more than 1% we effectively assume a

loss of credibility. Otherwise, deviations of less than 1% mean the loss of credibility.

Table 3 shows the results. A negative sign implies an increase in credibility, a

positive sign is interpreted as fall in credibility and a zero means that no statistically

significant link is found between the type of regime and credibility. INS means

insufficient data. The results in Table 3 show that in 5 out of 7 countries where we

had sufficient data, the GS increases credibility. Only for Germany is credibility

reduced while it is insignificant for Japan. BW reduces credibility in 8 out of 10

countries. It is insignificant for the U.S. Only for Canada was credibility raised.



A Comparison of Actual versus Expected Inflation Across Regimes for 10 Countries

Figure 10 compare actual with expected inflation. Expected inflation is the mean of

the forecasts from three different models in Bordo and Siklos (2014) that allow for

breaks, changes in persistence and moving averages. The closer expectations are

aligned with observed inflation the smaller the difference between the two series

and consequently, the more credible the central bank.

The key features that are apparent from these figures are: (1) that observed

inflation and expected inflation are most closely aligned in the gold standard period

because the dots are closer to the 45 degree line (here observed equals actual).

However, this comes at the cost of much greater volatility in prices (see Table 2).

This confirms the notion that the GS is akin to a price level target while inflation

targeting (explicit or implicit) regimes permit drift. Consequently, inflation volatility

has a strong moderating effect on inflation; (2) BW is the worst regime in terms of

delivering credibility with the principal exception of Germany and Switzerland

which have a strong “stability culture”; (3) Policy makers in the past two decades


                                                                                       60
have emphasized the importance of price stability but how it is defined and the

strategy used to achieve it differs across countries (e.g., inflation targeting versus a

more flexible monetary policy strategy); (4) it is clear that among the inflation

targeting (IT) countries in the sample (Canada, UK, Norway and Sweden) they have

been far more successful at anchoring expectations in the recent PS period than in

other countries where inflation is the declared aim. The only exceptions are

Germany and Switzerland. This can be seen in the flatter scatter plots in the IT

countries than elsewhere which means much less variation in expected inflation

than observed inflation; (5) Even in countries that are not as successful in anchoring

inflation expectations in the PS era there has been a large reduction in mean

inflation relative to the BW era. Hence, there are potentially two separate benefits

from PS: a mean reduction effect in inflation; and an enhancing effect with the latter

an added benefit of IT regimes.

The Determinants of Credibility

Table 4 explores the determinants of credibility using a panel regression. This is

adapted from Table 2 in Bordo and Siklos (2014). The highlighted yellow boxes

indicate statistical significance. Positive and negative signs at the top of the table

indicate that separate estimates were generated according to whether observed

inflation is ABOVE (+ve) or BELOW (-ve) the central bank’s implicit inflation

objective. It is an easy way to determine whether higher than desired inflation

(according to the central bank) influences credibility different than if inflation is

below the central bank’s target. A positive coefficient indicates that credibility is

reduced because the squared difference between observed and the inflation

objective increases, and vice versa, when the coefficient is negative.

The principal results were that: (1) adhering to the gold standard raises credibility;

(2) higher money growth reduces credibility but only when inflation is above the

central bank’s implicit inflation objective; (3) a rise in banking sector loans to GDP

reduces credibility but only when inflation is below the implicit inflation objective;

(4) greater central bank independence raises credibility. This is based on data since

the 1950s; (5) the exchange rate regime is defined so that the higher the value of the

variable the less flexible the exchange rate system. We find that less flexible systems

reduce credibility except when inflation rises above the central bank’s objective.

This could reflect the fact that a peg can serve as an anchor for inflation; (6) we find

that a rise in the sovereign debt to GDP ratio raises central bank credibility. This

may reflect the significance of the CBI variable and the fact that the government will




                                                                                     68
be constrained by a monetary policy determined to maintain the central bank’s

credibility.

In sum, our different strands of evidence provide complementary evidence for the

pendulum hypothesis. Both the gold standard and the recent price stability regime

had considerable credibility while the Bretton Woods era (with the exception of

Germany and Switzerland did not). Institutional factors like central bank

independence enhanced credibility. Finally in the recent period, countries adhering

to formal inflation targeting had great credibility than those which do not—a point

to be further developed in section 6.




                                                                                                             69
6. Inflation Targeting as a Credibility Enhancing Policy Strategy

In the past two decades, since New Zealand first pioneered its use, a number of

advanced countries (e.g., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, The UK, Norway and

Sweden) have become inflation targeters. There is considerable evidence that IT

improves central bank credibility over non IT monetary policy strategies that focus

on maintaining low inflation (Walsh 2009). The evidence is not overwhelming that

advanced country IT central banks have delivered better inflation performance than

non It central banks (Ball and Sheridan 2005)9. But in the case of emerging

countries the superiority of IT is clear. Some additional new evidence presented

below further reinforces these conclusions.

The main advantage of IT for enhancing credibility is that it is a superior means of

anchoring inflation expectations. It does this by clearly stating the target and

communicating its intentions on how to maintain it. Walsh (2009), and others,

explain that IT has greater transparency than other monetary policy strategies and

is more accountable to the public. Below we provide some evidence that in the

recent PS regime, IT countries had greater central bank credibility than their non IT

counterparts.

The first thing to note is that there is little difference in overall inflation between all

advanced countries and the Eurozone. Second there is less volatility in inflation in

advanced countries with IT and they are consistently much closer to the roughly 2%

inflation target that advanced countries have typically adopted. Third, emerging

countries with IT do consistently deliver better inflation performance than

emerging market countries in general. Finally, we see that while there is no

apparent convergence in inflation performance between the countries that do not

have IT (EMEs and the World group) the differential in inflation in emerging



                                                                                                                                 71
countries with IT and emerging countries more generally rises as we get closer to

the present and as a result, inflation in IT emerging countries is slowly converging to

inflation in advanced countries. These results echo those by Walsh (2009) and

others.

Transparency

One of the advantages of inflation targeting is that it embodies greater transparency

than non IT regimes. Using the Dincer-Eichengreen (2007) annual index ( also see

Dincer and Eichengreen 2014), made up of 15 indicators of transparency for 105

countries updated by Siklos (2014), where the index ranges from 0 to 15 we

compare in figure 12 the transparency index score between advanced IT countries

with the mean transparency index score for all countries in the sample.

Note: The horizontal axis measures mean overall transparency (sum of 15 categories that sum up to the
transparency index in advanced economies with numerical inflation targets (IT; IMF definition). The
vertical axis measures mean overall transparency (i.e., TI) for the country groupings labelled in the figure.
Each circle represents an annual observation. The world consists of all 105 economies in the sample.


                                                                                                         72
The figure is drawn such that the dots when transparency is low begin in 1998 and,

with few exceptions, rises over time until 2013. We see from figure 12 that

emerging countries with IT start in 1998 at the same point as the world but begin to

converge rapidly towards the advanced countries. Not only do the emerging

countries adopt IT very quickly but they become more transparent.

Note: the TI (also see figure 12) for the worst performing economy and the best performing economy for
each category of economy shown (i.e., EME, World, Advanced), depending on whether they follow a
numerical inflation target (IT) or not.



We next show the transparency index data in a time series format with the country

groupings clearly shown. See figure 13. The figure shows that the range of

transparency across central banks in the world remains quite large. Even the worse

performing EMEs easily outperform the worst in the world. Hence, in the emerging

market countries is also clearly associated with much greater transparency. Indeed


                                                                                                                                              73
the best emerging countries with IT outperform the ‘least‘ transparent or worst

performing advanced countries. Finally, we note that by 2006 the best performing

central banks in the world with respect to transparency have reached the maximum

score of 15 by 2006.

Inflation and Transparency

We now turn to the relationship between inflation and transparency. See figure 14.

The figure shows that there is a strong, statistically significant and negative

relationship between inflation performance (vertical axis) and transparency

(horizontal axis) for EMEs which adopted IT (left hand side plot). However we don’t

find such a relationship for the entire emerging market group of countries (not

shown). The slope is also negative but the coefficient is insignificant for the world as

a whole (middle plot). Finally, we do not find a link between transparency and

inflation for advanced countries because they have largely converged both in terms

of transparency and the level of inflation. Thus the figure suggests that transparency

delivers benefits but these generally wear out after a number of years. After a CB

becomes transparent it still needs to demonstrate competence and an ability to set

the appropriate stance of policy and deal successfully with crises.

                       Figure 14. Inflation and transparency




                                                                                     74
Credibility

We next turn to the issue of credibility. For the brief recent period examined in this

section we use a simpler method to generate our measure of credibility than the one

outlined in Bordo and Siklos (2014). Credibility is defined above as the squared

difference between observed and target inflation. However target inflation is

evaluated as the mean of inflation forecasts derived from an AR(1) and IMA(1,1)

model using annual data whereas a more sophisticated approach that permits the

target to be a function of one of three potential instruments of policy and is

endogenously determined is used in Bordo and Siklos ( 2014). The results in figure

15 illustrate the evolution of credibility since 2005. The data reveal that if inflation

forecasts are generated with only the most recent data these indicate that credibility

has improved since the bars are generally lower than if we assume that inflation

forecasts are generated for a much longer sample. In other words, this figure

provides indirect evidence that central banks with IT appear to have succeeded in

anchoring inflation at lower levels. The notable exception to this result is the

Eurozone (middle figure) which does not refer to itself as an inflation targeting

central bank.




                                                                                     75
                          Figure 15. Credibility indicator




Finally, we present some regressions which focus on the determinants of credibility

for IT and non IT countries in various groupings. The dependent variable in the

regressions is credibility, proxied as the square of the forecast error where the

inflation forecast is generated by estimates from two time series models: an AR(1)

and an integrated moving average of order 1. The mean of the two inflation

forecasts is then taken as the proxy for the central bank’s inflation objective. This

implies that a form of inflation forecasting targeting is assumed. Our results,

therefore, should be viewed as illustrative and tentative about the determinants of

credibility. The regressions for advanced countries with IT and emerging market

countries with IT are panel regressions with fixed effects. The Eurozone and “world’

regressions are time series regressions. The statistically significant coefficients are

highlighted in bold. Tables 5 and 6 show the results for the advanced countries with

IT. Table 7 shows the results for the Eurozone. Table 8 shows the results for the

emerging countries with IT. Finally Table 9 shows the results for the world.

The main findings from these tables are as follows:

(1)     Consistent with the previous figures transparency does not seem to be

related to credibility in advanced countries with IT. However, in Table 6 when

credibility is interacted with a dummy set to one when the countries in the panel

adopt IT, the transparency index coefficient becomes negative, an indication that

transparency improves credibility. This is more than offset, however, by the

coefficient on the IT dummy, an indication that advanced countries with IT saw a fall

in credibility, other things being equal during the time they targeted inflation. This

may be explained by the crisis of 2007-2013 which takes up almost half the sample




                                                                                      81
and may be capturing other factors like quantitative easing and other unorthodox

response measures.

(2)    The net lending/borrowing (by the private sector) variable is also significant

indicating that when bank lending rises central bank credibility falls;

(3)    The Eurozone regressions in Table 7 sees no credibility bonus from

transparency, conditional on the variables considered. The lending variable is also

significant as in the case of the advanced countries.

(4)    Tables 8 and 9 compare the emerging countries with IT with the “world”

(essentially a proxy for no IT). Emerging countries with IT see a credibility bonus

from greater transparency (this result holds even when we interact with IT and add

in an IT dummy as in Table 6 for advanced countries; not shown). There is no

credibility bonus in the rest of the world from greater transparency. Since the

“world” includes the 30 countries that adopted IT this suggests that we are stacking

the decks against the ITers and so the results suggest a significant link between the

adoption of IT, greater transparency, and more central bank credibility.

Overall our empirics suggest that in general countries adopting IT have greater

credibility and transparency than those without it. These results are most striking

for the group of emerging market countries.




7. Policy Lessons

The historical and empirical approach taken in this paper reveals a pendulum in

central bank credibility from the nineteenth century to the present. The recent




                                                                                  82
popularity of monetary policy regimes which emphasize price stability (PS) has

been characterized by a level of credibility that is similar to the one observed under

the classical gold standard. However, the current regime is based on a more flexible

fiat money system. The recent PS experience has been greatly enhanced by the

adoption of inflation targeting (IT), and the evidence suggests that this has been

especially true for some emerging market economies.

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 forced central banks to focus on lender of last

resort actions and enact other policies to preserve financial stability. These actions

involved working closely with the fiscal authorities and some observers have

suggested that this turn of events has compromised their independence. Of course,

even policy makers who place a heavy emphasis on the critical role of central bank

autonomy also recognize the value of fiscal and monetary policies working in

harmony.

Since the crisis central banks have been engaged in unorthodox quantitative easing

policies which depart greatly from the traditional “bills only” approach. Moreover

the evidence to date also points to the conclusion that through the crisis period the

nominal anchor has held and inflation has remained low and stable while no policy

regime formally referred to as consistent with inflation targeting has been

abandoned. As the IMF pointed out recently, “ inflation is the dog that didn’t bite’

(IMF 2013). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to pose the question: will central banks

continue to remain credible when they promise to preserve a policy to maintain

inflation low and stable? After all there are prominent voices arguing for higher

inflation than we have experienced in recent years or to raise the levels at which



                                                                                   83
inflation is considered to be low, in part to ease the burden of rising debt, to

vanquish thoughts of slipping into a Japan style deflation, or because observed

inflation rates remain well below explicitly stated targets.10

The recent financial crisis has also led to the call for central banks to elevate the goal

of financial stability to the same level as price stability. This is based on the belief

that the credit cycle will create future imbalances and future asset booms and busts

and financial crises. Hence, CBs should head off these imbalances by preemptive

monetary policy. However, such policies (assuming they work and do not backfire

as occurred in the U.S. in 1929 and Japan 1990) may be problematic if they impinge

on central banks main mandate for low and credible inflation.               That is, the

profession is still grappling with the nature of any possible trade-off that might exist

between price stability and financial system stability. Part of the difficulty is that

whereas the effects of various instruments of monetary policy are well understood

the same is not the case for the variety of so-called macro prudential tools being

used. It may well be the case that a regime that works well in ‘normal times’ needs

to be suspended, and credibly so, during extraordinary or crisis times.

There are a number of recent illustrations suggestive of the difficulty in balancing

the twin objectives of price and financial stability. For example recent concerns in

Sweden and Norway over rising house prices led the Riksbank and Norges Bank to

keep their policy rates higher than dictated by usual macro indicators

demonstrating that the conventional tool of monetary policy, the policy interest

10This is not the case everywhere. Spillover effects from ultra-loose monetary
policies in the U.S. and other advanced countries, combined with domestic factors,
have led to inflation rates that exceed inflation target objectives in economies such
as Brazil.


                                                                                       84
rate, can be a heavy-handed weapon to deal with asset price inflation (e.g. see

Svensson 2014). Indeed, around the time this paper was written, the Riksbank did

an about face and cut the repo rate around the time other central banks are

beginning to talk more openly about raising their policy rates.

For the U.S., U.K. and Canada, the central banks have kept policy rates unusually low

because they don’t see inflation on the horizon and their economies continue to be

recovering. But this can contribute to asset price inflation. In addition there is the

potential loss of credibility if central banks decide to tighten monetary policy earlier

than planned. Mark Carney of the Bank of England and Jim Bullard of the Federal

Reserve have both said that markets are not preparing themselves for rate rises and

the 2014 BIS Annual Report makes the same point. As a result, there is always the

possibility that these central banks may make the one big mistake that will ruin

their reputations as in the Ben Franklin quote earlier in the paper.

Several considerations are involved in determining the likelihood that central bank

credibility and reputation will be adversely affected: (1) the use of the policy rate for

multiple objectives can be a threat to CB credibility because it may give conflicting

signals to the public. An historical example of this problem was the use of sterilized

exchange market intervention by the Federal Reserve from 1962 to 1995. Holding

constant the question about its effectiveness, the FOMC in the mid-1990s decided to

greatly down play its use because it threatened their new emphasis on credibility

for low inflation (Bordo, Humpage and Schwartz 2014).

(2) The use of other macro prudential tools such as leverage ratios, loan to value

ratios, liquidity ratios, margin requirements and capital ratios to stabilize the credit



                                                                                      85
cycle may also be problematic. The problem is that by adding on extra tools to the

CBs toolkit it may complicate the CBs mission. Again turning to history, in the 1950s

and 60s many central banks used such instruments to influence the level and

growth of credit and money. These policies ultimately were abandoned because

they were not viewed as successful. CBs also influenced the allocation of credit to

different sectors of the economy. This use of credit policy where the CB picks

winners and losers, referred to as credit policy-- a form of fiscal policy according to

Goodfriend (2012) may distort resource allocation and compromise CB

independence. More important it may conflict with the central bank’s main mandate

which is to maintain price stability.

Thus, central banks may wish to exercise caution in joining the macro prudential

bandwagon. The evidence on the existence of credit cycles is not yet overwhelming

although many observers have argued that excessive credit growth was one of the

principal culprits in the last financial crisis (e.g. see Drehmann and Juselius 2013).

Part of the difficulty is that financial crisis can originate from the non-banking sector

as well and their role in the transmission mechanism is not yet fully understood.

There is no consensus macro model yet to back up the widespread use of these

policies unlike the workhorse New Keynesian models currently being adapted to

incorporate financial sector influences. Also it is not clear that central banks rather

than other agencies can most efficiently conduct these policies. Many countries

delegate these tasks to other agencies and the Treasury. In addition there are few

serious macro models to back up the widespread use of these policies. Protecting
