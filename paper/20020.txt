The ACA: Some Unpleasant Welfare Arithmetic

                                            ABSTRACT

Under the Affordable Care Act, between six and eleven million workers would increase their disposable
income by cutting their weekly work hours. About half of them would primarily do so by making
themselves eligible for the ACA's federal assistance with health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket
health costs, despite the fact that subsidized workers are not able to pay health premiums with pre-tax
dollars. The remainder would do so primarily by relieving their employers from penalties, or the threat
of penalties, pursuant to the ACA's employer mandate. Women, especially those who are not married,
are more likely than men to have their short-term financial reward to full-time work eliminated by
the ACA. Additional workers, beyond the six to eleven million, could increase their disposable income
by using reduced hours to climb one of the "cliffs" that are part of the ACA's mapping from household
income to federal assistance.

           The Affordable Care Act presents employers and potential employees with a variety of
new rewards and penalties. Will the law help the labor market recover from the recession, or
further prolong it? Complete answers to these questions must consider how incentives would be
different with the law than without it. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the number of
people who will have essentially no short-term financial reward from working more than 29
hours, and thereby either rendering themselves ineligible for the ACA’s assistance or increasing
the penalties that may be owed by their employer.

           Even when helping people out of work and otherwise with low incomes is a primary
policy motivation and the wage elasticity of labor supply is low, labor income tax rates that equal
or exceed one hundred percent are inconsistent with optimal tax theory (as long as work is not
socially harmful) because at a one hundred percent rate there is no longer a tradeoff between
efficiency and government revenue. From a positive point of view, economists expect that full-
time employment rates will be low, if not zero, in groups of people who are aware that they
receive no financial reward from working full-time (defined here to be working at least 30 hours
per week). These are a couple of more reasons to quantify the prevalence of marginal tax rates
that are near or exceed one hundred percent (hereafter, “prohibitive rates”).

           Section I begins with an overview of ACA provisions that, in effect, pay full-time
workers to reduce their weekly hours to 29. Section II walks through a specific example in
which moving to part time creates eligibility for subsidies that exceed the compensation lost
from working fewer hours. Section III presents the arithmetic of prohibitive employer penalties.
The somewhat more complicated arithmetic of prohibitive implicit taxes is presented in Section
IV. Sections V and VI conclude and discuss areas for further research.


I. ACA provisions that create 29ers1
           Two major provisions of the ACA tempt employers and employees to limit work
schedules to 29 hours per week. The most acknowledged is the penalty on large employers that

1
    Persons working just below the 30-hour threshold are sometimes known as “29ers.”
do not offer health insurance to their full-time employees, which are defined to be employees
working 30 hours or more per week (with an exception noted below). Because the amount of the
penalty is proportional to the number of full-time employees (over thirty) on the payroll, the
penalty creates an incentive to substitute part-time positions for full-time positions and to
monitor part-time employee hours so that they do not exceed 29 hours per week.

        The marginal penalty is either $2,000, zero, or $40,000 per full-time-employee year (the
ACA also adjusts each amount for health-cost inflation after 2014), depending whether the
average number of full-time employees on the payroll during the calendar year is greater than,
less than, or equal to, 49, respectively. For simplicity, this paper models the employer penalty as
if it had a constant marginal rate of $2,000 plus health-cost inflation, but in practice some of the
employers limiting work schedules to 29 hours per week will not owe any penalty and their limit
serves the purpose of avoiding the $40,000 marginal penalty.2 The penalty is not deductible
from the employer’s business taxes. Each $2,000 of penalty is therefore equivalent to $3,046 of
employee wages.3

        Less acknowledged is the ACA provision that full-time employees and their families
cannot receive subsidized health coverage on the ACA’s health insurance exchanges (hereafter,
“exchange subsidies,” even when referring to the subsidies that are administered as income tax
credits) unless their employer fails to offer coverage. Except in the increasingly rare cases where
part-time positions are eligible for employer health coverage too, an employee (and family) at a
firm offering coverage would be eligible for exchange subsidies only if he worked part-time,
which amounts to an implicit tax on full-time employment.4 The amount of the implicit tax on
full-time employment is equal to the employee’s valuation of the exchange subsidy he forgoes as
a consequence of working full-time. Assuming that household heads and spouses will not be
required to obtain family coverage through a dependent’s employment (sic) before they can
apply for subsidized exchange coverage, this implicit tax only applies to household heads and

  Gallen (2013) looks at the non-linearity of the penalty (in number of employees) and how it relates to the
allocation of labor between part- and full-time positions. The marginal penalty also depends on the number of full-
time equivalent employees on the payroll in the prior “look back” calendar year.

  3,046 = 2,000/[(1-0.39)*(1+0.0765)] where 39% and 7.65% are the employer business and payroll tax rates,
respectively.

  See also Gamage (2012) and Mulligan (2013). The incentives can be more complicated for dual-earner couples;
see below my discussion of the ACA’s “family glitch.”


                                                                                                                      2
spouses, and not to dependents because family coverage subsidies will be obtained on the basis
of the opportunities that head and spouse have for employer coverage.

        The implicit tax is similar in character to the employer penalty because both provisions
serve to give the government more net revenue from full-time jobs than from part-time jobs.
With the implicit tax, the government gets more net revenue from full-time employees at ESI
employers because those employees are ineligible for exchange subsidies. With the penalty, the
government gets more net revenue from full-time employees at (large) non-ESI employers
because those are the employees subject to penalties.

        The exchange subsidies are also phased out with household income, but the implicit full-
time tax would be present even without a phase out because full-time employment at ESI
employers by itself renders a worker and his family ineligible for the exchange subsidies.




II. Magnitudes of the 29er Wedge: An Example
        As an example of the full-time tax in action, consider a hypothetical person comparing a
part-time position to a full-time position. The full-time position, shown in the left column of
Table 1 requires 40 hours of work and $100 of employment expenses (such as commuting or
child care) per week, for 50 weeks per year. The part-time position requires 29 hours of work
and $75 employment expenses per week. Each of the positions costs the employer $26 per hour
worked, including employer payroll taxes and employer contributions for health insurance (if
any).

        Only the full-time position includes affordable health insurance, which means that a full-
time employee would not be eligible to receive assistance from the ACA for premiums or for
out-of-pocket health expenses.     The employer pays 78% of the premiums for the family
insurance plan, and withholds the remaining premiums of $3,146 from the paychecks of
participating full-time employees. Each full-time employee’s income subject to tax is $35,021,
which excludes employer payroll taxes (7.65% of the $35,021), employer health insurance
contributions, and employee premiums withheld.




                                                                                                3
       Part-time employees get less total compensation – $37,700 – because they work fewer
hours. The part-time employees are not eligible for ESI and the tax exclusions that go with it,
which makes their income subject to tax ($35,021) equal to their total compensation minus
employer payroll taxes. It is a coincidence that income subject to tax is the same for full-time
and part-time employees: more on this below.

       The part-time employees are eligible for subsidized health plans from the ACA’s
exchanges because they are not offered affordable health insurance by their employer. I assume
that the second cheapest silver plan has the same expected medical payments as the employer
plan: namely, $17,300 per year including out-of-pocket health expenses. By definition of silver
plan, the full premium is $12,110. However, because the employee has a family income subject
to tax of 145% of the federal poverty line (the employee is the sole earner in a family of four),
the ACA caps premiums for the second cheapest silver plan at 3.7 percent of their income
subject to tax, or $1,304 per year. The other $10,806 is paid by the U.S. Treasury to the insurer
pursuant to the ACA.

        By design, the silver health plans have lower premiums and greater out-of-pocket costs
(deductibles, copayments, etc.) than the typical employer plan. That design feature is visible in
Table 1 because exchange plan out-of-pocket costs total $5,190 rather than the $3,000 of out-of-
pocket health expenses associated with ESI. However, because the employee’s family is at
145% of the poverty line, the employee gets an 80% discount on the out-of-pocket expenses,
with the remainder paid by the U.S. Treasury to the insurer pursuant to the ACA.

       After health and work expenses, the part-time employee makes $28,929 per year, which
exceeds the full-time income ($27,021) after health and work expenses! Table 1 does not show
the employee payroll and personal income taxes, but those would be the same for the full-time
and part-time employee because the amount of the income subject to the two taxes is, in this
example, independent of full-time status.




                                                                                               4
           None of Table 1’s results reflects the employer penalty because the comparison shown is
for calendar year 2014.5 However, as explained throughout this paper, the employer penalty has
many of the same economic characteristics as foregone exchange subsidies, and vice versa.

           The hypothetical worker examined in Table 1 can, under the ACA, have more income by
working fewer hours. Table 1 does not show that this worker will have more income with the
ACA than without it (he may), because both columns assume that the ACA is in place. Among
other things, the ACA may affect the hourly employer cost shown in Table 1’s third row.6 The
purpose of Table 1 and the rest of this paper is to look at situations under the ACA in which a
decision to work less does not reduce disposable income.

           Table 1’s example is a bit simplified in that part-time employees have the same income
subject to tax and the same hourly employer cost as full-time employees. The Table illustrates a
general lesson that, under the ACA, moving from full-time employment to part-time employment
can trigger generous assistance with health premiums and out-of-pocket expenses that can offset
much of the income lost due to reduced work hours. The fact that the assistance is new means
that hours and employment patterns will not continue exactly as they have in the past (Mulligan
2014).

           Nevertheless, moving from part-time employment to full-time will not always, or even
usually, reduce disposable income as it does in Table 1. The purpose of this paper is to estimate
how many people will be in a “100+ percent tax” situation like the one shown in Table 1, so that
full-time work pays no better than part-time work.




III. The number and types of workers likely made 29ers by employer
penalties
           The ACA’s penalty on employers not offering affordable health insurance to their
employees is one reason that work schedules might be limited to 29 hours per week.
Approximately 26% of full-time employees will not be offered health insurance by their


5
    The employer penalty does not begin until 2015, and is not currently scheduled to be in full force until 2016.
6
    See Mulligan and Gallen (2013) for a fuller analysis of the incidence of the ACA.


                                                                                                                     5
employer.7 I therefore assume that 26 percent of persons employed (part- or full-time) in 2011
would be working (if at all) under the ACA for an employer that does not offer insurance to full-
time employees and is therefore penalized per full-time employee.8

         In order to estimate the distribution of people (in terms of work hours and demographics)
employed by employers not offering ESI, I assign a non-ESI-employer indicator to all non-
elderly household heads and spouses in the March 2012 CPS employed sometime during 2011
with usual weekly hours of at least 35.9 Sample members that do not have ESI from their job are
assigned an indicator of one, and the others are assigned zero.10 Among samples of the elderly,
dependents, or part-time workers, this would be a poor indicator of type of employer because the
elderly are typically insured by Medicare, dependents are typically insured by a family member’s
policy, and part-time workers are typically not offered coverage even while their full-time
coworkers are. For the elderly, dependents, and part-time workers, I calculate a probability that
their full-time coworkers are not offered ESI as the fitted value of a probit equation with
dependent variable equal to the non-ESI-employer indicator noted above, estimated in the
sample of non-elderly full-time household heads and spouses.11 Results for the entire sample, or
for specific groups of non-elderly persons, are not sensitive to variations on this procedure
because dependents and the elderly are a small fraction of persons working at least 30 hours per
week.

         Whether the assessment or threat of an employer penalty will actually result in work
schedule limitations depends on, among other things, the amount of the penalty and the degree to
which schedules need to be limited to avoid the penalty. By 2016, the weekly penalty amount

7
  The CBO estimates that 27 percent of employees in 2008 would work for an employer that does not offer coverage
(Congressional Budget Office 2007). Using Census Bureau data, Janicki (2013) estimates 29 percent in 2010.
Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), Carroll and Miller (2011) estimate 13 percent in 2011. There
will be some employers who drop their coverage as a consequence of the ACA, which by itself would make the
three estimates above underestimates of the fraction of employees in 2014 and beyond who would work for firms
not offering coverage.
8
  See above on the $2,000, zero, and $40,000 marginal penalty amounts.
9
  The Appendix presents an alternative version of my calculations that replaces the CPS usual weekly hours measure
with its measure of hours worked in the reference week.
10
   As noted above, I do not use this procedure to estimate the total number of people working for employers that do
not offer ESI.
11
   The independent variables are indicator variables for detailed industries and the interactions between indicators
for employer size more than 100 employees and work schedule at least 40 hours. Part-time non-elderly heads and
spouses that have ESI are assigned an indicator of zero, regardless of the fitted value that the probit equation assigns
them.


                                                                                                                      6
will be about $60 (2014 dollars).12 If a penalized employer would have had a 30 hour work
schedule but for the ACA – and there are workers with 30 hour work schedules – clearly he
should consider cutting the schedule to 29 in order to save the $60, unless each employee was
expected to produce more than $60 of value during that hour. As shown in the second column of
Table 2, cutting 31-hour schedules would save $30 per hour cut, and cutting 32-hour schedules
would save $20 per hour cut. At the minimum wage of $7.25, it might be worth cutting a 37-
hour schedule down to 29 in order to avoid the penalty. Even a 41-hour work schedule might, at
minimum wage, be worth cutting down to 29 if the schedule cut would both avoid the penalty
and reduce weekly work expenses (e.g., commuting or child care costs) by, say, $20: see the
third column of the table.

        Table 2 estimates the number of workers who satisfy these criteria – (i) employer not
offering ESI, (ii) working at least 30 hours per week in 2011, and (iii) average hourly wages (net
of work expenses) less than the salary equivalent of the employer penalty amortized over the
hours between 29 and actual weekly hours worked in 2011, under two alternative assumptions
about work expenses. The estimates are prepared in three steps. First, the non-ESI-employer
indicator noted above is rescaled so that it averages 26 percent in the entire sample of workers.
Second, the indicator is multiplied by the CPS health insurance weight in order to project 2012
national totals and then scaled by a factor of 1.014 to project 2016 national totals. Third, the
indicator is summed across observations satisfying the criteria (ii) and (iii) noted above and
reported in the right half of Table 2.

        Under these assumptions, and assuming that employees are paid according to the value
that they create, the sum of the indicators is the number of workers in 2016 whose weekly hours
could be cut to 29 hours without reducing the weekly value they create net of the employer
penalty and work expenses. The sum ranges from 2.8 to 5.1 million, depending on the assumed
work expenses.



12
  $60 is the $3,046 noted above increased 3.2 percent for projected health cost inflation in excess of wages between
2014 and 2016, and then divided by 52. The ACA penalties and exchange subsidies are determined on a monthly
basis, even though the annualized subsidy amounts are a function of calendar year income. For simplicity, I assume
that partial months of health insurance coverage are prorated in proportion to the number of weeks covered (and
ignore the fact that months usually do not have an integer number of weeks) so that I can refer to weekly amounts of
penalties and subsidies.


                                                                                                                  7
        Table 3 displays the likelihood that workers of various characteristics experience the 100
percent tax in the form of the employer penalty. Female workers are more likely than male
workers to experience the 100 percent tax because their weekly work schedules tend to be closer
to 29 hours. The likelihood declines with age among non-elderly workers because average
hourly earnings increase with age.

        It is easy to see why the employer penalty erases the reward to full-time work for a few
million workers. According to the CPS, there were about 5 million workers in 2011 with usual
hours of exactly 30. If roughly 26 percent (the population average) of those worked for an
employer that did not offer coverage to full-time workers, then 1.3 of the 5 million will avoid an
employer penalty by cutting hours to 29. If roughly 90 percent of workers earn less than $60 per
hour, workers with 30-hour schedules alone contribute over a million workers to the totals shown
in Table 3.13 The more exact amount shown at the top of Table 2 accounts for the fact that the
wage distribution among, and the types of jobs held by, 30-hour workers is different from the
general population.

        The ACA also penalizes employers that (i) offer health insurance to their employees and
(ii) have employees who receive subsidized coverage through the ACA’s exchanges. Both
conditions can occur because there may be employees who are eligible for subsidized coverage
because their employer’s offer of coverage is not affordable.14 The annualized penalty is $3,000
(plus health cost inflation after 2014) per full-time employee who receives subsidized coverage
and is capped at $2,000 (plus health cost inflation after 2014) times the total number of full-time
employees, including those full-time employees that do not receive subsidized coverage.15 The
$3,000 penalty can be avoided by reducing the hours of specific full-time employees. This
penalty is not reflected in Tables 2 and 3, which is one reason that their estimates are
conservative.




13
   There are also about 5 million workers with exactly 35-hour schedules, and probably more than a million of them
work for employers not offering coverage. Any of those (one million+) with hourly earnings less than $10 (=10 =
60/(35-29)) would make more net of the penalty by working 29 hours.
14
   “Not affordable” means that employee premiums for self-only coverage exceed 9.5 percent of the employee’s
household’s income.
15
   The cap even includes the first thirty full-time employees.


                                                                                                                 8
IV. The number and types of workers likely made 29ers by the exchange
subsidies
IV.A. Number and types of workers facing an implicit FTET
         Even if it did not penalize full-time employees at employers offering ESI, the ACA
presents employees with an implicit full-time employment tax (FTET): namely, exchange
subsidies foregone. Table 4 lists the demographic groups who will forego exchange subsidies by
working full time, in order of aggregate weeks worked in 2011. The table represents all 20
million (as of 2016) persons presented with an implicit FTET by the ACA, regardless of its
magnitude.

         The top group is married households with dependents in which one spouse works full
time with ESI and the other spouse either does not work full time or works for an employer that
does not offer family coverage.16 Their average annualized subsidy forgone is shown in the right
column and is almost $10,000 after income and payroll taxes because of the number of family
members whose exchange subsidy hinges on the job situation of the one family member who is
working full time with ESI.17 The method of calculating the forgone subsidy is presented below.

         A large number of married persons are not represented in Table 4 because many of their
households have two earners, each with access to family coverage on the job. If one of the two
spouses in such households were to give up his ESI by moving to part-time, the entire family
would still be ineligible for exchange subsidies because the ACA requires that they obtain
employer coverage through the spouse that continues to have access to family coverage on her
job.18 In other words, many married persons are excluded from Table 4 and the tables below
because the ACA does not present them with an implicit FTET.

         The next two groups foregoing exchange subsidies are one-person households and single-
parent households in which the head is working full time with ESI. According to the Kaiser

16
   For married persons who are employed full-time but enrolled in a spouse’s plan, the availability of ESI at the
employer is randomly imputed based on the size of that employer. 85% (8%) of not-enrolled employees at
employers of 100 or more (less than 100), respectively, are assumed to have been offered coverage but turned it
down.
17
   The averages in Table 4 includes zeros for the households that satisfy the eligibility criteria but have a premium
that is cheap enough to affordable by the ACA’s definition.
18
   The family coverage offered by a spouse’s employer does not even have to be affordable, as long as the spouse’s
employer offers affordable (by ACA definitions) self-only coverage to its employees. See Burkhauser, Lyons and
Simon (2011) for further discussion of this so-called “family glitch.”


                                                                                                                        9
premium calculator, annual silver plan premiums for a one-person household are about $4,000,
which means that the likely exchange subsidies are relatively small.19 However, as dependents
are added to the household exchange subsidies increase significantly, and would be about $7,000
annually for the average unmarried household with dependents and with income in the eligible
range, as shown in the final column of Table 4.

        The next group displayed in Table 4 is married households without dependents in which
one spouse has ESI and the other does not have a job offering ESI. Although the group is not
particularly large, the annualized exchange subsidies for married households that would satisfy
the eligibility criteria when not working full time average about $8,300. The top four groups
together contain over 90 percent of the persons expected to face an implicit full-time
employment tax under the ACA.

IV.B. Prohibitive implicit FTETs: determinants of disposable income
        Most workers represented in Table 4 forego an exchange subsidy that is less than the
revenue that would be lost by cutting their weekly work hours to 29. Some of them may
nonetheless cut their hours in order to obtain the subsidies because they value the leisure time,
but the focus of this paper are the persons like those in Table 1 who would improve their cash
flow by cutting their work hours.

        The first step in identifying such workers is to calculate the expected (in the actuarial
sense) annual medical expenditures m for each worker’s household. I use the Kaiser premium
calculator and March 2012 CPS information on the number and age of family members to
estimate the full premium (that is, without any subsidies) that the family would pay if enrolled in
a silver plan.     Because silver plan premiums are set to cover 70% of expected medical
expenditures, I take m to be the ratio of the silver plan premium and 0.7.

        Second, I measure household AGI apart from the worker’s earnings as the difference a
between the CPS variable for family income and the CPS variable for the worker’s wage and




19
  For example, a single person household with income of $30,000 would get half of the premium subsidized, and no
cost-sharing subsidy.


                                                                                                             10
salary income. All of these calculations are in 2014 dollars as a ratio to the federal poverty
line.20

           I then consider two situations for each full-time worker represented in the March 2012
CPS that has ESI and cannot obtain it through a spouse (if any): (i) the actual usual weekly work
schedule h and fringe benefits he had when at work in 2011 and (ii) a 29-hour work schedule and
exchange subsidies that would be available instead of ESI. If situation (i) pre-tax earnings were
high enough, then situation (i) would result in more disposable income than situation (ii) because
each hour worked beyond 29 would pay well and because the means-test would eliminate too
much of the subsidy to be received in situation (ii). I calculate the hypothetical amount y of pre-
tax compensation, if any, that would generate the same disposable incomes in both situations (i)
and (ii). That amount satisfies:

                                          29                                      29

                                                                                                          (1)
                                                                      29          29
                                          max 0,0.7



where t denotes the marginal personal income tax rate (not including the phase-out of ACA
subsidies), h > 29 denotes weekly work hours in 2011, and x denotes the extra work expenses
associated with working h hours rather than 29.                               is household AGI if the worker

earning y for h hours of work would work 29 hours instead.                        ∙ and   ∙ are the schedules
specified by the ACA determining the discount on out-of-pocket costs and the cap on the share
of AGI to be spent on premiums paid to the health insurance exchanges.

           For each worker, his actual compensation in situation (i) (measured in 2011 and
converted to 2014 dollars) can be compared with his critical value y, if one exists, from equation
(1). If y does not exist or is less than actual compensation then working h hours results in more
disposable income than working 29 hours. Otherwise, working h hours results in no more
disposable income than working 29 hours does, and the ACA’s subsidies present the worker with
a 100+ percent tax situation like the one illustrated in Table 1.

     2011 prices are converted to 2014 prices using a factor of 120.4679/113.8.


                                                                                                          11
        The first two terms in equation (1) are the income after taxes and work expenses,
respectively, created by working h hours rather than 29, holding exclusions constant. The first
term in square brackets denotes the tax savings from the exclusion of ESI premiums, which are
equal to 0.83m, that are available when obtaining coverage through the employer but not
available when obtaining coverage on the exchanges.21 The second term in square brackets is the
savings on out-of-pocket costs that is available only when obtaining subsidized coverage on the
exchanges. The max term denotes the premium tax credits received so that premium payments
do not exceed the ACA’s cap.22

IV.C. Prohibitive implicit FTETs: examples and comparisons
        About half of workers in the CPS report a work schedule of exactly 40 hours per week.
Among them, the critical compensation y varies across workers only to the degree that other AGI
a and medical expenditure m (m itself is just a function of the size of the family and the age of its
members) vary. Figure 1’s solid line graphs m versus the critical full-time compensation amount
y, assuming full-time hours h = 40, other AGI a = 0, and full-time work expenses of 0.04 FPL.
The vertical lines indicate expected medical expenditures m for selected family types.

        Take, for example, married couples, each aged thirty and with two children. Their
expected medical expenditures are 62 percent of the federal poverty line.                       The solid red
schedule’s vertical value of 2.07 (see Figure 1) partitions those households that have a single-
earner with a 40-hour full-time schedule into those that would increase disposable income by
working 29 hours and that would decrease disposable income. Specifically, if the worker’s full-
time compensation were 2.06 (2.08) times the federal poverty line, then household income would
be 1.49 (1.51) of the FPL, respectively, so that the discount rate on out-of-pocket costs would be
80 (57) percent. Both would have premiums capped at about 0.04 FPL, which would make their
premium subsidy equal to about 0.40 FPL. At a 25 percent marginal income and payroll tax rate,
the various terms in equation (1) would, in both cases, add to about 0.12 minus the  term, which
is 0.15 (0.11), respectively.          Thus, the 2.06-compensation worker (slightly) would gain
disposable income by cutting his schedule to 29 hours while the 2.08-compensation worker

21
   For simplicity, equation (1)’s 0.83tm term assumes that the household members who would be insured on the
exchanges are also covered by ESI. In fact there are workers with ESI (and no spouse with ESI) that do not insure
all non-elderly household members through their employer; for them I modify the 0.83tm term. The 0.83 reflects the
average actuarial value of employer plans (Gabel, et al. 2012).
22
   Recall that 0.7m is the full premium.


                                                                                                               12
would lose it. Determining the number of single-earner households with these demographics that
would gain disposable income by moving to the 29-hour schedule has thereby been reduced to
measuring the number of those earners who have ESI on their full-time job and are compensated
less than 2.07 FPL.

       The dashed line in Figure 1 shows that the schedule is different for single-earner
households in which the full-time schedule is 35 hours. Here the critical value for a family of
four (including two adults aged 30) is 2.41, which is greater than the 2.07 for the 40-hour
schedule because a 35-hour worker gives up less of his paycheck to cut to 29 hours than a 40-
hour worker would.

       To get a rough idea of how often salaries and fringes are below the critical values, note
that more than ten percent of the 3,211 married non-elderly 40-hour-per-week workers with ESI
(and with spouse not working full-time, or working less than 26 weeks in 2011) in the March
2012 CPS have salary and fringes that are less than 1.6 FPL, which is one of the smallest critical
values shown in Figure 1. 29 percent have salary and fringes that are less than 2.07 FPL. 64
percent of the 255 married non-elderly workers with ESI (and with spouse not working full-time,
or working less than 26 weeks in 2011) and schedules between 30 and 39 hours have salary and
fringes that are less than 2.41 FPL. Given the critical values shown in Figure 1, it should be no
surprise that, as a result of the ACA, more than ten percent of the workers represented in Table 4
might gain disposable income by cutting their schedules to 29 hours.

IV.D. Prohibitive implicit FTETs: frequencies in the micro data
       In order to arrive at a more precise estimate, I repeated this calculation – a critical value y
from equation (1) compared with actual compensation – for each March 2012 CPS observation
working full time in 2011 and represented in Table 4, and totaled the results in Table 5. As in
Table 2, the CPS respondents are projected to represent the national population in 2016.
Depending on whether additional work expenses are considered to be an expense of working
full-time, 3.3 to 4.4 million household heads and spouses would, under the ACA, have more
disposable income working 29 hours than working their usual full-time schedule. Because the
ACA presents a total of 20 million heads and spouses with an implicit FTET of some magnitude,
by subtraction I conclude that the implicit FTET is usually less than one hundred percent.
Nevertheless, four million workers – not to mention perhaps another four million workers for


                                                                                                   13
whom the employer penalty is a one hundred percent FTET – is a lot on the scale of overall part-
time employment.

         Table 5 shows that slightly more than half of the workers subject to the one hundred
percent FTET report 40 hour work schedules, but that is the result of the fact that (reported) 40-
hour schedules are generally common among workers with ESI. Among the few workers facing
an implicit FTET and reporting, say, 30- or 31-hour schedules, the vast majority face a FTET
rate in excess of 100 percent because they would lose relatively little wage income by cutting
their schedule just an hour or two.

         Only household heads and spouses in which at least one member is less than 65 years old
are represented in Table 5. Table 6 displays the likelihood of various sub-demographics of non-
elderly heads and spouses to experience any FTET and to experience a FTET rate of at least 100
percent. Unmarried people are more likely than married people to face the 100+ rate because the
former do not have a spouse with opportunities for family coverage. Unmarried women are
more likely than unmarried men because the former are more likely to be working 30-39 hours
even without the ACA. Married men are more likely than married women to face the 100+ rate
because they are more likely to be in a position offering ESI (e.g., married women may not be
employed full time).




V. Income cliffs and other 100 percent tax rates in the ACA
         The premium tax credits and out-of-pocket subsidies are discontinuous functions of
household income. At the income amounts or “cliffs” where the subsidy jumps, just one dollar
of additional income can cost a family thousands in lost benefits.

         Perhaps the biggest example of an income cliff under the ACA is the removal of all
premium tax credits when household income reaches 400 percent of the poverty line.23 Take, for
example, a couple with combined earnings equal to 399% of the federal poverty line. If the
adults are each aged 50 and they have two children, the actuarial value of the family’s medical


23
  Another large cliff is at 200 percent of the poverty line, where the discount rate on out-of-pocket costs falls from
57% to 10%.


                                                                                                                     14
expenditures is 85% FPL (see the vertical line in Figure 1), 60 percentage points of which would
be premium payments on a silver plan. The premium tax credit therefore has to be 22% FPL
(more than $5,000 per year) in order for the family’s net premium to be limited to 9.5% of its
income. If this household earned, say, $300 extra, it would cross the income threshold for
premium assistance and the entire subsidy would be taken away: a loss of almost $5,000 for
earning just an extra $300.

       The implicit and explicit FTET tax rates examined in this paper have nothing to do with
the income cliffs. I have not attempted to measure the number of persons who, when working
without ESI, would find that the reward to full-time work was completely erased by the ACA
because full-time work requires the person to cross one of the income cliffs.

       It is also possible that, for a period of time, not working at all pays better than working
full-time. In particular, taking a few extra months off work could add enough to earned income
tax credits, subsidies for health insurance, unemployment benefits, food stamps, and subtract
enough from work expenses to compensate for the entire salary lost during those months. I have
not attempted to quantify the number of people who might be in this type of multi-program
participation situation under the ACA.

       As with the FTETs, both the income cliffs and multi-program participation examples can
create 100 percent taxes in which people can profit by destroying value in the labor market. But
income cliffs and multi-program participation are more heterogeneous across workers than the
prohibitive FTET rates because, in the latter case, every worker that would benefit from the
FTET has essentially the same target behavior: a 29-hour work schedule. In contrast, the amount
of earnings that would push a worker over one of the ACA’s income cliffs varies across workers
according to their size and composition of their family. Although beyond the scope of this paper,
the heterogeneity of one hundred percent tax points may affect the amount and incidences of
behavioral responses to them.

       Households that recognize the dynamic structure of the ACA’s procedures for income
measurement can use it to strategically create their own one hundred percent tax situations. In
particular, the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies are advanced on the basis of
income estimates and are thereby a function of income earned prior to the insurance year to



                                                                                               15
which the subsidies apply.24 A household might file a paper copy of its prior year tax return in
October, so that as of the November enrollment period the exchanges are only aware of its
income for the year before last. Unless the household files late again the next year, this relieves
the household of some of the implicit taxes on its prior year income, but doubles some of the
implicit taxes on income earned in the year before last.25 With double implicit ACA taxes plus
the normal income and payroll taxes, a household could find its marginal tax rate on income in
the year before last to be over one hundred percent. I have not attempted to quantify the
frequency of one hundred percent marginal tax rates that occur via this mechanism.




VI. Conclusions
        It has been acknowledged that the ACA erodes the reward to work, meaning that people
gain less by working under the ACA than they would without the law.26 But this is the first
paper to show that the ACA will put millions of workers in the economically extreme situation of
having zero short-term financial reward, or less, to working full-time rather than part-time.

        There are two separate ACA provisions that can fully eliminate the reward to full-time
work. The first, which is scheduled to be in full force in 2016, pertains to full-time employees of
firms that do not offer health insurance: by cutting weekly work hours to 29, they save their
employer the annual salary equivalent of more than $3,000, or save them the threat of even larger
penalties. As shown in Table 3, by this mechanism women workers, young workers, and persons
already working 30-35 hour schedules, are especially likely to have their short-term financial
reward to working full-time erased by the ACA. Three or four million workers overall will have
their reward erased by this penalty provision.

        The second provision pertains to full-time employees at firms that do offer health
insurance. Over 60 million workers obtain health insurance from their employer, not including

24
   The premium tax credits are imperfectly reconciled with income earned during the insurance year (Mulligan
2013).
25
   For example, 2014 income (reported to the IRS in April 2015) could be used to determine cost-sharing subsidies
and advance premium tax credits for both insurance year 2016 and insurance year 2017 (enrollment for these
insurance years begins in November 2015 and November 2016, respectively). 2015 income (reported to the IRS in
October 2016) might not be used to determine any year’s cost-sharing subsidy or advance premium tax credit.
26
   See Mankiw (2009), Kessler (2011), Gamage (2012), and Mulligan (2013).


                                                                                                               16
workers who obtain health insurance from a family member’s employer. About half of them (26
million) are in families between 100 and 400 percent of the poverty line and therefore satisfy the
income criteria for exchange subsidies. 11 million of those are unmarried – by definition cannot
be covered by a spouse’s plan – and another 8 million of the married have a spouse that does not
work or otherwise cannot obtain coverage through a spouse. In other words, almost 20 million
workers are ineligible for exchange subsidies solely because their employer offers coverage to
full-time employees: these are the workers subject to the ACA’s implicit full-time employment
tax (FTET). A 29-hour work schedule, on the other hand would make them eligible for subsidies
without creating any penalty for the employer.

       In about four million cases (of the 20 million facing an implicit FTET of some
magnitude), the dollar amount of subsidy gain can exceed the after-tax income that is earned for
working beyond 29 hours per week. A distinguishing feature of almost 90 percent of these
workers is that their family incomes are below 250 percent of the federal poverty line. The four
million disproportionately consist of working unmarried household heads because, as noted
above, unmarried heads are especially likely to be ineligible for exchange subsidies solely
because their employer is offering coverage to full-time employees.

       Older (but not elderly) workers are also disproportionately represented among those
facing an implicit FTET rate of 100+ percent because older workers are more likely to have ESI
and are more expensive to insure. The 100+ percent FTET from the employer penalty has the
opposite age pattern, which means that there may be little age pattern for the propensity to face
one of the 100+ percent FTETs.

       The prevalence of 100+ percent FTETs is an important indicator of their behavioral
effects, but it is not the only one. There are other ways to avoid the FTET, such as working more
hours per week for fewer weeks of the year (Mulligan 2014). If employers are unwilling or
unable to adjust work schedules, the FTET may affect the equilibrium relationship between
hours and earnings (i.e., compensating differences) rather than changing the distribution of
hours. At the other extreme, employers may be able to substantially adjust measured work hours
without changing the actual work that is done (e.g., require employees to “punch out” during
break periods, and then adjust their hourly wage so that weekly earnings are the same), in which
case the ACA will reduce the measured hours for quite a large number of workers.


                                                                                               17
           In effect, millions of workers are becoming eligible for fully federally funded paid days
off work, akin to the sick leave policies in Western European countries. Because the Western
European data suggest that paid sick days really do result in fewer days at work (Lusinyan 2007),
we should expect the ACA’s FTETs to reduced days worked as well, at least for the segments of
the workforce that do not avoid the ACA’s taxes in other ways.




VII. Appendix: Estimates based on the work schedule for the CPS
reference week
           The estimates in the body of the paper measure work schedules in the March 2012 CPS
using the survey’s question about “usual” work hours in the previous calendar year, but the CPS
also asks about hours worked in the CPS reference week, namely the week before the CPS
interview.27 The measures are somewhat different. The mean weekly hours, conditional on
positive hours, is slightly more than 39 for both measures, but ten percent fewer respondents
(weighted by weeks worked in 2011) report positive reference week hours. 52 percent of
respondents with positive usual weekly hours report that their usual hours are exactly 40,
whereas 44 percent of respondents with positive reference week hours report 40. Both measures
have somewhat more than 3 percent reporting exactly 30 hours, but exactly 32 hours is twice as
common among the reference week hours reports as it is among the usual hours reports.
Arguably many of the 32-hour reports “missing” from the usual hours data are found among
those reporting exactly 35 usual hours because the frequency of 35 hours is greater in the usual
hours distribution.

           The ACA refers to average hours worked over an extended period: typically one year.
By ACA definitions, a worker will not change his full-time status from week to week even
though his work schedule may vary from week to week. In this regard, one could argue that the
27
     The reference week is the calendar week containing March 12.


                                                                                                 18
CPS usual hours measure is the closest to what the ACA measures, which is why I use it in the
main text.

       On the other hand, CPS respondents may recall their hours last week more accurately
than they recall their hours last year. The purpose of this appendix is to reproduce Tables 3 and
5 replacing the usual hours measure with the hours last week measure (also for the purpose of
converting calendar year earnings into hourly earnings).

       Tables 7 and 8 show the results. 2.8 to 5.1 million workers face prohibitive penalties
(Table 7), as compared to a range of 3.6 to 6.6 shown in Table 2. Part, but not all, of the
difference between Tables 2 and 7 is due to the fact that hours last week are more often
unmeasured. 3.4 or 4.5 million workers face prohibitive implicit FTETs (Table 8), as compared
to a range of 3.3 to 4.4 shown in Table 5. By comparing Tables 5 and 8, we see how the two
hours measures differ in the frequency of 32-hour reports.




                                                                                              19

Notes: Work expenses are assumed to be $20 per 8 hours. The workers in the table are not subject to the employer penalty.
Numbers of workers are national projections from the March 2012 CPS, and scaled for population growth through 2016 by a factor
of 1.01^4. I assume that no workers have hourly earnings below $7.25.
