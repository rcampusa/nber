Current Account Deficits During Heightened Risk: Menacing or Mitigating?

                                           ABSTRACT

Large current account deficits, and the corresponding reliance on capital flows from abroad, can
increase a country’s vulnerability to periods of heightened risk and uncertainty. This paper
develops a framework to evaluate such vulnerabilities. It highlights the central importance of two
financial factors: income on international investments and changes in the valuations of those
investments. We show how the characteristics of a country’s international investment portfolio –
the size of its international asset and liability holdings, their currency denominations, their split
between equity and debt, and their return characteristics – affect the dynamics of these financial
factors. Then we decompose those dynamics into their drivers, explore how they are affected by
domestic and global risk shocks, and apply this framework to 10 OECD economies. These
examples, including a more detailed assessment for the UK, show that a substantial degree of
international risk sharing can occur through current accounts and international portfolios. Our
flexible framework clarifies which characteristics of a country’s international portfolio determine
whether a current account deficit is “menacing” or “mitigating”.

It is a privilege to write a paper in honor of Frank Hahn. Hahn was a talented economist who wrote on a
range of topics central to macroeconomics today. He emphasized the importance of focusing on general
equilibrium, and how this could improve our understanding relative to partial equilibrium analysis. What
made Hahn particularly inspiring was his willingness to look at these central issues in new ways. For
example, in A Critical Essay on Modern Macroeconomic Theory (1995) with Robert Solow, he argues that
modern macroeconomic theory needs to put more emphasis on understanding financial markets – and
especially failures in financial markets. Their warnings were prescient.

This paper applies these insights from Hahn to analyze the risks inherent in current account deficits. Just
as Hahn emphasized the need to incorporate financial variables in macroeconomic analysis, we focus on
the role of the financial components of current account balances. These financial components are
critically important to the dynamics of current account deficits today, due to the large magnitude of
cross-border financial exposures and flows. These financial components can also create greater sources
of vulnerability than trade deficits, due to the speed and scale by which financial flows and valuations
can adjust. Just as Hahn emphasized the need to consider general equilibrium effects, we extend our
analysis of the financial components of current accounts to consider how they interact with changes in
global and domestic risk. We show how these various interactions affect international financial flows
and portfolio valuations, with their effects depending on the characteristics of a country’s portfolio and
the nature of the shocks. Current account deficits are not always “menacing”. Instead, our analysis
shows under what circumstances they can be “mitigating”, in the sense of providing a form of automatic
international risk sharing that reduces certain vulnerabilities related to large current account deficits.

We begin by discussing the potential vulnerabilities from large current account deficits. This discussion
highlights the increased role of financial factors. Although some of these financial factors affecting a
country’s international portfolio have been analyzed in other research, we are one of the few to
highlight the importance of the investment income component of the current account (as well as the
better known valuation effects on international investments). 1 We then develop a unified framework to
analyze the interrelationships between changes in risk and uncertainty (which often correspond to
sudden stops in capital flows and current account adjustments) with these financial factors affecting
current accounts and the corresponding dynamics in international portfolios. This framework is designed
to be flexible and easy to adapt to different countries at different times.

As an initial piece of this framework, we decompose the determinants of movements in international
portfolios and the financial components of current accounts. We show the role of variables such as: the
size of international asset and liability holdings, their currency denominations, their split between equity
and debt, their return characteristics, and exchange rate movements. We document the importance of
these variables to understanding current account dynamics in 10 OECD economies. Though there are
well-documented issues related to the international financial data 2 used in these examples, they are
useful to highlight the diversity across experiences, as well as the flexibility of this framework to
understand the cyclical and structural sources of vulnerability across countries.

  Obstfeld (2012) and Borio and Disyatat (2015) also discuss the importance of financial variables in analysis of vulnerabilities
related to current accounts. Key papers highlighting the importance of large international exposures and valuation changes are:
Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006, 2012), Gourinchas and Rey (2007), Gourinchas et al. (2012), and Benetrix et al. (2015).
2
  See Zucman (2013), Lane (2014) and Curcuru, Dvorak and Warnock (2008) for issues.

                                                                                                                               1
Next, we extend this framework to show how these variables interact with increased domestic or global
risk. Heightened risk and uncertainty – for whatever reason – can lead to sudden shifts in capital flows
that make it difficult to finance a current account deficit and lead to painful macroeconomic
adjustments. Heightened risk and uncertainty can also affect the exchange rate, the relative returns that
foreign and domestic investors earn, and the valuations of any international borrowing and investments.
The framework clearly shows which country characteristics can be stabilizing (by helping mitigate
vulnerabilities through international risk sharing) as well as which characteristics and risk shocks are
more likely to increase a country’s vulnerability. An application using different risk scenarios highlights
some sharp differences that currently exist across countries, as well as several common features.

In the first of these scenarios, which examines vulnerabilities during periods of heightened domestic
risk, many countries in our sample have characteristics that should mitigate the adverse domestic
effects by spreading the financial losses internationally. For example, the large size of countries’
liabilities (in most cases exceeding 100% of GDP) and the higher share of liabilities denominated in
domestic currency (compared to assets), will generally improve their international investment positions
after periods of heightened country-specific stress that correspond to currency depreciations. On the
other hand, the countries in our sample rely more heavily on debt than equity for funding, on average,
and debt generally provides less automatic risk sharing than equities. There is considerable cross-
country variation in how exchange rates commove with capital gains and rates of return on foreign
liabilities, both of which are also important to assess a country’s vulnerabilities.

In the second scenario, which examines vulnerabilities during periods of heightened global risk, there is
even greater cross-country variation in the international portfolio characteristics which determine
whether countries are more likely to gain or lose, on net, from international risk sharing. Countries more
likely to experience greater international risk sharing include those: with a negative net international
investment position (around half our sample); with riskier liabilities compared to assets (most of the
sample); with more assets than liabilities denominated in safe haven currencies (most of the sample);
and whose exchange rate is less correlated with returns on liabilities than with returns on assets (with
considerable variation across the sample). Taken as a whole, the structure of these countries’
international portfolios would usually generate less automatic risk sharing after global risk shocks than
after domestic risk shocks.

At the end of the paper, we build on this framework to provide an in-depth simulation of how these
vulnerabilities have evolved over time in one country with a large current account deficit: the United
Kingdom. The UK’s current account deficit reached 7.0% of GDP in Q4 of 2015, the largest of the
advanced economies, as well as for the United Kingdom in the 60 years for which data is available. This
large current account deficit has been highlighted as a concern by a number of individuals and
institutions. 3 Applying this paper’s approach shows under which circumstances heightened risk can
generate improvements in the UK’s international investment position and current account – even
without any trade adjustments. Key are the interactions of the structure of the UK international
investment portfolio with currency movements (as sterling tends to depreciate with increases in UK or
global risk). Automatic risk sharing through the current account has historically been greater during
periods of heightened UK risk than after heightened global risk. Estimates from an SVAR model suggest

3
 For example, see the IMF’s annual report on the UK economy (IMF, 2016) and the BoE’s stress test of risks to the UK financial
system related to its current account deficit (Financial Policy Committee, 2014). Also see Broadbent (2014) and Forbes (2016).

                                                                                                                                 2
that these financial adjustments to changes in global and domestic risk explain a meaningful portion of
changes in the UK’s international investment position and income flows. Even though the structure of
the UK’s international borrowing and lending can reduce certain vulnerabilities related to its current
account deficit, however, this is unlikely to fully mitigate the negative impact of heightened risk and
uncertainty on the broader UK economy.

The UK referendum on EU membership provides an example of how this framework can be used in real
time to evaluate how a specific event interacts with a country’s international portfolio characteristics,
and in turn, mitigates or magnifies any vulnerabilities related to the country’s current account. In June
2016, the UK voted to leave the European Union. In the week after the vote, measures of both global
and UK risk increased, but then global risk quickly fell back to pre-vote levels while measures of UK risk
remained elevated. 4 The framework in this paper shows that the increase in UK risk and corresponding
sterling depreciation should provide an important form of risk-sharing by shifting some of the
adjustment costs abroad. 5 More specifically, the initial impact of the referendum is estimated to
improve the UK’s net international investment position by roughly 25% of GDP in 2016, largely through
sharper gains in UK holdings of foreign investments (compared to the value of foreigner’s holding of UK
investments). This should alleviate any concerns about the sustainability of the UK’s external debt
position. The estimates also suggest that the initial impact of the referendum is to improve the UK’s net
international investment income (as a share of GDP) by about 0.7 percentage points due to exchange
rate effects (holding relative returns fixed). This will reduce the UK current account deficit and
corresponding international financing requirement, albeit only by a moderate amount relative to the
large current account deficit. The analysis also suggests that if the vote to leave the European Union had
continued to generate a significant increase in global risk—instead of being contained to the UK—then
the gains to the UK through risk-sharing would have been significantly smaller.

The remainder of this paper is divided into four parts. Section I discusses reasons to be concerned about
current account deficits: historic examples, the academic evidence, and the importance of financial
factors. Section II develops our broader framework for assessing the vulnerabilities related to current
account deficits by simultaneously incorporating the effects of cross-border financial exposures and
investment income. Section III then extends this framework to analyze how increases in global and
domestic risk could interact with these financial vulnerabilities linked to current account deficits. It
applies the analysis to 10 OECD economies and ends with a more detailed application to the United
Kingdom. Section IV concludes and summarizes the main results.



I.       Longstanding Concerns about Current Account Deficits

Current account deficits (and the corresponding borrowing from abroad) are a healthy outcome in many
standard economic models. Even a large current account deficit should not automatically be a cause for
concern. For example, in a standard endowment economy model, a country which experiences a

4
  To measure global risk we use an average of the Baker et al. (2015) monthly news-based economic policy uncertainty indices
for Europe and the US, weighted by those regions’ shares in UK foreign trade. This global uncertainty index spiked by 127% in
June 2016 but subsided quickly in the following months, returning in August to levels lower than the ones recorded prior to the
referendum. In contrast, the UK uncertainty index increased sharply in June, continued increasing to an all-time high in July
before falling back in August.

                                                                                                                              3
negative temporary shock to output (such as from a natural disaster) should borrow from abroad and
run a current account deficit in order to smooth consumption over time. Classical economic models
show that an optimal allocation of global capital implies that capital should flow from developed
economies with low marginal returns to developing economies with higher marginal returns, thereby
generating current account deficits in the latter. Various models incorporating demographic trends also
show current account imbalances as an optimal solution, as countries with older populations should
save less, drawing down assets and generating current account deficits (balanced by earlier surpluses). 6

The historical experience and academic evidence on current account deficits, however, suggests that
they are often not benign. There are numerous examples when current account deficits – and the
corresponding reliance on financing from abroad – created substantial challenges and made a country
vulnerable to the demands and whims of its external creditors. 7 These challenges are particularly
apparent during periods of heightened uncertainty and risk aversion. This section first highlights some of
those episodes when countries relying on external finance faced associated challenges and
vulnerabilities. It then turns to the extensive economic literature pointing out the reasons why large
current account deficits may increase a country’s vulnerability to external shocks and can entail difficult
and painful adjustments. The section closes by highlighting how the theoretical and empirical analyses
contained in the remainder of this paper further contribute to our understanding of these vulnerabilities
linked to large current account deficits.

     A. Vulnerabilities Related to Current Account Deficits: Historic Examples

One of the more poignant historic examples (especially for the UK) of how reliance on external financing
can make a country vulnerable to changes in foreign sentiment is the Suez Crisis of 1956. The UK
experienced moderate capital outflows from the beginning of 1956, which when combined with
sterling’s fixed exchange rate, corresponded to a steady loss of international reserves. The UK
government realized this was not sustainable. In September, UK officials began conversations to draw
financial assistance from the IMF – a plan which initially received informal support from the US (a key
vote as it was the only country with veto power). In October the UK joined a military campaign in Egypt
aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal. Although the campaign met with minimal resistance in
Egypt, it generated a strong international backlash – including from the US. The military campaign and
international reaction increased the perceived risk of investing in the UK, sharply accelerating UK capital
outflows and reserve losses. The UK needed immediate financial assistance to avoid a sharp devaluation.
But now the US blocked any financial assistance from the IMF, unless the UK agreed to a full and
immediate military withdrawal from Egypt. President Eisenhower even told his Treasury Secretary to
make plans to sell US holdings of UK sterling bonds. 8 The UK, constrained by its need to stabilize capital
flows from abroad, quickly agreed to full withdrawal from Egypt. It immediately received a large
financial assistance package that the IMF described as “linked to the financing of the current account” 9
and the situation stabilized. This experience highlighted the power of foreign investors over economies
that are reliant on foreign financing.

6
  For example, Ferrero (2010) highlights the role of productivity and demographics behind US trade imbalances.
7
  In 2006, the IMF was sufficiently concerned about these issues that it led a multilateral consultative process for which a key
goal was reducing current account imbalances.

  See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis
9
  Boughton (2001). Technically the UK still had a small current account surplus, but the IMF described the financing as linked to
the leads and lags in payments linked to financing the current account.

                                                                                                                                4
More recently, investors have focused on current account balances as a proxy for a country’s reliance on
external financing and corresponding vulnerability to any increase in risk aversion, economic uncertainty
or deterioration in investor sentiment. The logic is straightforward: countries with large current account
deficits need to attract large net financial flows from abroad each year in order to fund this deficit
(without drawing on any international reserves). This relationship between current account deficits and
country vulnerability gained substantial attention during the 1997 Asian crisis. This is captured in Figure
1, which graphs the current account balances of 12 major Asian emerging markets in 1996 (before the
crisis began). The 6 countries on the left of the graph (with the largest current account deficits, in
different shades of red) all experienced a sharp currency depreciation of over 10% in 1997 and some
also received an emergency financial package from the IMF (in light red). None of the six countries on
the right (with the smaller current account deficits or surpluses), received an emergency package or
experienced such a sharp depreciation. Although this is clearly not a scientific study, it suggests that
many investors believed that large current account deficits were an indication of vulnerability.

This focus on current account deficits as a proxy for country vulnerability during periods of heightened
risk has continued since. During the spring of 2013, concerns increased about China’s growth and the
US Federal Reserve Board began to discuss “tapering” its asset purchases. Measures of global risk (such
as the VIX) increased sharply and investors quickly withdrew capital from emerging markets. Again, the
sharpest capital outflows, currency depreciations, and increases in borrowing costs occurred in the
countries with the largest current account deficits. 10 Figure 2 shows this relationship between currency
depreciations (relative to the dollar) over the most volatile period from May 1 to June 30, 2013 and
current account balances (at the end of 2012). The correlation is almost 70% – without even controlling
for any other country characteristics. Highlighting this obsession with current account deficits as a
badge of country vulnerability, the group of major emerging markets under the sharpest investor
scrutiny during this period earned the moniker “The Fragile Five” – despite having little in common
other than large current account deficits and a corresponding reliance on external financing.

But is the current account balance an appropriate proxy for assessing country vulnerability to increased
risk and uncertainty? What are the channels through which current account deficits can correspond to
increased vulnerabilities?

       B. Vulnerabilities Related to Current Account Deficits: A Literature Review

Formal academic work suggests that large current account deficits and reliance on external financing
can present risks – but these risks are more nuanced than a direct link from the size of a country’s
current account deficit to its vulnerability. Using the framework in Obstfeld (2012), this literature
broadly points out three (related) reasons why current account deficits may lead to vulnerabilities: 11 (1)
because they increase vulnerability to “sudden stops” in capital flows; (2) because they lead to a
deterioration in the NIIP, which can put pressure on that country’s external debt solvency; and (3)
because they reflect unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances that will eventually require a painful
“reversal” in the current account.

The first strand of literature focuses on the risks associated with the fact that large current account
deficits need to be funded through financing from abroad (albeit for a limited period they can be funded

10

     See Obstfeld (2012) for more details on this literature and these risks related to current account deficits.

                                                                                                                    5
from any accumulated reserves). This results from standard balance of payments accounting, in
equation (1), which shows that the current account (CA) plus capital account (CAPACT) must equal the
financial account (FINACT) for each country i at time t:

                    𝐶𝐴𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐶𝐴𝑃𝐴𝐶𝑇𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐹𝐼𝑁𝐴𝐶𝑇𝑖,𝑡 .                                                                       (1)

The capital account is generally quite small for most countries – and especially the advanced countries
that will be the focus of this analysis – and so will be ignored in the rest of this paper. 12

Intuitively, any country running a current account deficit is sending more money abroad than it is
earning – through buying imports, paying returns on past investments, or outflows of other payments
such as remittances. The country must finance this shortfall of funding through a financial account
surplus – i.e. net financial flows from foreigners – through means such as selling debt and equities, bank
loans, more inward FDI, and/or selling accumulated international reserves. Domestic or external shocks
can cause a “sudden stop” in this external funding (whether due to domestic or external factors),
leading to tighter financial conditions, reduced availability of credit, increased borrowing costs, asset
market declines, and currency depreciations (for countries with flexible rates). In extreme cases, a
“sudden stop” can spark a currency crisis or broader financial crisis – with a sharp devaluation and
increase in bank collapses, corporate insolvencies and debt defaults. These situations generally occur in
an environment of sharply slower growth, reduced consumption and investment, a sharp fall in real
wages, and often high inflation (due to the currency depreciation). 13

The empirical literature has established some link between sudden stops in capital flows and the
adverse environment described above – albeit with more nuanced results. For example, Edwards (2005)
and Freund and Warnock (2007) show that sudden stops are correlated with currency depreciations,
slower growth, and higher interest rates. Catão and Milesi-Ferretti (2011) find that current account
deficits increase the probability of debt crises (defined as requiring large disbursements from
multilateral programs or external default), while Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) find that current
account deficits precede systemic banking crises in advanced economies. Frankel and Saravelos (2010)
review 80 papers estimating various forms of “early-warning models” that attempt to predict country
vulnerability to various types of crises and provides a useful synthesis to this large literature. They find
current account deficits are significant in predicting currency crises and vulnerabilities to current
account reversals, but not as powerful as other variables (such as exchange rate appreciation and
reserve accumulation).

The broader literature also finds that the type of financial flows corresponding to current account
deficits can affect a country’s vulnerability and the risk of a sudden stop. For example, there is evidence
that countries have a lower probability of experiencing a sudden stop if a larger share of the current
account is financed by capital flows that are more stable (such as FDI), that foster greater automatic risk


12
   According to the IMF’s Balance of Payments manual, the capital account is “credit and debit entries for non-produced
nonfinancial assets and capital transfers between residents and non-residents. It records acquisitions and disposals of non-
produced nonfinancial assets, such as land sold to embassies and sales of leases and licenses, as well as capital transfers, that is,
the provision of resources for capital purposes by one party without anything of economic value being supplied as a direct
return to that party.”

   See Mendoza (2010).

                                                                                                                                   6
sharing (such as equity), or that correspond to investors with a longer time horizon. 14 Perhaps most
important, this literature has also shifted away from focusing on net financial flows (which net out gross
inflows from foreigners less outflows from domestics) that correspond to the current account deficit.
Instead, the literature is increasingly focusing on gross capital flows as a measure of a country’s
vulnerability. 15 The 1956 Suez Crisis, discussed above, when the UK had a small current account surplus
but was still vulnerable to a sudden stop in financing from abroad, was an early example of this point.

The second strand of literature on the vulnerabilities related to current account deficits focuses on the
fact that these deficits lead to a deterioration in the net international investment position (holding
everything else constant). This deterioration can make investors question a country’s ability to repay its
external obligations, i.e. its solvency. To illustrate the link between the current account and the net
international investment position, decompose the net international investment position (NIIP) of
country i at time t into its holdings of foreign assets (A) net of foreign liabilities (L), for all asset/liability
categories (c), such as FDI, portfolio equity, portfolio debt, bank lending, and “other”, with all variables
expressed in domestic currency:

                   𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐�𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡 − 𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡 � .                                                                     (2)

Then further decompose any change in the NIIP into: changes in international capital flows (captured in
the current account as shown in equation 1); changes in the valuation of existing investment positions
(∆𝑉𝐴𝐿); and other adjustments to the value of international assets or liabilities that are not otherwise
included (OAdj), such as data revisions or adjustments related to the relocation of headquarters: 16

                   ∆𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝐶𝐴𝑖,𝑡 + ∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑂𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑖,𝑡 .                                                             (3)

The academic literature has found mixed evidence on this link between current account deficits and a
country’s vulnerability operating through deteriorating NIIP positions. For example, Blanchard et al.
(2010) show that large external debt positions were a significant predictor of output losses during the
global financial crisis, and Catao and Milesi-Ferretti (2014) show that the stock of net external debt is a
robust predictor of external crises, even after controlling for current account balances. Frankel and
Saravelos’ (2010) previously mentioned review of 80 studies, however, shows that only a small
proportion of these studies finds a significant relationship between a country’s net external debt
position and the probability of having a crisis. Their own analysis finds that external debt positions
significantly predict equity market falls and recessions, but not currency depreciations, the need to
borrow from the IMF, or other “crisis” measures.

These mixed results undoubtedly reflect the challenges in determining a country’s solvency, which
would require incorporating factors in addition to the NIIP position (such as expected growth, the
composition and liquidity of the international assets and liabilities, 17 the currency denomination of the
borrowing, the country’s ability to print its own currency, the country’s willingness to repay, etc.)

   Forbes and Warnock (2012) first develops this approach of focusing on gross capital inflows and outflows by foreigners and
domestics, rather than net capital flows, to analyse country vulnerability to sudden stops. Milesi-Ferretti and Tille (2010) and
and Avdjiev, McCauley and Shin (2015) also highlight the importance of looking at gross flows.

   The decomposition used here is similar to that in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2001, 2007a) and Devereux and Sutherland (2010).
Note that other adjustments also include the effect of real GDP growth on the past NIIP (the “denominator effect”). See Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti (2005) and Lane (2015) for information on this OAdj term.

Although large external liabilities undoubtedly increase a country’s vulnerability and cannot grow
infinitely, assessing exactly when net external borrowing becomes a significant concern is a challenge.

The third and final focus in analyses of the concerns related to current account deficits bypasses any
relationships with crises. Instead, this literature focuses on whether current account deficits reflect
underlying macroeconomic imbalances that will require a “reversal” in the current account, which in
turn entails slower growth and other costly macroeconomic adjustment (such as reduced consumption
and real wages). 18 This literature builds on the traditional approach to modelling current account
imbalances; countries must satisfy inter-temporal budget constraints, so any country that accumulates
current account deficits will have to run a surplus in the future. An unsustainable current account could
be generated by macroeconomic imbalances resulting from unexpectedly low productivity growth,
excessive consumption or investment, inflated asset prices, or an unsustainable fiscal deficit. When the
current account deficit reverses, it requires a change in production and consumption profiles – usually a
fall in domestic demand, a currency depreciation, and potentially other difficult adjustments ensuring
that the trade balance improves. 19

The academic evidence on the characteristics of these types of reversals is not uniform, but suggests
that they can be costly. For example, Freund and Warnock (2007) look at 26 episodes from 1980-2003 in
industrial countries and find that income growth slows when current account deficits reverse and that
larger current account deficits take longer to resolve. In one of the most careful recent analyses, Lane
and Milesi-Ferretti (2012) find that current account reversals generally do not correspond to increased
exports (which would support overall growth), but instead to “demand compression” – i.e. reduced
imports and domestic demand. Analysis also suggests that structural reforms contributing to reversals
by increasing domestic competitiveness over time may have a negative short-run impact on growth (e.g.
Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Raffo, 2014). An earlier vein of this literature also attempted to find a
“threshold” for current account deficits that corresponded to an impending difficult adjustment; some
papers found evidence that 5% was a level at which a painful current account reversal was significantly
more likely. But there is a huge variance around estimates of this threshold and there is now general
agreement there is no “magic number”. 20

Most recently, several papers have highlighted an important link between these literatures focusing on
different vulnerabilities related to current account deficits: rapid domestic credit growth (e.g.
Gourinchas and Obstfeld, 2012, Schularick and Taylor, 2012, and Korinek, 2011). 21 These papers argue
that it is the rapid increase in domestic credit (which often corresponds to large current account deficits,
capital inflows from abroad, and a deterioration in the NIIP) that has the greatest explanatory power in
predicting crises. If a current account deficit is not accompanied by this macroeconomic imbalance of

18
   See Adalet and Eichengreen (2007) for an analysis of current account reversals since the 1880s.
19
   Because the main component of the current account in these models is the trade balance, this “reversal” of a current account
deficit into a surplus generally corresponds to a reversal of the trade deficit to a surplus.
20
   For example, Freund (2005) found that after current account deficits reach 5% of GDP, they are generally followed by a
period of slowing income growth, currency depreciation, and declining investment. Summers (2004) also refers to this 5%
threshold. In contrast, Milesi-Ferretti and Razin (1998) examine a larger sample of countries and do not find evidence that
current account deficits above this level are systematically associated with slower growth and currency crises.
21
   Korinek (2011) models how these various factors could be related. In an economy with incomplete financial markets, a
sudden stop of foreign financing generates a depreciation, which raises the value of foreign liabilities and tightens financial
constraints. Individuals do not internalize this effect of a sudden stop, causing them to borrow too much and generating the
unsustainable credit boom and current account deficit.

                                                                                                                             8
rapidly increasing credit growth, these papers find that countries with large current account deficits are
not significantly more likely to experience a crisis or current account reversal. It is thus the end to
unsustainable credit growth associated with borrowing from abroad that leads to sudden stops and
painful reversals in the current account.

     C. Vulnerabilities Related to Current Account Deficits: Missing Pieces

This recent focus on credit growth as a key link between current account deficits, capital inflows,
macroeconomic imbalances, financial crises, external liabilities, and difficult reversals highlights an
important shift in the literature on current account vulnerabilities – away from the simplistic view of the
current account as equivalent to the trade balance and instead focusing on its financial component. This
does not mean that trade is unimportant in the vulnerabilities and adjustments related to large current
account deficits. Instead, this shift highlights the growing importance of financial channels due to
increased cross-border financial exposures, as well as the much more rapid adjustments that can occur
through financial channels than through trade.

Simple balance of payments accounting reminds us that the current account is a function of the trade
balance (TB) and a financial component. This financial component can be decomposed into net primary
investment income (INVINC) and other primary and secondary income (OINC): 22

                   𝐶𝐴𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝐵𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑂𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 .                                                             (4)

Moreover, combining equations (3) and (4) yields:

                   ∆𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝐵𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + ∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 + 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 ,                                                   (5)

where 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 denotes other primary and secondary income and other adjustments to the NIIP (which are
generally small). This shows that analysis of the vulnerabilities related to a country’s international
investment position should consider valuation effects on international investment positions, as well as
international investment income flows.

Figure 3 highlights why paying greater attention to the financial flows and financial positions linked to
the current account has become more important: increased financial globalization since the early 1990s.
The figure shows the sharp increase in cross-border financial assets and liabilities that occurred from
about 1990 through 2007, broken out by the type of exposure. Cross-border financial exposures have
roughly stabilized since then, largely reflecting a reduction in international bank flows. 23 Even if cross-
border financial flows do not return to their pre-crisis levels, however, the past accumulation of
international assets and liabilities implies that international financial exposures are likely to remain
substantially elevated relative to past decades. This increase in cross-border financial exposures has
important implications for vulnerabilities related to the current account deficit as it affects both net
international investment positions and international investment income.


22
   The trade balance includes trade in goods and services; net primary investment income is the return from past investment in
financial assets and production processes (largely dividends and interest); other net primary income consists predominantly of
compensation of employees; net secondary income is basically personal transfers, international assistance, charities and some
inter-government payments (which is a small component of the current account for the countries considered here).
23
   For more information on this “deglobalisation” in capital flows, and especially banking, see Cerutti and Claessens (2014),
Forbes (2014b), and Forbes, Reinhardt and Wieladek (2016).

                                                                                                                             9
Several important papers have considered the implications of these increased cross-border financial
exposures for net international investment positions, focusing on the effects of valuation changes. 24
There has not, however, been comparable work assessing the related implications for international
investment income – i.e. the financial component of the current account. Moreover, little attention has
been paid to how both valuation changes and international investment income could interact with risks
related to the current account.

Therefore, in the analysis that follows, we will focus on the role of financial factors for the current
account and international investment position. Financial factors such as investment income and
valuation changes can be large, important, and fast moving – and therefore critical to assessing a
country’s vulnerability.



II.      Incorporating International Financial Exposures and Investment Income into Vulnerability
         Analysis

This section investigates the role of investment income and valuation changes to understand the
dynamics and vulnerabilities of current accounts and international investment positions. It begins with
empirical evidence on their importance. Then it develops a basic theoretical framework to show what
drivers determine the evolution of these financial factors. The section ends by providing evidence of the
magnitudes and relative importance of these drivers in different countries.

      A. The Importance of Financial Factors for the Current Account and NIIP

How important are financial factors (valuation changes and investment income) relative to trade (which
traditionally receives more attention) in understanding the vulnerabilities related to current accounts?

Figure 4 provides an initial indication that these financial channels can be very important. It uses the
decomposition in equation (5) to report the ratios of the variances of the trade balance, investment
income, and valuation effects to the overall variance in the NIIP for a large sample of around 180
countries and then for the UK. 25 Figure 4a reports results for a long period from 1980 to 2014, and
Figure 4b for the more recent and more “financially globalized” period from 2004 to 2014. Valuation
effects play a significant role – and appear to be even more important than trade. More specifically, the
variance of valuation effects amounted to 35% of the variance of overall NIIP changes for the full sample
over the longer period, relative to 25% for trade and 8% for primary income (the largest component of
which is net investment income). The role of valuation effects is even greater in the UK on an absolute
basis and relative to trade – where they explain 45% of the variance compared to only 10% for trade.
Even more striking is how these valuation effects have increased over time. Over the last 10 years (in
Figure 4b), the role of valuation effects in explaining the variance in the NIIP is substantially greater –
reaching 61% for the full sample and 144% in the UK. 26 This increased role is not surprising given larger
international financial exposures, as discussed in the previous section, which magnify the impact of a

   Key papers are: Gourinchas and Rey (2007), Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2006), Gourinchas, Rey and Treumpler (2012), Lane and
Milesi-Ferretti (2012), Obstfeld (2012), and Benetrix et al. (2015).
25
   The shares do not add to 100% due mainly to covariances between the NIIP components, as well as to other smaller
components and data issues that are not reported to simplify the comparisons. In Figures 4-8, we use net primary income as a
proxy for net primary investment income due to data availability issues.
26
   The key results do not change significantly if we vary the start and end dates or exclude the recent crisis.

                                                                                                                          10
given change in the rate of capital gains on these positions. Concerns about country vulnerability linked
to unsustainable NIIPs should clearly include analysis of these valuation changes.

Any assessment of current account vulnerabilities should also consider financial effects through the
investment income component of the current account. This link has been largely ignored in the
literature (unlike for valuation effects) – possibly due to the common shortcut of treating the current
account balance as equivalent to the trade balance. Figure 5 shows, however, that this shortcut is not
valid. It graphs current accounts for the 15 OECD countries with the largest current account deficits over
2013-2014 and breaks these deficits into the three components shown in equation (4): the trade
balance, investment income (proxied by primary income) and other income (proxied by secondary
income). Large current account deficits are clearly not synonymous with large trade deficits; investment
income balances can also be significant determinants of current account balances. In fact, the
investment income balance (proxied by the primary income balance) constitutes a larger share of the
current account deficit than trade in a number of countries, including South Africa, Colombia, Peru,
Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Chile and Mexico.

Even if international investment income is important in explaining the levels of some countries’ current
account deficits, is it also important in explaining changes in current accounts? This may be even more
important for any analysis of vulnerabilities related to sudden stops and reversals in current accounts.
Figure 6 shows the share of the variance in the current account that is explained by the variance of
trade, investment income (proxied by primary income) and secondary income for a large sample of
countries and the UK. Figure 6a is again for the full period from 1980-2014, while Figure 6b just focuses
on the last 10 years. The figures show that trade accounts for more of the variance in the current
account than investment income for the full sample of countries in each of the windows. The estimates
for the UK, however, indicate that this can vary substantially over time and across individual countries.
In the UK, trade explained 87% of the variance in the current account over the full period – about twice
as much as explained by investment income. In contrast, over the last ten years the relative importance
of these components has basically reversed, with investment income recently explaining twice as much
of the variance in the current account as trade.

This increased role of investment income in explaining movements in the UK’s current account balance
recently is even more striking when its evolution is viewed over time. Figure 7a graphs the 10-year
rolling correlation of the UK’s current account balance with the trade and primary income balances
using data since 1980. In the 1980’s and 1990’s, movements in the UK current account almost perfectly
corresponded to movements in the UK trade balance. This correlation fell throughout the 2000’s and
during the crisis, and is now negative. In contrast, the correlation between the UK’s current account
deficit and primary income balance has increased sharply since the early 2000’s and is now close to
one. 27 This transition is striking and suggests that movements in the UK current account balance have
recently been driven almost entirely by changes in investment income, with little impact of changes in
trade. Treating the current account balance as a trade balance is clearly no longer appropriate.

Moreover, a similar analysis for other countries shows that the UK is not unique; there is a range of
country experiences. For example, Figures 7b through 7j perform the same analysis for 9 other OECD
economies with flexible exchange rates: the US, Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway,

27
  The pattern of a lower correlation of the current account with the trade balance and higher correlation with the income
balance is unchanged if we use a shorter rolling window of 5 years to exclude the financial crisis from the latest data point.

                                                                                                                                 11
Sweden, and Switzerland. The US figure also shows a correlation of nearly 100% between movements in
investment income and current account balance today (although with different trade correlations). In
contrast, Canada, Japan and Norway have negative – instead of positive – correlations between
movements in their current account balances and investment income. These negative correlations are a
sharp reversal from large positive correlations around 2004-2005 in these three countries.

This discussion has shown that any analysis of vulnerabilities related to current account deficits should
no longer just treat the current account deficit as a trade deficit, but also incorporate an analysis of the
investment income component of the current account. Similarly, any analysis of vulnerabilities related
to the corresponding NIIP should no longer treat this as an accumulation of current account balances,
but also incorporate an analysis of valuation effects on the NIIP. Incorporating analysis of these financial
factors alongside trade could improve our understanding of the dynamics and risks related to current
account deficits, as summarized in the literature review in Section I. For example, does the evidence
suggesting that larger current account deficits increase the probability of having a “sudden stop” in
capital flows hold regardless of whether the current account deficit is caused by a deficit in investment
income or in trade? Or if a large current account deficit does not reflect any macroeconomic
imbalances, but instead is driven by changes in investment income due to external shocks, is the current
account less likely to “reverse” and cause a difficult economic adjustment? And should we be less
concerned about any solvency risks from a large negative NIIP position if it is stabilized due to positive
investment income flows or valuation effects?

While addressing all of these implications is beyond the scope of this paper, one additional example
highlights how a broader framework that incorporates financial channels is useful to address these types
of questions. Figure 8 shows the evolution of the NIIP for the same sample of 10 OECD economies with
flexible exchange rates. The dotted blue lines graph cumulated trade balances (relative to GDP) since
1980 – and show the changes in the NIIPs that would have occurred if trade balances (instead of current
account balances) corresponded to the financial accounts and there had been no valuation changes on
the NIIP. The green lines show the cumulated investment income balances, and the red lines the
cumulated valuation changes on the NIIPs. For some countries, such as the UK and US, the cumulated
investment income balance and valuation changes are positive, generating substantial improvements in
the actual NIIP positions (the black lines) relative to the cumulated trade deficits. These financial effects
through international investment income and valuation effects have improved the UK and US NIIPs by
about 10% and 20% of GDP, respectively. These are meaningful improvements and show how these
financial factors have the potential to influence assessments of country solvency.

But it is also important to note that these effects could work in the opposite direction and weaken a
country’s NIIP relative to what it would have been without these financial effects. For example, the
same analysis shows that Sweden would currently have a positive NIIP if this only captured cumulated
trade surpluses. Instead, large negative valuation adjustments and primary income deficits over much
of this period have generated a small negative NIIP over this window. Korea is another country for
which the NIIP is substantially lower than its cumulated trade balances (by over 20% of GDP), due to
consistent large negative valuation effects and moderate negative investment income flows.

To summarize, when assessing a country’s vulnerabilities related to current account deficits, it is no
longer sufficient to simply assume that the deficits are mainly driven by changes in the trade balance
and will translate directly into changes in the NIIP. Instead, it is necessary to take a closer look at the

                                                                                                              12
financial component of the current account (investment income) and the role of valuation changes for
international assets and liabilities. These financial components may generate a meaningful
deterioration – or improvement – in current account balances and NIIPs. But what determines the
evolution and impact of these financial components?

    B. A Framework for Understanding the Financial Determinants of the Current Account and NIIP

In order to better understand the determinants of valuation changes and investment income, we can
use a simple decomposition. To begin, use the definitions and terminology from equations (1) through
(5) above to decompose the changes in valuations:
                                 𝐴,𝑐   𝐴,𝑐            𝐴,𝑐    𝐴,𝑐                               𝐿,𝑐   𝐿,𝑐            𝐿,𝑐    𝐿,𝑐
                      𝑐        𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1        𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 −𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1                           𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1        𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 −𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1
∆𝑉𝐴𝐿𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐 �𝐴𝑖,𝑡−1 �               𝐴,𝑐       −�          𝐴,𝑐          �� − 𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1 �               𝐿,𝑐     −�         𝐿,𝑐        ���
                                   𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡                 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡                                     𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡              𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡


                     𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1     𝐴,𝑐       𝐴,𝑐                                𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1      𝐿,𝑐       𝐿,𝑐
          = ∑𝑐 �          𝐴,𝑐 �𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 − �∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 − 1��� − ∑𝑐 �                    𝐿,𝑐     �𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 − �∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 − 1��� ,                        (6)
                     ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡                                                  ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡

         𝐴,𝑐    𝐿,𝑐                                                                        𝐴,𝑐    𝐿,𝑐
where 𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡  (𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 ) denotes the rate of capital gain on external assets (liabilities), 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 (𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 ) is the
exchange rate index which reflects the currency composition of country i’s asset (liability) holdings of
                                 𝐴,𝑐                              𝐿,𝑐
                𝐴,𝑐            𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡            𝐿,𝑐             𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡
class c ,and ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 ≡            𝐴,𝑐     and ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 ≡            𝐿,𝑐     . The exchange rate is defined as the cost of one unit
                               𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1                         𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1
of domestic currency in units of foreign currency so that the exchange rate falls (increases) when the
currency depreciates (appreciates). Equation (6) shows that capital gains resulting from changes in asset
prices and exchange rate changes affect valuations.

Next, perform a similar decomposition of international investment income into changes in exchange
rates and the returns received on assets from abroad (and the returns paid on liabilities owed to
foreigners):
                                                𝐴,𝑐   𝐴,𝑐
                                               𝑟𝑖,𝑡 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1                  𝑟 𝐿,𝑐 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡−1
                                                                                     𝐿,𝑐
          𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 = ∑𝑐 �𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1 �                𝐴,𝑐        � − 𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1 � 𝑖,𝑡    𝐿,𝑐       ��,                                         (7)
                                                 𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡                           𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡

       𝐴,𝑐
with 𝑟𝑖,𝑡  denoting country i’s nominal rate of return on A (foreign assets) or L (foreign liabilities) in
terms of last period’s stock, excluding exchange rate effects.

Finally, insert the decomposition in equation (6) for valuation changes and in equation (7) for
investment income into the definition of changes in the NIIP position in equation (5) to get:

          ∆𝑁𝐼𝐼𝑃𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑇𝐵𝑖,𝑡 +𝐸𝑖,𝑡
         𝐴𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1      𝐴,𝑐     𝐴,𝑐       𝐴,𝑐                                 𝐿𝑐𝑖,𝑡−1      𝐿,𝑐     𝐿,𝑐       𝐿,𝑐
+ ∑𝑐 �      𝐴,𝑐    �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  + 𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 − �∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 − 1��� − ∑𝑐 �                     𝐿,𝑐     �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  + 𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡 − �∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡 − 1���,                   (8)
         ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡                                                            ∆𝐸𝑅𝑖,𝑡

where 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑂𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑂𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑖,𝑡 . That is, changes in the NIIP can be decomposed into the trade balance,
other small effects (which we will largely ignore), and a term capturing the relevant financial variables
related to international financial exposures.

More specifically, this series of equations shows that a country’s international investment income and
its valuation changes (and corresponding changes in its international investment position) depend on

                                                                                                                                               13
four sets of variables: last period’s stock of international assets and liabilities, the nominal rate of return
and capital gains on these international assets and liabilities 28, the composition of assets and liabilities in
terms of class (c), and exchange rates (which reflect the currency composition of the country’s assets
and liabilities). Before estimating the importance of each of these variables for different countries over
time, it is worth briefly reviewing the role of each of these four sets of variables.

First, the gross stocks of international assets and liabilities – i.e. existing international exposures – play
an important role in determining investment income and changes in the NIIP. The larger the stock of
assets, the higher is any investment income and the larger is the impact of any change in the rates of
capital gains, the rates of return, or exchange rates. Equation (8) shows that even if a country’s net
financial position is zero, changes in the other variables, combined with large gross positions, can
generate changes in the NIIP. For example, if the rate of capital gains on assets is higher than the rate of
capital gains on liabilities, or if the exchange rate associated with assets depreciates more than that
associated with liabilities, then the inherited asset position (in domestic currency) increases, even if the
initial net position (NIIP) is zero. Gross positions matter!
                                                                                                  𝐴,𝑐        𝐿,𝑐
Second, the difference between the nominal rates of return on assets and liabilities, ∑𝑐��𝑟𝑖,𝑡        � − �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  ��,
often denoted excess return, is important. The higher are returns on assets relative to liabilities, the
higher is investment income. Similarly, differences in capital gains across assets and liabilities,
        𝐴,𝑐           𝐿,𝑐
∑𝑐��𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡   � − �𝑘𝑔𝑖,𝑡    ��, can have important valuation effects. The higher are capital gains on assets
relative to liabilities, the greater the improvement in the NIIP.

Third, the composition of assets and liabilities between categories such as equity and debt (or more
detailed breakdowns) matters for all components of these equations. For example, consider equation
(7) for investment income – the simplest of these decompositions. It shows that even if returns and
exchange rates are identical within each asset class, and the overall assets and liabilities net out to zero,
a different asset composition across assets and liabilities could make investment income positive or
negative. More specifically, still assuming identical returns and exchange rates within each asset class
and an NIIP of zero, if a greater share of assets was held in equities than for liabilities, and equities
earned a higher return than other investment categories, investment income would be positive.

Finally, each of the decompositions shows that exchange rates play a particularly important role for
valuation effects and investment income, both through their direct impact on the value of net foreign
assets (which affects valuation gains and investment income), but also because any movements in the
exchange rate might mitigate or accentuate the impact of contemporaneous changes in rates of return
on investment income and of rates of capital gains on the NIIP. Accurately measuring the various
exchange rates for different asset and liability classes if the currency denomination differs is also
critically important to capture the corresponding effects. Complicating this analysis, the standard
calculation for an exchange rate – say based on trade-weighted exposures – can differ from the
appropriate exchange rate for assets or liabilities based on a country’s financial exposures. For example,
Figure 9 shows the standard trade-weighted exchange rate for the UK, as well as the financial-weighted
exchange rate indices for UK international assets and liabilities, constructed from data compiled by
Benetrix et al. (2015) using the methods set out in Lane and Shambaugh (2010). Although the various
exchange rate measures move closely over some periods, they can also diverge at times. This can have

28
     The rates of return and capital gains both exclude exchange rate effects.

                                                                                                                 14
a significant effect on international investment income and valuation effects – even if a country has a
net zero international investment position and otherwise equal capital gains or returns on assets and
liabilities. This is not obviously intuitive, so a concrete example may help.

Consider the broad-based depreciation of sterling, shown in Figure 9, which followed the financial crisis
between 2007 and 2009. Had the UK’s proportion of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currency been identical, the exchange rate indices on assets and liabilities would have moved
symmetrically. Because more assets than liabilities were denominated in foreign currency, however, the
exchange rate on assets depreciated by 7% more than the exchange rate on liabilities over this period –
increasing the sterling value of those assets (and reducing the negative impact of the fall in capital
gains). That is, through its impact on the valuation of assets, the depreciation increased the UK’s foreign
assets. In contrast, the depreciation had the opposite impact on the liabilities side: it increased the
value of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (and mitigated the fall in capital gains on liabilities).
Since more of the UK’s foreign assets than liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies, the
exchange rate on assets depreciated more than the exchange rate on liabilities. Even assuming similar
capital gains and initial positions across assets and liabilities – this broad-based exchange rate
depreciation would have had the effect of increasing the return on assets more than the return on
liabilities, thereby on net improving the NIIP through valuation effects. 29 Conversely, from 2013 to 2015,
the exchange rate on foreign assets appreciated by more than that on foreign liabilities, contributing to
the deterioration in the NIIP and international investment income over this period.

To summarize, this section has developed a theoretical framework to show how the determinants of a
country’s vulnerabilities related to the current account can be described using a limited set of variables.
Financial variables play a key role – whether through exchange rate movements, international asset and
liability positions, returns and capital gains on these positions, or the composition of these positions. But
how important is each of these variables in practice?

     C.   Empirical Decompositions: The Drivers of Valuation Changes and Investment Income

The decomposition in the last section shows that four sets of financial variables are important to
understand vulnerabilities related to current account deficits: last period’s stock of international assets
and liabilities, the nominal rate of return and capital gains on these international positions, the
composition of these positions, and exchange rates. The relative importance of each of these four
determinants varies by country and time period, depending on the country’s international portfolio, on
changes in rates of return and capital gains, and on changes in exchange rates. Applying this framework
to available data to estimate the contribution of each of these variables, as shown in equations (6)
through (8), however, is not straightforward. Previous academic literature suggests two different
approaches. One strand of literature has focused on decomposing different countries’ net foreign
                                                                                𝐴,𝑐        𝐿,𝑐
returns into a return effect and a composition effect, (i.e. focusing on the �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  � − �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  � for each
                                                   30
asset/liability and composition c in equation 7). The second strand of literature has focused on the role
of exchange rate adjustments, and especially how they can determine valuation changes based on the
currency composition of assets and liabilities. 31 We unify these different approaches and build more

closely on the decompositions developed in equations (6) through (8) in order to provide a framework
to measure all of the different financial effects simultaneously. This requires some additional
calculations and assumptions, which are described in detail in Appendix A. The covariances between
these four variables will also matter—as will be clarified in more detail in Section III.

Figure 10 reports the results of these decompositions into the four main financial determinants (last
period’s stock of international assets and liabilities, the excess nominal rate of return and capital gains,
the composition of the portfolio, and exchange rates) using data from 1990 to 2014 for the sample of 10
OECD economies with flexible exchange rates used previously. 32 For each country in the sample, the
panel on the left reports the decomposition for investment income, while the right panel reports the
decomposition for valuation changes. Not surprisingly, the relative importance of each of these four
channels varies by country and time period, depending on the country’s portfolio of international assets
and liabilities and changes in exchange rates and rates of return and capital gains. The figures highlight
the range of experiences.

For example, beginning with the decompositions for investment income, some countries have had large,
positive income flows for much of the sample – such as the US and Japan (for the full period),
Switzerland (except in 2008), the UK (from 2000 to 2012), and Norway and Sweden (since the early
2000s). In the US, this positive investment income largely reflects a consistent and large positive return
effect (partially counteracted by consistent negative contributions from its stock of net liabilities). In
contrast, the positive investment income in Switzerland and Japan reflects large positive stock effects
(with both countries holding large net asset positions), combined with positive composition effects for
Switzerland and return effects for Japan. In the UK, its strong investment income in the 2000s resulted
primarily from the composition of its international investments (with a greater exposure to equity than
debt) and a moderate boost from relative returns. Recently UK investment income deteriorated sharply,
largely due to negative return effects (reflecting weaker relative economic performance abroad),
combined with smaller gains from composition effects (due to an increasing share of UK liabilities in
debt). Norway’s transition to earning positive net investment income in the early 2000’s largely resulted
from a stock effect, while Sweden’s transition largely reflected a positive return effect. Large negative
flows for international investment income, such as in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada (until the
early-2000s), are often driven by large stock effects – showing the challenges for countries with large
net international liabilities.

The panels on the right, which decompose valuation changes, show that not only does the role of the
four different determinants fluctuate more from year to year than occurred for investment income, but
even the direction of the net changes is much less stable. The stock effects, however, generally tend to
be smaller. Trends in the UK and US highlight how the different channels can play different roles at
different times. During the 2008 crisis, the UK experienced large positive valuation effects on its
international investments, driven largely by the exchange rate channel (and sterling’s depreciation),
albeit partially counteracted by a negative composition effect (as more of its international assets were in
equities, which lost more value than debt). In 2014 the UK experienced a negative valuation effect,
which was largely driven by an exchange rate effect (and sterling’s appreciation). In contrast, in 2008 the
US experienced negative valuation effects, driven by a powerful composition effect. In 2014 the US also
experienced large negative valuation effects, except in this case driven primarily by the return channel

(at least partially reflecting higher yields on bonds and equities in the US relative to the returns US
investors earned abroad in the same investment categories).

Given the range of different experiences, both across time and across countries, it is useful to try to
quantify the relative importance of these four channels determining investment income and valuation
effects over time. Table 1 provides one quantification – the correlation of international investment
income and valuation changes with each of the four components for each country over the sample
period. The averages for the sample highlight a number of points: a) the return effect is the most highly
correlated with both investment income and valuation changes, indicating it plays an important role; b)
the initial stock effect is also highly correlated with investment income, albeit somewhat less so with
valuation changes; and c) many of the correlations vary substantially across countries. These differences
are particularly noteworthy for exchange rate effects, whose correlations with investment income range
from -0.34 in Sweden to about 0.34 for Switzerland. Similarly, although several countries have a large
positive correlation between their exchange rate effects and valuation changes, others have negative
effects (such as the US, Australia, and Switzerland) – with some of these differences reflecting whether
the country’s currency is treated as a safe haven.

One important consideration that is not captured in these averages, however, is how these different
channels function during “good” times, such as from 2000 to 2007, relative to how these channels
operate during periods of crisis or economic stress. For example, the graphs show that in 2008, the peak
of the global financial crisis, some countries had large positive valuation effects (such as the UK and
South Korea), while others had large negative valuation effects (such as the US, Japan and Norway).
Switzerland also experienced a large negative investment income flow – a sharp turnaround from other
years in the sample and largely caused by a negative return effect. It is precisely during such periods of
crisis and heightened economic stress that concerns about vulnerabilities related to current accounts
increase. Therefore, the final section of this paper will extend this analysis one step further. It will build
on this framework to better understand how these financial components respond to various shocks –
and especially the types of shocks that correspond to increased concerns about current account deficits.



III.     Current Account Vulnerability during Heightened Domestic and Global Risk

The previous section showed that movements in investment income and the valuations of international
investment positions (and thus in the current account and the NIIP) will be determined by structural and
cyclical factors influencing the quantity and composition of international assets and liabilities, their
returns (including capital gains) and changes in exchange rates. To see how this framework for analyzing
vulnerabilities related to the current account works in practice, we extend the analysis to evaluate what
it implies during a period of heightened risk and uncertainty. 33 Research over the last few years has
highlighted the strong relationship between changes in risk (as often measured by the VIX) and sudden
shifts in capital flows and the broader global financial cycle in credit growth and leverage. 34 It is during
these periods of heightened risk that current account deficits usually become harder to finance,
requiring sharp movements in asset prices and difficult economic adjustments.
33
   We will use the words “risk” and “uncertainty” interchangeably in the following discussion, although in many frameworks
they capture two distinct concepts – changes in risk aversion and economic uncertainty.
34
   For evidence on the relationship of risk: with capital flows, see Forbes and Warnock (2012, 2014); with bank lending, see
Bruno and Shin (2015); and with the global financial cycle, see Rey (2013) and Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2015).

                                                                                                                               17
We model these periods of heightened risk as associated with increases in an “X-factor” (or risk factor).
Changes in that risk factor could be caused by many types of events and can incorporate a global (XG)
and/or a domestic (XD) component. The global component corresponds to any increased uncertainty
about the evolution of the global economy, periods of reduced global market liquidity, any widespread
financial crisis, or anything that makes global investors, consumers and businesses more risk averse. The
domestic factor is local to one specific economy and does not affect global financial markets. It
corresponds to events such as increased uncertainty about the domestic economy, or anything that
makes domestic consumers, businesses and investors more “risk averse”, including political uncertainty.
How do the characteristics of a country’s international investment position determine the extent to
which a shock to global or domestic risk impacts that country’s current account and NIIP? What are the
characteristics which aggravate vulnerabilities? And what are those that mitigate them through
international risk sharing? 35

This section answers these questions, but to simplify the analysis, we focus on financial effects and
ignore any effects through the trade balance. This is not to say that any adjustments through trade are
unimportant, but trade relationships have been well studied elsewhere and are generally much slower
than the financial channels on which this paper focuses. This section begins by showing the channels
through which domestic and global risk, respectively, can affect the current account and NIIP. These
channels correspond to the four sets of variables specified in equation (8) and discussed in Section II.
The analysis then shows which country characteristics affect the relative importance of each of these
channels and performs a comparison across the sample of 10 OECD countries used previously. The
section closes with a more detailed analysis of the effects of risk shocks on investment income and
positions using an SVAR model that we estimate using data on the UK. This allows us to assess not only
the direction, but also the magnitude, of the effect of heightened global and domestic risk on UK
vulnerabilities related to the current account.

       A. How Risk Affects the Components of the Current Account and the NIIP

To begin, we build on the accounting framework developed in Section II to describe the channels
through which changes in risk may affect the current account and the NIIP. Using equation (8) to
calculate the impact of a change in risk on the various components of the NIIP yields:
                                      𝐴𝑐

     𝑑𝑋𝑡
               =    𝑑𝑋𝑡
                            +                       𝑑𝑋𝑡
                                                                             −                      𝑑𝑋𝑡
                                                                                                                       +      𝑑𝑋𝑡
                                                                                                                                          .   (9)

Then, in order to further break down how the current account is affected by increased risk, use the
definition for the current account in equation (4) and the decomposition of investment income in
equation (7) to obtain:

  See Gourinchas, Rey and Truempler (2012) for calculations of the amount of risk sharing through net international
investment positions during the 2008 crisis. They estimate large effects. For example, they calculate that the US transferred
$2,200 billion in wealth transfers abroad from 2007q4 to 2009q1, while the UK had a net gain of $542 billion between 2007q4
and 2008q4. While our approach has similarities with theirs, we consider more channels through which external positions can
affect risk sharing, and we consider these channels over a longer period of time.

                                                                                                                                                     18
Finally, combining the effects of heightened risk on the valuation channel (on the right side of equation
9) and the investment income channel (on the right side of equation 10), yields the overall impact of risk
on the NIIP:

                                                                                                                       +           ,   (11)

where 𝐸𝑖,𝑡 = 𝑂𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖,𝑡 + 𝑂𝐴𝑑𝑗𝑖,𝑡 reflects adjustments which are usually relatively small, and that we
therefore abstract from.

Equations (10) and (11) show that, assuming a given trade balance, the impact of a risk shock on the
current account (through investment income) and on the NIIP (through both investment income and
valuation changes) will be determined by: the initial stock of international assets and liabilities, the rates
of returns and capital gains on these positions, the composition of these positions, and the response of
the exchange rates on assets and liabilities (which is determined by the currency denomination of these
positions and the relevant bilateral exchange rate movements). To more closely analyze these various
channels, we begin with the simpler case of increased domestic risk, and then move to the effects of
global risk.

        B. The Impact of Domestic Risk

The various effects of a shock to domestic risk, as shown in equations (10) and (11), can be simplified
given our definition that this type of shock does not affect the returns and capital gains on foreign assets
and only directly affects the domestic economy (through the returns and capital gains on domestic
liabilities and the exchange rate). 36 Therefore focusing on the effect of the shock on liabilities, the key
country characteristics and channels that determine how increased domestic risk affects a country’s
current account and the NIIP, are:

      i.     The initial stock of liabilities: a greater stock of liabilities will increase the impact of the shock on
             total capital gains and returns (leading to a greater reduction in payments abroad and greater
             reduction in the value of international liabilities, improving the current account and NIIP), as
             well as the overall impact from any change in exchange rates.
     ii.     The composition of the initial stock of liabilities: the more risky are the liabilities, the greater the
             impact on the rate of return and capital gains on these liabilities (reducing payments abroad,
             increasing net investment income, and improving the current account and NIIP).
     iii.    The currency of denomination of assets: the more assets are denominated in foreign currency,
             the more will the associated exchange rate depreciate (increasing receipts from abroad,
             increasing net investment income, and improving the current account and NIIP).
     iv.     The currency of denomination of liabilities: the more liabilities are denominated in foreign
             currency, the more will the associated exchange rate depreciate (increasing payments abroad,
             lowering net investment income, and deteriorating the current account and NIIP).



36
  While the shock does not have any direct impact on international assets, some characteristics related to assets, such as the
effects of exchange rate movements, play a role in risk sharing following a domestic shock.

                                                                                                                                              19
     v.    The co-movement of rates of returns on liabilities with exchange rates: the more does the
           exchange rate associated with liabilities depreciate as their rate of return falls, the less benefit
           will occur from lower returns on liabilities (the more will the negative effects from iv. counter
           the positive effects from i. and ii. on investment income, the current account and NIIP).
     vi.   The co-movement of capital gains on liabilities with exchange rates: the more does the exchange
           rate associated with liabilities depreciate as capital gains on liabilities fall, the less benefit will
           occur from lower capital gains on liabilities (the more will the negative effects from iv. counter
           the positive effects from i. and ii. on the NIIP).

Table 2 lists each of these key variables and summarizes what characteristics of each would mitigate the
negative effects of a domestic risk shock on current account vulnerabilities by transmitting wealth to the
domestic economy. In other words, it describes what country characteristics provide this type of
international risk sharing through changes in the NIIP. It also reports how each of the 10 OECD
economies in our sample perform according to each of these characteristics, as well as on average.

The table suggests that, on average, the international portfolios of these major OECD economies with
flexible exchange rates have many characteristics that would support some automatic risk sharing in the
face of heightened domestic risk. The average stock of liabilities as a percent of GDP was above 200% in
recent years, having increased from an average of less than 80% in 1990 and around 150% in 2000.
Moreover, on average 44% of the borrowing is in the form of equities, up from 25% in 1990 and 40% in
2000. This suggests that when domestic risk increases and has the usual impact of causing domestic
equity prices to decline, an increased portion of these losses are shared with foreign investors.

Additional risk sharing also occurs through the currency denomination of assets and liabilities. With 90%
of assets denominated in foreign currency and only 43% of liabilities, any heightened domestic risk that
causes these countries’ currencies to depreciate will – all else equal – generate an improvement in their
NIIP simply because it increases the value of their international assets relative to the value of what they
owe foreigners. 37 This channel of risk sharing has likely increased over time, as the share of liabilities
denominated in foreign currency has fallen from almost 60% in 1990 and 46% in 2000, while the share
of assets denominated in foreign currency has stayed around 90%.

While most of the countries’ international portfolio characteristics support some risk sharing, on
average, other characteristics could at least partially counteract these effects. For example, the average
positive correlations between the exchange rate and the rate of capital gains, as well as with the rate of
return, suggests that exchange rate movements can partly offset the risk sharing from movements in
rates of returns and capital gains on liabilities. Consider the 0.52 correlation between the exchange rate
and capital gains on liabilities for the UK. Increased domestic risk tends to reduce the capital gains on UK
liabilities, thereby improving the UK’s NIIP position (assuming everything else stays constant). The
positive correlation between reduced capital gains and sterling, however, suggests that the currency
would simultaneously weaken, thereby lessening this reduction in capital gains (as some liabilities are
denominated in foreign currency) and partially counteracting the risk sharing. All in all, despite these
currency “hedging effects”, these 10 OECD countries with flexible exchange rates appear, on average, to


37
  Of course, if a country’s currency appreciates after an increase in domestic risk, then these effects would be reversed. The
estimated currency denominations are based on Benetrix et al. (2015) and refer to 2012.

                                                                                                                                 20
have international portfolios that could provide some cushion against heightened domestic risk – at
least in terms of reducing vulnerabilities related to any current account deficits.

There are noteworthy differences, however, between the individual countries in the group. For example,
Switzerland has a number of characteristics that support a particularly high degree of international risk
sharing after increased domestic risk: its high share of international liabilities to GDP (450%), high share
of equities in liabilities (60%), high share of assets in foreign currency (95%), low share of liabilities in
foreign currency (32%), and negative correlation between its exchange rate and foreign currency capital
gains (-32%). Japan benefits less from international risk sharing after domestic shocks due to its: low
share of international liabilities to GDP (104%), low share of equities in liabilities (37%), and lower share
of assets in foreign currency (71%). The UK has some characteristics that should support a substantial
degree of automatic risk sharing – such as its large stock of international liabilities (the highest in the
sample at 558% of GDP) and 93% share of assets denominated in foreign currency (close to the sample
average). But by other measures the UK would only have moderate risk sharing and less than the sample
average, such as its 58% of liabilities denominated in foreign currency (compared to an average of 43%)
and only 27% of liabilities in the form of equities (compared to an average of 44%). The UK’s exchange
rate movements also tend to improve risk sharing through its negative correlation with foreign currency
returns, but reduce risk sharing through its positive correlation with foreign currency capital gains.

     C. The Impact of Global Risk

While the international portfolios of these 10 OECD economies with flexible exchange rates appear to
provide some automatic risk sharing in the face of domestic risk shocks, what do they imply in the face
of global risk shocks? Analyzing the effects of heightened global risk is more complicated than for
domestic risk, however, because it requires incorporating two additional considerations. 38 First, taking
into account that some currencies are “safe havens” and appreciate in response to increased global risk,
while others tend to depreciate. Second, the global risk shock affects not only capital gains and returns
on foreign liabilities, but also on foreign assets.

To assess which currencies are generally treated as a safe haven by investors, Figure 11 reports the
correlations between the VIX and the currencies of the 10 OECD economies in our sample, plus the euro,
over different time periods. Currencies treated as a safe haven generally have a positive correlation –
reflecting the fact that their value increases when global risk increases (and vice versa). The figure shows
that the dollar, yen and Swiss franc have consistently been treated as safe havens over each of these
windows, while other currencies have not. The euro has showed characteristics of a safe haven during
some periods – but not others – so for the analysis that follows we will only treat the dollar, yen and
Swiss franc as safe havens.

Next, we use the same framework as in the last section (and summarized in equation 11) to analyze how
a global risk shock would be expected to impact key variables related to current account vulnerabilities
and the NIIP, except now we extend the analysis for the additional effects on foreign assets, as well as
differentiate between safe haven currencies and the rest. Many of the effects of global risk shocks are
the same as for domestic risk shocks, so to simplify discussion, we will highlight the key differences in

38
  Other considerations might also be relevant, such as if increased global risk generated a rush to safe assets globally and
caused the return on debt liabilities (relative to the return on equity liabilities) to fall less than when domestic risk increases. To
simplify the analysis, we abstract from this effect.

                                                                                                                                    21
bold. More specifically, the impact of increased global risk on the current account and on the NIIP
(incorporating the effects on investment income and valuation changes), will depend on:

   i.   The initial stock of liabilities and assets: a greater stock of liabilities relative to assets will
        increase the shock’s impact on overall capital gains and returns and through exchange rate
        changes (leading to a greater reduction in payments abroad relative to payments received from
        abroad and greater reduction in the value of international liabilities relative to assets, improving
        the current account and NIIP).
  ii.   The composition of the initial stock of liabilities and assets: the more risky are the liabilities
        relative to assets, the greater the impact on the rate of return and capital gains on these
        liabilities relative to assets (reducing payments abroad relative to those received from abroad,
        increasing net investment income, and improving the current account and NIIP).
 iii.   The currency of denomination of assets: the more assets are denominated in foreign safe haven
        currencies, the more will the associated exchange rate depreciate – or the less will it appreciate
        if it is a safe haven - (increasing receipts from abroad, increasing net investment income, and
        improving the current account and NIIP).
 iv.    The currency of denomination of liabilities: the more liabilities are denominated in foreign safe
        haven currencies, the more will the associated exchange rate depreciate – or the less will it
        appreciate if it is a safe haven - (increasing payments abroad, lowering net investment income,
        and deteriorating the current account and NIIP).
  v.    The co-movement of returns on liabilities and assets with exchange rates: the more does the
        exchange rate on liabilities depreciate as the returns on liabilities fall, the less benefit will occur
        from lower returns on liabilities (the more will the negative effects from iv. counter the positive
        effects from i. and ii. on investment income, the current account and NIIP). But the more does
        the exchange rate related to assets depreciate as the returns on assets fall, the less will be the
        negative impact of lower returns on assets (the less will the negative effects from i. and ii.
        counter any positive effects from iii).
 vi.    The co-movement of capital gains on liabilities and assets with exchange rates: the more does
        the exchange rate on liabilities depreciate as the rate of capital gains on liabilities fall, the less
        benefit will occur from lower capital gains on liabilities (the more will the negative effects from
        iv. counter the positive effects from i. and ii. on the NIIP). But the more does the exchange rate
        related to assets depreciate as the rate of capital gains on assets fall, the lower will be the
        negative impact of the fall in capital gains on the NIIP (the less will the negative effects from i.
        and ii. counter any positive effects from iii).

These characteristics differ quite a bit across countries; countries have different quantities of assets
relative to liabilities, hold different types of assets (with different shares of equity relative to debt), and
invest using different currencies (with different shares in safe havens). Nonetheless, in an attempt to
make these channels more concrete and provide some basis for comparisons, Table 3 repeats the
analysis in Table 2, but for global (instead of domestic) risk. The table again describes what international
portfolio characteristics mitigate the impact of global shocks through changes in the NIIP, and reports
the average values for the same sample of 10 OECD economies with flexible exchange rates, as well as
individual country characteristics.

                                                                                                             22
The table suggests that, on average, these countries’ international portfolios have some characteristics
that could partially mitigate the impact of heightened global risk on the NIIP. Other characteristics,
however, do not, making the aggregate effects less clear than after heightened domestic risk. For
example, starting with the positives, 40% of assets are denominated in foreign safe haven currencies
and only 24% of liabilities. Therefore, when global risk increases and safe-haven currencies appreciate,
the value of international assets increases relative to liabilities, thereby boosting the NIIP and helping
mitigate the wealth effects of the global risk shock. The higher correlation between exchange rates on
assets and their rates of capital gains than that between exchange rates on liabilities and their rates of
capital gains also implies that the exchange rate generally mitigates the fall in the NIIP after a global risk
shock. Counteracting this effect, however, the countries hold fewer foreign liabilities than assets, on
average, so that if these are hit identically by a global shock, their net foreign asset holdings decline,
exacerbating the impact of the shock. Moreover, the smaller share of equity (relative to debt) for
liabilities (relative to assets) further amplifies the negative effects of increased global risk on the NIIP.

The averages cited in Table 3, however, again incorporate significant differences in international
portfolios across countries. Countries such as the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand have larger
liabilities relative to assets 39, suggesting they tend to see improvements simply due to the stocks of their
positions after global shocks. In contrast, countries such as Norway, Switzerland, and Japan have larger
assets relative to liabilities, and are therefore more likely to be made worse off after a global shock
simply due to the magnitudes of these positions. There are also substantial differences in the relative
equity shares in liabilities relative to assets, with the US, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, Norway
and Sweden more heavily exposed to equity in their liabilities, and therefore more likely to benefit from
these compositional effects after global risk shocks (which tend to reduce the values of equities relative
to debt). 40 Most countries, however, have a substantially larger share of assets denominated in foreign
safe-haven currencies than liabilities (with the smallest difference for Japan). This should increase the
value of their assets relative to liabilities after an increase in global risk (which increases the value of
safe-haven currencies), helping mitigate the wealth effects of the shock. 41

     D. The Magnitudes: Global and Domestic Risk Shocks and Current Account Vulnerabilities

Tables 2 and 3 show that the international portfolios for a sample of OECD economies with flexible
exchange rates have a number of characteristics that should help mitigate the negative impact of
heightened domestic risk, and possibly heightened global risk, on international exposures. The tables do
not, however, provide any information on the magnitude of any such risk sharing through these
channels in practice, or the relative importance of different channels that work in opposing directions
(especially after global risk shocks). Therefore – as a final step to get a better sense of the magnitudes
and relevance of the effects discussed in this section – we estimate an SVAR model to calculate how
domestic and global risk shocks have affected international investment income and valuation changes
over time. We focus on one country, the United Kingdom, which currently has a very large current
account deficit that has raised concerns about the country’s vulnerability to various shocks.

39
   Based on 2014 market valuations. Most countries report market valuations for all asset classes excluding FDI. We use Lane
and Milesi-Ferreti (2007b) FDI stocks, valued at replacement cost, and update them for 2012-2014 using growth rates
calculated from official statistics reported in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics database.
40
   Gourinchas, Rey and Truempler (2012) also highlight this impact of a greater share of equity in assets.
41
   It is not clear whether this channel has increased over time. The share of assets denominated in foreign safe haven currencies
has fallen over time; but the share of liabilities denominated in safe haven currencies has also fallen.

                                                                                                                              23
In order to estimate a model that closely follows the framework in this paper, we will continue to focus
on separate global and domestic risk shocks. To measure these risk shocks, we start with measures of
UK uncertainty and global uncertainty reported in the indices constructed by Baker, Bloom and Davis
(2015). These measures of uncertainty do not just capture exogenous changes in UK or global risk,
however, but also other changes in the domestic or global environment (such as adverse demand
shocks). These measures also move together to some degree (with a correlation of 0.65), reflecting the
fact that certain shocks could affect both global and UK uncertainty. In order to identify and estimate
exogenous risk shocks based on these measures of uncertainty, we therefore use an SVAR model
combined with other macroeconomic data. This SVAR model is described in Appendix B, along with
details on the identification assumptions and corresponding data. This framework yields uncorrelated
UK and global risk shocks. Then we use these measures to estimate how exogenous domestic and global
risk shocks will affect UK net international investment income and valuation changes on its international
portfolio.

Figures 12 and 13 show UK investment income and the valuation effects on its international portfolio,
respectively, as well as the estimated historical contributions to these variables from the two risk shocks
identified using our SVAR model. The contributions of the risk shocks typically move in the same
direction as movements in international investment income and valuation changes. They also appear to
explain a material portion of the movements in both variables. A substantial share of the variation is not
explained by the risk shocks, but this is expected as we only focus on the impact of two, narrow types of
shocks (from exogenous global and domestic risk), and we do not plot the impact of other fundamental
shocks that affect investment income and valuation changes (such as from relative demand, supply,
monetary policy, and exogenous exchange rate movements). More specifically, the UK risk shock
accounts for around 15% of the forecast error variance of investment income and 14% of valuation
changes. The global risk shock accounts for a slightly smaller proportion of the variance, around 12% for
both investment income and valuation changes. Therefore, our model suggests that just over a quarter
of the unpredicted variance of net international investment income and valuation changes can be
attributed to the domestic and global risk shocks.

But are these contributions to international investment income and the NIIP positive when risk
increases, thereby mitigating the adverse impact of heightened risk on the UK economy? Or do they
decrease national net wealth and exacerbate the real effects of higher uncertainty on the economy? The
SVAR estimates indicate that the answer has depended on the source of that risk – whether it originates
in the domestic economy or reflects a general increase in global risk.

On one hand, an increase in domestic risk tends to have positive effects on the valuation of the UK’s
international portfolio, largely reflecting the effects of the corresponding sterling depreciation and the
currency composition of the UK’s international portfolio. The effects on net investment income tend to
be smaller and less robust to different specifications. This suggests that the structure of the UK
international portfolio facilitates international risk sharing after country-specific risk shocks through its
effect on the NIIP. This effect can be seen in Figure 13 during 2012 and early 2013, which was a period
when UK risk increased relative to global risk. Sterling depreciated, increasing the sterling value of UK
foreign asset holdings, while having a much smaller impact on the value of UK liabilities (a smaller share
of which is denominated in foreign currencies, as shown in Table 2). These effects, however, work in the
opposite direction during periods of reduced UK risk. For example, in the second half of 2013 and 2014,


                                                                                                           24
UK domestic risk fell and sterling appreciated, reducing the sterling value of UK foreign asset holdings
and shifting wealth abroad.

On the other hand, an increase in global risk has historically been associated with net valuation losses on
the UK’s international portfolio and lower international investment income. Sterling tends to depreciate
after heightened global risk, which should generate some positive valuation effect as occurred after a
depreciation in response to heightened domestic risk. Heightened global risk, however, also generates
an additional effect on the foreign currency returns on UK foreign assets, independent from any
movements in the exchange rate. This effect through relative returns has been less favorable for the UK
due to the composition of its assets and liabilities. More specifically, UK international assets have
historically had a larger share of risky investments (such as FDI and portfolio equity) than UK
international liabilities, such that the returns on UK assets abroad are likely to fall more than the returns
on safer UK liabilities during periods of heightened global risk. This effect is evident in Figures 12 and 13
in the period before the crisis from 2005 to 2007. Global risk was low, corresponding to higher capital
gains and investment income flows on UK assets relative to that on UK liabilities, and thereby
contributing to positive net valuation gains and net investment income surpluses. In contrast, when
global risk increased sharply during the financial crisis, there was a negative impact on net valuation
changes and investment income (as the UK’s riskier assets earned lower returns and underperformed its
safer liabilities 42).

These SVAR results provide more detailed information on how the specific characteristics of a country’s
international portfolio can affect its vulnerabilities related to the current account in the face of
heightened domestic and global risk. The results show not only the net direction of these effects, but
also give a rough sense of the magnitudes. For the UK, an increase in domestic risk leads to positive
valuation effects on its international portfolio that help share the costs of heightened domestic
uncertainty internationally in a meaningful way. An increase in global risk, however, generates negative
valuation and return effects due to the composition of the UK’s international portfolio.



IV.       Conclusions

Although current account deficits – even large ones – should not automatically imply country
vulnerability, the historical and empirical evidence suggests that they are often not benign. They
correspond to a greater reliance on investment and capital flows from abroad, thereby increasing a
country’s vulnerability to anything that affects these capital flows or investor sentiment. Sudden shifts
in these capital flows can trigger difficult economic adjustments. In some cases, however, the factors
affecting investor sentiment and the corresponding capital flows will also influence the current account
and international investments, potentially aggravating or mitigating any related vulnerabilities. This
paper developed a framework to evaluate these effects. It allows us to assess and better understand
when a current account deficit is menacing, versus when it provides some mitigation against adverse
shocks through international risk sharing.

42
  For example, the UK entered the crisis with FDI holdings accounting for 14% of its total foreign assets, but only 9% of its
foreign liabilities. In 2008, these FDI holdings generated a negative capital gain of 15%, whereas safer assets such as portfolio
debt and other investments (mostly cross-border loans and deposits) generated positive capital gains of 7% and 14%,
respectively. Since the UK held more of the worse-performing asset (FDI), the value of its net portfolio suffered from the
increase in global risk that drove equity prices down.

                                                                                                                                    25
Before developing this framework, the paper began by reviewing why current account deficits often
generate concerns. Recent evidence suggests that key vulnerabilities reflect the financial components of
the current account, despite the common shorthand of treating current account balances as
synonymous with trade balances. A series of empirical decompositions for a sample of OECD economies
shows that these financial components are increasingly important, and sometimes more important than
trade, in explaining movements in current account balances and changes in net international borrowing
positions. These financial components include changes in the valuations of a country’s international
investments (“valuation effects”), as well as the income earned and paid on past cross-border
investments (“investment income”). Although previous academic work has explored these valuation
effects, little attention has been paid to the role of international investment income, or to the drivers
and interactions of these financial factors. Understanding their determinants and dynamics is critical to
understanding the vulnerabilities related to current account deficits.

Therefore, we next developed a unified framework that decomposes these financial factors into four
sets of variables determining their evolution: the existing stock of international assets and liabilities in a
country’s portfolio, the composition of this portfolio (between more and less risky investments), the
rates of returns and capital gains on this portfolio, and exchange rate movements. We showed that the
relative importance of each of these variables differs across countries and time, reflecting both the
characteristics of each country’s portfolio as well as the confluence of changes in markets around the
world. But the decomposition also showed several noteworthy patterns – such as how the size of
international asset positions has large and consistent effects over time, the importance of relative rates
of return on international assets and liabilities in driving valuation effects and international investment
income, and the effects of exchange rate movements.

After developing this framework to better understand the drivers of current account balances and
international investment positions, we extended the framework to evaluate the vulnerabilities related
to current account deficits during periods of heightened risk and uncertainty. These are the periods that
often correspond to sudden shifts in capital flows that make it more difficult to finance a current
account deficit. These periods could reflect an increase in domestic risk (such as related to domestic
political or economic uncertainty) or global risk (such as related to commodity price fluctuations, global
economic uncertainty, or global financial conditions). We showed which characteristics of a country’s
international investment portfolio tend to aggravate the negative impact of heightened risk and
uncertainty on a country’s vulnerabilities, and which characteristics can mitigate these effects by shifting
some of the adjustment costs abroad.

While the framework developed in this paper can be applied to any country, we primarily focused on a
sample of 10 OECD economies with flexible exchange rates. This includes a number of countries which
currently have, or have had, large current account deficits. The sample allows us to highlight the role
that exchange rate adjustments can play in the buildup – or unwinding – of any vulnerabilities. The
examples also highlight the flexibility of this framework to analyze very diverse experiences across
countries. Although some common patterns emerge for our sample of advanced economies – such as
the potential for international sharing of idiosyncratic risks through currency movements – there is
substantial heterogeneity in countries’ external portfolios and thereby how they are affected by
heightened risk and uncertainty.

In order to more concretely show how this framework and the results can be applied to analyze a
specific country’s vulnerability to certain events, the paper closes with a more detailed application to
one country with a large current account deficit: the United Kingdom. This discussion helps tie together
the various pieces of analysis developed through the paper and provides an indication of the magnitude
of the various effects. The analysis provides several insights on the UK’s vulnerability related to its
current account. First, changes in the UK’s international investment position have primarily
corresponded to valuation adjustments in these investment positions (instead of trade balances), and
the role of these valuation effects has increased over time. Second, changes in the UK’s current account
since 2004 have been almost entirely driven by changes in international investment. Third, the increased
role of financial fluctuations in determining the UK’s international investment position and current
account is not surprising given the sharp increase in the UK’s gross international asset and liability
positions; larger positions mean that even small changes in valuations and returns have larger effects.
Fourth, positive international investment income flows and valuation effects have substantially
improved the UK’s net international investment position over time. Fifth, the UK’s strong international
investment income in the 2000s resulted primarily from the composition of its international investments
(with a greater exposure to equity than debt) and a moderate boost from the relative returns earned
abroad relative to those paid to foreigners. Finally, sterling’s movements have had a powerful effect on
the valuation of UK international investments, with the effect positive during periods of sterling
depreciation (such as during the 2008-2009 crisis) and negative during periods of sterling appreciation
(such as during 2014).

After understanding these key structural components and sensitivities of the UK international
investment position, it is then possible to analyze how these components would be affected by
increases in UK risk and global risk. The UK has some characteristics that should support a substantial
degree of automatic risk sharing after domestic shocks—such as its large stock of international liabilities
(the highest in the sample at 558% of GDP) and 93% share of assets denominated in foreign currency. By
other measures, however, the UK would only have moderate risk sharing and less than the sample
average (such as its relatively high 58% of liabilities denominated in foreign currency and relatively low
27% of liabilities in the form of equities). The UK’s exchange rate movements also tend to improve risk
sharing through its negative correlation with foreign currency returns, but reduce risk sharing through
its positive correlation with foreign currency capital gains. By most measures, the UK appears to be less
well positioned to share risk internationally after an increase in global risk. An analysis quantifying the
impact of these effects shows that changes in UK and global risk have explained a meaningful portion of
changes in UK international investment income and investment positions over time. 43

This analysis should be read with several important caveats. First, the international financial data is far
from perfect, so all empirical calculations and estimates should be interpreted as having a wide margin
of error. Second, the analysis focused on understanding the vulnerabilities related to current account
deficits that occur during periods of heightened risk and uncertainty. It did not incorporate the
additional vulnerabilities and effects of heightened risk on an economy, such as through any effects of

43
  The analysis does not account for other important effects of heightened risk on the broader economy, such as from currency
depreciation, which is a key part of these financial effects and would in itself incur other adjustments. Carroll et al. (2011) and
Case et al. (2013) estimate that changes in the valuation of international exposures have minimal impact on domestic incomes
and growth in the UK and would therefore be unlikely to counteract the negative effects of heightened uncertainty on these
domestic variables. Forbes, Hjortsoe and Nenova (2015) show how the source of the shock behind an exchange rate movement
will determine its impact on import prices, inflation, and the broader economy.

                                                                                                                                27
delayed investment and consumption, or any additional effects on the real economy from the
corresponding movements in financial markets. It also does not make any attempt to consider any
effects of heightened risk on the liquidity or functioning of financial markets. 44 Finally, the analysis
focuses only on the financial vulnerabilities and immediate adjustments related to current accounts. It
ignores the slower moving, but often important, adjustments that can occur through trade.

With these caveats, the analysis clearly showed that any analysis of a country’s vulnerabilities related to
current account deficits and international borrowing needs to prominently feature financial factors,
drivers, and interactions. Although these effects vary across countries, a fairly straightforward and
limited set of measurable characteristics of a country’s international investment portfolio can go a
substantial way to understanding the dynamics of current accounts, international investment positions,
and their related vulnerabilities. This framework showed that current account deficits are not
automatically “menacing”. Instead, in countries with certain characteristics of their international
portfolios (including many of the OECD economies analyzed in this paper), current account deficits can
partially mitigate the negative impact of certain shocks (especially domestic risk shocks) through
international risk sharing. Although this paper focuses on the potential benefits of this risk sharing to
individual countries, future work could attempt to aggregate these effects and assess the benefits to the
global economy from this type of risk sharing. 45



Appendix A: Decomposing Investment Income and Valuation Changes

The decomposition of investment income, valuation changes, and overall changes in the NIIP shown in
equations (6) through (8) shows that four sets of financial variables are important in understanding
vulnerabilities related to current account deficits: the existing stock of international assets and liabilities,
the exchange rate indices reflecting the currency composition of the country’s assets and liabilities, the
composition of each asset and liability class (c), and the nominal rate of return and capital gains on last
period’s foreign assets and liabilities. Using the framework in equations (6) through (8) to estimate the
contribution of each of these variables, however, is not straightforward. Previous academic literature
has taken two different directions, which we attempt to unify within the framework used in this paper.

One strand of literature has focused on decomposing different countries’ net foreign returns into a
                                                                 𝐴,𝑐        𝐿,𝑐
return effect and a composition effect, (i.e. focusing on the �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  � − �𝑟𝑖,𝑡  � for each asset/liability and
composition c in equation (7)). This literature, including Gourinchas and Rey (2007) and Curcuru et al.
(2008), has decomposed different countries’ net foreign returns into a return and a composition effect.
The first captures whether a given country is paying more or less on its foreign liabilities than it receives
on its assets of the same type. A positive net return effect has been described as a country’s “exorbitant
privilege”. The composition effect, on the other hand captures whether a country’s international
portfolio yields more based on the types of investments in its portfolio and not the returns for each
type. For example, a country could have a higher average yield on its international portfolio because it

  An extensive literature assesses the extent of international risk sharing (through measures such as the cross-country
comovement in consumption and output growth) and found less risk sharing than optimal or would be expected given high
levels of financial globalization. See Flood, Marion and Matsumoto (2012) and Kose, Prasad, Terrones (2007). One exception is
Gourinchas et al. (2012), which documents the substantial risk sharing that occurred during the global financial crisis.

                                                                                                                           28
has a higher share of assets (than liabilities) in equities and FDI, which tend to yield more than bonds
and cross-border bank loans and deposits.

The second strand of literature has focused on the role of exchange rate adjustments, and especially
how they can determine valuation changes based on the currency composition of assets and liabilities.
This literature, led by Lane and Shambaugh (2010) and Benetrix, Lane and Shambaugh (2015), has
pointed out that exchange rate movements play a role in valuation changes if a country has a nonzero
initial net position or if the currency composition of its assets and liabilities differs. For instance,
countries that issue much of their liabilities in their own currency (such as the US), but hold foreign
assets denominated in other currencies, can benefit substantially from a depreciation. These exchange
rate effects can exacerbate or mitigate the effects of certain shocks on a country’s external position. Not
explicitly accounting for these exchange rate effects when constructing measures of the composition
and return effects can make the latter two very volatile and less informative about the underlying
structure of a country’s vulnerability.

For our analysis, we unify these different approaches and build more closely on the framework
developed in equations (6) through (8). This allows us to provide a decomposition of investment income
and valuation changes into all four of the different financial determinants simultaneously (i.e. the
existing stock of international assets and liabilities, differences in exchange rates across assets and
liabilities, differences in the composition of these portfolios, and differences in returns and capital gains
on these positions.) This more detailed decomposition, however, requires some additional calculations
and assumptions.

First, we begin by calculating the effect of the initial international stocks on investment income and on
valuations effects, the “stock effect”. This effect captures any net income or valuation changes that the
previous period net asset positions would have generated stripping out the impact resulting from assets
and liabilities yielding different returns (both due to composition and return effects) and from exchange
rate movements differing across assets and liabilities. The stock effect is thus computed assuming that
rates of return and capital gains as well as exchange rate movements are identical across assets and
liabilities. This yields an equation to derive the initial stock effect for the net investment income as:
                                              𝑟𝑡𝐴 +𝑟𝑡𝐿     1             1
𝐼𝑁𝑉𝐼𝑁𝐶_𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑡 ≡ (𝐴𝑡−1 − 𝐿𝑡−1 ) �                  2
                                                       ��    𝐴     +       𝐿 �.                                                              (A1)

The initial stock effect for valuation changes can, in turn, be written as:
                                           𝑘𝑔𝑡𝐴 +𝑘𝑔𝑡𝐿     1                1         1                         1

All the variables are defined as before 46. The only notable difference is that, to simplify, these
calculations use aggregated exchange rates and returns on assets and liabilities, denoted with subscript
A or L, rather than the asset-class specific A,c or L,c. ER0 denotes the base period exchange rate.

foreign assets and liabilities and the exchange rate impact on different stocks only differs depending on their currency

In line with previous literature we also compute the effect from the foreign currency excess yield and
excess capital gain. These can be decomposed following the “exorbitant privilege” literature (see Habib,
2010) into return and composition effects. To do so, define 𝛼𝑐,𝑡 as the share of a given asset c in a
country’s total assets in period t, and 𝜆𝑐,𝑡 as the share of a given asset c in a country’s total assets in
period t, holding the exchange rates associated with all asset classes fixed.

The third channel, the composition effect, for net investment income and valuation changes is then:

Appendix B: Estimating the impact of global and domestic risk shocks on UK international investment
income and valuation changes

We develop a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) model to identify domestic and global risk
shocks, differentiate them from other fundamental shocks, and study their effects on UK net
international investment income and net valuation changes on its international portfolio. This appendix
summarizes (i) the dataset from which structural shocks are extracted, (ii) the identification of those
shocks, and (iii) the estimation of the model.

Our dataset includes eight macroeconomic and financial variables at quarterly frequency over the period
1997Q1 – 2015Q3. The data and transformations used to construct these are summarized below:


denomination. In reality, it is likely that some asset holdings are hedged against exchange rate movements and the exchange
rate effect is not full, at least in the short run. We are not aware of any data to quantify these hedging effects, but if they are
substantive, the decompositions here might be overestimating the effect of the exchange rate and as a result underestimating
the effects of the foreign currency excess returns.

Using this set of variables, we identify six structural shocks with the short- and long-run zero restrictions
and the sign restrictions shown in Table B1. More specifically, we identify relative supply, demand and
monetary policy shocks, as well as an exchange rate shock and a domestic and global risk shock.

The first three relative shocks are identified primarily through sign restrictions that are standard in the
SVAR literature. In addition, we assume that relative demand and monetary policy shocks cannot affect
long-term relative output. Next, we also use standard sign restrictions to identify an exogenous
exchange rate shock, which also has no effect on relative long-term output. In addition, we assume that
the two uncertainty measures do not react to exchange rate shocks in the short- or the long-run to
exclude any exchange rate movements that are driven by changes in risk captured in the UK and global
uncertainty measures.

To differentiate between the first three fundamental shocks, which can affect uncertainty, and genuine
exogenous increases in risk, we assume that changes in uncertainty driven by the two risk shocks only
lead to changes in relative output with a lag. Finally, to separately identify a UK and a global risk shock,
we assume that global uncertainty is unaffected by higher UK risk and that UK uncertainty does not

increase by more than global uncertainty in response to higher global risk. In addition, an increase in UK
uncertainty leads to a sterling depreciation.

     (iii)    Estimation

We estimate the model using Bayesian methods with standard Minnesota priors 47. We include two lags
of the endogenous variables but impose the short-run restrictions in Table B1 for one period only, i.e. on
the contemporaneous effect of the structural shocks. The combination of sign, short-run and long-run
zero restrictions outlined above is imposed using the algorithm suggested by Rubio-Ramirez et al. (2010)
and extended by Binning (2013) for under-identified models. The historical decompositions and forecast
error variance decomposition results reported in this paper refer to the average values from the final
1,000 repetitions of a Gibbs sampling procedure.




47
  This prior, proposed by Litterman (1986), assumes each variable follows a random walk process and is independent from the
other endogenous variables in the model. The hyperparameter values used here are as follows: λ1=0.2, λ2=0.5, λ3=1,
λ4=10,000.

                                                                                                                         32

Note: The accumulated current account and valuation changes sum up to the NIIP. The accumulated current account comprises the
accumulated trade and primary income balances, as well as the accumulated secondary income balances (not shown here). For each country,
the accumulation of current account and trade balances starts using the first year’s NIIP, while the accumulation of valuation changes and
income begins with a zero initial value. This assumption is necessary in order to decompose the level of the NIIP rather than its change since the
first period.
