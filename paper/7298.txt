Green Taxes and Administrative Costs:
The Case of Carbon Taxation
Sjak Smulders and Herman R.J. Vollebergh
NBER Working Paper No. 7298
August 1999
                                                ABSTRACT

        This paper explores the trade-off between incentive effects and administrative costs associated with
the implementation of various environmental tax instruments, with special reference to carbon taxes. In a
simple model, we show under what conditions it is optimal to use input rather than emission taxes to
internalize environmental externalities. Mixed tax regimes are also studied. If linkage of emissions to inputs
is close, if abatement possibilities are costly, and if administrative costs of emission taxes are high, emission
taxes should not be introduced. It is shown that these conditions directly apply to current tax policies
toward CO2 emissions in several European countries that harness pre-existing energy taxes. First, there is
a one-to-one correspondence between carbon content of energy and CO2 emissions. Second, only few
possibilities exist to abate CO2 emissions separately. Third, “piggy-backing” on existing administration for
energy excises allow to save on administrative costs. Broadening the carbon tax base by removing certain
widely-used exemptions for energy production (and possibly adding emission taxes or abatement subsidies
for selected industries) is likely to increase incentives for carbon reduction without significant additional
administrative costs.

 1. Introduction



 Implementing enviromnental policies -- through standards, tradable permits or
 environmental taxes alike -- is far from costless. For instance, when
                                                                       implementing an
 environmental tax, the tax department has to run a special unit to enforce and collect taxes

 and to monitor compliance. In practice, the costs of implementing environmental policies

 plays a significant role in the choice between different policy options. The proposals of the

 European Commission for a European wide energy/C02-tax provide clear examples

 (Vollebergh, 1995). Instead of proposing a totally new tax on C02-emissions, the European

 Commission employed the close linkage between C02—emissions and the implicit taxation of

carbon by the existing taxes on energy products (which are usually intermediate inputs).

Indeed, using existing instruments rather than introducing new ones to address new policy

areas may save considerably on administrative costs.

      However, just minimization of transaction costs might come at a cost for society. A

strategy based on input taxes, for example, foregoes the gains that are potentially reaped by

a more direct way of taxing the externality through emission taxes. Any deviation from the

principle of taxing externalities at the point where they arise, introduces an incentive to

misallocate resources. Thus a trade-off arises between minnnizing transaction costs and

directly inducing incentive effects. The optimal tax structure has to balance the burden of

complex and expensive-to-run tax systems against the incentives it induces to internalize the

externality that is aimed to be addressed.

     This paper investigates the potential trade-off between administrative costs and
incentives of environmental regulation, in particular if the government aims to reduce CO2
                                               2

 emissions. We analyze how the optimal choice of carbon taxes is affected by the
 administrative cost incurred by the regulator (government). Using a simple model, we

 determine the optimal rates for emission and input taxes in the presence of administrative

 costs and which of these taxes should optimally be introduced. Moreover, we explore and

 interpret the scarce empirical evidence on administrative costs of taxation in the light of

 optimal carbon taxation. As empirical information on the role of implementation cost in the

 design of environmental policy is almost entirely lacking, we concentrate on what factors

 might be expected to determine those costs, based on studies about administrative costs

 outside the environmental policy area.

      Although most formal analysis of environmental regulation ignores administrative

costs, compliance costs, or transaction costs in general, a growing literature takes these

issues seriously (see overview of Krutilla, 1999).1       Several   papers recognize that
administrative costs may be important and rule out the use of emission taxes on these

grounds. It is typically investigated which taxes could best replace or 'approximate'

emission taxes (Smith, 1992). Moreover, under some circumstances other taxes or tax

combinations are even equivalent to perfect emission taxes (that is, emission taxes in a

world without transaction costs). For instance, Xepapadeas (1999) reviews the conditions

under which input taxes and emission taxes are equivalent. Eskeland and Devarajan (1996)

show how the combination of mandated technology and output taxes approaches the ideal

emission tax. Fullerton and Wolverton (1997) propose to combine output taxes and

subsidies on clean goods, or more general two-part instrument systems of a deposit-refund

nature, to replace the monitoring-costly emission tax.

     The implicit assumption in these papers, however, is that emission taxes are
                                               3

 prohibitively costly to administer and that other taxes have negligibly low administrative

 costs. We extend this approach by more explicitly taking into account administrative costs

 of all type of taxes, without assuming beforehand that emission taxes will always be the

 most costly type of tax from the administrative point of view. In particular we allow

 different tax instruments to feature differences in administrative costs, which, in addition,

 are endogenously dependent on the tax rates. Once other taxes as well as emission taxes are

 subject to significant administrative costs, it becomes unlikely that the first-best optimum

 can be reached. Hence, alternative tax systems should be considered that are no longer

equivalent to perfect emission taxes.

      Shortle, Horran and Abler (1998) study to what extent input taxes can approach
perfect emission taxes if not all inputs that directly affect emissions can be taxed. We

extend their analysis by explicitly taking into account administrative costs and allowing for

the simultaneous use of emission and input taxes. We find that a mixed tax system might be

(second-best) optimal. Schmutzler and Goulder (1997) arrive at a similar result in a model

of mixed output and emission taxation that incorporates monitoring. We complement their

analysis by investigating input taxation and by exploring in more detail how optimal tax

rates in the presence of administative costs differ from Pigouvian taxes. Administrative

costs in our model mainly represent costs stemming from monitoring, and thus our paper is

related to the literature on monitoring and enforcement of environmental policy (see Cohen

1998 for a survey). As we are primarily interested in optimal taxation rather than optimal

monitoring, we do not model monitoring in an explicit way.

     The theoretical part of this chapter is also closely related to the chapter by Fullerton,

Hong and Metcalf (1999) in this volume. The two chapters complement each other in
                                               4
 various respects. Both chapters compare ideal emission taxes with alternative taxation, but

 differ with respect to the production structure and the government budget constraint. First,

 Fullerton et al. analyse a model in which there is a on-to-one correspondance between input

 use and emissions. Input taxes and emission taxes are therefore equivalent, but output taxes

 provide an (imperfect) substitute form of taxation. In contrast, our model separates input

 use from emissions, and considers abatement explicitly. Accordingly, we allow for three

ways to reduce pollution, viz, output reduction, input reduction and abatement. We study

input taxation as an (imperfect) substitute for emission taxes. Second, whereas Fullerton at

al. consider a second-best world with a distortionary labor tax for revenue-raising purposes,

the second-best nature of policies considered here arises because of administrative costs.

Thus, the present chapter abstracts from tax-interaction effects due to recycling effects.

      The structure of our paper is as follows. First, we explain the nature of the trade-off

involved if the implementation cost of corrective taxes, in particular administrative costs,

are considered explicitly. Second, we analyze a stylized model that incorporates both
emission and input taxes to sort out critical determinants that shape this trade-off. Finally,

we evaluate both explicit and implicit carbon taxation in OECD countries in terms of the

trade-off and suggest some opportunities for welfare improving carbon tax policies. Note in

advance, that taxing carbon inputs is not equivalent to taxing CO2 emissions as is

sometimes suggested. Although a close linkage exist between the carbon content of energy

products and C02-emissions, this is not a fixed chemo-technological relationship as several

opportunities for carbon abatement or removal exist (Holloway et.al., 1996).



2. The trade-off between incentives and administrative costs
                                               5

 In this section we argue that the administrative cost argument per se is not sufficient to rule

 out the implementation of emission taxes. In the presence of administrative costs, the costs

 and benefits associated with each specific type of tax should be compared. First, we

 hypothesize which factors influence the shape of the administrative cost curve. Next, we

 show why administrative cost introduce such a general trade-off between cost and benefits

 of different implementation strategies. We also develop some useful terminology.



2.1. Administrative costs



We defme transaction costs as the costs associated with the tax assessment, collection and

enforcement, and all other costs incurred by any party to enable, faciliate, and ensure

transactions from tax payers to tax authorities (Vollebergh, 1995). An alternative term that

we will use is implementation costs. The terms include ex-ante costs (e.g. cost of exclusion)

and ex-post costs (e.g. monitoring cost). It is conmion to categorize these costs further into

cost for the government (tax receiver), or administrative cost, to handle forms and enforce

compliance, and the cost for the tax liable agent (tax payer), or compliance cost, to carry

out the obligations of calculating and paying the tax (see Sandford et al. 1989). In our

analysis we concentrate on administrative cost.2

     Administrative costs of a particular tax are closely related to the base to which the tax

is applied. The tax base usually varies with the type of tax. For example, an emission tax

taxes physical volumes of hazardous substances, while an input tax taxes such substances

indirectly, for instance through its use as (intermediate) inputs. In turn, these differences

induce both tax authorities and tax payers to set up and maintain different systems for
                                               6
 collecting and processing information about the tax, that is, to record how much is emitted

 or how much input is used, in order to be able to calculate total tax payments due.



      One important characteristic of the tax base that determines (differences in)

administrative costs is the number of agents liable to the tax. A large number of taxable

legal units implies a large implementation cost for the tax agency since each unit requires

separate treatment. Taxing a particular pollutant that is emitted by many producers may be

associated with large administrative costs. Taxing the inputs from which the pollutant arises

as a by-product may be associated with significantly lower administrative costs. For

instance, inputs need no longer be taxed at the points of consumption, but can also be taxed

at the point of delivery, such as gas stations or distributors of electricity. Hence, switching

from emissions to inputs as the tax base could change administrative costs.

      Note that the difference in administrative costs is independent of the induced

regulatory effect. It is a difference in the fixed cost component of administrative cost. This

regards the set-up cost and part of the cost to run the information system. Each liable unit

submits its own tax form. The cost of processing forms depends on the number of forms

rather than the tax amount due. Nevertheless, this still leaves the possibility of economies

of scale for a given type of tax. If the tax base can be broadened across a larger number of

tax payers, the overall administrative cost per tax payer   can be reduced. A s e c o n d
important determinant of administrative costs is measurability of the base. In most cases

emission levels are likely to be more difficult to measure, report and record than input or

output levels. Heterogeneity across industries and their technologies compounds to the

complexity of a tax system. For instance, a tax base in terms of weighted units of
                                               7
 measurement, rather than in terms of a single unit, may be expected to create higher
 administrative costs if firms use highly firm-specific technologies. One well-known

 example is NOR-emissions from road transportation which depends on vehicle type,

 equipment, fuel type, driving patterns, etc. (see also Hoel, 1998, p.89).



Administrative costs are also likely to vary with the tax rates and the revenue raised. The

possibility of evasion by tax payers asks for monitoring expenditures by regulators. The

remark by Fullerton (1995, p.7) that many of the administrative costs "are 'fixed' costs of

calculating the tax base, not marginal costs of collecting more revenue by raising the rate of

tax on a given tax base" seem to call for a qualification in this respect. The larger is the tax

bill, the larger are the incentives to evade tax payment and the more attractive it is for the

regulator to spend resource to reduce tax evasion.

      Regulators usually have various strategies for monitoring and need to sort out the

efficient choice of monitoring levels and techniques. A large literature on monitoring and

enforcement studies this policy in detail (Cohen 1998). Here, we do not need to dig into

this level of detail. With respect to environmental monitoring, we can safely assume that

when the optimal mix of monitoring instruments is chosen, total cost of monitoring is

increasing in the extent to which stochastic elements determine actual pollution, in the

number of polluters, the variety of production and abatement techniques used, and in the

difficulty of measuring emissions.

     To sum up, no general shape can be assumed cx ante for different type of taxes.

However, it seems fruitful to assume that both fixed and variable costs (varying with the tax

rate) play a significant role. Both in theory and practice, we need a case-by-case approach
                                               8

 to study the nature and implications of administrative costs.



 2.2. The role of linkage



 Efficiency of instruments to reach a certain policy goal is usually defined in terms of the

extent to which the instrument increases social welfare. The most efficient instrument to hit

a given target has the smallest gross welfare cost, where gross welfare cost3 refers to the

change in welfare apart from that arising from the reduction in the externality .

      In a first-best world without transaction costs, different instruments can be ranked in

terms of efficiency by investigating their effect on private welfare. Things become more

complicated in a world with transaction costs as both administrative cost and the linkage

between regulatory aim, emission reduction, and the type of tax used to regulate play a role

(Smith, 1992). First of all, different type of taxes usually differ with respect to the

directness of the incentive they provide to reducing emissions (assuming emission reduction

reflects the goal of the government). Less direct taxation of the marginal damages caused

by an individual pollutor causes an efficiency loss but may lower administrative costs.

Furthermore, different instruments not only differently distort private welfare directly, but

also indirectly through their implications for transaction costs. The usual gross welfare cost

of taxation has to be supplemented by the transaction cost of the tax.

      Before turning to how welfare analysis of environmental taxation is influenced by

transaction cost, it is useful to clarify and precisize our terminology. We explicitly separate

out the transaction costs from the total change in welfare associated with the use of a certain

(tax) instrument. Hence, in our case of environmental taxation, we distinguish (i)
                                                 9

administrative (transaction) costs, (ii) the welfare gain from an improvement in the

environment, (iii) the "residual" welfare change, that is the gross welfare cost ignoring

transaction costs. The latter component will be called "private gross welfare cost" •6 Au

instrument that has relatively low private gross welfare costs is called relatively privately

efficient. Of course, in a world without transaction costs, efficiency just coincides with this

notion of private efficiency, since gross welfare costs do not contain transaction costs.

      Thus, the relative efficiency of different type of taxes can be measured with the

following formula:



      U= Y-T--D(E)                                                                             (1)



where U is social welfare of the representative agent, V is gross private welfare, T is the

welfare loss due to transaction (administrative) costs, and D is the damage from pollution.

Let t1 and t2 be two different tax regimes that yield the same aggregate emissions: E(t1) =

E(t2). The private costs of t1 are lower than those of t2   if: Y(t1) >   Y(t2).

      We do not need to discuss extensively the determinants of "private efficiency" here,

since they are well-known from analyses without transaction costs. For example, the

efficiency of a tax to internalize pollution externalities is larger if the individual's tax bill is

more directly linked to the externality. Hence emission taxes are more (privately) efficient

than input taxes. Also, efficiency requires that the effective tax rate on marginal
contributions to damage (D) is equal across pollutors. Hence, an emission tax that applies to

all polluters is (privately) more efficient than an emission tax with exemptions or a non-

uniform emission tax.
                                               10

      As noted in the introduction, it is often argued that emission taxes are too costly to

 implement and that administrative costs provide a basic motivation for other (tax)

solutions.7 However, instead of simply assuming that such a shift away from emission taxes

is optimal, we aim at explicitly deriving such a conclusion within a comprehensive welfare

framework. A first step in this direction has been taken by McKay, Pearson and Smith's

(1990) who hypothesize that a clear trade-off exists between shifts in the tax system to save

on transaction costs on the one hand, and tax reforms that harness incentives and promote

(private) efficiency, on the other hand. They assume that regulation that is linked less

directly to the externality indeed saves on administrative costs, but that it comes at a cost

for society by distoring private decisions more.

      Figure 1 illustrates. The horizontal axis measures different tax systems with respect to

the directness with which they address incentives to reduce damage. For example, an

emission tax ranks high, an input tax ranks low. Taxes on different inputs rank differently,

depending on the closeness of the linkage between input use and emissions subject to

regulation. The vertical axis measures two components of utility. The figure compares a

continuum of different tax systems. It is assumed that all of them yield the same level of

damage D by appropriate choice of tax rates. The two curves represent the other two

components of overall utility, transaction costs T and private utility Y, for each of the tax

systems. Administrative costs T increase when taxation is better linked to emissions. The

idea behind this is that more direct taxation implies less links to already existing procedures

of the existing tax system. The (private) utility loss Y also increases with the linkage of

taxation to emissions. The more direct taxation is, the larger (private) utility is for a given

level of emissions.
                                             11

                                     INSERT Figure 1



The optimal tax system balances transaction costs and efficiency. In the figure, welfare is

maximized by choosing an indirect tax that corresponds to points A and B. The complete

switch to emission taxes is too costly: the associated increase in administrative costs would

outweigh the gains from having a more direct tax with better incentives.

     Figure 1 is hypothetical and suggestive. As noted before, we have to assess different

tax proposals case-by-case. For example, if marginal administrative costs increase only

slowly, emission taxes may be optimal despite the presence of administrative costs.

Moreover, it is not guaranteed at all that the curves T and Y have nice convex and concave

shapes respectively. Smulders and Vollebergh (1998), for instance, represent the linkage to

pollution by the fraction of (symmetric) sectors that is liable to an emission tax, and fmd in

a very simple setting that the Y curve first declines and then increases. In general,

administrative costs introduce non-convexities because of their fixed-cost nature, and the

conventional marginal approach to optimal taxation has to be extended.

     Administrative costs have many dimensions. The government may affect
administrative costs by varying the number of firms or sectors subject to the tax, the tax

rates chosen for input and emission taxes, accuracy of measurability aimed for, and

enforcement spending to reduce the (probability of) tax evasion, and so on. Each of these

dimensions can be measured along the horizontal axis in a figure similar to Figure 1.

Needless to say, each of these factors directly influences the overall welfare effect of

implementing environmental taxes.

     Not only the multi-dimensionality of administrative costs makes the simple diagram of
                                             12

Figure 1 problematic. As Feldstein has pointed out long ago (Feldstein, 1976), a careful

distinction should be made between the design of a tax system de novo and the reform of an

existing tax system. This is true for its associated administrative system as well. Indeed, in

practice every tax reform starts from a given tax and administrative system inherited from

the past. This system determines the (short run) scope for welfare improving tax reform at

low administrative cost (Smith, 1992; Vollebergh, 1995).

     For instance, increasing existing taxes, rather than introducing new taxes might save

on the "fixed costs" of administration and therefore on total administrative costs. Such

economies of scale and scope are also attractive to exploit when designing enviromnental

taxes. Levying environmentally motivated taxes on a base that is already taxed for other

purposes, rather than introducing an entirely new emission tax, would certainly save on

administrative costs. Furthermore, also economies of scope with the administrative system

used for other regulatory instruments may arise. When implementing environmental taxes,

the regulator could benefit from experience in related administrative procedures for

operations already undertaken. Like Smith (1992), we label this use of existing

administrative procedures and experience for new purposes "piggy-backing".



3. Critical determinants shaping the trade-off



This section develops a simple model along the lines of Kaplow (1990) and Shortle, Horran

and Abler (1998) to compare emission taxes and input taxes in the presence of
administrative costs. The aim of the regulator is to correct externalities from pollution. The

presence of administrative costs implies that the regulator should deviate from the first-best
                                              13

Pigouvian tax. Hence, administrative costs in itself cause policies to be second best. We

abstract from other second-best issues. In particular, we assume that lump-sum taxes and

transfers are available to the government, so that there is no revenue requirement that

affects tax rates and we can ignore labour taxes.8



3.1. The model



We assume a given number of heterogenous sectors, indexed i. Production of one unit of

fmal output q. requires labour I, and a single homogenous intermediate input x (in amount

xj. Moreover, firms can spend labour services on abatement a, which reduces emissions

per unit of output e•. The minimum labour requirement per unit of output equals 1(x1).

Labour and inputs are substitutes: I, '3i,Ix1 <0. Emissions per unit of output depend

negatively on abatement effort and positively on inputs: e1(a,x1) with e7, 'ae1Iaa <0 and

   'ae,/ax1>
      Final good producers face a (sector-specific) emission tax and a (per unit) input tax

(tfl). Perfect    competition prevails, and firms take the output price P as given. They
maximize profits by choosing output, abatement and input levels. We normalize the wage to

unity. The first order conditions can be written as:



      p1 =   I,   + a1 +   e•   (p + t1)x1,                                            (2)



       1   (—eaj')c and           waloe,'°                                             (3)
                                            14

        + t + r1e '     — l' and       waloe.                                           (4)



Equation (2) says that price equals cost which in turn equals labour cost for production,

labour cost for abatement, and taxes due per unit of output. Condition (3) states that with

positive abatement levels, the marginal cost of abatement (on the left-hand side) equals the

marginal benefits in the form of reduces emission tax payments (on the right-hand side).

Condition (4) equates the marginal cost to the marginal benefits of input use. Marginal

input costs consist of price of the input p, the sector-specific input tax t and the induced

additional emission tax payments. Marginal benefits consists of the labour saving in

production.

     The intermediate good is produced with labour only and subject to constant returns to

scale. We choose units such that one unit of labour produces one unit of the intermediate.

For simplicity we assume that the production of the intermediate input is non-polluting (but

this can be easily modified in a way that is completely analogous to pollution in the final

goods sector). Intermediate good producers face a price p which they take as given. Hence,

their first order condition for profit maximization simply states that the price equals the

wage which is normalized to one:



                                                                                         (5)



Equilibrium in the market for the input requires:11



      X=x1q1
                                               15

where X is total supply of the intermediate good.

     We impose a very simple demand structure by choosing a quasi-linear utility function

with no cross-demand effects, and where the opportunity cost of labour is constant (and

normalized to one). The utility function is:



      U = u(q1) + 1 - D(E)                                                                (6)



where l is leisure, D is damage from emissions, and E is aggregate emissions defined as



     E=                                                                                   (7)



Consumers take prices and emissions as given and maximize utility, subject to their budget

constraint p1q1 =L —10+Z, where Z are transfers from the government. The first order

conditions read:



                                                                                          (8)



The government collects tax revenue, pays civil servants for the tax administration (I) and

rebates the remainder of tax revenue to households in a lump-sum fashion (Z). The tax

administration employs T units of labour at wage w =1. The required administrative costs

are sector-specific and depend on sectoral taxes and output levels.12



      T=   F1(I, Ia,) + V( z, t, q)                                                       (9)
                                              16

where F represents the fixed cost of the tax system, and V represents the administrative

costs varying with the size of the rates and bases of the tax system. Fixed costs are

determined only by certain taxes being implemented or not. This is modeled by the

dependence of F on indicator functions ) each of which takes a value 1 if tax t'(e.g.     is

positive and a value zero if the tax is zero. The natural restrictions we impose are sign %'

= sign f for any tax t that is both taxes and subsidies are costly to implement, and

V(0,0,q1) = 0, that is, all fixed costs are excluded from VQ.

     The labour market clears. Labour endowment is fixed and given by L. Hence, we

write:



     L=     l + (l+a+x1)q1 + T                                                          (10)



Substituting (7) and (10) into (6), we may write utility as:



         U = u1(q1) + L - (1+a1+x1)q1 - T - DQeq)                                       (11)



Totally differentiating utility, and substituting the first order conditions for firms' and

households' maximization problems (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8), we obtain:



         dU =             dT   -    (D' - r,)dE,                                        (12)




where E—eq is total emissions in sector i and Xx1q1 is total input use in sector i. Equation

(12) shows the welfare impacts associated with changes in input demands, transaction costs,
                                              17

and environmental quality. The first term on the right-hand side of (12) stand for the

distortionary effect of excises on the goods market associated with input taxes. The last

term reveals that a reduction in emissions ceteris paribus improves utility as long as the

marginal damage is larger that the emission tax.



3.2. Optimal taxation



We can rewrite (12) so as to separate the three components of welfare as in (1):




      dU=> [1dE1+t1dx,]—dT-D"dE                                                           (13)




Equation (13) categorizes the welfare effect of any policy in the three components

mentioned in section 2.2. The bracketed term on the right-hand side is the private gross

welfare effect of the policy (in line with (1) to be denoted by dl'), dT is the transaction cost

of the policy, and -D 'dE=-dD is the environmental welfare gain. Note that the private

gross welfare cost is a tax base effect. The change in each tax base times the tax rate

corresponding to that tax base together determine this effect.'3

      In the presence of administrative costs, a necessary condition for optimality of the tax

system is that the expression in (13) is zero. The government maximizes welfare, taking as

given the reactions of households and firms to changes in taxes. It faces a two-stage

decision problem: i) deciding which taxes to use (tax base decision), and ii) setting the

appropriate tax level (tax rate decision).

      Concerning the tax rate decision, we find conditions for optimal taxation by rewriting
                                             18

(12) in terms of the total derivatives with respect to each of the taxes, and setting these

expressions equal to zero.14 For any tax (this condition reads:




      dU             dx.   dT - (D'-t.)__L   dE.
            =      t .—. - —                            0     A             0

                                                                        =




                                                            waloe                        (14)



Equation (14) guides the tax rate decision, conditional on the tax being implemented.

     Concerning the tax base decision, the regulator should compare utility levels

associated with any combination of taxes implemented at the rate implied by (14). The

optimal tax system may include non-zero taxes, set at the level implied by (14), as well as

zero taxes, that is, taxes that are not implemented. For the latter taxes, equation (14) may

be violated, that is, utility may marginally increase in this tax. Yet it is optimal not to

implement these taxes. The reason is that, by construction, in an optimally designed tax

system, setting any tax belonging to the latter catagory at the level implied by (14) -- and

adjusting all non-zero tax rates such that they satisfy (14) --     decreases   welfare (non-

marginally) because of fixed administrative costs. Similarly, in an optimally designed tax

system, switching the rate of any non-zero tax from the rate implied by (14) to a zero rate --

and adjusting all other non-zero taxes such that they satisfy (14) -- decreases welfare (non-

marginally). Since fixed administrative costs play a role, the tax base decision is subject to

non-convexities and no simple "smootht' optimality condition can be written down.

      Instead of optimizing the overall tax system, a more practical issue is to find a welfare
                                               19

improving tax reform. Such an approach takes account of the fact that actual changes of the

tax system are usually slow and piecemeal due to the role of the existing tax system

(Feldstein 1976), and, as we like to add, its associated administrative costs. A change in an

existing tax system is worth pursuing if this change entails an increase in welfare even if

not the maximum level of welfare is reached. In particular, we are interested in the welfare

effects of the introduction of a new tax, if some taxes already exist (as well as their

associated tax administration). The obvious rule for a welfare-improving introduction of a

new tax is that the net welfare gain from exploiting the newly introduced tax should exceed

the fixed cost of introducing the tax. For any tax t this condition can be written as:'5




         = j'O     f [ f_dI
                         dt
                                      ]    F                                               (15)




where tv is the level of the tax that corresponds to (14) (that is the solution to dU/c=O, or

the corner solution 0), F dTIdI(t) is the 'fixed cost" (set-up administrative cost) associated

with introducing tax 1, t' is the (second-best) optimal tax rate,16 and we evaluate all total

derivatives taking into account changes in other taxes so as to satisfy (14) for all other

taxes.

      As a benchmark, consider the (first-best) case without transaction costs, i.e.
T=dT=0. As is well-known, the optimal emission tax then equals the marginal damage D'

in each sector and all other taxes should be zero.'7 This can be immediately seen from (12).

Indeed (14) is satisfied for these tax rates. Under the usual conditions on utility and
                                              20

production functions, the tax base optimality condition is automatically met since fixed

costs do not play a role and the maximization problem is convex. Starting from a situation

without any taxes, introducing the emission tax improves welfare.18

     The first-best outcome may be realized in some special cases even if transaction costs

play a role. Obviously, if transaction costs are associated with other taxes, but not to

emission taxes, the Pigouvian tax should still be implemented. The other way around, if

transaction costs apply to emission taxes only, and other taxes can be implemented without

such costs, a first-best outcome may arise provided that other taxes (or tax combinations)

are equivalent to emission taxes with respect to their incentive effects ("private efficiency").

For example, if the emission input ratio is fixed, an input tax can bring about the first best

outcome.19

     A second-best situation arises when other taxes also involve transaction costs or when

other instruments are privately less efficient than emission taxes. Once transaction costs

play a role, it is no longer guaranteed that emission taxes should be uniform, nor that

output or input taxes should be excluded. Most of the literature on second-best optimal

environmental taxation concentrates on cases in which other taxes (taxes on output or

inputs) can replace emission taxes without loss of incentives and without administrative

costs (see, for example, the double dividend literature, De Mooij 1999).

      If administrative costs are mentioned as a reason not to use emission taxes, the most

common case in the literature is the one where emission taxes are too costly to be

implemented because of transaction costs associated with emission taxes but not with other

taxes (the most discussed case is non-point pollution, see Xepapadeas 1999). Our model

allows for more subtle impacts of administrative costs by considering administrative costs
                                             21

throughout the entire tax system and taking into account that administrative costs may

endogenously vary with tax rates. To investigate these in more detail, we consider some

special cases.



3.3. Pure emission taxes



Let us first focus on emission taxes by considering the case where all other taxes are ruled

out. Note that we caimot simply suppose that only emission taxes are used, but that we have

to explain whithin the model why this is so. We will give this explanation in the next

subsection and concentrate here on the optimality conditions for emission taxes only.

      Evaluating (14) for an emission tax in sector i, we find that the following optimality

conditions should hold:



       dU                           dE.
              =   — dT
                    — — (D"—t)—--—           0    A   t. 0       waloe                  (16)
       dt.          dt.            ' dt.
          I           1                1




Hence, if implemented, the optimal emission tax reads:



                                   d T/d.
          =   max { 0 ,   D'   —
                                                                                        (17)
                                   —dE./dt




This tax should be implemented if the total welfare gain exceeds the fixed administrative
                                                          22

cost, see (15). We approximate the welfare gain by a second order Taylor expansion,
evaluated at       z°. The optimal tax            is given by



                        1       dE.                        dT.
            =     if        —     1 (TO)2 +           +          F.

                                                                                              (18)

where TiE and          are the positively-defined elasticities of dE/d r and dT/d i with respect to




Conditions (17) and (18) reveal two cases in which it is optimal not to use emission taxes in

a particular sector because of administrative costs. The first case is the case in which the

fixed costs of administering the tax are large relative to the total potential gains, see (18).

The gains are small indeed if emissions are insensitive to the emission tax, that is, if

abatement and changes in the input mix are expensive (dE1/d small), if the marginal

damage (D) is small, and if marginal administrative costs (dT/d z) are large.2° A second

case in which a sector should be optimally exempted from an emission tax is the case that

marginal administrative costs for the sector are relatively large, such that, for any small

increase in the sector-specific emission tax, higher administrative costs more than offset

gains from the induced emissions reduction (dU/d <0 for any z so that rf—O).

      Figure 2 illustrates the case of emission taxes in terms of the trade-off between
                                             23

efficiency and administrative costs (see section 2). Private gross welfare, Y, is maximized

for zero emission taxes, since -- loosely speaking -- emission taxes impede free market

forces. However, they reduce damage D and hence improve social welfare. In a first-best

world without administrative costs, the Pigouvian tax        maximizes welfare Y-D. In the

presence of administrative costs T, the gross welfare cost of emission taxation (that is, the

effect on U—D) is higher and rises more steeply with tax rates. The (second-best) optimal

tax maximizes Y-T-D and it can be easily seen that this tax is below the first-best tax. In

panel b of Figure 2, transaction costs rise steeply with the tax rate and the fixed cost

component is large. As a result the second-best optimal emission tax is zero.



                                     INSERT Figure 2



How emission taxes should be optimally differentiated across sectors is also revealed by

condition (17), conditional on being implemented. Note that the optimal tax equals marginal

damage minus a correction term that is proportional to marginal administrative costs. The

optimal tax equals the Pigouvian tax if marginal administrative costs are zero (dT/dç=O).

The gap between optimal taxes and the Pigouvian tax widens if administrative costs rise

steeply with tax levels and if emissions are not very sensitive to emission taxation. The

latter may arise because of a low elasticity of demand (it is hard to accomplish emission

reductions by cutting demand) or because the emission intensity is not very sensitive to

emission tax changes (steeply rising abatement and input substitution costs). To clarify this,

we decompose the emissions reduction effect of the tax, that emerges as the denominator in

(17), into these three effects:

that is, E represents the effect of emission taxes on emiss ons through changes in demand, a

measures the direct effect of emission taxation on emissions through abatement, and A

measures the analogous effect through input reduction (the reason to separate        and A

becomes clear in the next subsection).

     So far, we have assumed that administrative costs rise with tax rates because
                                                     25

incentives to evade increase with the tax rate, thus raising the cost for the tax authority to

administer the tax. The opposite, however, is possible as well. Using a partial-equilibrium

model, Polinsky and Shavell (1982) find that the optimal emission tax in the presence of

administrative costs may be larger than the Pigouvian tax. The argument is that a higher

emission tax saves on transaction costs if administrative costs depend on the number of tax

paying finns and if an increase in the emission tax reduces market demand and the number

of firms. In our set-up the number of firms is indeterminate because of the constant returns

to scale production functions, but the equation immediately shows that Polinsky and

Shavell's result also applies here if administrative costs decrease with the tax rate, that is if

dT/d<O.


3.4. Input taxes: the role of linkage



To investigate the trade-off between emission taxes and input taxes, we first consider

sector-specific taxes on emissions (z) and on the use of input x (ç,). Evaluating (14) for

these taxes, we find:2'

Note that         measures the direct effect of input taxation on emissions,22 X measures the

elasticity of the emission function with respect to input use, and 3 measures how much

input use is more sensitive to input taxation than to emission taxes.

     According to (24), input taxes can serve as environmental taxes and reduce the need

for explicit emission taxes. Note that the first two tenns are the same as in (17) after

substitution of (19). The smaller is the direct emission tax effect      A. + c = — dE/d r; the

larger is not only the effect of marginal administrative costs on optimal emission taxes, but

also the larger is the scope for input taxes to replace emission taxes as appears from the

third term in (24). Indeed, with high marginal administrative costs of emission taxes, input

taxes only should be used as environmental tax and should be set according to (25) with

z=O, which can be written as:




             - dE./dt.Xl D'—
             —        I
                                      dT/dt.Xl
                                                                                          27

                                        I xi




Note that inputs should then be taxed according to their marginal emission content dE1/dX,

times marginal damage D 'corrected for administrative costs as a result of changes in input
                                                 27

use. (Of course we must make the provision that in the presence of large fixed
administrative costs, such that (15) is violated for t,, the input tax should not be
implemented.)

     Replacing emission taxes by input taxes reduces efficiency. Input taxes distort the

input mix and fail to provide direct incentives for abatement. Only if the input to emission

ratio is constant and there are no abatement possibilities, then input taxation and emission

taxation are equivalent in the absence of transaction costs. This corresponds to e./x, =

constant, A =       =1, and a =0. With an interior solution, conditions (24) and (25) can then

be rewritten as:

With a fixed emission input ratio, input and emission taxes would be equivalent in the

absence of administrative costs (as is well-known, see e.g. Xepapadeas 1999). Indeed,

according to (25), with zero marginal administrative costs, any combination of taxes such

that z+tx/e1=D 'would achieve the first best optimum. This implies that the two taxes are

equally efficient in terms of the sum of gross private welfare and the enviromnental benefit

(see section 2). Hence, transaction costs considerations entirely determine the choice
between the two taxes.

     Differences in (fixed and/or variable) administrative costs across tax instruments

remove the indeterminacy in the optimal tax choice. First, if fixed administrative costs

differ across the two taxes but administrative costs are not affected by tax rate levels, to
                                                     28

satisfy   the "entry-condition" only the tax with lowest fixed administrative cost should be

introduced, either              or t,x1/e=D'. Note that the effective tax on pollution equals

marginal damage (the Pigouvian tax). Second, when both tax rates increase administrative

costs, the effective tax on pollution (z + tx/e) should be smaller than marginal damage D'.

When, in addition, the sum of fixed costs of administration for the two taxes are sufficiently

small to justify the introduction of both taxes, the taxes should be set so as to minimise

variable administrative costs, as appears from the second equality in (26).

      In the general case of variable and sector-specific emissions per unit of input, input

taxes are less efficient than emission taxes. Hence, if at the same time administrative costs

for emission taxes are higher, efficiency and administrative costs may be optimally traded

off by choosing a mixed system of input and emission taxes. Solving (24) and (25) for an

interior solution, and for simplicity assuming that abatement and input use separately affect

emission (e"=O so that =1/?.), we obtain:

4 measures the "efficiency edge" of emission taxes over input taxes. Indeed with a constant
emission input ratio (a=O and ?= 1), we have i0, and (29)-(30) collapse to (28). The

efficiency edge of emission taxes increases in abatement possibilities c and in I A— 1 . We

call this latter expression the extent of linkage between emissions and inputs. The closer is

the elasticity of emissions with respect to inputs (A) to unity, the closer is the
correspondence between inputs and emissions and the more efficiently can input taxes

mimic emission taxes. Equations (29) and (30) reveal that marginal administrative costs are

less important to determine the optimal tax rates if the efficiency of emission taxes relative

to input taxes () is larger, i.e. if the more abatement possibilities abound (c larger) and
emissions are more closely linked to inputs (A closer to one).



3.5 Conclusions



To internalize environmental externalities in the presence of administrative costs, pure

emission taxes are optimal only under specific conditions. These conditions include (i) low

fixed administrative costs, (ii) not too steeply rising administrative costs (as a result of

increases in emission taxes) relative to marginal damage and direct emission reduction

effect of emission taxes, and (iii) relatively low incentives effects from alternative

environmental taxes (taxes on polluting inputs) to reduce emissions. The optimal second

best rate of emission taxes falls short of marginal damage.

     Input taxes may serve indeed serve as (optimal) environmental taxes. With close

linkage between input use and emissions, and if abatement of emissions (as an alternative

means to reduce the pollution intensity of production besides changing the input mix) is
                                              30

relatively costly, taxes on polluting inputs may supplement emission taxes that fall short of

marginal damage to internalize pollution externalities more fully. In this case a mixed

system of emission taxes and input taxes is optimal, essentially because it saves on

administrative costs with only moderately affecting incentives to reduce emission. If linkage

is close and abatement expensive, and if also administrative costs associated with input

taxation are sufficiently low relative to administrative costs associated with emission

taxation, input taxes should fully replace emission taxes.



4. Carbon taxation and administrative costs



In this section we assess existing and potential environmental taxes relevant for climate

change policy, in particular through carbon taxation. We argue that current policy
(proposals) can be substantially improved if the trade-off between incentive regulation and

administrative costs is explicitly taken into account. We concentrate on the explicit carbon

taxes introduced in a number of European countries since the beginning of the 1990s. We

first review relevant facts on existing carbon taxes, then present evidence on administrative

costs, next assess current carbon taxes, and, finally, discuss scope for improvement.



4.1 Carbon taxes in practice



Since the early 1990s, taxes are considered seriously to combat climate change, in

particular carbon taxes that would curb C02-emissions (e.g. Pearce, 1991; Cnossen and

Vollebergh, 1992; Poterba, 1992). The debate in Europe was strongly influenced by a
                                             31

proposal of the European Commission (see COM(92)226) for a hybrid EU-tax on

energy/CO2 to be implemented at the European level. The basic idea behind this proposal is

to bring the (minimum) rate structure more in accordance with the carbon content across

currently taxed energy products, mainly hydrocarbon fuels, as well as to extend the carbon

tax base to energy products that are not yet subject to an excise. The same idea is also

behind the carbon taxes actually implemented in several European countries.



                                     INSERT Table 1



Thus the aim is to raise the implicit taxation of carbon at the margin. As is well-known CO2

emitted per kind of fuel differs considerably (see Table 1). Clearly, oil emits less carbon

than coal does. Natural gas, in turn, is cleaner than oil. The obvious implication is that

emission intensities also can be reduced by internalizing the respective carbon contents in

the price of each kind of fossil fuel. By differentiating the fossil fuel excise by carbon

emission coefficient instead of energy content coefficient, or even a hybrid coefficient, the

consumption of carbon is put at a disadvantage at the margin. Thus, users would be

induced to substitute oil for coal and natural gas for coal and oil, and, further, nonfossil

fuels for fossil fuels.

      However, the EU proposal was never implemented due to considerable resistance of

industry and specific countries like the UK. Despite this failure to implement an EU-wide

carbon tax, several individual European countries have introduced explicit carbon taxes (see

also Table 2). Finland, at that time not a Member State, was the first country to impose a

C02-tax in 1990. This environmental tax is additional to an excise tax (basic duty) and
                                             32

calculated according to the carbon and energy content of the energy products. Furthermore,

it is imposed on primary energy inputs, including heavy fuel oil, LPG, coal and natural

gas.



                                       INSERT Table 2



Other Nordic countries followed soon: Norway and Sweden in 1991, and Denmark in

1992. The C02-tax in Norway affects the use of mineral oils, coal, natural gas and

petroleum on the continental shelf. Interestingly, CO2 tax rates differ between these

products with petroleum and natural gas (sic!) taxed most heavily (per unit C02) and heavy

fuel oil and coal at a much lower level. Also electricity production and consumption is

taxed. The CO2 tax of Sweden applies to primary energy inputs, such as natural gas and

coal, but also includes heavy fuel oil and gas oil. The Danish tax is levied on all energy

products with the exception of petrol and amounts to a tax rate reform from $/liter to $/unit

carbon. A tax reform in 1996 explicitly distinguishes energy consumption in industry

according to categories of room heating, light processes and heavy processes with tax rates

varying accordingly.

       The Netherlands already have an environmental tax on fuels (hydrocarbon oils) since

1988, with the C02-component added in 1990. However, only the regulatory tax on energy

from 1996 was specifically aimed to achieve carbon emission reduction by households and

small firms. The tax base included primary energy products while the tax rates correspond

to the proposed C02-energy tax of the EU. Also Austria imposed an energy tax on
electricity and natural gas in 1996.
                                               33

      In a recent analysis of these carbon taxes, Ekins and Speck (1999) show how

exemptions for industry are used to provide considerable tax relief for certain sectors facing

considerable 'competitive pressure'. Tax relief is usually established by applying lower or

zero carbon tax rates or systems of rebate for specific industries which use these products

as inputs (often in addition to exemptions already provided for already existing energy

excises). Sometimes a maximum is set to the tax liability for specific energy-intensive

industries, like the steel industry, usually in terms of a percentage of sales value (this

provision was also envisaged in the hybrid EU-tax). Finally, improvements in energy-

efficiency are promoted by explicitly targeted tax reliefs. As a result, nominal and effective

tax rates for specific industries tend to differ considerably.



                                       INSERT Table 3



Table 3 shows for several energy products that both Sweden, Denmark and Norway apply

much lower effective rates for specific industries. Only Finland does not apply lower rates,

although this heavily debated now. Furthermore, it is remarkable that considerable

differences exist in tax rates per ton CO2 across energy products, especially in Norway.

Norway, like Finland, exempts LPG, while coal and natural gas are taxed (much) more

heavily than is oil.

      The carbon taxes in the Nordic countries are quite similar to the original proposal for

a common carbon tax within the EU jurisdiction (see COM(92)226 and its evaluation by

Smith and Vollebergh, 1993). This tax is aimed to lower the use of fossil fuels in

proportion to their carbon content. The European carbonlenergy tax, the first explicit
                                             34

uniform Union-wide tax, was proposed as an additional tax on top of the (non) existing

taxes. Since the tax base would include several energy products that were not subject to tax

before, the proposal also broadens the tax base of current energy taxes. Thus, an incentive

would be provided for industry and consumers to reduce their use of carbon-based energy,

and hence for CO2 emissions to be reduced.

     As this EU proposal was never implemented, a later proposal was more closely linked

to the existing drafts on Mineral Oil Excise Harmonization (see COM(95)172) and

therefore concentrated effort on a much smaller carbon tax base (see Table 2 and its

evaluation in Vollebergh, 1995). In 1997 the European Commission came up with a new

proposal to use the directive on excise harmonization across EU countries more specifically

for the purpose of carbon tax policy (see Ekins and Speck, 1999, for further details).

According to this proposal the minimum target levels for the existing excise taxes on

mineral oils should be raised in three steps, while also small minimum rates on primary

energy products, like coal and natural gas, are proposed, as well as a tax on electricity (see

Table 2 for the proposed rates for 2000).

      All EU proposals allow for exemptions. In the 1992 draft directive an exemption

would depend on a case-by-case assessment of the degree of competitive pressure faced

from countries not taking equivalent measures. Member states could grant firms a reduction

in the carbon tax payable (through an exemption or an equivalent refund), if energy costs

(minus value added tax) amount to at least 8 per cent of value added. In addition, the

proposed directive in 1992 also allows for reductions or refunds if firms invest in energy

efficiency improvements or abate carbon.

      Summarizing, the recently introduced (unilateral) carbon taxes in several European
                                               35

countries   indeed broaden the existing (implicit) carbon tax base by including specific

primary energy products, like coal and natural gas. These products were usually not taxed

before. Usually the agents who pay the tax are mainly (downstream) distributors of fmal

fuel products or electricity at the point of delivery to households, small and large

businesses. Furthermore, with the exception of Norway, the tax rate is equal per unit

carbon across energy products and is interwoven with (existing) energy excise rates, if

available. Finally, with the exemption of Finland, all Nordic countries choose to exempt

*specific agents, mainly energy-intensive industries, by applying (much) lower or even zero

carbon tax rates.



4.2 Evidence on administrative costs



Empirical estimation of the administrative costs of different environmental tax policies is,

to our knowledge, absent. The same holds for compliance cost with only a few exceptions,

such as Fullerton's (1996) analysis of the Superfund's Corporate Environmental Tax. Also

direct estimates of the administrative costs of carbon taxes are lacking. Therefore this

section reviews the existing evidence on the administrative costs of taxation in general, and

the factors that appear from this literature as relevant for the level of these costs.

     The lack of evidence on administrative cost is not surprising as only few explicit

environmental taxes exist in practice (see for example Fullerton 1996). Explicit
environmental taxes are those for which the legislator has expressed explicitly the aim that

this tax should serve some environmental purpose. However, the analysis of environmental

taxation and administrative cost would be severely restricted if one limits the analysis to
                                             36

explicit environmental taxes only. As shown in the previous section, also input taxes are

important for environmental purposes. Indeed, taxes like excises and VAT matter for the

environment (taxes on petrol and motoring), as well as facilities in the income tax (tax

allowances for commuting expenses, mine exploration, pollution control equipment, etc) •23

For carbon taxation, current energy taxes, like excises on hydrocarbon oils, are the most

important as they are likely to have an impact on emissions through changes in input mix

and changes in demand for energy.

     Unfortunately, empirical information on the administrative costs of other taxes is

scarce as well. Only a few studies exist.24 Many problems exist regarding how to measure

these costs, especially their absolute levels. One issue is the significant element of

transferability between compliance costs and administrative costs (Sandford et al. p. 203).

Also, difficulties arise in categorizing operating costs. For instance, the (marginal) cost of

transferring forms is highly influenced by the level of integration with existing
administration.

     Table 4 summarizes the results of Sanford et al. (1989). Both administrative and

compliance costs of each tax are expressed as a percentage of the revenue raised by the tax.

Administrative cost vary from 0.12% for the Petroleum revenue tax to 1.53 % for the

income tax. The overall picture is clear: income tax and VAT are relatively expensive to

administer, while especially excise duties are inexpensive in terms of administrative costs.

This finding is also in accordance with fmdings in other studies: although the OECD (1988)

provides lower estimates on the total cost of VAT (between 0.40 and 1.09%), this study

also ranks income taxes as being relatively most expensive and excises (interpreted as

single-stage general consumption tax) as being least expensive to implement (total cost
                                             37

around O.5%)!



                                      INSERT Table 4



As Sandford et al. also include compliance costs, we can test whether we bias our analysis

by focusing on administrative costs only. On average, compliance costs are 3 times higher

than administrative costs. Compliance costs are relatively higher only for VAT. It is more

important for our purposes, however, that the ranking of different types of taxes according

to implementation costs is the same whether we use administrative costs or total operating

costs. Hence, the basic picture is not influenced by adding compliance cost. The similar

relative importance of compliance, and administrative costs across different taxes suggests

that administrative costs can be taken as being representative for both.

     We now turn to the factors that determine the level of the administrative costs (see

also section 2.1). Administrative cost as a percentage of the total revenue raised by a tax is

not very relevant for the choice between different type of taxes. It is more important to

know their fixed and variable cost characteristics, and how they are affected by the choice

of tax base and rate. Unfortunately, such information is available only in a very limited

way. As far as the role of the number of tax payers is concerned, empirical information on

the administrative cost of VAT indeed suggests the existence of economies of scale as far as

the number of tax payers is concerned. In that case costs per registered business should be

relatively lower in countries with a low small-business exemption than in countries with a

high exemption: broadening the tax base across a larger number of tax payers reduces

overall administrative cost per tax payer. Cnossen (1994, p.1652) notes that the data
                                               38

observed by OECD (1988), with the exception of Denmark, indeed fit this observation.

      Another important determinant of administrative costs is measurability of the tax

base. One factor here are differences among tax payers. Some tax payers will be more

expensive to tax due to specific characteristics that have to be checked. Again an interesting

example is the small-business exemption in VAT. The larger the exemption, the smaller the

number of registered businesses, and the lower the absolute levels of administrative cost

(see Cnossen, 1994, p.1652). Usually exemptions will be responsible for higher
administrative cost. For instance, to give a tax rebate to a particular industry requires extra

excise officers to handle and check such claims. Of course, exemptions for specific agents

can also lower administrative costs if the agent is neither liable for tax payment nor for a

rebate. We did not fmd evidence for the assumption that more complex forms for

calculating the tax base would raise administrative cost. Also no empirical studies have not

tried to quantify the precise shape of the fixed and variable cost component of
administrative costs of different tax types in relation to the use of differences in tax rates.

      No decisive empirical information exist on the (general) shape of the transaction cost

curve for different type of taxes, especially environmental taxes. Moreover, as observed by

Cnossen (1994, p.1663), the fmdings of Sandford et a!. (1989) on the comparatively high

VAT compliance costs are in clear contrast with evidence on VAT compliance costs in

Germany. Here the estimated cost are only a fraction of the costs observed for the UK,

which is mainly explained by the much longer tradition and experience in Germany, and the

integration of VAT with the administration of the business income tax. Thus, even if some

information exist, the evidence seems to be dependent on local circumstances and

institutional settings.
                                             39

     The implementation and enforcement of environmental taxes, however, has much in

common with the operation of the age-old excises on alcohol, tobacco and petroleum

products (Cnossen, 1977). Generally, these excises rely on quantitative measurement for

assessment purposes, with compliance ensured through physical controls. Similar close

controls should be exercised at points of import.26 Thus, it seems safe beforehand not to

expect always prohibitively high administrative costs for environmental taxes. This might

be different only if the regulatory tax base asks for monitoring of emissions which are

difficult to measure, and therefore require costly metering technology.

     Furthermore, the change in administrative costs depends heavily on the sectors

already subject to other existing taxes or environmental regulation. For instance, according

to Hoornaert (1991, p.87), the physical control necessary for energy excises is very closely

related to carbon taxes, while administrative controls for VAT are quite different and more

time-consuming. The same might hold for other regulatory procedures which are already in

force. Usually direct controls for environmental purposes also reflect tight supervision of

technological processes and quantitative measurement. Thus, if closely linked production

processes are already subject to monitoring, administrative costs need not be very high.

     Summarizing, the level of administrative cost depends much on how emissions

specifically relate to the production processes, their heterogeneity and the number of these

processes included in the tax base. Using existing excises for environmental regulation

might be a relatively cheap way of taxing bads since tax officers already have a lot of

information required to operate the tax system.



4.3 Assessment in terms of the trade-off
                                              40

As noted before, the overall effect on welfare of introducing 'new' environmental taxes,

like carbon taxes, should be compared to the incentives provided by the tax. An important

result of our theoretical model is that input taxes offer an interesting alternative for

emission taxes if three conditions are met (see the end of section 3.4 in particular). First,

there should be a 'clear linkage between inputs and emissions. Second, only few

possibilities must exist to abate carbon emissions separately. Third, administrative cost of

emission taxes should be high. In this section we argue that these conditions are indeed met

in the case of carbon taxation which supports the strategy chosen by the different countries

applying these taxes. At the same time, however, the current design of the carbon taxes in

practice leaves considerable room for improvements.

        The first condition is related to the linkage issue (measured through I — 1 as part of

the "efficiency edge" 4 in section 3.4). In the carbon case C02-emissions are indeed in a

1:1 correspondence to the carbon-content in energy products used as inputs (e.g. crude or

refined oil products, natural gas and different types of coal). Moreover, (potential) harmful

C02-emissions are mainly related to the consumption of fossil fuels in modern societies.

Thus, rather than taxing each unit of carbon emitted separately, it is rational to use taxes on

energy products which contain carbon to pursue climate change objectives. Such taxes on

energy products provide indirect incentives, using the relationship between the burning of

these products and transactions which can more easily be taxed. Thus instead of taxing the

emissions from car exhausts, additional tax may be levied on petrol purchases, on the

assumption that the environmental damage caused is proportional to the amount of petrol

used.

        This approach is indeed largely reflected in the carbon taxes applied in practice. They
                                              41

all take advantage of this fact by using carbon content of fuels as its tax base (although

often a hybrid tax base is applied with a combination of both carbon and energy content).

Thus coal-based energy production processes are put at a disadvantage compared to other

fossil and non-fossil fuel energy products. The same holds for oil relative to natural gas and

non-fossil fuels. This is entirely in alliance with the purpose of the tax: providing much

better targeted incentives compared to an indirect excise tax on energy alone. However,

applying differences in tax rates per unit of carbon, as in the Norwegian case, cannot be

justified and the rate structure applied considerably weakens its incentive effect (e.g. coal is

taxed at a much lower rate compared to natural gas which contains fewer units of carbon

per unit of energy).

      The second important condition is that only few possibilities should exist to abate

carbon emissions separately (measured through a as part of the "efficiency edge" zli). If

emissions are very sensitive to emission taxation, that is if agents can abate C02-emissions

easily, input taxes might become inefficient because they do not provide appropriate

incentives for reducing carbon emissions directly. In other words, a loss in efficiency of

input taxes can be expected only if direct carbon abatement is possible, though not

stimulated by a tax levied on the agents who are responsible for these C02-emissions. With

respect to the abatement of carbon emissions ('carbon disposal') indeed relatively few

possibilities are available and almost none is actually employed.27 Furthermore, these

possibilities can usually be applied only on a rather large scale. Therefore they are outside

the reach of small individual firms or households. Thus the use of input taxes in the case of

carbon is indeed justified in this respect, in particular because the explicit carbon tax rates

are considerably low.28
                                             42

     The third condition is that administrative cost related to emission taxes should be

high, or, in other words, the cost of input taxation should be relatively small (see equations

(29) and (30) in particular). Usually administrative cost of newly designed taxes are

relatively expensive due to a fixed set-up cost element of monitoring activities. This also

applies to excise taxes, whether they are emission or input taxes, even though they are

cheap to administer compared with other type of taxes (see section 4.2). For that reason tax

reform of existing taxes is very attractive for policy makers, as the effect on (marginal)

administrative cost can be expected to be small. A rise of the marginal carbon tax rate is

simpiy reached by using the existing implicit energy taxes on carbon, i.e. the existing

energy excises. Thus, tax rate reform is sufficient, i.e. a reform of currently existing

energy input taxes into taxes based on emission coefficients (see section 4.1).

     Indeed, the strategy chosen by the Nordic countries when implementing carbon taxes,

basically follows this logic. We tentatively checked which products and agents were already

subject to energy excises in these countries in the pre-carbon tax period, say 1990.29 Table

5 presents our results. We distinguish between three potential groups of tax payers:

households (Hh), industrial consumers (I), and electricity generators (E). It is immediately

clear from this table that the most important carbon-containing energy products consumed

or produced in the Nordic countries were already subject to energy excises before the

introduction of the carbon tax. The basic picture was that existing excises were levied on

fuels consumed by households, with the exception of natural gas in Sweden and Norway

(which is a small category anyway). The inputs of electricity were usually not subject to

tax, in contrast to the delivery to consumers (both households and industries). Although

many energy products are subject to tax, including even the products used as inputs in
                                             43

industry, it turns out that the industrial sector is often exempted or pays lower tax rates,

especially energy intensive industries (refineries; steel and aluminium production).



                                      INSERT Table 5



Thus, the effects on administrative cost of introducing carbon taxes on fuel content in these

countries is dominated by the use of the existing energy excise administration. As long as

this administration is also used for the carbon tax, one can safely assume a small rise in

administrative costs. The only factor that might give an upward effect is the more

complicated tax base calculations due to the integration of two instead of one indicator (both

energy content and carbon content). The same holds for carbon tax exemptions, especially

in the case of rebates. As noted before, rebates often complicate the tax and cause higher

administrative costs. If, however, exemptions in the carbon tax also take advantage of these

institutional set-up, additional administrative costs still need not be high (sunk cost

element).

       In all Nordic countries, however, the carbon excise is also imposed on new

products, especially the production of electricity (use of inputs) and natural gas. Also coal

seems to be taxed now on a more comprehensive basis. But the effects on administrative

costs of these changes also seem to be limited. Like the existing excise systems for other

energy products, tax administration can take advantage of the way in which final fuel

products, like diesel or electricity, is usually delivered to consumers (both industry and

households). The administration of energy excise taxes saves on the number of tax payers

by using points of delivery (eg. fuel stations and energy distributors) instead of taxing all
                                              44

consumers separately. This is applicable in the case of natural gas (delivery through pipe

lines), as well as in the case of coal (points of distribution). Thus, the broadening of the tax

base implies only a small increase in the number of tax payers.



4.4 Scope for improvement



Although the current carbon tax strategy in the Nordic countries satifies the conditions for

using input taxes instead of emission taxes, considerable scope for improvements seems to

exist. The coverage of the carbon excises in the Nordic countries (as well as the

Netherlands) is far from exhaustive, especially in tenns of the agents subject to an effective

tax. Exemptions are widely used, mainly motivated by concerns about international

competiveness. Often energy inputs of domestic industries are taxed at lower rates or not

taxed at all. Furthermore, the existing energy excises related to oil products are of the final

fuel type, which implicitly exempts production of the fuels themselves. Also extraction of

any fossil fuel is not subject to this tax (although other type of taxes and subsidies apply).

       Our theoretical results suggest that sectoral differentiations in the tax rate are

justified by administrative costs, if linkage and marginal abatement cost (MAC) differ

among sectors. Exemptions can also be justified by differences in fixed administrative

costs. A difference between linkage and MAC, as well as fixed administrative cost among

sectors, seems to apply in the carbon case. However, current differentiation is exactly the

opposite to what our model suggests as optimal. Dijkgraaf and Vollebergh (1997) have

shown that this observation generalizes across OECD countries. In general, households face

much higher taxes on average compared to industry. Furthermore, most OECD countries
                                             45

tax final oil products (diesel, gasoline) much more heavily compared to primary energy

products on average (heavy fuel oil, natural gas and coal). In this respect the countries that

introduced a carbon tax, already applied a much broader (implicit) carbon tax base
compared to the other countries.

       Thus the industries that are usually exempted now, mainly the energy-intensive

industries (both producing energy products as energy-intensive products), are also the tax

payers who can be taxed with lowest transaction costs per unit emission. In other words,

the most important polluters (small number of tax payers consuming the larger part of fossil

fuels) still do not pay any or only a very small amount of tax. The same holds for the

choice to exempt certain energy products consumed by specific sectors, like coal by

electricity generation. Finally, not taxing particular energy products that cause considerable

carbon emissions, like coal, seems to be particularly unattractive.30 Of course, issues of

carbon leakage are of considerable importance here. If a country follows a unilateral

strategy without any compensation for its carbon-exposed industries, import substitution

could easily reduce the effectiveness of its carbon abatement policy. However, several

mechanisms are available to compensate for these effects with small or even no negative

effect on administrative costs, such as tax credits (Vollebergh et.al., 1997).

       Another issue closely linked to the selectivity of coverage is that all explicit carbon

taxes are based simply on the amount of carbon contained in the actual products. This

implies that carbon emitted in the production processes producing those fuels is not taxed at

all. As Pearson and Smith (1991, p.29) noted long ago, such a scheme gives an undesirable

incentive towards the use of highly-refined fuel products, in which as much as possible of

the carbon emissions have taken place before the excise is applied. Thus this tax will be less
                                            46

efficient at encouraging carbon-reducing fuel substitutions. According to Vollebergh (1995)

it might be an efficient strategy in this case to use a materials balance approach to impute

the amount of upstream carbon emissions that are related to energy products of the final

fuel type.

       A third possibility for improvement is to supplement current input taxes with

incentives for abatement (introducing a mixed system of input and emission taxes).

Although abatement of CO2 emissions is very limited for small energy users, large

industries and energy producers may have some opportunities for abatement that are less

costly than separate abatement possibilities like carbon sequestration. Large-scale firm-

specific investments are involved in these abatement projects. Emission taxes for energy

producers may provide appropriate abatement incentives. Moreover, the administration

costs for emission taxes in the energy production sector can be expected to be considerably

lower than for small industry and households. Technologies are more homogenous, and the

number of agents is small. For large energy-intensive industries, however, the

competitiveness argument may prevent the implementation of emission taxes, since these

taxes increase costs and require again compensation schemes. Alternatively, abatement

subsidies decrease costs, and seem more feasible.

       The most important step toward more efficient carbon policies is explicit
coordination of carbon policies on EU, OECD or, better, world scale. Carbon leakage then

no longer offsets unilateral carbon policies. Thus, exemptions of large energy-intensive

exporting industries to restore international competitiveness would no longer be a

reasonable strategy. Only then it is possible to initiate a full-fledged tax reform toward

imposing carbon taxes on agents that have most options for abatement, contribute most to
                                            47

CO2 emissions, and for which the administrative costs involved are relatively smallest.

NOTES:

1.   The relation between taxation in general and transaction costs is more widely

analysed, see Slemrod and Yitzhaki (1998) for an overview.

2.    Section 4.2, however, shows that administrative and compliance costs turn out to

move together in practice, that is, taxes for which compliance costs are relatively important

are also associated with relatively high administrative costs).

3.   The term "gross welfare cost" is due to Goulder (1995).

4.   This definition applies to corrective taxes. The gross welfare cost in case of revenue

raising can be similarly defmed as the change in welfare apart from that arising from

relaxing the government budget constraint.

5.    There is an interesting analogue between the current paper and the long standing issue

in environmental economics of selecting instruments to improve ambient quality directly or

indirectly through the reduction of emissions. It is well-known that linkage between

emissions and ambient quality is often indirect, but the cost of ambient quality regulation

can be prohibitive. Thus an interesting trade-off exist between the utility loss in terms of

the directness of linkage on the one hand, and the cost of regulation on the other hand. We

owe this point to Dallas Burtraw.

6.    We realize that this term might be misleading, since transaction costs also affect

(ultimately) private welfare. However, the term captures the fact that we focus on

administrative costs that first affect the tax authority (and not directly private agents).

Indeed of the three terms in (1), only the first captures direct changes in private welfare.

The third term, the environmental gain, is a "public" component of the welfare change if

the environment is assumed to be a public good. Alternatively, we could have used the
                                                 60

terms "frictionless gross welfare cost" and "frictionless efficiency".

7.        In fact, Smith (1992) has shown that the basic idea can be traced back to the seminal

paper of Diamond (1972).

8.        We also abstract from output taxes and abatement subsidies. See Smulders and

Vollebergh (1999) for the interaction between these instruments and administrative costs.

9.        Furthermore, e ">0,   e" >0, and l">O. We ensure concavity by assuming
[l"+(—ea )e ']e "—(—ea ')(e )2> 0
10. with at least one equality

11. To simplify notation, all summation sign refer to summation over all final goods

sectors, unless stated otherwise.

12. Note that, by assuming linear sectoral separability, we ignore economies of scope as

discussed in section 2.

13. See the analysis in Bovenberg and Goulder (1998, section 3.1).

14. Note that equations (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8) allow us to determine how a, x:, q., Pj

and p -- and hence also 1(x1), e(a1,x1), E1, X,, T and U -- depend on the tax rates.

15. This condition can be called the "entry condition" analogous to industrial organization

models where firms enter if the operating profits (cf. welfare), measured at the optimal

price (cf. tax), exceed the entry cost (cf. tax introduction/set-up cost).

16. To be precise, (is the tax that maximizes welfare given the set of taxes employed;

(=0 if (15) is violated.

17. Solving the social planner problem for the case without transaction costs, we fmd the

                                            i
following optimality conditions: (i) u, '= +a1 +x1 + e1D', (ii) 1   — eat   V/      (iii)

1    —i   '-e1 V /        Comparing these conditions to (2), (3), (4), (5) and (8) we find that
                                              61

z =D', t, = 0 implements the first-best outcome. As a special case, if e '=0 and e1 '—e1/x1
Vi, any combination of taxes that satisfies     (x1/e)t1 =D 'Vi, also implements the first-best

social optimum (input taxes and emission taxes are equivalent, cf. section 3.4).

18. For this case d U/cit reduces to (i—D ') dE,/d r which is positive for t <D'. Hence the

left-hand side of the second inequality in (15) is positive while the right-hand side is zero

and (15) is satisfied.

19. Similarly, two-parts instruments may do the job. If only one pollutant causes an

externality and if all other outputs and inputs can be taxed at zero transaction cost, the first-

best outcome can be reached (see Fullerton and Wolverton 1997). In the present model this

would require a (sector-specific) taxes on output and input use and a (sector-specific)

subsidy on abatement. Note, however, that optimality breaks down once more pollutants

play a role.

20. To see this, substitute (17) into (18).

21. Note that (x1/e1)2(, + f)= - dX1Idt and (x1/e1)(e +      = - dE1/dt,, = - dX/d z.

22. It can be derived from (3) and (4) that dx/d       e '(da1Idt) + e' (dx1/dt).
23. Barthold mentions 51 federal tax code provisions for the US (Barthold, 1994) and the

OECD in more recent inventories also mentions a much larger number of relevant taxes.

24. Sandford et a!. (1989) analyse administrative and compliance costs of different taxes

in the UK in 1986-1987. OECD (1988) discusses operating cost for consumption taxes

relative to other taxes.

25. See the discussion in Cnossen (1994).

26. Note that the tax base of specific excises requires physical control due to the physical

dimensions in which they are usually expressed ($ per unit, litre, etc). This is
                                              62

fundamentally different from taxes expressed on an ad valorem basis (% of price or (added)

value).

27. Of course, many opportunities exist for savings on energy use (improvements of

energy efficiency) which also implicitly reduces carbon emissions (Eskelund and

Deravajan, 1996). However, the condition applied here is the improvement of carbon

efficiency at the margin (as measured through the efficiency edge of emission taxes over

input taxes, see section 3.4). We also exclude 'compensation' techniques, like carbon

sequestration (by planting trees), as they are not directly related to the production

techniques employed for producing output.

28. This might change if carbon tax policy would become more strict as technological

improvements might considerably reduce the cost of existing carbon abatement potentials.

29. We only checked excises as the introduction of a carbon tax is closely related to

existing energy excises. Furthermore, in terms of the fixed cost element, it is not important

whether these products are VAT-exempt or not. As discussed in section 4.2, the

administrative procedures for VAT differ considerably with excise administration.

30.       OECD (1998) shows that coal is even still subsidised in quite a number of OECD

countries.
