                   Exchange Rate Management:
                    Intertempo ral Tradeoffs


                             ABSTRACT




     The management of the exchange rate is possible only if the government

pursues a monetary-fiscal policy mix which is consistent with its exchange

rate targets. In this paper with uncertainty concerning the length of

individual life the real consequences of exchange rate management depend

on the precise time pattern of the accompanying policies. We look at a

stylized example of disinflation by means of exchange rate targetting with

an initial overvalued currency and a delayed accompanying absorbtion policy.

The result will be an intergenerational redistribution of welfare whereby

spending rises during the initial period and falls during later periods,

while the external debt rises in all periods.

 1.     INTRODUCTION

        It is now well understood that exchange rates cannot be managed without

the pursuit of other policies which make the entire package internally

consistent (e.g. Pollak (1957)). Governments or central banks can only

temporarily target exchange rates without giving due attention to other

policies. However, eventually they will have to choose or will be forced to

chooce measures which validate ex—post the feasibility of their exchange rate

policy. These measures will typically be anticipated by economic agents

during the initial periods of exchange rate management and those anticipations

will translate into immediatee pressure in various markets. Hence, the

success of exchange rate management depends to a large extent on other

policies, commitments to future policies, and its effects on expectations.

        In this paper we study the intertemporal constraints on exchange rate

management for economies in which governments precommit themselves to the

future course of monetary and fiscal policies and honor their commitments. We

explore the implication of such policy packages in terms of their effects on

the time pattern of spending and debt.

        In order to obtain real effects of exchange rate management policies we

do away with the Ricardo—Barro type neutrality (see Barro (1974)) by

considering consumers with finitely expected lifetime, as in Blanchard



*     This work was financed by a grant from the Horrowitz Institute
                                         2

(1984). It is known that in the presence of Ricardo—Barro type neutrality

exchanqe rate management tias no real effects (see, for example, Helpman and

Razin (1979)). On the other hand, this neutrality breaks down in the presence

of various distortions, in which case exchange rate management does have real

effects (see, for example, Aschauer and Greenwood (1981) and Helpman and Razin

(1984)), but we do not wish to consider such distortions in the present study.

       In addition to the general feasibility constraints that result from the

fact that the real consequences of exchange rate management depend on the

precise time pattern of the policies that support the exchange rate path, we

study an example in which disinflation is achieved by means of an exchange

rate   freeze. This is an interesting case because several countries have
recently attempted to disinflate by means of exchange rate targetting (e.g.
Argentina,   Chile, Israel). We show that when this policy is pursued with an

initially overvalued currency and a delayed accompanying absorption policy,

the result will be higher spending during the initial periods following the

inception of exchange rate management, lower spending in later periods, and

larger aggregate foreign debt in all time periods. The twist in the time

profile of spending and the upward shift in the time profile of debt will be

larger the larger the initial overvaluation and the longer the delay in the

absorption policy. However, the delay in the absorption policy is bounded by

the government's taxing capacity. The beneficiaries of this policy

combination are individuals who are alive during its inception, while future

generations suffer.

       In our framework the time pattern of real variables does not depend on

monetary policy if the exchange rate is freely floated and in this case the

allocation of resources is efficient. Efficiency is also preserved when the

exchange rate is managed, but the time pattern of real variables does
                                          3


depend on the policies that support the exchange rate path (contrast with

Helprnan and Razin (1979), Helpman (1981) and Lucas (1982)). As pointed out

above, these supporting policies do affect the intergenerational distribution

of welfare. Hence, in this framework there are significant differences

between a managed and a floating exchange rate regime. The real effects of

exchange rate targetting that we describe are closely related to the real

effects of budget financing that were discussed by Blanchard (1984) and

Frenkel and Razin (1984) in frameworks without money. We, naturally, take

explicit account of monetary considerations.

     We begin our discussion with a description of the economy in a floating

exchange rate regime. In this regime monetary injections and withdrawals

through the tax—transfer system have no real effects. This is followed by a

detailed discussion of the channel through which exchange rate management has

real effects and an illustration of the disinflation policy.



2. Floating Exchange Rate

     We consider an economy with overlapping generations in which a cohort of

size 1 is born in every period. Individuals survive to the next period with

probability -r     and this probability is age independent. The event of death

is independent across individuals. Therefore, the proportion of a cohort

alive at time t1 which survives to period t2 is:


              (t2-_t1)
          Y
                                            4

      The age distribution of the population is constant over tine and in every

period there are



                  a
             I



individuals       of age a. The size of the population is also constant and equal

to:




                       =



      We   assume that those individuals live in a small country facing a given

one—period world real interest rate r on sure loans in terms of traded

goods. All loans are indexed and foreign prices of traded goods are constant

and equal to one. Thus if one borrows b he has to repay Rb the next

period, where R = 1+r is the interest factor. Since an individual survives

to the next period only with probability y,        he cannot obtain a loan with

this interest rate. Foreign financial institutions who lend to domestic

residents will obtain a sure repayment Rb if they charge a real interest

rate of:



              I


In order to see this, suppose that b is being lent to every individual of a
given cohort. Then those who will survive to the next period will repay



              I
                                                     5


However, only a proportion y            of   the individuals will survive. Therefore

total payments by the cohort will be Rb. Clearly, (RIy) —                   1     is the

risk—adjusted real interest rate (see Blanchard (1984)).

        There exist firms that produce T units of traded goods per capita

and         units of nontraded goods per capita. The sectoral output levels

are functions of the relative price of nontradables Pt and so in CNP per

captita in terms of traded goods, which we denote by                            Clearly,
dy(pt)dpt =

        Firms sell their output in exchange for domestic money and distribute the

proceeds to the living individuals at the beginning of the following period.

Individuals have to pay for goods with money; with home money for home goods

and foreign money for foreign goods. Thus, we assume a system with

cash—in—advance constraints in which goods are bought with the seller's

currency (see Helpinan and Razin (1984) for a discussion of alternative

monetary mechanisms).

        The budget constraint of an individual of age a in period t is:


                                                 +                     —
(1)
             Ca,t   ba,t —     (R/-r)b8_i,t_i            [etiY(pt_i)

where    c8 (            +               is his total consumption in terms of
                 cTa,t       PtcNa,t)
traded goods; ba,t is his new debt;              (R/Y)ba_i,t_i is his repayment of

old debts, with period minus one debt equal to zero; i.e., b..j, = 0 for
all t; e is the exchange rate; and                        are the age independent nominal

taxes or transfers. We also assume in (1) that money is not used for store of

value purposes, which happens when the nominal effective interest rate is

positive. In addition we need to impose the terminal condition that

(R/Y)_Tba+T,t+T goes to zero as T             goes to infinity.
                                            6

      We assume that the government has no real spending. In a freely floating

exchange rate regime the government injects and withdraws money from the

economy via the taxes and transfers e. Hence, if mt is the per—capita

stock of money in period t, then:


              =
                   mt_i    Ot


On the other hand, with positive nominal interest rates all money is spent on


goods, implying:



           m =     ey(p)

Taken together the last two equations imply:



                                        =
(2)         [eiy(pi) -          o]/et
      Using (i) and (2) it is clear that in a pure floating exchange rate
regime monetary injections and withdrawals via       have no real effects.

Put differently, in this system the time pattern of consumption and debt,

individual as well as aggregate, and the real exchange rate ''t' do not

depend on the time pattern of monetary injections. This result is in line

with models in which there are no overlapping generations and individuals live

to the end of the economy's horizon (see Helpman (1981)).

      We use this case as a benchmark for comparisons with exchange rate

management policies. It should though be pointed out that neutrality of the

above described monetary policy need not hold in the presence of a

labor—leisure choice or externally financed investment. It also need not hold

if the buyer's currency is used for transactions instead of the seller's (see

Helpman and Razin (1984)). Moreover, a special feature of the current
                                       7

formulation of overlapping generations is that the neutrality result also

depends on the assumption of an equal division of dividends amongst all living

individuals. It can, for example, be shown that if this is not so, and

individuals can take loans using current period output as collateral (in case

they do not survive to the next period), then monetary policy will have real

effects.

     In what follows we will use the model described in this section in order

to study real effects of exchange rate management policies. We will be

interested in particular in the deviation that such policies generate from the

benchmark case.

3. EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT AND MOVEMENTS OF RESERVES



     Suppose tnat in the benchmark case considered in the previous section we

obtain the following solution for per—capita consumption and debt:


              =   (l—i)     a           =
                                             (1_Y);OYa5a,t
                                                             t =   —...

and the real exchange rate {1ft},


Suppose also that in period t=O the government begins to manage the exchange

rate. The question we consider is: what are the real consequences of

exchange rate management in terms of deviations of {Ct,bt,pt} from the

benchmark case.     AS we know from Helpman (1981), in a model without

overlapping generations in which individual lives extend to the economy's

horizon exchange rate management has no real effect as long as the government

is intertemporally balanced, independently of the time pattern of taxes. The

reason is that in that case the private sector fully internalizes the

government's intertemporal budget constraint. This, however, cannot be

expected in an economy in which individuals pay future taxes with a

probability smaller than one.     Therefore, the time pattern of taxes required

in order to manage the exchange rate will generally have real effects (e.g.

Blanchard (1984)).

     Clearly, for every time pattern of exchange rates there exists a time

pattern of taxes and transfers which preserves the benchmark real variables.

However, while in previous models (e.g. Helpman (1981)) there was no constraint on

the time pattern of the neutral taxes but only on their present value, here this

pattern is unique. As is clear from (1) and (2), if in period t=O the real
                                             9


exchange rate remains (1/) and per—capita debt does not change, then for

a given pattern of exchange rates {et}0 the taxes {Ot}l have to satisfy:




(3)           =
                  et
                               -
                                   ey()     ,    t   =   0,1,...

where e1 =             This   policy generates monetary injections and withdrawals

which keep the money supply in line with the nominal value of output implied

by the exchange rate e and the real exchange rate                   i.e. it assures:



           rn =        —      = ey(t)

with no deficits or surpluses in the overall balance of payments.

If (3) is satisfied, we have




(4)        [eiy(i) -          e]/e   =
                                         y(),        t    0,1,...



which is the same as (2), implying no change in real variables. In this case

no reserve movements are required in order to manage the exchange rate.

Observe, however, that even when the exchange rate is maintained constant over

time, varying taxes and transfers are required as long as the real exchange

rate is not constant over time. Hence, exchange rate management without real

consequences requires a well coordinated time—varying policy of monetary

injections and withdrawals. No such policy is required under a free float.
                                                10

       It is clear from triis discussion that if a policy that satisfies (3) does

not accompany the exchange rate management programme there will be reserve

movements. Assuming intrerest bearing services, reserve movements qenerate

public debt which has real effects, as explained in Blanchard (1984). The

time pattern of external public debt per capita is given by:



(5)      b = Rb1    +                      -
                                               ey(p)   -
                                                           oi,   t =   0,1,...

with the initial conditions:

             i-.   nLI,—
                       '_ n-  '-._, '-'1   —



We    assume that the government repays its debts. Therefore its policy is

restricted to satisfy (5) with the terminal condition:


(6)           Urn R_tb = 0.


        Equation (5) describes reserve (external interest bearing assets)

movements according to the standard balance of payments mechanism. External

debt grows at the rate of interest due to rollovers plus periodical additions

through deficits in the overall balance of payments, the last component being

represented by the terms in the square brackets. The first two terms describe the

decline in the overall demand for money [e 1y(p. i —               ety(pt).
Part of this decline is satisfied by negative injections (withdrawals)
                                                      11


via taxes o.        The rest is attained via foreign exchange

purchases by the private sector, which bring about reserve losses.                   It is

clear from (5) that when (3) is satisfied, we obtain the solution

Pt =       and   b =     0    for all t; i.e., there are no reserve movements.


        Now, suppose that the exchange rate management policy starts in period

zero and the policy rule given in (3) is not followed. Then the effects of

reserve movements on individual budget constraints can be seen from the

following rewriting of the budget constraint (1), using (5):


                                  -                   +        + (b -
(8)          Cat =   bat              (R/Y)b8_i,t_i                     Rb1)

        In order to see as clearly as possible the real effects of reserve

movements, assume that all goods are traded; i.e., N = 0 and

y1. Then (1) and (2) imply (using the terminal condition on ba÷Tt÷T):



(8)                                          o(Y/R)TyT — (R/Y)ba_i,t_i

while (7) implies (using the terminal condition on ba+Tt+T and (7)):

                              I               I
(9)          O(Y/R)Tca+Tt+T = Wa,t

where            is real wealth of an individual of age a at time t and



                     =                       -                    -
(10)                         0(y/R)Ty1            (R/Y)ba_i,t_i       Rb1
                                                           +
                                                               (1-i) TO'       bt÷
                                              12

It is clear from a comparison of (8) with (10) that reserve movements have

real effects and that these effects depend on the time pattern of reserve

movements. Different time patterns of reserves generate different

redistributions of wealth across generations, thereby effecting the time

pattern of aggregate spending as we will show explicitly in the next section.

Observe also that -if we assume that no new cohorts are born and the

probability of survival equals one, then viewed from t=O constraint (10)

coincides with (8), which implies neutrality of the exchange rate policy.

This case coincides with that discussed in Helpman (1981).

        The redistributional effect embodied in (10) can be also seen in another

way by combining it with (5) in order to obtain:

                                                                   -
                                   -          +                        et+T
(11)             =
                     o(YIR)T(YT        e+T)        0(y/R)T(t+T_l
                                       t+t                         e+
                                                         -
                                                             (R/Y)ba_i,t_i

It is seen from here that the real wealth of an individual born at time t

depends both on the given depreciation rates of the managed exchange rate and

on the tax rates. An individual born at t is better off the further away in

the future taxes are imposed and the exchange rate is depreciated, and the

nearer in the future transfers are given and the exchange rate is

appreciated. However, the taxes cannot be divorced from exchange rate

movements, because from (5) and (6) they have to satisfy:


                                                         —
(12)          oR_t(ot/et) =       0R_t                       ey(pt)]

where p1 =           and   e1 =   ë,   with (r)       y-1- in the case of traded goods

only.     Hence, the larger initial appreciations of the currency the larger the

taxes that have to be collected.
                                                          13

        Coming back to (11), and the case of traded goods only, observe that from

period t1 onward exchange rates and taxes are fully anticipated. However,

at time t=O, when exchange rate management begins, there is an unanticipated

change both in the exchange rate and in taxes (and in the real exchange rate

whenever there are nontraded goods). It is therefore useful to decompose the

contribution of period zero disposable income, inclusive of capital gains on

wealth, into anticipated and unanticipated components. Given the discussion

of the benchmark case it is clear that the anticipated component of real

income is T' while from (11) total real income is:


                     —            +   e1—     e0



Therefore, the last two terms represent the unanticipated components, and they

can be expressed as:


                 0            e        —e

is the unanticipated increase in real taxes. The definition of the real loss

due to taxes is clear from (13b), while the capital gain on money balances may

require an explanation. Before the change in the exchange rate policy the

private sector is expected to hold

money balances at the beginning of period zero. The real value of this money

was expected to be T• As a result of the unanticipated stabilization of

the exchange rate at e the real value of this money has become

eOyTIeO. Hence, (13a) describes the unexpected capital gain on

period zero money holdings.

       Now, using N = 0 and (13) it is seen from (5) that:



(14)          b =   g = k—n.




Namely, the initial loss of reserves is equal to the public's unanticipated capital

gain on money holdings minus the unanticipated increase in tax obligations. In view

of (14), condition (3) for t0 (which describes the period zero

absorption policy that is required for real neutrality of the exchange rate

management policy) can be interpreted as follows: The tax rate        is

chosen so as to make the unanticipated increase in tax liabilities h just

equal to the unanticipated capital gain on money balances k. When this holds

there are no initial reserve movements.



4.     AN ILLUSTRATION

        In order to illustrate the dynamic effects of exchange rate management,

we consider in this section an explicit example. For this purpose suppose

that there are traded goods only, and suppose that, as has been the case in

several countries (e.g. Argentina, Chile, Israel) the government decided to

reduce inflation by means of exchange rate management. For concreteness,

suppose that it freezes the exchange rate at the level e from period

zero to infinity. In this case real effects are prevented if h=k
                                          15


and       = 0   for t=1,2,..., as can be seen from (3). Namely, perfect

price stabilization with no real effects is achieved when the government taxes

away the period zero capital gains on money holdings, and it balances its

budget in all future periods by setting taxes equal to zero. In particular,

price stability without real effects is achieved by choosing the period zero

exchange rate equal to the period minus one exchange rate and by balancing the

budget in period zero as well.

       The simple policy combination that we described above is feasible only in

the simple case to which it was applied. If, for example, there are nontraded

goods in the system, then taxing away the capital gain on money holdings in

period zero and setting taxes equal to zero in all future periods will not

attain price stability, nor will it prevent real effects. As we have shown in

the previous section real neutrality requires the taxes to vary over time in

reaction to real exchange rate movements (see (3)). When other real world

complications are added as well, such as the dependence of the velocity of

circulation on the nominal interest rate, the required policy coordination for

real neutrality becomes even more complicated.

       Returning to the simple case with traded goods only, we choose to analyze

the following policy experiment. Suppose that the exchange rate e is chosen

below         and taxes are not changed in period zero. Starting with period

t1 no taxes are imposed until period t=T. From t=T onwards fixed real taxes

   =   e'/e   are collected in order to pay interest on public foreign debt, so

that the government's budget is balanced for t=T, 1+1           In this case

exchange rate management begins with an overvalued currency; we wish to

explore the resulting real effects and their dependence on the timing of the

contractionary policy.

       Observe that under this policy experiment:

while from (5) and (14):

(15)       b =
                             RT_lg        ,   t   > T




i.e., the government's foreign debt grows at the rate of interest until

period T—1 and remains constant afterwards.

           From (12) and (13a) we obtain the real taxes:




           et =   (_1)T_lg    ,   t   =   T, T +         1,...,

i.e., taxes from I onwards pay the interest on government foreign debt.

Since no taxes are imposed between period 1 and 1—1, the individual budget

constraint (1) can be written as:

where:

                              (R_1)RT_lg             ,      t   > T



while (9) arid   (11) can be written as:

Using the right nand side of (18), we obtain:

Thus, if say             = 0    and R < 1, then                         is declining over time and

is rising over time, both reaching a steady state as shown in Figure 1.                                                 If,

time    and        is declining over time, both reaching a steady state as shown in

Figure 2.     If          = 0       and yR > 1, then                         is rising and

is declining without bound; i.e., there is no steady state. If yR =                                                 1


then consumption and debt remain constant over time.

future,      as compared to the benchmark case. On the other hand, the initial

overvaluation of the currency makes private foreign debt lower in all

time periods. Nevertneless, a direct calculation shows that total debt

bt +    b     is larger than                                      in all time periods, which means that public

debt increases by more than private debt declines. A comparison of the time

path of consumption and debt for the case R < 1                                                                is illustrated in Figure 3.

It is seen from (23) that the initially higher spending level is larger the

later taxes are imposed, and that the eventually lower spending level is

smaller the later taxes are imposed. Thus, the longer the delay in the

required contractionary policy the larger are the real effects of exchange

rate management. Moreover, the contractionary policy cannot he delayed at

will, because given a limit on taxing capacity, say x percent of GNP

(possibly hundred percent), taxes which eventually have to equal g(R—1)RT'

cannot exceed x percent of T• These results are in line with the

observed responses of spending and debt to the dissinflation attempts in

Israel during 1982—1983 and in Chile and Argentina during the late seventies.
                                      20

     The economics behind these results is as follows. The capital gain from

the overvalued currency is appropriated by the individuals who are alive in

period zero. To them the present value of future tax liabilities is smaller

than the capital gain, and they respond by raising spending in all periods.

All future generations face larger tax liabilities and reduce spending; the

later an individual is born the larger his tax liability in present value

terms (except that all those who were born after T.—1 have the same tax

liability). Over time the population share of individuals who were alive at

t=O declines and the share of those with heavier tax liabilities increases.

Therefore, aggregate spending is initially larger and it becomes smaller far

enough in the future.
