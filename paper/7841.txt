Introduction

Several previous studies have found, among women, a negative correlation between
body weight and wages.1 There exist three broad categories of explanations for this
phenomenon. First, obesity may cause lower wages. Examples of such explanations
are that obese women face discrimination in the labor market2 and that obese women
are less productive.
       The second category of explanations is that low wages cause obesity. This may be
true if, for example, poor labor market outcomes lead to depression and depression
leads to weight gain.
       The third category of explanations is that unobserved variables cause both obesity
and low wages. One example of such a variable is rate of time discount. If someone
assigns little value to future events, they may invest little in both their unobserved
human capital (and thus have low wages) and their health (and may therefore be
overweight).
       This paper tests the Ô¨Årst category of explanations, that high weight lowers wages,
using the method of instrumental variables. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the weight of a child is
used as an instrument for the weight of the child‚Äôs mother. This method, which
exploits the genetic variation in weight, is justiÔ¨Åed with reference to multidisciplinary
research that suggests that the weight of children is uncorrelated with their mother‚Äôs
wage residual.
       This paper focuses on women for two reasons. First, previous studies of this ques-
tion (described in section 1 below) have consistently found a relationship between
weight and wages for women, but generally not men. Second, the method of instru-
   1
       See, e.g., Register and Williams (1990), Averett and Korenman (1996), and Pagan and Davila
(1997).
   2
       This is the conclusion of Averett and Korenman (1996).




                                                  1
mental variables used in this paper exploits an instrument that is available in the
data only for women.
        The question of whether there exists discrimination in the labor market against
obese persons is likely to become more important with time. Recent studies have
found dramatic increases in the prevalence of obesity in the United States during the
1980s3 and 1990s.4 This trend was similar across age, gender, and race-ethnic groups.
The prevalence of obesity in the U. S. is expected to continue to rise.5
        The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 1 is devoted to a brief review
of related studies. The data used in this paper are described in section 2. The
relationship between weight and wages using the methods of ordinary least squares
and instrumental variables is estimated in section 3. Finally, in section 4, I test
whether weight is correlated with market employment or sector of employment.



1         Previous Studies of Women‚Äôs Weight and Wages

There have been several studies of women‚Äôs weight and their wages or income6 , but
this section is devoted to the two that acknowledged the possibility that weight is
endogenous and have used techniques to generate consistent estimates of the eÔ¨Äect
of weight on wages. Both of these studies use data from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth (NLSY), the data which is also used in this paper.
        ‚ÄúThe Economic Reality of The Beauty Myth‚Äù (1996), by Averett and Korenman,
    3
        Flegal et al. (1998) Ô¨Ånd that the prevalence of obesity in the U. S. rose from 14.5% in 1976-80
to 22.5% in 1988-94. Their estimates are based on measured weight and height.
   4
     Mokdad et al. (1999) Ô¨Ånd that the prevalence of obesity increased from 12.0% in 1991 to 17.9%
in 1998. These estimates are based on self-reported height and weight.
    5
        Flegal et al. (1998).
    6
        See, e.g. Register and Williams (1990), Gortmaker et al. (1993), Loh (1993), Hamermesh and
Biddle (1994), and Haskins and Ransford (1999).



                                                    2
was the Ô¨Årst to address the endogeneity of weight in this context. They attempt
to solve the problem by diÔ¨Äerencing between sisters, which will remove variance in
weight attributable to a shared family environment.
      When they diÔ¨Äerence among sisters, they eliminate the portions of variance in
weight attributable to shared genes or a shared family environment. However, the
behavioral genetics literature consistently Ô¨Ånds no eÔ¨Äect of shared family environment
on weight.7 Moreover, after diÔ¨Äerencing they are still left with the variance in weight
attributable to environment unshared by sisters, which is endogenous. The strategy of
Averett and Korenman is Ô¨Çawed; the potential source of variance in weight that they
seek to remove (shared family environment) in fact explains a negligible proportion
of the variance in weight, and some of the variance that remains (due to unshared
environment) is endogenous.
      Using the 1988 data of the NLSY, Averett and Korenman conclude that obese
women have a lower family income-to-needs ratio than women whose weight is in
the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù range (based on actuarial tables). They Ô¨Ånd this to be true
before and after taking sister diÔ¨Äerences. They also examine log wages as an outcome
measure, and Ô¨Ånd that obesity is associated with lower wages in their cross-sectional
regressions. Estimating separately by race, they conclude that the wage penalty
associated with overweight is less for black than white women. However, when Averett
and Korenman estimate their wage model using the sister-diÔ¨Äerencing procedure, the
coeÔ¨Écients on obesity are not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant, at least in part because the
sample of paired sisters is small.
      The second related study to address the issue of endogeneity of weight is Pagan
and Davila (1997). This study Ô¨Ånds that women who meet the clinical deÔ¨Ånition
of obese earn less than their more slender counterparts in the 1989 NLSY data.

                                           3
Pagan and Davila acknowledge the possibility that weight is endogenous, and, using
a Hausman speciÔ¨Åcation test, fail to reject the hypothesis that weight is uncorrelated
with the error term of the wage equation. However, their test is marred by the
fact that their instruments (family poverty level in 1988, health limitations, and
indicator variables about self-esteem) are also correlated with the error term in the
wage equation. Poverty level in the previous year could be correlated with both this
year‚Äôs wage residual and body weight. Health limitations could aÔ¨Äect unobservable
aspects of productivity as well as weight. Self-esteem could be a reÔ¨Çection of workplace
success. Given that their IV estimation suÔ¨Äers the same kind of bias as their OLS
estimation, it is not surprising that, through their Hausman test, they fail to reject
the hypothesis that OLS and IV coeÔ¨Écients are equal.
   Pagan and Davila also test for diÔ¨Äerences in occupation by weight classiÔ¨Åcation.
They estimate models of occupation choice for a nonobese sample and multiply the
vector of estimated coeÔ¨Écients with the vector of characteristics of each person in the
obese sample to generate an estimate of the probability that the obese person would
have a given occupation were they nonobese. They Ô¨Ånd that there are fewer over-
weight women in managerial and professional occupations than their model predicts.
   In summary, previous studies of wages and weight have found that heavy women
tend to suÔ¨Äer a wage or income penalty. This paper seeks to improve on this literature
in four ways, by: 1) using the entire panel, rather than just a single year, of the NLSY
data; 2) correcting for reporting error in weight and height; 3) correcting for selection
bias in the estimates of women‚Äôs wages; and most importantly, 4) conducting valid
tests of the exogeneity of weight and generating consistent estimates of the eÔ¨Äect of
body weight on women‚Äôs wages.

2         Data: NLSY

This section introduces the data used throughout this paper. The National Lon-
gitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), designed to represent the entire population of
American youth in 1979, consists of a randomly chosen sample of 6,111 U. S. civilian
youths, a supplemental sample of 5,295 randomly chosen minority and economically
disadvantaged civilian youths, and a sample of 1,280 youths on active duty in the
military.8 All youths were between fourteen and twenty-two years of age when the
Ô¨Årst of annual interviews was conducted in 1979. Since 1994, interviews have been
conducted every two years. Retention rates for those NLSY respondents remaining
eligible for interview have remained close to 90 percent during the sixteen years of
interviews.
        At the baseline of the NLSY, respondents were asked to report their race or
ethnicity, which the NLSY simplifed into three groups: black, hispanic, and non-
black/nonhispanic. I refer to nonblack nonhispanics as whites throughout this paper,
although it should be noted that this group is heterogeneous.
        The NLSY recorded the self-reported weight of respondents in 1981, 1982, 1985,
1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1998. Reported height was
recorded in 1981, 1982, and 1985; given the age of the respondents, the height in 1985
was assumed to be the respondents‚Äô adult height.
        These self reports of weight and height include some degree of reporting error,
which may bias coeÔ¨Écient estimates. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, when only one regressor is measured
with error, there is attenuation bias in the OLS estimate of the coeÔ¨Écient associated
    8
        Due to funding constraints, some members of the original sample are no longer being inter-
viewed. After the 1984 surveys, interviewing ceased for 1,079 members of the military subsample;
retained for continued interviewing were 201 respondents randomly selected from the entire military
sample. Beginning with the 1991 survey, 1,643 economically disadvantaged white respondents from
the supplemental sample are no longer being interviewed.


                                                  5
with that regressor. However, if there are multiple regressors measured with error,
there is no consistent rule about the sign of the bias in the coeÔ¨Écients of the variables
measured with error.9 I correct the NLSY measures of weight and height for reporting
error in the method of Lee and Sepanski (1995) and Bound et al. (1999); see Appendix
A for details.10
       This paper uses two measures of body weight: 1) weight in pounds (controlling
for height in inches); and 2) body mass index (BMI). BMI, the standard measure of
fatness and obesity in epidemiology and medicine, is deÔ¨Åned as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared.11
       Weight tends to rise with age. In order to distinguish the eÔ¨Äects of weight from
those of age and time, I include a linear measure of age and indicator variables for
time as regressors in my log wage regressions.
       Weight may also be aÔ¨Äected by current pregnancy. For this reason, women who
are pregnant at the time that they report their body weight are dropped from the
sample.12
       This paper uses three dependent variables: 1) log of current hourly wage at pri-
mary job; 2) an indicator variable for whether occupation is coded as white collar
(as opposed to blue collar) using Census classiÔ¨Åcations; and 3) an indicator variable
   9
       Judge et al. (1985).
  10
       I have also estimated the models in this paper without correcting for reporting error in height
and weight and I Ô¨Ånd very similar results.
  11
     The U. S. National Institutes of Health classiÔ¨Åes BMI as follows: below 18.5 is underweight,
between 18.5 and 25 is healthy, between 25 and 30 is overweight and over 30 is obese. See U. S.
National Institutes of Health (1998) and Epstein and Higgins (1992).
 12
    I use two questions in the NLSY to eliminate women who are pregnant at the time that they
report their weight. First, women were asked whether they were currently pregnant at the time
of interview. Second, in some years they were also asked whether they had, in retrospect, been
pregnant at the time of the last interview. I drop from the sample women who answered yes to
either of these questions.


                                                   6
that equals one if the respondent is currently employed or currently active duty in the
military, and equals zero if the respondent is unemployed or out of the labor force.
       In each year, the NLSY calculates the hourly wage earned by the respondent at
their primary job. I recode outliers; if the hourly wage is less than $1 an hour, I
recode it to $1 and if the hourly wage exceeds $500 an hour, I recode it to $500.13
       I classify all occupations as either white collar or blue collar, using Census codes
for occupation. White collar workers are those working in sectors described by the
U. S. Census as Professional, Technical, or Kindred Workers, Non-Farm Managers
and Administrators, Sales Workers, and Clerical and Unskilled Workers. The only
unskilled workers in the last group are those in white-collar positions, such as cashiers,
Ô¨Åle clerks, bill collectors, and messengers.
       I include the following regressors in the log wage regressions: general intelligence
(which is a measure of cognitive ability derived from the ten Armed Services Vo-
cational Aptitude Battery tests)14 , highest grade completed, years of actual work
experience (deÔ¨Åned as weeks of reported actual work experience divided by Ô¨Åfty), job
tenure, age, and indicator variables for year, local unemployment rate, current school
enrollment15 , region of residence, and black and hispanic. I also include indicator
variables for missing data associated with each regressor except the weight variables.
Table 1 provides summary statistics for the sample of women used in the log wage
regressions.

       The instrument used in the IV section of this paper is the BMI of a biological child
  13
       After recoding, there are 109 women in the sample with bottom-coded wages and 7 women with
top-coded wages.
  14
       See Jensen (1987) for a full description of this measure of cognitive ability.
  15
       I also experimented with dropping those currently enrolled from the sample and found very
similar results.

aged six to nine.16 A single observation of child BMI is used as an instrument for
every (up to twelve) observations of mother‚Äôs weight.17 Although the instrument does
not vary with time, the mother‚Äôs weight does, so in each year a woman may have a
unique value for instrumented BMI. The data on child weight and height comes from
the Child Supplement to the NLSY, which consists of all children born to NLSY
female respondents who were living in their mother‚Äôs household at the time of a child
assessment interview and who completed an interview. All of the children in the
NLSY Child Sample are biological children, so they represent suitable instruments to
gauge the genetic variation in BMI.
       The use of children to instrument for mother‚Äôs weight requires that the sample be
limited to women that have borne children. It is possible that the empirical results
found for this sample do not generalize to all women, but 82.65% of all women in the
NLSY had given birth by 1998, so the sample of women with at least one birth may
not diÔ¨Äer signiÔ¨Åcantly from the entire population of women.
       NLSY sample weights are used in all estimations described in this paper. T statis-
tics reported in the tables of this paper reÔ¨Çect robust standard errors are calculated
with clustering by individual to account for correlations in the error terms of each
  16
       Sorensen et al. (1992) Ô¨Ånd that the mother-child correlation in BMI has reached its adult level
by the child‚Äôs age 7.
  17
     The single observation of child weight was chosen in the following manner. For each woman,
the eldest child aged 6 to 9 was examined in the most recent year. If the child‚Äôs height and weight
were measured, those values were chosen. Otherwise, the next most recent year‚Äôs observation on the
eldest child was examined. If the eldest child had no measured values of height and weight, the next
eldest child was examined, and so on. If no child of a given woman had measured weight and height
in any year, a mother‚Äôs report of the child‚Äôs height and weight were used. Of all of the observations
of child weight and height, 98.7% were measured and the remainder reported by the mother. In
models run with an added indicator variable for mother report of weight and height, the coeÔ¨Écient
on the indicator was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.

individual over time.



3        Weight and Wages

The goal of this paper is to generate a consistent estimate of the causal eÔ¨Äect of body
weight on labor market outcomes. I assume that the relationship between wages w
and BMI b has the following form for individual i at time t:

                                       wit = ebit Œ≤+Xit Œ≥+œÑt +uit

or

                                ln wit = bit Œ≤ + Xit Œ≥ + œÑt + uit                                     (1)

where X is a vector of variables, œÑ is a time-speciÔ¨Åc eÔ¨Äect and u is the residual, which
is assumed to be uncorrelated with b, X, and œÑ . If BMI were strictly exogenous, we
could interpret Œ≤ as the true eÔ¨Äect of BMI on log wages.
       A Ramsey RESET test was used to test the assumption implicit in equation (1)
that log wages are linear in BMI (or weight in pounds).18 I cannot reject at the
5% signiÔ¨Åcance level the hypothesis that log wages are linear in BMI or weight in
pounds.19
       Assume that BMI has the following projection or reduced form:

                                    bit = Zit œÄ + Xit Œ¥ + it                                         (2)

where X is a set of variables that aÔ¨Äect both BMI and log wages, Z is a set of variables
that are correlated with BMI but not the error term in wages, and  is the residual.
  18
       Thursby and Schmidt (1977). While I use the Ramsey RESET to test for linearity of wages in
the weight variables, I acknowledge that no test can discriminate between unknown omitted variables
and an unknown functional form.
  19
     In its use of linear measures of body weight instead of indicator variables for weight classiÔ¨Åcation,

For now, I will assume that  and u are uncorrelated, but I will relax that assumption
later in this section.
       OLS coeÔ¨Écients and t statistics of equation (1) appear in Table 2.

       Table 2 indicates that both BMI and weight in pounds have negative and statis-
tically signiÔ¨Åcant coeÔ¨Écients. The magnitude of the coeÔ¨Écient on weight in pounds
implies that if two otherwise identical women diÔ¨Äered in weight by ten pounds, we
would expect the lighter one to enjoy 1% higher wages.
       At the bottom of Table 2, I list the standard deviations of BMI and weight in
pounds in the sample. If weight is normally distributed, the standard deviations and
coeÔ¨Écients in Table 2 imply that if two otherwise identical women diÔ¨Äered such that
one was at the median and one was at the 95th percentile for weight, we would expect
the lighter one to enjoy roughly 7% higher wages. For comparison, the coeÔ¨Écients on
height suggest that each inch in height is associated with 1.1% higher wages.
       There is a large literature on the extent to which studies of women‚Äôs labor force
participation are inÔ¨Çuenced by sample selection bias due to the fact that many women
do not work for pay.20 Despite the fact that studies examining the wages of women are
likely to be aÔ¨Äected by selection bias‚Äìsince they attempt to make inferences about all
women using data only on working women‚Äìnone of the studies of weight and women‚Äôs
wages reviewed in section 1 attempted to determine the degree of selection bias in
their estimates.
       The method of Heckman (1979) is used to correct the log wage regression re-
sults for any selection bias. As instruments for the propensity to engage in market
employment, i.e. variables that aÔ¨Äect labor force participation but not wages, this

paper follows the traditional literature on women‚Äôs labor force participation, and uses
marital status, number of children in the household, age of the youngest child in the
household, and family income that is not attributable to the wages of the respondent.
   Listed alongside the OLS estimates in Table 2 are estimates corrected for selection.
At the bottom of the table are the t-statistics associated with the inverse Mills ratio,
which represent a test for the presence of selection bias. For the sample of all women,
the coeÔ¨Écient on the inverse Mills ratio is not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant. However, I
do Ô¨Ånd evidence of selection bias for some subsets of the sample, so for all the log
wage regressions in this paper, results both uncorrected and corrected for selection
are presented for the sake of comparison.
   These OLS estimates suggest that, in general, heavier women tend to earn less.
However, in the terminology of equations (1) and (2), OLS estimates of Œ≤ are consis-
tent if and only if uit and it are uncorrelated. As mentioned earlier, the errors terms
might be correlated if there is reverse causality (e.g. labor market failure causes
depression and subsequent weight gain) or if unobserved variables (e.g. relating to
lifestyle) cause both heaviness and adverse labor market outcomes.
   If the error terms are correlated, one can still generate a consistent estimate of Œ≤
if one can identify a set of variables Z that are correlated with BMI but not the error
term in wages. Given Z, one can calculate an instrumental variables estimate of Œ≤.
In this paper, the instrument for a mother‚Äôs weight is the BMI of one of her children.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the set of instruments consists of eight variables: the BMI of the child
interacted with the child‚Äôs gender and the child‚Äôs age, which ranges from six to nine.
   A series of articles has been published outlining the harms of weak instruments.
Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1993) point out two problems associated with weak instru-
ments. First, a weak correlation between the instrument and the endogenous variable
will exacerbate any problems associated with a correlation between the instrument



                                            11
and the wage residual. Second, the magnitude of Ô¨Ånite sample bias in IV estimates
approaches that of the OLS bias as the R2 between the endogenous explanatory vari-
able and the instruments approaches zero. They suggest that the R2 and F statistics
from the Ô¨Årst stage of two-stage least squares be reported as approximate guides to
the quality of the IV estimates. Staiger and Stock (1997) argue that 10 is an accept-
able value of the F statistic associated with the hypothesis that the coeÔ¨Écients on the
instruments in the Ô¨Årst-stage regression of two-stage least squares are jointly equal to
zero.
       The set of instruments used in this paper appears to meet the standard of Staiger
and Stock. The hypothesis that all coeÔ¨Écients on instruments are jointly equal to
zero in the Ô¨Årst stage of IV estimation is rejected; the F statistic is 10.47 when BMI
is the endogenous regressor, and 10.23 when weight in pounds is the endogenous
regressor.21 The marginal R2 associated with the instruments is .04 when BMI is the
endogenous regressor, and .11 when weight in pounds is the endogenous regressor.
       However, there are additional requirements of an instrument. In particular, it is
imperative that the instrument be uncorrelated with the error term in the second
stage of instrumental variables estimation; if it is correlated, the IV procedure has
accomplished nothing (and may in fact have caused harm22 ) because the instrumented
variable is still endogenous. The identifying assumption of this paper is that the BMI
of a child is correlated with the weight of its mother and is uncorrelated with the
mother‚Äôs wage residual. The evidence in favor of this assumption is: 1) There is no
  21
       It is not surprising that the correlation between mother and child BMI is high; heritability
studies suggest that genetics account for as much as 70% of the variance in weight across people;
see Yanovski and Yanovski (1999). Most estimates from U.S. data of the correlation between the
adult BMI of a mother, and the childhood or adolescent BMI of her child are in the range .21-.36.
The correlation does not diÔ¨Äer by the gender of the child. See Maes et al. (1997), p. 334.

consistent pattern between childhood obesity and socioeconomic status; see the review
in Sobal and Stunkard (1989). 2) There is no measurable eÔ¨Äect of common household
environment on body weight; see Stunkard et al. (1986), Price and Gottesman (1991),
Sorensen et al. (1992, 1993), Vogler et al. (1995), and Maes et al. (1997).23 These
studies indicate that all of the similarity in weight between parents and children is
genetic in origin.
       While it is impossible to conÔ¨Årm the null hypothesis that child BMI is uncorrelated
with the mother‚Äôs wage residual, it can be illustrative to test whether instruments are
correlated with observables that are believed to be correlated with the unobservables
that aÔ¨Äect the second-stage residual. To this end, mother‚Äôs education and general
intelligence were regressed on the set of instruments and the other regressors in the
log wage regressions. The set of instruments was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the
10% level, which is suggestive evidence in favor of the identifying assumption.
       The use of child‚Äôs BMI as an instrument has an added advantage. Instrumental
variables analysis only measures the eÔ¨Äect of the endogenous regressor on the de-
pendent variable for the population ‚Äútreated‚Äù by the natural experiment. In many
natural experiments, the treated population diÔ¨Äers in important ways from the pop-
ulation, and the IV estimate for the treated population may diÔ¨Äer dramatically from
the treatment eÔ¨Äect on the entire population.24 Using the BMI of a child as an in-
strument for the weight of the child‚Äôs mother largely avoids this problem, because
genetics aÔ¨Äects the body weight of every person and over 80% of the women in the
  23
       Grilo and Pogue-Geile (1991), a comprehensive review of studies of the genetic and environmental
inÔ¨Çuences on weight and obesity, conclude that ‚Äú...only environmental experiences that are not
shared among family members appear to be important. In contrast, experiences that are shared
among family members appear largely irrelevant in determining individual diÔ¨Äerences in weight and
obesity.‚Äù (p. 520).

          In Ô¨Årst stage of 2SLS, I regress a measure of mother‚Äôs weight (corrected for re-
porting error)25 on eight interaction terms: the child‚Äôs BMI times indicator variables
for child gender and age. I interact the child‚Äôs BMI with the child‚Äôs age and gender
because I want to measure the extent to which the child is heavy for their age and
gender. The regressors from the second stage of 2SLS are also included in the Ô¨Årst
stage. CoeÔ¨Écients from the Ô¨Årst stage of two stage least squares are listed in Table
3.


                                       INSERT TABLE 3 HERE


          In Table 3, all the coeÔ¨Écients on the instruments are of the expected sign; a high
BMI child (relative to other children of the same age and gender) is associated with
higher weight mother, whether measured in BMI or pounds. Every child BMI-age-
gender interaction is signiÔ¨Åcant at the 1% level in each regression. At the bottom of
each table are listed the F statistics and partial R2 of the instruments.


                                       INSERT TABLE 4 HERE


          Table 4 contains the two-stage least squares estimates of the eÔ¨Äect of weight on
log wages for women. Although the standard errors are larger due to the IV method,
the point estimates of the coeÔ¨Écients generated by IV are similar to those generated
     25
          Instrumental variables estimation is often proposed as a method of generating consistent esti-
mates of coeÔ¨Écients of variables measured with error. (See, e.g., Fuller (1987) or Greene (1993).)
However, such an approach requires one to Ô¨Ånd an instrument that is correlated with the true value
of the variable measured with error and yet is independent of the reporting error. Since, as shown in
Appendix A, reporting error in BMI is a function of level in BMI, it is not reasonable to assume that
an instrument correlated with true BMI is uncorrelated with the reporting error in BMI. For this
reason, I must still correct self-reported height and weight for reporting error before instrumental
variables estimation.

by OLS. In fact, a Hausman test indicates that the hypothesis that the OLS and IV
coeÔ¨Écients are equal cannot be rejected. In other words, any endogeneity of weight
does not appreciably aÔ¨Äect the OLS estimates and these should be preferred to the
IV estimates.
       I next test for diÔ¨Äerences in these results by race. I test and reject at the 5%
signiÔ¨Åcance level the hypothesis that the coeÔ¨Écients of equation (1) are equal for
black, white, and hispanic women.26 OLS and IV results are presented in Tables 5
and 6 for white females, Tables 7 and 8 for black females, and Tables 9 and 10 for
hispanic females.27


                           INSERT TABLES 5 THROUGH 10 HERE


       These tables reveal considerable diÔ¨Äerences by race. Only for white females are
the OLS coeÔ¨Écients on weight variables statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 5% level. The
OLS coeÔ¨Écients on weight for hispanics are statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at the 10%, but
not the 5%, level. The OLS coeÔ¨Écients on weight for blacks are not statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant at any reasonable signiÔ¨Åcance level.
       As for the entire sample, Hausman tests conducted separately by race indicate
that the hypothesis that the OLS and IV coeÔ¨Écients are equal cannot be rejected.
Collectively, the results presented in Tables 5 through 10 indicate that the evidence is
relatively strong that weight lowers the wages of women who are white, the evidence is
relatively weak that weight lowers the wages of women who are hispanic, and there is
no evidence that weight lowers the wages of women who are black. This is consistent
with the Ô¨Ånding of Averett and Korenman (1996), who Ô¨Ånd in OLS regressions that
the wage ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù for overweight is smaller for black women than white women.
  26
       I cannot reject at the 5% signiÔ¨Åcance level the hypothesis that coeÔ¨Écients are equal across
occupation sector (white or blue collar) within race groups.

      It is reasonable to ask, how ‚Äúlarge‚Äù is the wage penalty for body weight among
white women? If weight is normally distributed, the standard deviations and coef-
Ô¨Åcients in Table 5 imply that if two otherwise identical women diÔ¨Äered such that
one was at the median and one was at the 95th percentile for weight (a diÔ¨Äerence
of roughly sixty-Ô¨Åve pounds), the lighter one is expected to enjoy roughly 7% higher
wages. Judging by the estimated coeÔ¨Écients of other variables in the model, this is
equivalent in absolute value to the wage eÔ¨Äect of roughly one year of education, two
years of job tenure, or three years of work experience.



4       Employment and Occupation

So far in this paper I have taken as given employment and sector of employment.
However, it is conceivable that while there may be no wage discrimination condi-
tional on employment, discrimination may exist at the hiring stage. This section is
devoted to estimating the correlation between weight and employment and sector of
occupation.


4.1       Weight and Employment

The dependent variable in this section is an indicator variable that equals one if the
woman is employed or on active duty in the military, and equals zero if the woman
is unemployed or out of the labor force. I estimate both probit and probit with
IV models using the same set of regressors as for the log wage regressions, minus
job tenure and the indicator for white collar job.28 In contrast to the log wage
regressions, I could not reject the hypothesis that coeÔ¨Écients in are equal across race
in the employment probit regressions. Table 11 reports the marginal probabilities
 28
      The probit with instrumental variables estimation follows the strategy of Newey (1987).

associated with the probit coeÔ¨Écients and z scores.29


                                     INSERT TABLE 11 HERE


       The coeÔ¨Écients on BMI and weight in pounds are not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in the
employment probit regression. However, it may be that weight is correlated with the
error term in the probit regression for occupation choice. Just as in a linear regression,
a correlation between a regressor and the error term violates the assumptions behind
the nonlinear regression model.30 I use the same instruments in the probit with IV
regression as in the two-stage least squares regressions.
       The probit with IV coeÔ¨Écient on each weight variable is statistically signiÔ¨Åcant at
the 10%, but not the 5%, level. The magnitude of these coeÔ¨Écients implies that a gain
in weight of ten pounds is associated with a 1% higher probability of employment.
As a check of robustness, I re-estimated these models dropping from the sample
women who were out of the labor force and found no evidence that weight aÔ¨Äected
the probability of employment.31


4.2        A Random Utility Model of Occupation Choice

This subsection is devoted to testing whether obesity is correlated with the probability
of employment in a white collar as opposed to a blue collar job. I assume that each
person derives utility based on their sector of occupation. People enjoy utility Uw if
they work in the white-collar sector or utility Ub if they work in the blue-collar sector.
  29
       The z scores reÔ¨Çect standard errors for probit with IV corrected for estimation in the Ô¨Årst stage;
see Murphy and Topel (1985).
  30
     In nonlinear regression, if a regressor is correlated with the error term, it is expected that the
transformed regressor is also correlated with the error term; see Greene (1993).

     Tables of the results of the employment probit regression excluding from the sample those who

The utility that they enjoy in each sector is a function of their characteristics X:

                                   Uw = XŒ≤w + w

                                   Ub = XŒ≤b + b

Let Y = 1 indicate that a NLSY respondent has a white-collar job and Y = 0 indicate
that they have a blue-collar job. The probability that a person has a white-collar job
is equal to the probability that their utility in the white-collar job is greater than the
utility that they would enjoy in a blue-collar job:

                   Pr[Y = 1|X] = Pr[UW > UB ]

                                   = Pr[XŒ≤w + w > XŒ≤b + b ]

                                   = Pr[X(Œ≤w ‚àí Œ≤b ) + w ‚àí b > 0]

                                   = Pr[XŒ≤ +  > 0]

                                   = Pr[ > ‚àíXŒ≤]

    Assuming that  follows a normal distribution, the probability of white-collar
employment as a function of characteristics X can be estimated with with a probit
model. Marginal probabilities and z scores for the probit regressions appear in Table
12. The probit and probit with IV results in Table 12 provide no evidence that weight
aÔ¨Äects the probability of employment in a white-collar, as opposed to a blue-collar,
job.

5      Summary

This paper seeks to improve on previous literature on the relationship between weight
and women‚Äôs wages in four ways: 1) by using a much larger dataset; 2) correcting for

                                           18
reporting error in weight and height; 3) correcting for selection bias in the estimates
of women‚Äôs wages; and most importantly, 4) conducting valid tests of the endogeneity
of weight and generating consistent estimates of the eÔ¨Äect of body weight on women‚Äôs
wages.
       This paper Ô¨Ånds evidence that weight lowers wages for white women; among this
group, a diÔ¨Äerence in weight of two standard deviations (roughly sixty-Ô¨Åve pounds)
is associated with a diÔ¨Äerence in wages of 7%. This diÔ¨Äerence in wages is equivalent
in absolute value to the wage eÔ¨Äect of roughly one year of education, two years of
job tenure, or three years of work experience. The fact that weight lowers certain
women‚Äôs wages may become increasingly important over time, as the percentages of
Americans meeting the clinical deÔ¨Ånitions of overweight and obese are predicted to
continue to rise.32
       It should be stressed that the Ô¨Ånding that weight lowers wages is not conclusive
evidence of workplace discrimination. Another hypothesis also consistent with these
Ô¨Åndings is that heavier workers are less productive at work. It has repeatedly been
found, for example, that obese workers are more likely to miss work due to illness.33
However, this explanation is complicated by the fact that this paper Ô¨Ånds no evidence
that weight lowers wages for black women.
       This paper also Ô¨Ånds evidence of a wage premium for height among white women;
a diÔ¨Äerence of 3 inches in height is associated with a diÔ¨Äerence in wages of 4%. This
paper Ô¨Ånds no eÔ¨Äect of weight or height on the probability of employment or sector
of occupation.

to healthy-weight workers, had 1.5 to 1.9 times more work days lost to illness. Wolf and Colditz
(1998) estimate that, in the U. S. in 1994, obesity-related illness resulted in 39.2 million missed work
days.

Appendix A: Reporting Error in Weight and Height

Weight and height are self-reported in the NLSY; reporting error in these variables
has the potential to bias coeÔ¨Écient estimates. In this appendix, I assess the extent
of reporting error in weight and height in the NLSY, and correct for it, using the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).34 NHANES
III, conducted in 1988-1994, was designed to obtain information on the health and
nutritional status of the U. S. population through interviews and direct physical
examinations. NHANES III surveyed a nationally representative sample of 33,994
persons aged 2 months and older; 31,311 of those respondents also underwent physical
examinations. NHANES III is useful for the purposes of this paper because it both
asked respondents to report their weight and height and then, within four weeks,
measured their weight and height. In order to assess the extent of reporting error in
the NLSY, I examined the reported and actual weight and height of NHANES III
respondents of the same age as the NLSY sample when they reported their weight
and height (aged 17-40). There were 3,854 female NHANES III respondents in the
NLSY age range.
      In NHANES III, height and weight are reported such that NLSY-aged women
tend to underreport their BMI by 1.5%. Underreporting of weight varies positively
with actual weight; underweight women overreport, whereas overweight women un-
derreport, their weight. There is no clear pattern of misreporting of height by actual
height.
      In order to correct for this reporting error, I predict true height and weight in the
NLSY using information on the relationship between true and reported values in the
NHANES III. This strategy is outlined in Lee and Sepanski (1995) and Bound et al.
(1999). If one has validation data, which in this case contains measures of true and

reported weight and height (and, therefore, BMI), one can regress the true value of
the variable on its noisy reported value. The OLS coeÔ¨Écient on the reported value is
then used in the primary dataset; speciÔ¨Åcally, it is multiplied by the reported value
to create an estimate of the true value. (This assumes ‚Äútransportability,‚Äù i.e. that
the relationship between true and reported values are the same in both datasets.) I
then regress log wages on a set of regressors that includes transformed BMI, which is
constructed using the transformed values of reported height and weight.
       Measured weight was regressed on actual weight for a sample of NLSY-aged (i.e.
17-40) respondents to NHANES III. I estimate the regression separately by race;
actual weight is regressed on reported weight and its square (in deviations about race
group-speciÔ¨Åc means); the intercept is suppressed.35 Reported weight and its square
are strong predictors of actual weight; judging by the extremely high R2 (each over
.995), this model Ô¨Åts the data very well.
       This process was repeated for height. Regressions of actual on measured height
and its square (in deviations arbout race-speciÔ¨Åc means) were estimated separately by
race.36 Again, the extremely high R2 (equal to 1 to the third decimal place) suggest
that reported height and its square are outstanding predictors of actual height.
       Self-reported height and weight in the NLSY are then multiplied by the coeÔ¨Écients
on the reported values associated with the correct race-gender group in the NHANES
III. The Ô¨Åtted value of BMI, corrected for reporting error, is used throughout the

       The hypothesis that the coeÔ¨Écients are equal across race was rejected. The hypothesis that these
coeÔ¨Écients are equal across age groups could not be rejected. The hypothesis that the coeÔ¨Écient
on the squared term is equal to zero was rejected, but the hypothesis that the coeÔ¨Écient on a cubic
term is zero could not be rejected.

The other regressors in the log wage regression are: general intelligence (derived from the ten ASVAB tests),
highest grade completed, actual work experience, job tenure, age, and indicator variables for white collar job,
currently enrolled in school, year, local unemployment rates, region of residence, and black and hispanic.
NLSY sample weights are used. Robust standard errors are calculated with clustering by individual. Preg-
nant women are dropped from the sample.

Aside from the variables reported here, the other regressors in the regression are: general intelligence (derived
from the ten ASVAB tests), highest grade completed, actual work experience, job tenure, age, and indicator
variables for white collar job, year local unemployment rates, region of residence, and black and hispanic.
NLSY sample weights are used. Robust standard errors are calculated with clustering by individual. Preg-
nant women are dropped from the sample. Instruments are interactions of child BMI with child age and gen-
der.

The other regressors in the log wage regression are: general intelligence (derived from the ten ASVAB tests),
highest grade completed, actual work experience, job tenure, age, and indicator variables for white collar job,
currently enrolled in school, year, local unemployment rates, and region of residence. NLSY sample weights
are used. Robust standard errors are calculated with clustering by individual. Pregnant women are dropped
from the sample.

by individual. Pregnant women are dropped from the sample. Probit results reported are the marginal proba-
bilities associated with probit coefficients; z scores appear in parentheses. Probit with IV uses the method of
Newey (1987). Probit IV standard errors are corrected according to Murphy and Topel (1985). Instruments
are interactions of child BMI with child age and gender.
