                                              ABSTRACT

U.S. state and local governments are increasingly restricting smoking in public places. This paper
analyzes nationally representative databases, including the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, to compare
short-term changes in mortality and hospitalization rates in smoking-restricted regions with control
regions. In contrast with smaller regional studies, we find that workplace bans are not associated with
statistically significant short-term declines in mortality or hospital admissions for myocardial infarction
or other diseases. An analysis simulating smaller studies using subsamples reveals that large short-term
increases in myocardial infarction incidence following a workplace ban are as common as the large
decreases reported in the published literature.

1 Introduction

       State and local governments have increasingly banned smoking in public places

(including workplaces, restaurants and bars) as a means of limiting non‐smoker

exposure and of discouraging smoking (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

2007). Several recent studies in the medical literature using a small number of regions

suggest that smoking bans lead to a short‐term 8 to 40% decrease in the annual

incidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (Sargent, Shepard et al. 2004; Bartecchi,

Alsever et al. 2006; Cesaroni, Forastiere et al. 2008). Despite these findings, it is unclear

how well the results would translate to typical U.S. communities. We examine whether

governmental smoking restrictions affect hospitalization and mortality rates in a large

sample of U.S. communities.

       We calculate death and hospitalization rates for AMI and other diseases using

Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MEDPAR) files, national death records

(otherwise known as the multiple cause of death files, hereafter MCD), and

hospitalization data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s Nationwide

Inpatient Sample (NIS). We compare rates before and after implementation of these

bans relative to communities that did not implement bans. We use the variation in

implementation dates across the country and fixed effects models to control for

unobservable factors including improving prevention and treatment of cardiovascular

disease, decreasing smoking rates, and smoking restrictions enacted by private


                                              4
businesses. We find that smoking restrictions are unlikely to substantially affect short‐

term mortality and hospitalization rates in both the elderly, working‐age, and child

populations. We find some evidence that smoking bans could reduce mortality in the

elderly but the results are not statistically significant (‐1.4%, 95% confidence interval: ‐

3.0 to 0.2%).

       All previous published studies on the health effects of smoking bans share a

common methodology: they compare the outcomes in a single community that has

passed a smoking ban with outcomes in a small set of nearby communities that have

not passed bans. A major contribution of this paper is that we simulate the results from

all possible small‐scale studies using subsamples from the national data. We find that

large short‐term increases in AMI incidence following a smoking ban are as common as

the large decreases reported in the published literature.




2 Background

       In this section, we discuss how environmental tobacco smoke (also known as

second‐hand smoke) is related to health outcomes, the history and effects of smoking

bans in the U.S. and internationally, and the implication of previous studies for U.S.

smoking policy.




                                              5
2.1 Environmental tobacco smoke and health outcomes




       In a recent review, the U.S. Surgeon General reports that numerous

epidemiologic and laboratory studies have linked environmental tobacco smoke (ETS)

exposure to increased rates of cardiovascular disease, respiratory illness and lung

cancer (Glantz and Parmley 1991; He, Vupputuri et al. 1999; Barnoya and Glantz 2005;

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2006). Laboratory studies support the

notion that small quantities of inhaled cigarette smoke can induce similar biochemical

responses in non‐smokers as in chronic smokers. Such effects could predispose non‐

smokers to greatly elevated risk of AMI and stroke. Epidemiologic studies typically

compared outcomes non‐smoking spouses of smokers and non‐smokers. Although

some meta‐analyses disputed these findings, most agreed that chronic ETS exposure

increased risk of AMI by 20 to 30%. Although no amount of secondhand smoke is likely

to be beneficial, the above studies do not address the potential effects of intermittent

exposure to secondhand smoke, as might be caused by exposure to cigarette smoke in

public places.

       Secondhand smoke in public places has been most strongly linked to AMI

among all potential adverse health outcomes (Ong and Glantz 2004; Sargent, Shepard et

al. 2004; Bartecchi, Alsever et al. 2006). There is some biological justification for this in

the medical literature (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2006). The full


                                               6
effects of eliminating tobacco smoke may take years to occur because some aspects of

coronary artery disease (such as narrowing of the coronary arteries) develop slowly

over time. However, a heart attack occurs due to sudden clot formation in diseased

arteries; in laboratory settings, exposure to even small quantities of tobacco smoke can

induce biochemical states that predispose to heart attacks. Therefore, a smoking ban

could plausibly reduce AMI incidence and mortality as early as the first year after a ban

if it eliminates even relatively minor exposure. As a result many prior studies examined

AMI rates in single regions in the 6 to 18 months following a smoking ban. In addition

to increased risk of AMI, those exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke may suffer

higher rates of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections, cancer and

other diseases.




2.2 Public bans on smoking in U.S. public places

       As evidence on ETS accumulated, many U.S. employers began restricting

smoking in the workplace; the proportion of covered workers increased from 25% to

70% between 1986 and 1993 (Farkas, Gilpin et al. 1999; Farrelly, Evans et al. 1999;

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000). Following these private restrictions,

several communities in California banned smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and bars

in the early 1990s. Many other states and municipalities followed (American

Nonsmokersʹ Rights Foundation 2007). In addition to these local policies, several


                                               7
prominent politicians advocated a national policy banning smoking in public places

(OnTheIssues.org 2007).

       Although these bans have proven popular, the scientific literature to date has

only examined the imposition of a smoking ban in a few specific U.S. regions and

several European countries. AMI rates decreased approximately 40% in Helena,

Montana and 27% in Pueblo, Colorado (relative to surrounding communities) following

the imposition of broad restrictions (Sargent, Shepard et al. 2004; Bartecchi, Alsever et

al. 2006). A larger study compared rates of AMI and acute stroke admissions in New

York State before and after comprehensive smoking bans, which were largely

implemented in March and July 2003 (Juster, Loomis et al. 2007). This study estimated

that the laws reduced AMI admissions by 8%, although it did not compare these

changes in AMI and acute stroke admissions to changes that may have occurred in

nearby states that did not implement smoking bans over this period.

       Examining a different mechanism, Adams and Cotti (2008) find increased rates of

vehicular deaths following the enactment of smoking bans. They attribute this increase

to smokers driving out of their native area to find a place to smoke in public. Another

possibility is that these bans lead smokers to smoke more in vehicles, which could be a

distraction while driving. Adams and Cotti use national data and hence measures the

average effect of a ban across all communities in the U.S.; unlike the previously cited

studies, they do not measure the effect in individual communities.


                                             8
2.3 International smoking bans

        Two relatively large studies of the effect of smoking bans on AMI incidence in

Rome and the Piedmont region of Italy concluded that smoking bans reduced AMI

incidence by 7 to 11% in younger populations (Barone‐Adesi, Vizzini et al. 2006;

Cesaroni, Forastiere et al. 2008). The authors demonstrated that the prevalence of

smoking, cigarette consumption per smoker, and non‐smoker exposure dropped in

Italy after the national ban (Barone‐Adesi, Vizzini et al. 2006; Gallus, Zuccaro et al. 2007;

Cesaroni, Forastiere et al. 2008).1

        A study of the Scottish public smoking ban found large reductions in AMI rates

as well (Pell, Haw et al. 2008). The Scottish government implemented a comprehensive

ban in March 2006. The authors measured admissions to 9 hospitals (which treat over 3

million people) as well as death records for the general population. They measured

actual exposure to cigarette smoke among non‐smokers (former smokers and never‐

smokers) and current smokers. In prior studies of the general population, serum

cotinine levels declined – from 0.43 to 0.25 nanograms/dL in nonsmokers and from 167

to 103 nanograms/dL in current smokers. The authors then noted statistically significant

declines in admissions for acute coronary syndromes in all groups ‐ 14% in smokers,

19% in former smokers and 21% in those who never smoked. The decline in the AMI

non-smokers reliably.

                                                        9
rate was noticeably larger than the 4% decline in neighboring England during the same

time period (which lacked a comprehensive ban).




2.5 Implications of prior work for U.S. smoking policy

       The aforementioned studies linking smoking bans to impressive public health

gains suggest that widespread public smoking bans would demonstrably improve U.S.

public health. However, the international experience also may not translate because

nonsmokers’ exposure to secondhand smoke and smoking prevalence in Italy and in

Scotland were much higher and private smoking restrictions were weaker than in the

U.S.

       Restricting the analysis to U.S. studies does not eliminate questions about

generalizability. Prior U.S. studies were small in scale, having examined only a few

regions; it is possible that those regions are not representative of typical U.S.

communities. Although difference‐in‐difference analyses can control for unobserved

factors, a simple pair‐wise comparison using an atypical pair of communities will yield

results that may not be representative. By contrast, a simulation study found that

extending smoking restrictions from 70% to 100% of U.S. workplaces would prevent

roughly 1,500 myocardial infarctions in the first year (Ong and Glantz 2004). Although

this may be a clinically relevant improvement, it represents a much smaller reduction




                                               10
(<1%) than those reported in the small‐scale studies based in Helena or Pueblo or the

pre‐post study of New York State.

       The mechanism for these tremendous declines in AMI rates reported in the

small‐scale studies is unclear as well, which makes their results less certain. It is

unknown whether public bans effectively reduce exposure to secondhand smoke and

whether the reduced exposure leads to clinically significant cardiovascular risk

reduction. There is conflicting evidence as to whether typical government smoking

restrictions dramatically reduce exposure to ETS or induce smokers to quit, as

restrictions initiated by employers have been shown to do (Longo, Brownson et al. 1996;

Evans, Farrelly et al. 1999; Metzger, Mostashari et al. 2005; Adda and Cornaglia 2006).

Although Pell et al. (2008) showed that bans were associated with large relative

reductions in ETS among non‐smokers, the absolute reductions were very small. In

addition, if strong private restrictions were prevalent in the U.S. and avoidance of

public bans was relatively easy, public bans might have no effect at all. It is therefore

unclear whether governmental restrictions affect public health substantially, or simply

codify existing workplace practice.

       Furthermore, the estimates of risk due to ETS exposure due to public smoking

from these small‐scale studies are similar in magnitude to those from studies of

intensive household exposure to secondhand smoke (Thun, Henley et al. 1999). The




                                             11
similarity implies exposure to secondhand smoke presents large heath risks at low

levels and no additional health risks at higher levels, which seems unlikely.2

       We address these issues by analyzing the impact of U.S. public smoking

restrictions on health outcomes in a large, heterogeneous group of U.S. communities. By

analyzing much larger populations in a diverse group of U.S. hospitals and counties

and by accounting for underlying secular trends and region‐specific characteristics, we

mitigate the possibility of selection bias.




3. Data

       To construct the data sets used for our analysis, we merge data on the timing and

location of smoking bans to three large nationwide data sources on health outcomes.




3.1 Data on smoking bans

       We use ordinance data from the American Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation to

identify states, counties, and municipalities that implemented restrictions on smoking

between 1990 and 2004. We adapt the classification scheme from the American

Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation to identify those bans that restrict smoking in all

workplaces except bars and restaurants as “workplace” bans. Although not included in



2
 Similar risk reductions were found in European and U.S. studies though baseline smoking
prevalence, secondhand smoke exposure, and efficacy varied, which argues against a plateau
in risk.

                                              12
the former list, California adopted a nearly complete ban on workplace smoking in

1995. We classified California as smoking‐restricted starting in 1995. We also create a

dataset of bans of any site ‐ workplaces, bars or restaurants. We classify each 3‐digit zip

code, city, and county in the U.S. by smoking ban status and date of implementation.




3.2 Data sources for health outcomes

       We analyze health outcomes using the Multiple Cause of Death (MCD) database

(1989‐2004), Medicare claims (1997‐2004), and the Nationwide Inpatient Survey (NIS),

collected 1993‐2004 by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which is sponsored

by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (Agency for Healthcare Research

and Quality 2006). The MCD database identifies the underlying cause for each death in

the U.S. Our source for Medicare claims are the Medicare Provider Analysis and

Review (MEDPAR) files, which include all fee‐for‐service Medicare beneficiaries in the

U.S. The NIS is a nationally representative 20% sample of all discharges from U.S.

community hospitals (which includes all non‐federal acute care hospitals). Excluded

hospitals include Veterans Affairs hospitals and long‐term rehabilitation hospitals.

       We identified mortality and hospitalizations due to AMI and all‐cause deaths

and hospitalizations because both might plausibly improve in the short‐run. In

addition, broad disease measures like AMI and all‐cause events are less likely miscoded

in administrative data, reducing measurement error (Petersen, Wright et al. 1999;


                                            13
Tirschwell and Longstreth 2002). We also consider cases of asthma and chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease; while these are chronic diseases, secondhand smoke

possibly triggers acute exacerbations (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

2006). We also identify hip fracture hospitalizations because these can act as a negative

control because their incidence would be unlikely to change quickly after a smoking

ban (Hoidrup, Prescott et al. 2000). We don’t expect the incidence of hip fracture to be

affected by smoking bans. If we were to find an association between smoking bans and

the incidence of hip fracture, we would question the validity of the empirical strategy.

       We assemble each dataset in a similar fashion: we first classify deaths and

hospital admissions according to their primary diagnoses (AMI, asthma, etc.); we then

sum all outcomes in each region (hospital catchment area, county, or zip code); finally,

we merge information on smoking ordinances for that region.

       Workplace smoking bans could have differential effects by age. The elderly and

children may be more vulnerable to the diseases exacerbated by ETS, and could stand to

gain more benefit than a typical working adult. On the other hand, children and the

elderly are primarily exposed to workplace ETS as customers, which would reduce

their benefit from a smoking ban. To account for these differences, we further stratify

outcomes into three age groups per region: children (0‐17 years), working age adults

(18‐64 years), and the elderly (65+ years).




                                              14
       From each dataset, we exclude deaths and hospitalizations where we are unable

to determine whether the person lived in an area where a smoking restriction was

implemented (35‐40% of the NIS and MCD data). In addition, we exclude the following

from our analysis of NIS hospitals: transfer patients, hospitals included in a single

survey year, hospitals that merged during 1993‐2004, hospitals devoted to acute

rehabilitation (because few AMIs are admitted) and small hospitals (<1000

admissions/year). The final NIS and MCD samples consist of approximately 60% of all

deaths and 4% of all hospital admissions in the U.S. for the period under study. Table 1

summarizes the characteristics of the samples used.




4. Empirical strategy

       We estimate region‐level fixed effects models using our three national samples.

In addition, we perform a number of sensitivity analysis on these models. Finally, we

develop an approach to simulate the potential distribution of effects one might observe

from pair‐wise difference‐in‐difference models, using the national data.




4.1 Fixed effects regression model

       We use a multivariate linear regression model to analyze changes in mortality

and hospitalization following smoking bans. Analyses comparing outcomes before and

after bans are implemented may be subject to bias due to unobserved trends. For


                                            15
example, many regions experienced unobserved increases in private smoking

restrictions, reductions in smoking prevalence, or improved medical treatment that

could have caused changes in outcomes. To mitigate these potential confounding

factors, we compare trends in regions where smoking bans were implemented to those

in control regions where smoking restrictions were not imposed. In particular, we

estimate region fixed effects models. For each outcome (e.g, AMI death or

hospitalizations), we use the following regression model:

       (1) Outcomeit = α i + γ t + β s SmokingBanit + ε it

       Here Outcomeit represents the number of deaths or hospital admissions in region

i (1…N) and time t (1…T), Outcomeit is an indicator for each year, and ε it is the error

term. We include α i , an indicator for each region (county, 3 digit zip code, or hospital),

to control for idiosyncratic differences between regions. β s is the coefficient of interest,

representing the break in the time trend induced by a smoking ban, after controlling for

secular trends. In presenting final results, we present the mean percentage change in

             βs                      1
                × 100%) where μ is             ∑ ∑
                                                   N     T
outcomes (                                                      Outcomeit . We use block bootstrap
             μ                     N ×T           i =1   t =1




clustered at the regional level to calculate all standard errors. Of note, the effects of

private restrictions enacted prior to a government ban are included in pre‐ban trends

and are excluded from the final estimate. As a result, this strategy plausibly identifies

the short‐term effects of government restrictions alone. Due to data limitations, we alter


                                                   16
our approach in analyzing hospital admissions in NIS hospitals; we compare changes in

admissions in the first year following a smoking restriction to changes in control

hospitals without smoking restrictions.3




4.2 Sensitivity analyses.

       In our main regression model (1) we do not include covariates other than time

and region‐specific indicators. However, it is possible that factors might change over

time differentially between regions. If so, the fixed effects model would yield biased

estimates. We therefore test model specifications of the following form:

       (2) Outcomeit = α i + γ t + β s SmokingBanit + βX + ε it

The terms and results are the same as in (1) except for the addition of βX , a vector of

county‐level characteristics taken from the 2005 Area Resource File. The variables

include population size, number of physicians and hospital beds per county, household

income, and percent of population in labor force. These data were linked by county and

year, where available, to counties from the MCD as well as hospitals in the NIS data.

We do not include these variables (which could potentially add explanatory power) in


       3
         In our analysis of the NIS data, our primary unit of analysis is the hospital’s
catchment area, which includes the hospital’s home city but whose full extent is unobservable.
We use the number of admissions to a hospital in a particular month as a measure of the
admission rate within its catchment area. Catchment areas tend to remain stable over time, so
the approximation error is likely to be small. It is possible that we misclassified some
admissions. However, many bans were enforced in the county or state of origin, which would
include the entire catchment area. In addition, we only considered patients with serious
illnesses who tend to be taken to the nearest hospital, which further reduces bias.


                                                   17
all model specifications because data for βX is often missing for several years, which

substantially limits their sample sizes. We perform sensitivity analyses by comparing

the results using model specification (2) to the results using model specification (1) for

the same set of included regions.




4.3 Simulating small‐sample results

       We complete our analysis by using subsamples of the national data to simulate a

complete set of pair‐wise comparison studies of the sort available in the published

literature, including Bartecchi et al. (2005) and Sargent et al. (2004). These studies

compared a treatment unit where a ban was passed against a control unit with no ban

on the basis of the change in an outcome variable (heart attack admission rates, for

instance) in a short period (6‐18 months) after the ban was passed in the treatment

region. We simulate the range of such effects by first calculating the percent change in

admissions in each hospital located in a region with workplace smoking restrictions

between the year before and the year following a workplace smoking ban; we also

calculate the same statistics for all control hospitals from the same time period. We then

subtract the change in outcomes in each contemporaneous control hospital from each

intervention hospital. The resulting dataset consists of the universe of possible (19,406)

pair‐wise comparisons of one smoking‐restricted hospital with one control hospital. We

conduct a similar analysis of heart attack mortality, except in this case, we use MCD


                                             18
mortality data and our unit of analysis is the county. The final dataset consists of 23,938

pair‐wise comparisons and represents the universe of such comparisons in the MCD

data.

5.1 Smoking restrictions over time

        The percentage of U.S. regions that imposed smoking restrictions increased

dramatically between 1988 and 2004; the prevalence of smoking restrictions rose

sharply in 1995 and 2003‐2004 and more gradually in other years (see Figure 1).

Notably, this national trend follows the actions of private employers. By 1993, most

workplaces isolated cigarette smoke, which would diminish the impact of legislative

bans (Farrelly, Evans et al. 1999; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2000).




5.2 Main estimates

        Workplace smoking restrictions are unrelated to changes in all‐cause mortality or

mortality due to other AMI in all age groups. Restrictions on smoking of any sort are

associated with reduced all‐cause mortality among the elderly (‐1.4%, 95% CI: ‐3.0 to

0.2%) but the result is only significant at the 10% level (p=0.06) (see Table 2).

        We find no statistically significant reduction in admissions due to AMI among

working‐age adults (‐4.2%, 95% CI: ‐10.2 to 1.7%, p=0.165) or among the elderly (2.0%,
                                             19
95% CI: ‐3.7 to 7.7%, p =0.48) following the enactment of a workplace smoking

restriction (see Table 3). We similarly find no evidence of reduction in admissions for

other diseases in any age group, though smoking restrictions of all sorts are associated

with statistically insignificant increases in asthma (11.4%, 95% CI: ‐2.4 to 25.3%, p=0.11)

and total admissions (3.7, 95%CI: ‐2.1 to 9.5%, p = 0.21) among children. Among both

the elderly and working‐age adults, we find no statistically significant effect of smoking

bans on hip fracture admissions, our negative control. This supports the hypothesis that

unobserved characteristics of regions do not confound our results.




5.3 Sensitivity analyses

       Solely using region‐specific indicators to capture trends potentially omits

important confounding variables but comprehensive data is not available for all regions

and years. We test for bias by adding variables for demographics and medical resource

availability to the regression model. (We obtain these data from the 2005 Area Resource

File, which contains information for all counties and some years.) We examine the

importance of these omitted variables by comparing results with and without

additional variables for the same time periods.

       Table 4 shows the effect of any smoking ban on total death rates in all age groups

using different sets of control variables. The estimates do not change dramatically with

inclusion of different variables, but do change as the study sample changes. The sample


                                            20
is reduced from 24,884 county‐quarters in column (1) to 7,308 county‐quarters in

column (4). Regression estimates using the same samples but different regression

models are similar. For example, based on a limited sample of 15,512 county‐quarters

across 9 years in column (3), the estimated association between any smoking ban and

total death rates was +0.330% (with a standard error of 0.794%) without additional

controls and +0.328% (with a standard error of 0.804%) with controls for hospital beds

per capita and physicians per capita. We show similar results in Tables 5 and 6. These

results suggest that ordinary demographic changes are accounted for using the

difference‐in‐difference identification strategy.

       In all of the results reported in the tables, we calculate standard errors that allow

for clustering at the area level (county, hospital area, or zip code). If in addition, we

were to correct for multiple comparisons using Hochberg’s method (Hochberg 1988),

our standard errors increase further.




5.5 Pair‐wise comparisons simulating small sample results

       Figures 2 and 3 plot all possible pair‐wise comparisons of changes in AMI

incidence after a workplace smoking ban to changes in randomly selected control

regions. Figure 2 shows that the mean measured effect of workplace smoking bans on

heart attack admissions is close to zero, but 10% or greater declines and 10% of greater

increases in AMI admissions are common. Figure 3 shows similar results for a


                                             21
comparison of AMI mortality in smoking‐restricted counties from the year after a

workplace ban with rates in counties without a ban. The results of this simulation

analysis shows that results from prior small sample studies, which found very large

decreased in AMI admissions and mortality following the enactment of smoking bans,

are feasible. However, results with the opposite sign and of similar magnitude are also

feasible and should be equally common.




6. Conclusions

       We find no evidence that legislated U.S. smoking bans were associated with

short‐term reductions in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction or other

diseases in the elderly, children or working‐age adults. We find some evidence that

smoking bans are associated with a reduced all‐cause mortality rate among the elderly

(‐1.4%) but only at the 10% significance level.

       We also show that there is wide year‐to‐year variation in myocardial infarction

death and admission rates even in large regions such as counties and hospital

catchment areas. Comparisons of small samples (which represent subsamples of our

data and are similar to the samples used in the previous published literature) might

have led to atypical findings. It is also possible that comparisons showing increases in

cardiovascular events after a smoking ban were not submitted for publication because

the results were considered implausible. Hence, the true distribution from single


                                            22
regions would include both increases and decreases in events and a mean close to zero,

while the published record would show only decreases in events. Thus, publication bias

could plausibly explain why dramatic short‐term public health improvements were

seen in prior studies of smoking bans.

      Our study focuses only on the health effects of smoking bans. Future research

should estimate non‐health related benefits of these bans to non‐smokers. Prior to a

smoking ban, non‐smokers at risk for respiratory symptoms or cardiovascular events

might have avoided businesses with high ETS levels. After a ban, non‐smokers could

gain comfortable access to these businesses, but based on our findings in this study, this

benefit would not also result in reduced hospitalization or death rates. Our study

design plausibly identifies only short‐term benefits of smoking bans (as has the study

designs used by previous studies). We cannot analyze whether smoking bans improve

long‐term trends for chronic cardiovascular disease or lung cancer. In addition,

smoking bans may induce smokers to quit or discourage nonsmokers from starting

smoking. These potential long‐term benefits will not be apparent in study of short‐term

outcomes and would benefit from further study.
