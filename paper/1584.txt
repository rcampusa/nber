                                       ABSTRACT




      The paper studies the design of efficient anti—inflationary policies in a
two—country interdependent economic system.          A number of alternative
specifications of the price formation process are considered, incorporating
successively higher degrees of price level and inflation inertia.
     Only in   the   classical flexible price level model with forward—looking
rational expectations is credibility of current announcements of         future
monetary policy necessary and sufficient for costless, irmnediate disinflation.
     If price level inertia prevails, deceleration of the money growth rate must
be   accompanied by nominal money "jumps" or cost—reducing tax cuts in order to
accommodate the fall in velocity that accompanies successful disinflation, if
the transition is to be costless (and immediate). With a sluggish price level
and sluggish core inflation, ta cuts (or incomes policy) are necessary for
costless disinflation. In general, the elimination of inflation can only be
gradual.    With real balance effects on demand, unilateral disinflationary
policy always "spills over" through real interest rates and the real exchange
rate. They are necessary for the presence of spillovers only in the classical
model. Cooperative policy design effectively leaves the national authorities
with the same scope for influencing domestic target variables that they would
have had in a closed economy.

I.   Introduction

       The   purpose   of monetary policy is to ensure that money doesn't matter.

There are three reasons why money may matter for real economic performance.

First, to the extent that monetary growth is causally connected with infla—

tion, insufficient or excessive money growth (even if fully predictable)

will cause the actual inflation rate to differ from the optimal one. The

optimal inflation rate is the one that produces satiation with costlessly

produced non—interest--bearing money balances. It is associated with a

zero nominal interest rate. If the real interest rate is positive, the

optimal inflation rate will be negative. This result is both well—known and

pritically uninteresting, Equally obvious is the second reason why money may

matter. Monetary policy        could   introduce extraneous, unnecessary noise

into the economic system. Even in an idealized flexible price economy, ran—

domization of monetary policy will be costly if the realization of the sto-

chastic money supply process are not immediately and fully observable by private

agents. Adopting non-stochastic policy rules is of course quite consistent

with the specification of the monetary policy rule as a known, contingent

(conditional or flexible) function of current or past observables.

       The third reason why money may matter hinges on the presence of

nominal inertia or stickiness in the behaviour of wages and/or prices.

Given such "Keynesian" features, tight monetary policy will not result in

a transition to a lower price level or inflation rate at full employment.

Even if in the long run, reductions in money growth are associated with

equal reductions in the rate of inflation, the real-time transition or

traverse may involve persistent and significant periods of excess capacity

and involuntary unemployment. Well-designed monetary policy minimizes

                                                                         2




these output or unemployment costs of achieving a sustained and sustainable

reduction in the rate of inflation. To minimize the "sacrifice ratio,"

it will often be necessary to use the instruments of fiscal policy in

conjunction with monetary policy. The two are of course linked through

the government's budget identity, but there are infinitely many combina-

tions   of changes in taxes, spending, borrowing and external financing that
are consistent with a given sustained change in the rate of monetary growth.
Alternative    complementary fiscal packages may have greatly different impli-

cations both for the adjistment process and for the nature of the ultimate

equilibrium.

         In an open economy, external policies and events will alter the cur-

rent and anticipated future constraints faced by the domestic policy maker.

Thus, under a credible fixed exchange rate regime, the domestic rate of

inflation cannot be systematically higher or lower than the world rate of

inflation. Foreign monetary and fiscal policy actions affect the domestic

economy through goods markets (e.g., by altering world demand for home

country traded output), through interest rate linkages and, in the case of

an endogenous exchange rate regime, through spot and forward exchange mar-

kets. Freely floating exchange rates do not, except in a very special and

practically unimportant cases, insulate a country from external real and

financial shocks, nor do they prevent the spillover of domestic disturbances

into the rest of the world. Only the most naive zero—capital mobility, trade

balance view of exchange rate determination could lead one to believe that

"decoupling" through exchange rate flexibility is an option.


1The sacrifice ratio is the cumulative undiscounted net output or unemploy-
ment cost of achieving a one percent steady-state reduction in the inflation
rate.
                                                                    3


      The existence of mutual spillovers is not by itself sufficient for

policy coordination. It could be the case that policy actions are properly

?tpriced so that even decentralized, non—cooperative policy design leads

to Pareto—efficient outcomes. Merely to state this possibility is almost

sufficient to refute it. The two main reasons are that market prices are

not sufficient indices of marginal social value and that national policy

makers are not sub—atomistic, competitive agents. Even in highly abstract,

idealized representations of competitive, market—clearing economies such

as the overlapping generations model, the incompleteness of the set of

markets (reflecting, e.g., the difficulties one is likely to encounter

when attempting to make binding private contracts with the dead and the

unborn) may prevent prices in the markets that do exist from being accurate

social shadow prices. Other reasons for the non—existence of a complete

set of Arrow—Debreu markets are adverse selection and moral hazard. The

insufficiency of market prices for harmonizing non-cooperative policy actions

is especially serious when labor, goods or credit markets are in disequi--

librium (or in non—Wairasian equilibrium) and non—price rationing occurs.

In addition, the non—atomistic nature of national policy makers means that

they do not necessarily treat market prices or other policy makers' actions

as parametric when designing policies that are optimal from a national per-

spective. Government behavior in countries other than Andorra, Lichtenstein,

Luxembourg, etc., is more properly viewed as a non—cooperative dynamic game

against other governments and against markets with anticipating (even if

competitive) private agents. In these markets some governments will be

large participants.

       To assert that, given externalities and non—competitive behavior

by governments, there exists scope for global welfare improving policy

coordination schemes that move the world economy closer to the contract
                                                                    4


curve, is not to argue that there may not also be many "cooperative" schemes

that will result (or in the past have resulted) in reduced global welfare.

Nor does the merely qualitative proposition that there exist welfare im—

proving arrangements for international cooperation and coordination deny

the possibility that the quantitative significance of the improvement could

be slight and/or highly uncertain. The task of quantifying the fruits of

international policy coordination is an important one but lies beyond the

scope of this paper. In what follows I propose to study the design of

efficient disinflationary policies in an interdependent economic system.

The formal vehicle for this analysis is a small and simple analytical two—

country macroeconomic rational expectations model.2 I will start with the

case of the flex—price New Classical wonderland in which credibility of

monetary policy is necessary and sufficient for costless disinflation. The

consequences of successive concessions to realism can then be traced in

a relatively straightforward manner. The consequences of unilateral and

coordinated policy design and implementation are emphasized throughout.

       In what follows, "first—best" policies which eliminate inflation at

a stroke without output or unemployment costs will almost always exist,

and can be derived by inspection. It will therefore not be necessary

formally to specify an objective functional penalizing deviations from

zero inflation and from full employment or capacity output. The paper

does not deal at all with the "incentive—compatibility" of the first—

best policies, i.e., with whether these policies are time—consistent.




2The analysis relies heavily on the single—country analysis of efficient
 disinflationary policy in Buiter and Miller [1983b]. The two—country
 model is a slight extension of the model used in Miller [1982].

II.    A Model in Which Credibility of Monetary Policy Is Necessary and

       Sufficient for a Costless Sustained Reduction in Inflation

        The various models to be considered in this paper will differ from

each other only as regards the specification of the inflation process.

They will have a common set of portfolio balance equations and output

market equilibrium equations. These are given in equations (1)—(7). Starred

variables relate to the foreign country, unstarred variables to the home

country. All variables except for interest rates, measures of fiscal stance

and tax rates are in logarithms. The notation is as follows. m is the

nominal stock of money, p the consumer price index, y real output, r the

short nominal interest rate, e the nominal exchange rate, measured as the

number of units of home currency perunit of foreign currency, £ is an

index of fiscal stance, v the value added deflator at factor cost, r the
                                                                   1
indirect tax rate, 9 a measure of real money balances, c international com-

petitiveness or the real exchange rate and ii the instantaneous proportional

rate of growth of the nominal money stock.

        All parameters are non—negative.                denotes the right—hand side

time derivative of x. Expectations are formed rationally. E denotes the

conditional rational expectation operator at time t.

       Equations (la) and (ib) are standard domestic and foreign money
demand functions. Demand for domestic output, in (2a) is a decreasing

function of the real interest rate and an increasing function of competi—

tiveness, of real money balances, of the degree to which fiscal policy is

expansionary, as measured by f ,         and of the foreign level of economic

activity. The demand for foreign output is specified analogously in (2b).

       The money stock is to be interpreted as narrow money, say the mone-

tary base. Domestic money is held only by domestic residents, for domestic

transactions purposes. There is no direct currency substitution. This

seems reasonable as domestic money is dominated as a store of value by

short domestic bonds and foreign money by short foreign bonds. Between

these two interest-bearing assets there is perfect substitutability. Equa-

tion (3) represents uncovered interest parity, the outcome of perfect markets

and risk-neutral speculative behavior. The consumer price index is a weighted

average of the two national value added deflators as shown in (4a) and (4b).

Indirect taxes can drive a wedge between factor costs and market prices.3



   e absence of explicit consideration of the government budget idçntity is
justified as follows.   In natural units using upper case letters) the domestic
output market equilihrium condition and public sector budget identity (under
a freely floating exchange rate regime) can be written as follows:
                                                                                       7

        In the New Classical wonderland of this section, output is always

equal to its exogenous capacity or full employment level, i.e.,


(8a)          y


(8b)          y* =y*

        What permits this is the perfect flexibility of the domestic and

foreign price levels and (in the background) of domestic and foreign money

wages. GDP deflators have the flexibility normally associated with the

exchange rate and othet financial asset prices. The domestic and foreign

rates of inflation can be expressed as in (9a,b)

G denotes exhaustive public spending on goods and services, T total taxes
net of transfers. B is the nominal stock of government bonds. f, the
effect of fiscal policy on demand in equation (2a) is given by

positive, then FG >           FT
       I assume that as regards bond financing the domestic authorities
throughout follow a constant financial crowding out pressure" policy
which consists in keeping constant the real stock of government debt B/P.
The foreign authorities similarly keep B*/P* constant. Thus B = B(P/P)
and B* = B*(P*/P*) . Whether or not B/P and B*/P* are arguments in the
money demand functions and/or the output demand functions, their constancy
makes it unnecessary to consider them further. I am ignoring as of second—
order importance the fact that domestic bonds may be held abroad and
foreign bonds domestically. Let Bddenote domestic holdings of domestic
government debt and B foreign holdings of domestic government debt.
Then B E Bd + B and, by analogy, B*    B*d B* . The proper argument is

           Equivalently                (except at those instants at which "news" arrives),

we can look at the expected rates of inflation given in (9'a) and (9'b):

 Even if total (global) real bond wealth doesn't change, a redistribution
 of a given total through current account deficits and surpluses (or
 through capital gains and losses) may change total demand for a country's
 output if the marginal propensity to spend out of bond wealth on that
 country's output differs between the two countries. I rule out any such
 "transfer effects" either on total spending or on spending on the mdi-
 vidual countries' outputs.

            Given our bond financing assumption, we can write

                               e

 Given M/P , C and (r —                           , the    authorities can use total taxes net of
 transfers to choose the rate of monetary growth, p . This still leaves
 them real spending, C, to set the current fiscal stimulus f at its desired
 value. Note, however, that since total tax receipts T (and C) are "assigned"
 to p and f , the indirect tax rate T cannot be varied independently.
 Higher values of T. must be matched by a lower direct tax rate Td •                          For

          The system given in (9 ) has three non-predetermined, forward—looking

or'jump'state variables. The domestic and foreign value added deflators,

v and v are flexible, market-clearing prices, as is the nominal exchange

rate e .          The boundary conditions for-             9.      rn-v ,     9    m -   v   and

c     e +     v   -    v   take therefore the form not of given initial conditions

but of the terminal or transversality condition that the solution to (10)

should lie on the stable manifold (if this exists). For this terminal con-

dition to generate a unique, convergent solution trajectory for                               9. ,


and    c ,        given the actual and anticipated future values of the ten forcing
variables, the characteristic equation of (10) should have three unstable

roots, i.e., roots with positive real parts. It is easily seen that if

there are no real balance effects in the two countries' -IS curves (c =                                   = 0)
the three characteristic roots are p1 =                                , p2   =      and

23     [_l +y*_*]/[ct +ct* - 1]             .   The first two are always positive, the

third will be positive if a +              c    > 1   ,         i.e.,   if on average the residents

of each of the two countries have a preference, at the margin, for spending

on own        output.          If both a and a* exceed one half, this condition will

be satisfied.4 The characteristic roots are continuous functions of the

      in equation (10). A sufficient condition for (10) to have 3 unstable

characteristic roots is therefore a +                     a*     > 1    and small real balance effects.

          The steady state conditions of the model have the familiar long-run

classical or monetarist properties. The same set of steady-state conditions,

given in (11) below, will also characterize the other variants of the model

analyzed in this paper, although the latter exhibit "Keynesian" behavior

outside the steady state.

          In   the long run, real interest                         rates are equalized and the real exchange

rate is constant. Differences in monetary growth are reflected in the rate

of depreciation of the exchange rate. The                              world real   interest rate rises

with    fiscal         expansion at home and abroad. An increase in capacity output

at home or abroad                 lowers the long-run real interest rate if
&*(l   —•.ck) -        *>0             and S(i -       c*k*)   -       >0   respectively.   If there is
no   real balance effect at home or abroad, a change in the rate of growth

of the nominal money stock at home (abroad) raises the domestic (foreign)

nominal interest rate one-for-one and leaves the long—run real interest
                                                                                  12


 rate unaffected. If there is a real balance effect at home ( > 0)                an

 increase in monetary growth at home raises the nominal interest rate at

home less than one-for-one. The real interest rate (at home and abroad)

 is reduced.

        Absent real balance effects, changes in money growth rates leave

 the long-run real exchange rate unaffected. With a real balance effect

 at home, higher money growth at home means a long-run depreciation of the

 real exchange.rate. The mechanism is that, if A > 0            ,   higher   money growth

 and domestic inflation lowers the real stock of money balances and thus

 the demand for output. An improvement in competitiveness is required to

rebalance the output market. Fiscal expansion at home causes long-run

 real appreciation while fiscal expansion abroad has the opposite effect.

 It should be clear that a proportional shift in the levels of the domestic

 or foreign money stock paths will not affect the nominal or real interest

 rate or the real exchange rate but will be associated with equal propor-

 tional shifts in the levels of the paths of p ,            p and e.

The crucial aspect of equation (15) is that the state variables depend

only on current anticipations of future values of the forcing variables.

Current and past behavior of the exogenous variables and the policy instru-

ments matters only to the extent that it influences expectations of the

future.

          From the general dynamic specification of the model in equations

(l)-(8) and from the steady state conditions in equation (11), or from

equations (9a), (9b) or (9'a), (Y'b) and (10) the following result can

be obtained by inspection. The initial situation is one of constant values

of all forcing variables (i.e., -              =.         =0   ).



Proposition    1:    In the flexible price model, the credible announcement of

an immediate, permanent reduction in current and future monetary growth by

i      in the home   country is necessary and sufficient for an immediate, sus-

tained reduction in domestic inflation by Ap

6 T      denotes the transpose of y
                                                                            15


 It will be obvious that in this model with its instantaneous market-

clearing features there will never be any output costs of bringing down

inflation. Lack of credibility about future monetary growth may, however,

prevent a desired reduction in inflation, no matter how faithfully the

authorities restrict the current monetary growth rate. E.g., the possi—

bility of the election at some future date of an inflation-prone govern-

ment may prevent even a very conservative government from translating

monetary deceleration during its term of office into corresponding reductions

in current inflation. It is not sufficient to commit oneself, one must also

be able to commit one's successors. The recognition of this dilemma is

behind some of the calls for embedding monetarypolicy in a constitutional

framework (or tying it into a constitutional straightjacket, depending on one's

point of view) in order to safeguard it against political manipulation.

       The response of the system to the immediate credible permanent reduc-

tion in domestic monetary growth is especially transparent when there are no

real balance effects (c =     = 0).     The transition to the new steady state

with the lower rate of inflation is instantaneous. All real variables

other than the domestic rate of inflation and the domestic stock of real

money balances remain unchanged. The domestic nominal interest rate de-

clines by the same amount as the reduction in domestic monetary growth

and domestic inflation. Foreign inflation remains unchanged. The rate

of depreciation of the domestic currency ()       also   declines by the amount

of the reduction in     and     .     Real competitiveness remains constant.

Note however, that both the domestic value added deflator v and the

nominal exchange rate undergo an immediate discontinuous or discrete drop

at the time of the policy announcement with Lw =         = XLi   .   The reason

for this is apparent in the domestjc money demand function (la). Lower
                                                                                 18


competitiveness must decline (foreign competitiveness must improve). In

this case the credible announcement of the immediate, permanent reduction

in       is accompanied by a discrete drop in v and a discrete increase

in v .     While    c falls, the impact -effect on e is ambiguous.

         There are several ways of avoiding these spillovers from domestic

monetary growth reductions on real variables that concern foreigners.

The home country could stop its real interest rate (and thus the world

real interest rate) from rising by contractionary fiscal policy with

     =      .   This would also stabilize the real exchange rate and stop
the foreign nominal interest rate from rising. The foreign country cannot

use fiscal policy alone to stabilize both its real interest rate and its

real exchange rate. To prevent the real interest rate from rising, con-

tTactionary fiscal policy abroad is called for (with Lf* =          LLi) while        to

stop foreign competitiveness from improving, expansionary fiscal policy abroad

is called for with f*                         .   It   is clear from equations

(hg) and (llh) ththe foreign money growth rate p*              and the foreign

fiscal stance, f* can be used jointly to stabilize the real interest

rate and the real exchange rate. This does mean, of course, that the foreign

country cannot choose to stabilize its real exchange rate and its real

interest rate while maintaining its previous rate of inflation.

         It is possible for the two countries jointly to choose any pair

of inflation rates        and     while   maintaining the old real interest

rate and competitiveness by using both money growth rates and fiscal in-

struments appropriately.

III.    Models in Which Smart Demand Management Is Necessary and Sufficient

        for a Costless, Sustained Reduction in Inflation

        The main reason for spending time with the classical model in which,

given credibility, nothing can go wrong, is that it provides good insight

into what can go wrong in more realistic and useful models.

        It is generally accepted that the level of money wages and the GDP

deflator are not like the foreign exchange rate or the stock market index.

A common alternative view is that the value added deflator (or the wage)

changes only gradually over time in response to excess .demand or supply

pressure, e.g., through an augmented Phillips curve:



(16)          -(v -   0t)    =               + ir   , i>0       ;     0<      0 < 1



(16')                 -
                          0*t)    =   j*(y* _j*) + * ,              iP* > 0        ;     0 < 0* < 1.



        In C16) it is recognized that the direct tax rate may influence

the behavior of before-tax wages and other factor payments. The two ex-

treme possibilities are that it is the rate of change of after-tax factor

rentals (v -          and   v *   -      with       0 =         =1    )       or       the rate of change

of before-tax factor rentals             (   v and v with 0 =                          0=0      )   that   is

                                                                                          and       —
determined through the Phillips curve mechanism. V                            —
                                                                                                        Old
are treated as sluggish or predetermined (i.e., incapable of making a dis—

continuous jump at a point in time). The sacrifice ratio depends crucially

on the specification of the process governing ir                          ,   the augmentation term
in the Phillips curve or "core inflation." Note that the old-fashioned

        There are at least three well-known models of the inflation process

which combine the view that v -                  the prive level) moves sluggishly

with the view that             (core inflation) moves flexibly. Two are repre-

sented in (16) plus (17) or (18) below, the third in (19a), (l9b), (19c):

        The first model (17) has core inflation equal to the current money growth

rate (Dornbusch [1980], Buiter and Miller [1981]. The second (18) has core

inflation given by '           or     ,   the    right-side derivative of the price

level path of the classical, flex-price model of the previous section.

This means that core inflation equals the rate of change of the price level

in the classical equilibrium model except at those points where that rate

of change becomes infinite because the classical equilibrium price level makes

a discrete juirip. Price equations such as (16) and (18) have been used by

Mussa [1981] and Barro and Grossman [1976].

        Equations (l9a), (l9b), and (l9c) represent a contract model in

which the level of the current contract wage, w ,               depends on current
expectations of future values of                and excess demands and the

current value added deflator depends on past contract wages. This model

is due to Calvo [1982a, b, c] and can be viewed as a continuous time version

when we solve for v and w explicitly as follows:

           K   in (20a) and (20b) is an arbitrary constant of integration, to

be determined by a terminal boundary condition. It is easily seen that

in models with a well-defined steady state rate of inflation and monetary

growth p ,           the arbitrary constant K is equal to                             .   Note that

while          is predetermined in (20a), the current contract wage w is,

among other things, an increasing function of current expectations of future

excess demand and of the transversality condition determining steady-state

inflation through K .               Since w is flexible, the rate of change of the
value added deflator,                 ,   is flexible (see equation (19a)). The effect
of   dixect taxes on v if 0 > 0 also introduces an element of domestic

cost      flexibility. All three models in equations (16)-(l9) thus have flex-

ible core inflation. It may therefore appear that the credible announcement

of   an   immediate, permanent reduction in money growth would again be sufficient
                                                                          22



(and necessary) for reducing domestic inflation without output costs.

This is not correct, because an immediate transition to   lower rate.of

inflation would require, if the interest-elasticity of demand for money

balances is negative, that the stock of real money balances is increased.

In the classical flex-price model, the price level drop shown in Figure 1

brought about the necessary increase in real money balances. Absent price

level flexibility, the authorities must either increase the level of the

nominal stock of money balances, or cut direct or indirect taxes so as

to reduce the market price level for any given level of after-tax factor

income or prevent the fall in nominal interest rates associated with lower

steady state inflation by engaging in expansionary fiscal policy. Therefore:


Proposition 2:   In the model with a predetermined price level but flexible

core inflation, credible, immediate, permanent reduction in money growth

in the home country is necessary for an immediate, costless, sustained

reduction in domestic inflation by the same amount. In addition, the

authorities must either generate an immediate increase in the level of

the real money stock (by a 'lump' in the nominal money stock or by

direct or indirect tax cuts, with all fiscal variables adjusted in such

a way as to keep aggregate demand equal to full employment supply) or

engage in a set of fiscal measures (e.g., an increase in f) that prevent

a decline in the domestic nominal interest rate. Only the first of

these two options avoids international spillover effects (assuming no

real balance effects).

       In all three of these models one country's inflation can be

eliminated costlessly and at a stroke, given credibility of announce—
                                                                            23


ments of future money growth and given a policy for mimicking or avoiding

the need for, the price level drop shown in Figure 1.

       We can write the domestic monetary equilibrium condition as

                          Ord
       To achieve an instantaneous transition to a new low—inflation steady

state, if theforeign country does not change any of its policy instruments,

the home country's policy instruments should satisfy:



(3)           0d -              +       (A* + (la)(1* + c*X*))


              =       x[*y +            + *A* + (a—i) (* + c*X*)c]
                                                A

where A =     (y÷cX)*     + (1* + *A*)5
                                                                            24




         If there is no real balance effect at home or abroad, the "money

jump"   policy with m =    -XI   would be the simplest way to proceed. The

level of the nominal money stock is raised once—and—for—all at the same

time that its rate of growth is lowered. While such a policy combination

may appear to be prone to credibility problems, it should be noted that

it would be implemented automatically if the government announced a cred-

ible nominal income target rather than a monetary growth target. A nominal

income target is of course a "velocity-corrected" monetary target which

would automatically allow for the decline in velocity associated with the

transition to a lower rate of inflation. The jump in real money balances

can, from (23) also be achieved with an unchanged nominal money stock,

through a cut in indirect taxes balanced in terms Of revenue by an increase

in direct taxes, provided 0 < 1      ,   i.e.   provided indirect taxes have a

larger immediate effect on the price level than direct taxes.7

         Absent real balance effects, changes in in       or     would permit

costless and instantaneous domestic disinflation without any real spill-

overs to the foreign country. The real interest rate, the real exchange

rate and the foreign country's nominal interest rate would be unaffected.

         Expansionary domestic fiscal policy (an increase in £ at the same

time that i     is   reduced) will not in general be consistent with an immediate,

costless transition toa lower inflation steady state, except for a closed

economy or a small open economy. Even without real balance effects, an

increase in f will be associated with a higher long—run real interest rate

and a long—run appreciation of the domestic real exchange rate. The short—

run result of such a policy combination would be to start a boom abroad,

stimulated by the improvement in foreign competitiveness. The combination

of domestic money growth reductions and fiscal stimulus that would satisfy



7Retnember that, with public spending constant, we must have          +     = 0.
                                                                            25

   the desired new low   inflation   domestic steady state conditions, would

in all likelihood create a transitional slump at home. With a real balance

effect even the money jump and indirect tax cut policies will have reper-

cussions abroad. The domestically correct steady state policy combination

is again likely to cause a slump at home and a boom abroad.

       If the domestic authorities adopt a money jump or indirect tax cut

policy6 in conjunction with the money growth deceleration when real balance

effects are present, the foreign authorities will in general need to change

two policy instruments to stay at full employment. They could, e.g., accept

a higher real (and nominal) interest rate and an improved level of foreign

competitiveness by implementing a discontinuous, once-and-for--all reduc—

tion in the level of the foreign nominal money stock (or an increase in

foreign indirect taxes if O <    1 )    and   a   change in f*   The same

result holds qualitatively whether or not real balance effects are

present, if the home country lowers money growth and raises f at

the same time.

       A combined common reduction in money growth rates at home and abroad

will cause a global slump unless both countries undertake simultaneously

noney jump policies, indirect tax cuts or fiscal stimuli. If there are

no real balance effects, money jumps or indirect tax cuts in the two coun-

tries permit an immediate, costless global disinflation at a constant real

interest rate and real exchange rate. Even if there are real balance

effects, an immediate costless global disinflation will be possible, with

money jumps or indirect tax cuts in both countries, at a constant real ex-

change rate but a higher real interest rate, if the two countries have



6"Indirect tax cut policy" refers to a constant revenue change from in-
direct to direct taxes. There are therefore no direct aggregate demand
effects of such a policy.

identical     structures. VJithout this restriction, however, the two                fiscal

instruments f          and f* will have to be used jointly with the reductions

in    money growth and the money jumps or         indirect tax cuts to achieve         effi-

cient global disinflation.

         How important are the costs of badly-designed disinflation policy?

Consider as a simple illustrative example            the    wage-price block of equations

(4a), (16) and (17) where core inflation equals the rate of growth of the

money stock. A little manipulation yields



                      -ds =
(24)
                                [m() -p() - (m(t) -p(t))] +O[Td() - Td(t)j
                                +   [t.() - t.(O)] + (1-a) [c()    -
                                                                       c(O)]}

          The cumulative net undiscounted output            cost given in (24) increases
with    the amount by which real money balances must              be increased in the long
run.     Without     a nominal money stock jump,     the long-run change in rn-p
equals -Ar where                means long—run or steady state change. In the


simplest     case, without real balance effects, r =                    .   The sacrifice

ratio is therefore

         A   unilateral reduction        in i has   a sacrifice ratio of X/ip         , in-
creasing in the interest sensitivity of money demand and decreasing in

the    slope of     the Phillips curve. As is       clear   from (24) or (25) money jumps

or tax cuts     could    reduce the sacrifice ratio to zero. Note, however, that

a real appreciation of the currency (c <             0) also      lowers the sacrifice ratio.

           Lc enters the   foreign   cost calculation. The anti—inflationary gains

of real exchange rate appreciation are strictly beggar—thy—neighbor. In

addition, the short—run gains from exchange rate appreciation accruing to

a single country may well overstate the long—run gains. Note that without

real balance effects c = 0 after a unilateral reduction in p. As is shown,

e.g., in Buiter and Miller [1983aJ, any initial anti—inflationary gains due

to exchange rate appreciation must be "handed back" as the loss of competitive-

ness unwinds in the long run, since in their model c = 0.             Of course the

timing of the anti—inflationary successes will be different when the exchange

rate is permitted to appreciate sharply in the short run, and early reduc-

tions in inflation may be worthwhile in themselves, even if the net output

cost of fighting inflation is not affected. It should also be pointed out

that the model (like all models in this paper) is assumed to be structurally

invariant with respect to the class of policy changes under consideration.

It may be that the "short sharp shock" of a sudden exchange rate appreciation

permits one to "over—write" the existing inflation equations. The slug-

gishness or inertia of the price—wage mechanism could vanish when the

government invests in credibility by engineering a brutal appreciation of

the exchange rate. I do not consider that possibility in this paper. In

any case, the foreign government would be disinvesting in credibility by

suffering a brutal depreciation of the exchange rate.

           The moral of this section is that if there is only price level

inertia but no inflation inertia, well—designed aggregate demand manage—

ment policy (changes in p, m, f, p*, m* and f*) are sufficient to ensure

efficient, i.e., costless and instantaneous unilateral or joint reductions

in inflation.8 When a greater degree of inertia is attributed to the wage—

price process, this fairly optimistic conclusion vanishes.


80f course, indirect tax cuts may be helpful, if 0 <        0   <   1, even if f is
 kept constant.

IV.     Models in Which Genius or Good Luck Are Necessary for a Costless,

        Sustained Reduction in Inflation

         Many economists have a view of the wage—price process that implies

considerably more sluggishness and inertia than has been permitted in any

of the models considered thus far. Multi—period contract models such as

Taylor's [19801 are one well—known example.

          Some of the essential features of this entire class of models are

represented by the simplest possible "adaptive" core inflation process.

It is characterized by a sluggish price level and, subject to some quali—

.fications, a sluggish rate of core inflation. For the home country equa—

tions (4a) and (16) are combined with (25). For the foreign country

equations (4b) and (16') are joined with (.25'):


(25)             =   -rr)   ,        >   0


(25')


It is easily checked that for the home country the sacrifice ratio is

now given by:


                                             fa

                                                                         -    1[e    +        +



          Note that a money level jump no longer helps to avoid or even reduce

the    output costs of bringing down inflation.                      Barring changes in tax

rates or in the real exchange rate, both v and                           ir   are predetermined and

the sacrifice ratio depends only on the slope of the short-run Phillips

curve,       ,   arid the speed of adjustment of core inflation,                         .   The foreign

sacrifice ratio is given by:


9it may still be a useful (or even essential) component of a complete policy
package capable of achieving an instantaneous transition to a lower rate of
inflation steady state.

          Following Okun [1978] we can, as was discussed in the previous sec-

tion, use direct or indirect tax cuts to break core inflation. Unless

6 =   1   and direct tax increases fully offset the price level effect of

equal revenue indirect tax cuts, an indirect tax cut financed by a direct

tax increase can melt core inflation. Even if 0 = 1        a net cut in overall

taxes can have the desired effect on core inflation. This exercise is

then of course complicated by the fact that tax cuts implemented for their

cost-reducing effects will also have aggregate demand effects (i.e., £

would increase). Public spending will thei have.to be lowered in such a

way as to maintain aggregate demand at full employment. Note the opposite

effect of changes in c on the domestic and foreign sacrifice ratios. If

the home country through its policy actions were to achieve a long-run

appreciation of its real exchange rate (a decline in c )       then the foreign
country would, if its inflation objectives are constant, be forced to suffer

a cumulative net loss of output. But for this output loss the depreciation

of the foreign country's real exchange rate would result in a rise in

foreign core inflation.

          Note that if some form of incomes policy could shock core inflation,

i.e,, jump i ,      the   output cost of bringing down inflation could be re-

duced or even eliminated altogether without recourse to changes in the

tax structure (while keeping the aggregate demand effect of fiscal policy

constant) or to beggar-thy--neighbor, zero-sum attempts at "competitive

loss of competitiveness."

          The rewards from a successful incomes policy would be enormous. The

mechanism for achieving it, theoretically and in the light of historical
                                                                    30


experience, is problematic. With centralized wage bargaining and strong

unions capable of delivering on the shop floor wage agreements negotiated

centrally, it might be possible to achieve an anti—inflationary breakthrough

this way. With decentralized, non—synchronized and non—cooperative wage

bargaining someone has to go first while everyone wishes to go last. Pro-

posals for "real wage insurance" through the public purse, floated briefly

in the U.S.A. under Carter, may be helpful here. Tax—based income policies

are, if anything, primarily a means for lowering the natural rate of unem-

ployment (for raising y). They may, however, when they are introduced,

also serve to break the momentum of on—going core inflation.


Proposition 3: If there is both a predetermined price level and quasi—

predetermined, adaptive, core inflation, the policies required if both coun-

tries are to achieve an instantaneous and costless disinflation are the

following. Both countries have to announce and implement credible reductions

in the rate of growth of their nominal money stocks. Tax cuts (or indirect

to direct tax changes) have to be implemented to break core inflation. The

lower velocities associated with a successful transition to lower inflation

rates will have to be accommodated by a once—and—for—all increase in the

level of each country's nominal money stock. Public spending in each

country is to be adjusted so as to maintain aggregate demand at its full

employment level. Credible nominal income targeting could be a substitute

for the money growth deceleration and money level increase. Incomes policy,

if effective, could be a substitute for tax cuts.

            It might be argued that the view of core inflation embodied in

  equations (25) and (25') is both too "backward—looking" and too optimistic.

 Modern eclectic views of the wage—price process not only incorporate

  sluggishness in the level and rate of change of wages but also forward—

 looking behavior. They also view ir as strictly predetermined, i.e.

 unlike (25) and (25') changes in the price level brought about through

 changes in the exchange rate or tax rates, cannot move the level of ir

 discontinuously. This view is represented in equations (26), (27) and (26'),

  (27'):


 (26)             =
                      1(q—Tt)   ,           > 0



 (6')                 (q* -         ,               > 0



 (27)         Eq =    2(q-p)    ' 2         >   o


 (27')       Et* (q**) ,                         > 0



           q is the current rate of wage contract inflation.                          ,   core infla-
tion, has the interpretation of "the going rate." It is a function of past

contract inflation. Current contract inflation is a function of current

expectations of the future state of excess demand and of what the "going

rate" will be in the future.

         Solving for q and ¶                we find:



         q(t) = ¶(t)                2l (t-s)
(27)                     +
                             2Je
(28)     (t) =
                 ¶(t0)   +
                             12JJe

                                                2l        (s—z)
                                                                  Es[(y(z)_+oTd(z)+.(z)+(1_)c(z)Jdzds

         This solution makes sense only if

provided the relevant integrals exist), (27) and (28) simplify to:
                                                                   -   l   •   When   =
                                                                                          l   (and
                                                                          32




         q(t) = r(t)   +                  +
(27')
                           2iEt(y(s))ds

(28') (t) = (t0) + '2J JE(y(z)-dzds+12J
                      t0s              t0


         In   this model the current contract rate of inflation, q , is   non-

predetermined    but core inflation or "the going rate" is strictly predetermined.

Barring changes in tax rates and in the real exchange rate, current contract

inflation exceeds the going rate if    the "present value" of currently expected
future   excess demand is positive. Current core inflation equals core infla-

tion at some initial date plus an increasing function of the sum between that

initial date and the current date of the present value of future excess de-

mand expected at each instant between these two dates. Domestic current

contract inflation can be reduced instantaneously by long-run tax cuts or

long-run real exchange rate appreciation. Barring these two channels, only

credible announcements of (policies causing) future recessions can bring

down current contract inflation. Credibility remains central, but is no

longer sufficient to avoid costs. Core inflation cannot be brought down

instantaneously even when indirect or direct tax cuts or exchange rate ap-

preciation are announced credibly. It is a function of the entire history

of past expectations of future excess demands, tax cuts and real exchange

rate appreciation. Barring the last two influences, it is (past expec-

tations of) credible future recessions that bring down core inflation.

Anticipated current and future reductions in nominal income growth or

monetary growth can no longer be translated painlessly into lower inflation.

They work if and to the extent that they create expectations of future

recessions. Note that this can create some awkward credibility and time—

consistency problems. Assume the authorities announce policies that will

cause a deep recession at some future date. It is possible that inflation
                                                                        33

and core inflation are brought down to their desired level before the

recession has actually started. What government,, having licked inflation

with the help of the announcement effects of future recessions, would then

create a recession merely to validate these past expectations? These

expectations would be bygones and a government reoptimizing after inflation

had been brought down would be tempted to cheat on its earlier policy

commitments. Such a policy announcement would therefore not be credible.

       Both global and single—country attempts to reduce inflation will,

in the most realistic of our models, always take time. A single country

may achieve its anti—inflationary objectives without unemployment and out-

put costs by using cost—reducing tax cuts and real exchange rate appreciation.

The world as a whole can rely only on 'tax cuts and, where feasible, incomes

policy. The transition to the low inflation equilibrium will involve the

internal and external coordination of time—varying trajectories for mone-

tary growth (including money stock jumps), tax rates and public spending.

If a serious research effort gets underway now, we may be ready with sen-

sible policy packages when there is once again the perceived need to accord

high priority to reducing inflation, after the next inflationary outburst.



V. Conclusion

       This paper has considered anti—inflationary policy design in an open

interdependent economic system. Policy instrument values or rules were

treated as though imposed "exogenously." Both for positive analysis (how

is policy actually determined?) and for normative analysis (how should policy be

designed to achieve a given set of objectives?) it is essential that policy be-

havior be endogenized through the explicit derivation of decision rules that re-

flect the objectives and the actual and perceived constraints (economic, technical,
                                                                         34

administrative, political, and informational) of the policy makers.

       Finally, it is important not to be misled by the deterministic nature

of the models considered in this paper, into believing that credibility and

precommitment require inflexible policy design. Credibility requires that

preannounced rules are followed faithfully. These rules can

be contingent or conditional in nature. Provided the nature of the rules is

understood by private agents——and this means       simplicity and transparence

but not rigidity——and provided the government's record in sticking to its

commitments can be monitored promptly and at little cost, optimal or even

merely sensible policy design can incorporate scope for flexible

response to new information about the external environment and about actions

of other players.

       The widely known   result,   that in models with rationally anticipating,

forward—looking private agents, optimal policy design will not in general

he time—consistent, has led to resignation to the pursuit of time—

consistent but suboptimal policies or even of time—inconsistent and

suboptimal policies. The moral is surely quite different. Time—

inconsistency of optimal plans could be viewed as a call for institutional

innovation and reform aimed at making the optimal policy time—consistent.

New rewards, sanctions, threats or promises may be designed to render

optimal policy incentive—compatible given the new, purpose—built con-

straints. Institutional, and indeed constitutional innovation can

then be compared with resignation to the th best.
