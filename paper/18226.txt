                                             ABSTRACT

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) is the single most effective HIV prevention
intervention in practice today. Nonetheless, little reliable empirical evidence exists on the behavioral
effects of PMTCT. This paper documents the rapid expansion of access to PMTCT in Zambia during
the period 2000-2007 and provides some of the first evidence on the change in reproductive behavior
associated with PMTCT scale-up. The results of a primarily descriptive analysis suggest that PMTCT
may have generated increases in knowledge about PMTCT and MTCT, large reductions in child mortality
and pregnancy rates, and smaller changes in breastfeeding rates. However, additional research is required
to address the potential endogeneity of PMTCT availability.

1     Introduction

The rapid expansion of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in

Sub-Saharan Africa in the past decade is one of the great humanitarian successes of this

era. At the turn of the 21st century, PMTCT was virtually unavailable for the vast majority

of women in Sub-Saharan Africa, the region of the world most aﬀected by the HIV/AIDS

pandemic. By 2010, 54 percent of HIV positive pregnant women in the region received

PMTCT (WHO 2010).

    This scale-up surely has saved millions of lives. Five percent of adults age 15-49 in Sub-

Saharan Africa are HIV positive (UNAIDS 2010). In the absence of PMTCT, a HIV positive

woman will transmit the virus in utero, during childbirth, or through breastfeeding with a

cumulative probability of as much as 45 percent (Dabis and Ekpini 2002). A HIV positive

infant will die with probability between 25 and 50 percent by age 1 (Spira et al 1999, Taha

et al 1999, Dabis et al 2001, Brahmbhatt et al 2001). PMTCT can reduce the cumulative

transmission probability from a HIV positive woman to her newborn child to as little as 3

percent (Dabis and Ekpini 2002, Canning 2006).

    This paper documents the expansion of PMTCT in Zambia over the period 2001-2007

and examines changes in reproductive behavior associated with the local introduction of

PMTCT. In doing so, it provides some of the first evidence on reproductive behavior in the

context of the widespread availability of the single most eﬀective HIV prevention intervention

we know of in practice today, an intervention that dramatically reduces child mortality risk.

Although the current analysis is mostly descriptive and does not attempt to identify the

causal eﬀects of PMTCT availability, it provides suggestive evidence that the rapid scale-up


                                              1
of PMTCT has generated large changes in reproductive behavior.

   Between 2001 and the end of 2007, the number of health facilities in Zambia oﬀering

PMTCT increased from fewer than 6 to nearly 600. By the end of this period, more than

40 percent of health facilities oﬀered PMTCT. Because the expansion occurred with greater

intensity in urban areas than in rural areas, individual level coverage rates increased even

more rapidly.

   Although it is clear that PMTCT changes the incentives that women and couples face in

making decisions about reproductive behavior, a priori the sign of the fertility response to

PMTCT is ambiguous. For example, the standard quantity-quality model following Becker

and Lewis (1973) illuminates a mechanism by which PMTCT reduces fertility and one by

which PMTCT increases fertility. First, PMTCT reduces the shadow price of child quantity.

Because each birth is more likely to survive into older ages, the expected number of births to

achieve a desired number of surviving children has fallen, in turn reducing the shadow price

of child quantity and leading to an increase in fertility. Second, PMTCT simultaneously

reduces the shadow price of child quality. Because each child is more likely to survive into

older ages, household investments in children’s human capital made at a young age are more

likely to realize a larger return. That is, the shadow price of child quality has fallen, inducing

a reduction in fertility due to the quantity-quality tradeoﬀ embedded in this model.

   I use newly assembled data on the expansion of HIV/AIDS services in Zambia to examine

changes in reproductive knowledge and behavior associated with the local introduction of

PMTCT. A primarily descriptive analysis of conditional means yields three main findings.

First, the local introduction of PMTCT was associated with an increase in knowledge of

mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and an increase in knowledge of prevention of mother-

                                                2
to-child transmission (PMTCT). Second, the local introduction of PMTCT was associated

with a decrease in child mortality and pregnancy rates. Third, the local introduction of

PMTCT was associated with (proportionally) smaller reductions in breastfeeding rates. An

analysis of the heterogeneity in these changes by the likelihood the respondent was HIV

positive provides mixed support for a causal interpretation of these diﬀerences in conditional

means. In addition, I uncover several significant diﬀerences by age and education level of

the respondent.

   Future research will address the endogeneity of PMTCT expansion. PMTCT largely was

introduced at existing health clinics and PMTCT expansion occurred with greater intensity

in urban areas. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that time-invariant as well as time-varying

factors aﬀecting reproductive behavior varied systematically with the intensity of PMTCT

expansion. In the interim, the results of this analysis provide some of the first evidence on

PMTCT expansion and reproductive behavior.

   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I describe the existing literature

in three related topics: (i) PMTCT and fertility, (ii) HIV/AIDS and fertility, and (iii)

child mortality risk and fertility. Section 3 provides a few clinical facts about PMTCT

and discusses some possible behavioral responses. Section 4 describes the data collected for

this project. Section 5 discusses PMTCT scale-up in Zambia. Section 6 presents five sets

of outcomes related to PMTCT expansion: (i) knowledge of mother-to-child transmission

(MTCT), (ii) knowledge of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), (iii) child

mortality, (iv) pregnancy, and (v) breastfeeding. Section 7 discusses the implications of these

findings as well as an agenda for future research on PMTCT and reproductive outcomes.

2     Existing literature

2.1    PMTCT and fertility

There is no existing economic literature on the behavioral eﬀects of PMTCT. Moreover, there

is only a nascent literature in public health on the behavioral eﬀects of PMTCT. However,

a small number of studies examine fertility intentions in the context of PMTCT.

    The limited empirical evidence on fertility intentions in the context of PMTCT suggests

that access to PMTCT may increase fertility among HIV positive women with known HIV

status. Cooper et al (2007) conducted in-depth interviews with 61 HIV positive men and

women in Cape Town, South Africa. Providing information about PMTCT during the course

of the interview increased the desire to have (more) children. However, female interviewees

expressed additional concern about the availability of ART to ensure that they would be

alive to take care of their children. Peltzer et al (2009) investigate fertility intentions among

a sample of women with known HIV status receiving postnatal care in Tembo District, South

Africa. Among HIV positive women, knowledge of PMTCT was associated with increased

desire for pregnancy.



2.2    HIV/AIDS and fertility

A variety of studies examine the impact of HIV/AIDS on fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa.

These studies generally investigate the total eﬀect of HIV/AIDS on fertility, rather than

focusing on the child mortality risk channel. Because PMTCT only directly reduces child

mortality risky without directly aﬀecting adult mortality risk, it is unlikely that PMTCT

simply will reverse the eﬀects of HIV/AIDS. Nonetheless, these studies represent an impor-

                                               4
tant related literature, particularly because of the dearth of evidence on the fertility response

to PMTCT.

   The initial economic analyses of the fertility response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic sug-

gested that fertility in much of Sub-Saharan Africa may have fallen in response to the

HIV/AIDS pandemic. Young (2007) found that demand for children, and in turn fertil-

ity, fell in response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Similarly, Juhn et al (2009) found that

although community-level HIV prevalence had no eﬀect on fertility, HIV positive women in

Sub-Saharan Africa had fewer children.

   A second wave of economic research on this topic presents new evidence seemingly con-

tradicting these initial findings. Kalemli-Ozcan and Turan (2010) revisited Young’s (2007)

study and found that restricting the empirical analysis to the period for which HIV data are

actually available suggests that HIV actually increased fertility.1 Fortson (2009) and Fink

and Linnemayr (2009) present evidence suggesting that the HIV/AIDS pandemic has not

aﬀected fertility on average. However, Fink and Linnemayr (2009) also argues that fertility

fell among more educated women in response to HIV/AIDS. More generally, Kalemli-Ozcan

(2010) shows that the estimated relationship between HIV prevalence and fertility is very

sensitive to the source of variation in HIV prevalence (e.g., cross-sectional versus time series)

and suggests that HIV/AIDS has had little eﬀect on fertility.

   In contrast, it appears that the majority of public health and medical studies on HIV/AIDS

and fertility find lower fertility among HIV positive women than among HIV negative women.

For example, Gray et al (1998) found that pregnancy rates in Uganda were lower among HIV
   1
     In the absence of complete data on HIV prevalence at the start of the pandemic, Young (2007) assumed
that HIV prevalence was zero from 1980 through 1998.




                                                   5
positive women than among HIV negative women, partly due to an increased likelihood of

pregnancy loss and partly due to lower rates of conception. Likewise, Carpenter et al (1997),

Zaba and Gregson (1998), Glynn et al (2000), Fabiani et al (2006), Kongnyuy and Wiysonge

(2008), and Chen and Walker (2010) present evidence indicating that fertility is lower among

HIV positive women than among HIV negative women. In a study examining changes in

fertility among women receiving a HIV positive test result in Malawi, Hoﬀman et al (2008)

found that pregnancy rates fell among HIV positive women who learned of their HIV status.



2.3    Child mortality risk and fertility

A broader economic literature examines the eﬀect of child mortality on fertility. Using

data from three diﬀerent settings, Ben-Porath (1976) found that in each setting increased

(realized) child mortality was associated with higher subsequent fertility, consistent with

households engaging in replacement fertility. In contrast, Wolpin (1984) found evidence of

only a small replacement fertility eﬀect. However, Wolpin (1984) found a large negative

eﬀect of child mortality risk on fertility.

   Among more recent studies, Doepke (2005) examined the relationship between child

mortality and fertility in a model following Barro and Becker (1989), as well as in several

variants of this model. Doepke (2005) found that the existence of replacement fertility

may produce a positive relationship between child mortality risk and fertility. However,

for child mortality risk to have a positive eﬀect on net fertility, households must practice

precautionary fertility (i.e., “child hoarding”). Similarly, Angeles (2010) found that child

mortality increased gross fertility, but had little eﬀect on net fertility. In contrast, Soares



                                              6
(2005) shows that the existence of a quantity-quality tradeoﬀ for household investments in

children yields the result that a reduction in child mortality risk reduces fertility.




3     Prevention of mother-to-child transmission

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) is the single most eﬀective

HIV prevention intervention in practice today. When administered in accordance with World

Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, PMTCT can reduce the cumulative proba-

bility of transmission from as much as 45 percent in the absence of PMTCT to as little as

3 percent (Dabis and Ekpini 2002, Canning 2006). In doing so, the availability of PMTCT

has the potential to substantially reduce child mortality risk in high HIV prevalence envi-

ronments.

    The WHO recommends “combination therapy” (i.e., a multiple-drug therapy) for HIV-

positive mothers and infants (WHO 2006). The drugs in this combination therapy include

azidothymidine (AZT) and nevirapine (NVP). In Zambia, as in much of Sub-Saharan Africa

(UNAIDS 2010), PMTCT consists of single-dose NVP (i.e., NVP without AZT) administered

to a HIV positive pregnant woman at diagnosis, at the onset of childbirth, and to her infant

child during the first week or two of breastfeeding (Stringer et al 2003, Stringer et al 2005).

    By reducing child mortality risk, PMTCT changes the incentives that women and house-

holds face in their reproductive decisions. In a standard quantity-quality model following

Becker and Lewis (1973), PMTCT reduces the shadow price of child quantity because it de-

creases the number of births required to achieve a desired number of surviving children. The

reduction in the shadow price of child quantity should increase fertility. However, PMTCT


                                               7
simultaneously reduces the shadow price of child quality because household investments in

a child’s human capital made at a young age are more likely to realize a return as that child

is more likely to survive into older ages. Through the quantity-quality tradeoﬀ embedded

in this model, this reduction in the shadow price of child quality should decrease fertility.

PMTCT may aﬀect fertility through other channels as well, including reducing the need for

precautionary or replacement fertility or by providing information to a HIV positive woman

about her HIV status.2

        A change in fertility due to the availability of PMTCT may induce changes in other

reproductive behaviors as well. For example, if PMTCT reduces fertility, then women may

increase breastfeeding durations, possibly further reducing fertility due to increased lacta-

tional amenorrhea. Moreover, the availability of PMTCT may directly aﬀect breastfeeding

behavior. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breastfeeding comprises roughly

one-half of the cumulative risk of mother-to-child transmission (Dabis and Ekpini 2002) and

PMTCT reduces the risk of transmission associated with breastfeeding.




4         Data

Despite the central role PMTCT has played in HIV/AIDS policy in Sub-Saharan Africa,

there has been little eﬀort to document PMTCT expansion at a sub-national level. Thus, in

conjunction with the Network of Zambian People Living with HIV/AIDS (NZP+), I collected

data documenting the expansion of PMTCT at the health facility level from the beginning
    2
   Personal communication with Dr. Jeﬀrey Stringer indicates that there do not appear to be any bio-
chemical pathways linking NVP and fecundity.

of HIV/AIDS services time in Zambia through June 2008.3

       The Japanese International Cooperation (JICA) 2006 Health Facilities Census (HFC)

formed the foundation for our data collection. The 2006 HFC enumerated every health

facility in Zambia and recorded the precise GPS coordinates of each facility. Using this

information on the universe of health facilities in Zambia, we collected information from

each facility on the month and year (if any) it began oﬀering PMTCT, as well as similar

information for the other two main HIV/AIDS services (i.e., voluntary counseling and testing

(VCT) and antiretroviral therapy for adults (ART)).

       This processes yielded a retrospective monthly health facilities panel documenting the

expansion of the three main HIV/AIDS services for an entire high HIV prevalence country.

To the best of my knowledge, these are the first such data that exist. Not only do they

document HIV/AIDS service expansion at the health facility level, but in conjunction with

nationally representative household survey data on reproductive behavior they will provide

evidence on the behavioral responses to HIV/AIDS service expansion (including PMTCT

expansion).

       Data on reproductive behavior come from four nationally representative household sur-

veys. These are the 2001 and 2007 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2003 and

2005 Zambia Sexual Behavior Surveys (ZSBS). Several key variables I use in the empirical

analysis are: (i) knowledge (yes/no) of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, (ii) knowledge

(yes/no) of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), (iii) child death
   3
    Data collection continued past the middle of 2008. However, the panel only reliable captures PMTCT
expansion through the middle of 2008. Data collection eﬀectively began in June 2008 and facilities reporting
no PMTCT at that time may have subsequently introduced it. Because our data collection process does not
update expansion in real time, we are unable to track PMTCT expansion after June 2008 until we update
the health facilities panel.



                                                     9
(yes/no) by age one, (iv) pregnant (yes/no) at any point in the twelve months leading up to

the interview date, (v) breastfeeding (yes/no) for a child age zero to twenty-four months.

        Information on the location of the survey respondents allow me to calculate the distance

from each survey respondent to each health facility. The 2007 DHS contains respondents’

GPS coordinates (intentionally coded with a small error component to ensure respondent

confidentiality). I use administrative records on the locations of the primary sampling units

in the 2001 DHS, the 2003 ZSBS, and the 2005 ZSBS. These tend to be Statistical Enu-

meration Areas (SEAs), which are administrative units designed to capture approximately

1,000 residents. I calculate the centroid of each SEA and record its GPS coordinates as the

location of the survey respondents who reside in that SEA. After calculating the distance

from each survey respondent to each health facility, I am left with 7,683 adult females (i.e.,

ages 15-49) in the 2001 DHS, 2,296 adult females in the 2003 ZSBS, 2,072 adult females in

the 2005 ZSBS, and 7,146 adult females in the 2007 DHS.4




5         Zambian scale-up

Before turning to an analysis of the association between local PMTCT introduction and

reproductive behavior, I briefly describe the expansion of access to PMTCT as documented

in the data collected for the current analysis. Between 2000 and the end of 2007, the number

of health facilities in Zambia oﬀering PMTCT increased from virtually zero to nearly six

hundred. Figure 1 shows the number of health facilities that introduced PMTCT by the
    4
     The Zambia Central Statistical Oﬃce provided a digitized census map which I use to identify the location
of each Statistical Enumeration Area (SEA). However, this map is missing roughly seven percent of the SEAs
in Zambia and I am unable to calculate the location of approximately seven percent of the 2001-2005 survey
respondents.

year of introduction. Although expansion was fairly steady over this period, the expansion

occurred with greatest intensity in 2005.

    [INSERT FIGURE 1 HERE]

    Facilities coverage rates increased from close to zero to more than 40 percent over this

time period. Figure 2 shows the proportion of health facilities at the end of each calendar

year oﬀering PMTCT from 2000 through 2007.

    [INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE]

    Individual coverage rates increased even more rapidly over this same time period. I

calculate the individual coverage rate as the fraction of females age 15-49 residing within 20

kilometers of a PMTCT site. Figure 3 shows the individual coverage rate at the end of each

calendar year from 2000 through 2007. Because PMTCT expansion occurred with greater

intensity in urban areas, the individual coverage rate tended to be higher than the facilities

coverage rate during this time period.

6     Results

6.1    Knowledge of MTCT

I begin by examining the change in knowledge of mother-to-child transmission of HIV

(MTCT) associated with the local introduction of PMTCT. By local introduction, I mean

PMTCT was introduced at a health clinic within 20 kilometers of the respondent at least




                                             11
eleven months prior to the interview date.5 Unless most women were already informed about

mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the local introduction of a service designed to prevent

this transmission presumably should have increased knowledge of MTCT. If it did not, that

might suggest that local availability does not translate into local access because of lack of

information about local availability.

       Table 1 shows the proportion of female respondents who reported knowing of MTCT,

disaggregated by (eventual) proximity to PMTCT. For respondents in (eventual) PMTCT lo-

cations, these sample means are further disaggregated by whether PMTCT has been available

for at least eleven months. The sample means presented in Table 1 suggest that PMTCT

may have increased knowledge of mother-to-child transmission. Although respondents in

(eventual) PMTCT locations had higher knowledge of MTCT prior to local PMTCT intro-

duction than did respondents in non-PMTCT locations, knowledge of MTCT increased by

approximately 7 percentage points (p-value=0.00) among respondents in locations receiving

PMTCT.

       [INSERT TABLE 1 HERE]

       This response may have been larger among women who were more likely to be HIV

positive. Women who believed they were more likely to be HIV positive may have been

more likely to be introduced to PMTCT (or the concern about MTCT) through a local

health clinic. On the other hand, women who believed they were more likely to be HIV

positive may have been more likely to have prior information about MTCT and hence would
   5
    In an analysis of the determinants of maternal health care usage in Zambia, Stekelenberg et al (2004)
found that willingness to visit a maternal health clinic fell rapidly when the clinic was more than a two hour
walk. I use a cut-oﬀ date of eleven months prior to the interview date because that is roughly when the
representative conception occurred for pregnancies measured during the twelve months leading up to the
interview date.

have had less scope for increasing their awareness.

   Table 2 presents information similar to that in Table 1, except now I disaggregate the

sample means by whether the respondent is in a demographic group with HIV prevalence

above the median HIV prevalence by demographic group. For these purposes, I define de-

mographic group as the interaction of gender, five-year age group, and province of residence.

Data on HIV prevalence come from a single cross-section, the 2007 Demographic Health

Survey (DHS). This table shows that knowledge of MTCT was indeed higher among women

in high HIV prevalence demographic groups. Moreover, MTCT knowledge rates approaching

the high nineties for women in high HIV prevalence demographic groups suggest that the

scope for increased knowledge was limited. Consistent with this observation, the increase

in MTCT knowledge among respondents in (eventual) PMTCT locations associated with

the local introduction of PMTCT was smaller among women in high HIV prevalence demo-

graphic groups than among women in low HIV prevalence demographic groups (i.e., 0.06

versus 0.07 percentage points).

   [INSERT TABLE 2 HERE]

   Social networks likely vary systematically across age groups, suggesting that social learn-

ing about MTCT through local PMTCT availability may vary by age as well. Table 3 ex-

plores this possibility, by further disaggregating knowledge about MTCT by the respondent’s

age group. These results suggest that the increase in knowledge of MTCT among respon-

dents in (eventual) PMTCT locations associated with the local introduction of PMTCT was

greater among younger age groups. For example, the increase among women age 15-19 in

(eventual) PMTCT locations was approximately 11 percentage points, or roughly twice that

for women age 20-29. Again, high prior knowledge of MTCT among older respondents might

                                             13
explain the smaller increase among older age groups.

   [INSERT TABLE 3 HERE]

   Finally, I examine how the association between PMTCT availability and knowledge of

MTCT varied by the education level of the respondent. Table 4 represents the results of

this analysis. There do not appear to be particularly large diﬀerences by education level

in the change in knowledge of MTCT associated with the local introduction of PMTCT.

The proportion of women who reported knowing about MTCT increased by between 2 and

8 percentage points in locations receiving PMTCT after the local introduction of PMTCT,

regardless of the respondent’s education level. Although more educated women may be more

knowledgeable about MTCT even in locations never receiving PMTCT, even these diﬀerences

do not exhibit a consistent pattern of increased education associated with increased knowl-

edge of MTCT. However, the small number of women in locations never receiving PMTCT

who have completed secondary school means we should interpret these simple diﬀerences in

means with caution.

   [INSERT TABLE 4 HERE]



6.2    Knowledge of PMTCT

Now I turn to the question of whether knowledge about prevention of mother-to-child trans-

mission (PMTCT) increased in areas receiving PMTCT. Table 5 shows the proportion of

female respondents who reported knowing of PMTCT, disaggregated by (eventual) prox-

imity to PMTCT. In locations eventually receiving PMTCT, the change in knowledge of

PMTCT associated with the local introduction of the service was nearly 50 percentage



                                            14
points (p-value=0.00). Much of this may be a secular change that was shared by individuals

in locations greater than twenty kilometers from an eventual PMTCT site. However, the

fact that only 25 percent of respondents in locations greater than twenty kilometers from an

eventual PMTCT were aware of PMTCT also suggests that the local introduction of this

service had a large impact on knowledge of the existence of an intervention aimed at reducing

mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

   [INSERT TABLE 5 HERE]

   Table 6 allows average knowledge of PMTCT to vary by HIV prevalence in the respon-

dent’s demographic group. The results suggest that the local introduction of PMTCT did

not increase knowledge of its existence substantially more among women who were more

likely to be HIV positive. The proportion of women aware of the existence of PMTCT in-

creased by approximately 47 percentage points in low and high HIV prevalence demographic

groups alike.

   Partly because the change in knowledge of MTCT associated with local PMTCT varied

by age, it is reasonable to believe that the change in knowledge of PMTCT did as well. Table

7 examines this possibility. The results indicate that the increase in knowledge of PMTCT

associated with local PMTCT introduction was greater among women who were in age

groups that were already more likely to know about PMTCT. For example, the proportion

of women age 15-19 in areas eventually receiving PMTCT who were knowledgeable about

PMTCT increased by 42 percentage points, whereas the increase among women age 20-29

in the same areas was 50 percentage points.

    Table 8 examines whether the change in knowledge of PMTCT associated with local

introduction of the service varied by the education level. As was the pattern with MTCT,

there were only small-to-moderate diﬀerences by education level in the change in knowledge

of PMTCT.

6.3       Child mortality

The local introduction of PMTCT may have aﬀected knowledge about MTCT and PMTCT

even if respondents accessed these services at low rates. Without data on use of PMTCT,

the best information on access to PMTCT is information on child mortality. If respondents

were receiving PMTCT, then presumably we should see a reduction in child mortality in

these data.

    Table 9 reports under age 1 child mortality rates, disaggregated by (eventual) proximity

to PMTCT. The local introduction of PMTCT was associated with a one percentage point

(i.e., ten percent) reduction in under age 1 child mortality rates (significant at the 5 percent

level).

    [INSERT TABLE 9 HERE]

    Table 10 disaggregates child mortality rates by whether the respondent (i.e., the child’s

mother) was more or less likely to be HIV positive. Child mortality appears to have fallen

by one percentage point, invariant of the likelihood the mother was HIV positive.

    [INSERT TABLE 10 HERE]

    Table 11 examines whether the association between PMTCT availability and child mor-



                                              16
tality varied by the age of the respondent (i.e., the child’s mother). Child mortality appears

to have fallen the most for the youngest respondents. Child mortality fell by five percentage

points for women age 15-19. In contrast, it fell by one percentage point for all other age

groups.

   [INSERT TABLE 11 HERE]

   Table 12 disaggregates the change in child mortality associated with local PMTCT avail-

ability by the education level of the mother. There is some evidence of a larger reduction in

child mortality for more educated women.

   [INSERT TABLE 12 HERE]



6.4    Pregnancy

The availability of PMTCT changes the incentives that women and couples face in making

decisions about reproductive behavior. In the standard Becker and Lewis (1973) model,

PMTCT simultaneously reduces the shadow prices of child quantity and child quality. These

price changes would aﬀect fertility decisions. Similarly, PMTCT should reduce the need

for replacement or precautionary fertility. Table 13 examines changes in pregnancy rates

associated with the local introduction of PMTCT. Although pregnancy rates were already

lower in locations eventually receiving PMTCT than in locations never receiving PMTCT,

pregnancy rates fell by an additional 5 percentage points (p-value=0.00) in association with

the local introduction of PMTCT.

   [INSERT TABLE 13 HERE]

   Presumably the reduction in pregnancy rates associated with the local introduction of



                                             17
PMTCT should have been larger among women who were more likely to be HIV positive.

Table 14 explores this possibility by further disaggregating pregnancy rates by the whether

the respondent was in a demographic group with HIV prevalence above the median. Perhaps

surprisingly, these results do not suggest that the response was larger among women who

were more likely to be HIV positive.

   [INSERT TABLE 14 HERE]

   Table 15 allows pregnancy rates to vary by the age of the respondent. The results

indicate the reduction in pregnancy rates associated with the local introduction of PMTCT

was concentrated among younger women (i.e., age 15-19 and age 20-29). These groups

demonstrated roughly 5 percentage point reductions each in pregnancy rates (p-value=0.00

and 0.00), whereas older age groups demonstrated slightly smaller reductions in pregnancy

rates.

   [INSERT TABLE 15 HERE]

   The change in pregnancy rates associated with the local introduction of PMTCT may

have varied by the education level of the mother. If more educated women were better able

to access this service, then they may have demonstrated a larger response. On the other

hand, pregnancy rates were higher at lower levels of education so less educated women may

mechanically have greater scope for reducing pregnancy rates. Table 16 provides evidence on

whether the change in pregnancy associated with the local introduction of PMTCT varied

by the education level of the respondent. The results indicate that women who had not

completed primary school reduced their likelihood of being pregnancy by 2 percentage points,

roughly twice as large as most educated women. Furthermore, the reduction for secondary

school completers was not statistically significant at conventional levels (p-value=0.65). The

                                             18
simple diﬀerence in means was roughly the same for primary school completers and for

women who had not completed primary school.

   [INSERT TABLE 16 HERE]



6.5    Breastfeeding

PMTCT expansion likely aﬀected breastfeeding behavior as well. There are at least three

reasons to think that breastfeeding habits might have changed after the local introduction

of PMTCT. First, PMTCT appears to have reduced pregnancy rates and breastfeeding

is an important contraceptive mechanism in Zambia. Among sexually active females age

15-49 in the 2007 DHS, approximately 4 percent report using the lactational amenorrhea

method (Central Statistical Oﬃce et al 2009). Because the denominator in this calculation

includes many women who do not have infants of breastfeeding age, this understates the

true prevalence of breastfeeding as a contraceptive method.

   Second, PMTCT reduces the shadow price of child quality which should induce house-

holds to increase investment in children’s human capital (e.g., health and education). Be-

cause PMTCT increases the likelihood a newborn will survive into older ages, household

investments in children’s human capital made at a young age (e.g., breastfeeding) are more

likely to realize a greater return. Thus, PMTCT should increase breastfeeding rates as part

of an overall increase in household investment in children’s human capital.

   Third, PMTCT directly reduces the expected cost of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is one

of the three stages at which a mother may transmit HIV to her child and comprises roughly

one-half of the cumulative transmission probability (Dabis and Epkini 2002). PMTCT re-



                                            19
duces the probability of transmission through breastfeeding and hence should increase breast-

feeding rates among women receiving the service.

   Table 17 investigates the relationship between PMTCT availability and breastfeeding

behavior among women with children ages 0 to 24 months.6 A simple comparison of con-

ditional means suggests that PMTCT availability was associated with a small decrease in

breastfeeding. Breastfeeding rates were approximately five percentage points lower after the

local introduction of PMTCT (significant at the 1 percent level).

   [INSERT TABLE 17 HERE]

   In Table 18, I allow the association between PMTCT availability and breastfeeding to

vary by the likelihood the respondent was HIV positive. Breastfeeding rates appear to have

fallen by five percentage points (significant at the 1 percent level) invariant of the likelihood

the respondent was HIV positive.

   [INSERT TABLE 18 HERE]

   Breastfeeding behavior and the change therein associated with PMTCT expansion may

vary by age of the mother. Diﬀerences by cohort in education levels or in exposure to par-

ticular reproductive health policies might generate diﬀerences in the breastfeeding response

to PMTCT. Likewise, life cycle diﬀerences in labor supply might condition the responsive-

ness of breastfeeding to PMTCT. Table 19 explores these possibilities by disaggregating

the change in breastfeeding by the age of the mother. Breastfeeding appears to have fallen

more among women in the middle of the age distribution. For women ages 20-29 and 30-39,

breastfeeding rates fell by five to seven percentage points (significant at the one percent

al 2009).

level). In contrast, the simple diﬀerence in means suggests that breastfeeding rates fell by

two to three percentage points for women ages 15-19 and 40-49, although these changes are

not statistically significant for these groups (p-values=0.29 and 0.73, respectively).

    [INSERT TABLE 19 HERE]

    Finally, Table 20 presents breastfeeding rates in PMTCT and non-PMTCT locations

further disaggregated by the education level of the mother. Breastfeeding rates appear to

have fallen more among women who had completed more schooling, although the change for

women who had completed secondary school was not statistically significant at conventional

levels.

7     Conclusion

Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) is the single most eﬀective

HIV prevention intervention we know of in practice today. PMTCT reduces the probability

a HIV positive mother transmits the virus to her child from as much as 45 percent in the

absence of PMTCT to as little as 3 percent (Dabis and Ekpini 2002, Canning 2006). During

the past ten years or so, the proportion of HIV positive pregnant women in Sub-Saharan

Africa receiving PMTCT increased from virtually zero to more than one-half (WHO 2010).

    This paper documents the rapid expansion of PMTCT in Zambia over the period 2000-

2007 and provides descriptive evidence on the association between PMTCT expansion and

reproductive behavior. I use a newly assembled monthly health facilities panel identifying the

expansion of access to the three main HIV/AIDS services, including PMTCT. In conjunction


                                              21
with four nationally representative household surveys spanning this time period, these data

allow me to examine the change in reproductive knowledge and behavior associated with the

local introduction of PMTCT. I find that local PMTCT introduction was associated with:

(i) increased knowledge about mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) and about PMTCT,

(ii) reduced child mortality and pregnancy rates, and (iii) a small reduction in breastfeeding

rates. The reduction in pregnancy rates suggests that not only has PMTCT expansion been

a humanitarian success, but it may have reduced total fertility rates, possibly promoting

economic growth and development.

   However, future research is required to address the endogeneity of PMTCT expansion.

For example, PMTCT expansion may have occurred with greater intensity in areas with

fundamentally diﬀerent time trends in fertility than the rest of Zambia and the empirical

methodology used in the current analysis does not address this concern. In addition, the

data assembled for this project allow for the investigation of several other important research

questions about PMTCT expansion and reproductive health, including the interaction be-

tween PMTCT and ART availability in the process determining reproductive behavior.
