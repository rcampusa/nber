             R&D, Production Structure, and Productivity Growth
            in the U.S., Japanese and German Manufacturing Sectors


                                 ABSTRACT



       The paper analyzes the production structure and the demand for inputs

in three major industrialized countries, the U.S., Japan and Germany. A

dynamic factor demand model with two variable inputs (labor and energy)

and two quasi-fixed inputs (capital and R&D) is derived directly from

an intertemporal cost—minimization problem formulated in discrete time.

Adjustment costs are explicitly specified. The model is estimated for

the manufacturing sector of the three countries using annual data from

1965 to 1977. Particular attention is given to the role of R&D. For

all   countries the rate of return on R&D is found to be higher than that
on capital. Their respective magnitudes are similar across countries.
We find considerable differences in factor demand schedules; we also

find tha1 for all countries the speed of adjustment for capital is higher

than that of R&D. Adjustment costs are of importance in the demand equations

for capital and R&D, but play a minor role in the decomposition of total

factor productivity growth.

Introduction *

     There is a considerable literature on the contribution of research

and development expenditure (R&D) to the growth rates of output and

productivity in various U,S. industries,1 The questions of what are the

determinants of R&D expenditure and what are the rates of return on R&D

investment in different sectors of the U.S. economy are also extensively

examined.2 The issue of lags between R&D expenditure, innovative activities,

and growth of output have been active areas of research,3 Similarly, the

role of energy as a factor of production in the evolution of the production

structure of the U.S, economy and various industries has been debated for a

considerable period of time, Of particular interest has been the effect of

increase in oil prices on the rate of growth of output, productivity growth

and direction of technical change,4

     These discussions have been largely focused on the U.S. economy and

its various industries. Very few econometric studies are available that

have explored the role of R&D in other industrialized economies, Further,

most of the available studies are based on static equilibrium models and

therefore do not adequately explore the intertemporal nature of some of the

issues, To take account of these two issues, we shall develop a dynamic

factor demand model that takes explicit account of adjustment costs inherent

in the investment process and estimate the model using data for the

manufacturing sectors of the U.S.,Japan and Germany In the context

of our dynamic framework we shall explore the role played by labor and energy

as well as that of the quasi-fixed factors, the stocks of plant and equipment

and R&D in the evolution of the structure of the production process ôfthe
                                                                             2




manufacturing sectors of these three countries, These countries were

chosen because they are the major economies among the OECD countries and

also provide a reasonable regional representation, The manufacturing

sectors were selected because of their importance in the industrial

structure of these economies and the availability of reasonable sets of

data,

        In our model a system of dynamic input demand equations is derived

from an intertemporal model with internal costs of adjustment, Because of

the adjustment costs, the stocks of plant and equipment and R&D will not adjust

instantaneously to their optimal levels, and hence those factors will be

quasi—fixed in the short run, Labor and energy, the other factors, are

assumed to be variable. Because of the adjustment costs, an intertemporal

optimization process must be formulated, Furthermore particular care is

necessary in the calculation of short— and long—run input elasticities,

factor productivity and rates of return on quasi—fixed factors, These

measures are likely to differ from the conventional measures reported in

the literature,

     Our estimating equations are derived directly from an interteinporal

cost—minimization problem formulated in discrete time. The technology is

represented by a restricted cost function. The technology is assumed to be

homogeneous, technical change is considered to be disembodied, and the

adjustment costs are specified to be separable.

     Using our theoretical framework, we would like to explore several issues:

Our first objective is to examine the evolution of the production process of

the manufacturing sectors of the U.S., Japan and Germany. Of particular
                                                                                     3




interest would be the short'. and long—run responses of employment, energy,

investment in plant and equipment and in research and development to changes

in the relative prices, output and technical change. Our second aim is to note

the magnitude of, the adjustment costs related to investment in plant and

equipment and R&D, The third objective is to formulate a concept of average net

rates of return on the quasi—fixed inputs in the context of an intertemporal

riodel and calculate these rates for capital and R&D for the different

manufacturing industries. Finally, we will decompose total factor productivity in

the   context of our   dynamic   model into   several components and examine the

contribution of different inputs, technical change and adjustment costs to the

growth of output in the manufacturing sectors of the U.S.., Japan and Germany

in the period 1965 to 1977.

       The paper is organized as follows In section 1 we formulate the

analytical framework and econometric specification of our model. In section 2

we present our estimation results and their interpretation. Section 3 is

devoted to the examination of the differential responses of the inputs in

different countries to changes in input prices, output, and technical change

in the short, intermediate and long run. The average net rates of return in

the individual quasi—fixed inputs are formulated         and   calcuIated in   section   4.

In section 5 we examine the decomposition of total factor productivity,

 The contribution of yaious. -f4ctors. to the growth .rate of output in the

 mnufacturing sectors of these economies will also be discussed in this

 section. The paper is concluded with a summary and some suggestions for

 future research. The types and sources of the data used in estimating our

 model   are   described in the appendix.

1. Theoretical Model and Econometric Specification



      1.1 Theoretical Model

      The model underlying this paper is close to that of Denny, Fuss and

Waverinan (2981) and Morrison and Berndt (1981). Denny et al. and Morrison

and Berndt specify their model in continuous time and then employ a discrete

approximation of the continuous factor demand equations in their empirical

investigation. Instead, we shall specify the entire model in

discrete time. It turns out that the two approaches lead to different

specifications.5 The importance of this difference depends, as is explained

in more detail below, on the magnitude of certain a priori unknown parameters

of the model.

      Consider a firm in period t that employs m variable inputs v.(i=1, . . . ,m)

and n quasi—fixed inputs x.(j=l, . . . ,n) in producing the single output good

      More specifically, the firm's production process is described by the

following generalized production function:

                =
(1)
                    F(vt,xti,xt,T)
where v =
        t
             {v.it } is   the vector of variable inputs, x = {x. }
                                                          t
                                                                     is   the vector of
                                                               jt
end-of-period stocks of quasi-fixed factors, and Tt is a technology index.

The vector Ax =             — j,t-1   represents internal adjustment costs in terms

of forgone output due to changes in the quasi-fixed factors, i.e. F <0. The
                                                                               :
production   function satisfies standard assumptions with respect to the

traditional factors v and x    and is assumed to be concave in all inputs.
                    t      t-l
This implies that the marginal products of the traditional factors of production
                                                                                5




are decreasing and that the marginal adjustment costs are increasing.

      The firm is assumed to face perfectly competitive markets with respect

to its factor inputs. We denote the acquisition price for the variable and

quasi-fixed factors a            =l,...,m) and       =   1,...,n),   respectively.

It proves convenient to normalize all prices in terms of the price of the

first variable factor, and we denote those normalized prices as            =
                                                                               it'1t
and q =
      The production technology (.1) can be described alternatively in terms of

the normalized restricted cost function. Lt          denote the cost-minimizing

variable factor inputs neededto produce output           conditional on x_1 and

      then the normalized restricted cost function is defined as


(2)
            G(wxtixt ,Qt,Tt) =

with w it=2 This function has the following properties (see Lau
(1976)): G < 0,       G >    0, GQ> 0, G > 0. Furthermore, G(.) is convex in
              j          j              i
      and         is concave in w.

      The firm is assumed to hold static expectations on relative factor

prices, output, the technology and the discount rate, r. In each

period the firm is assumed to derive, for given initial stocks             and subject

to the production function constraint (1), an optimal input path such that the

present value of the expected cost stream is minimized. Making use of the

restricted cost function (2) and choosing a "first order certainty

equivalence" representation we can state the firm's optimization problem in

period t as
                                                                                              6

                                                                               i
                                                                                    1
                                                                                   jtj
where G(t+T)       =
                       G(WtIXt+i,tX,Q,T).6

        The firm's demand for its variable factors can be derived from the

normalized restricted cost function via Shephard's lemma as


 (5)          v.it = aG(t)
                      0W.
                         it

The demand for the first variable factor can be computed as                        G(t)   -
 Zn
       w V.
1=2 it it

       The first order conditions describing the firm's demand for quasi—fixed

factors can be given the following economic interpretation: The firm plans to

invest in a quasi—fixed input until, at the margin, the cost of adjustment

plus the purchase price of one unit of investment in period t+T plus the

discounted depreciation losses equals the discounted sum of the production and

adjustment    cost savings plus the purchase price of the investmetit unit in
period t+t+1,
                                                                                                                7

our empirical analysis (dropping all t—sbscripts) is as follows;

second order approximation to a general normalized restricted cost function

corresponding to a constant returns to scale technology.7 We impose the

usual parameter restriction:


(6b)          =                   =            = 0,                           j,k =1,...,n,            i= 2,...,xn,



(6c)             =         = 0                                                jk, j,k =
           1jk       1jk
                                                                                                 8




Restriction (6b) implies that the marginal adjustment costs at x=O are zero.

Restriction (6c) is rather strong; it implies a zero long—run cross—price

elasticity between quasi—fixed factors. However, the restriction is imposed

to make our problem in case of more than one quasi-fixed factor analytically

and empirically tractable.

       4aking use of Shephard's lemma (5) we obtain the following demand

Note that the unstable root of each of the above sets of second order

Our entire system of estimable demand equations thus consists of the in

variable    factor demand equations (7) and the n quasi-fixed factor demand

equations (9). For the empirical estimation we replace                    and        by the

actually observed values v. and x. and add a stochastic disturbance term
                         it
to equations (7a,b) and (9a).

        The discrete approximations of the accelerator equations obtained from a

continuous model are also of the form (9) but with                     replaced by

Note that as the adjustment costs go to zero, i.e.                    + 0, we have           - 1

but mt - . Hence                within the context of our discrete model we can test
        JJ ,t

and allow for the possibility that some of the factors that are a priori

expected to be quasi-fixed are actually variable, i.e.                    =          The discrete

demand equations derived from a continuous model become meaningless as

adjustment costs go to zero.

 2.    Empirical Results



       For empirical estimation of the model we consider two variable factors,

labor (L) and energy (E), and two quasi-fixed inputs, stocks of plant and

equipment (K) and R&D (R).     The estimating equations consist of (7a), (7b),

and (9a), with m=n=2 and where      =   L,   V2 = E, x1 = K, and x2 = R.   The data

used   to estimate the production structure and factor demand in the manufacturing
sector of the U.S., Japan   and Germany cover the period 1965-1977. The sources

of the data and method of constructing the variables of the model are described

in the appendix. Data on output, energy, capital and R&D are in constant 1970

prices. The technology index is represented by a simple time trend. The

estimation technique used is full information maximum likelihood. When

necessary, a correction was made for first order autocorrelation of the

disturbances, All estimation was performed with TSP.

       The parameter estimates of the model are shown in Table 1. The fit of

the model is quite good, and the estimated coefficients are generally

statistically significant. The R2 for the labor equation is low for Japan; the

inidividual parameter estimates, as expected, vary across countries. However,

the important restrictions susggested by economic theory to insure the

concavity conditions of the underlying technology are met in all cases, i.e.,

the parameters                and
                      y,                are all positive, and y     are all

negative.

       The adjustment coefficients m.. (j = K,R) as implied by the estimates in

Table 1 can be calculated using the expression (9c). Their 1970 values are

shown in Table 2.

           Several points are of interest with respect to these results. First, the

adjustment coefficient or capital, m, is generally greater by a factor of two

in each country than the corresponding adjustment coefficient for R&D, mKK. These

estimates imply that about 75% of the adjustment in capital is completed after

two   or   three years, but that it takes much longer to adjust the stock of R&D.

There is some evidence confirmin9 our         results   in the case of capital stock.

Mayer (1960) concluded from a survey of 276 u.s. companies that there was a lag

of two to three years involved in plant investment and of seven to eight months

in investment inequipment, Similar results were obtained by Almon (1968),

Berndt, Fuss and Waverman (1980), Bischoff (1969, 11971), Coen and Hickman (1970),

and Jorgenson and Stephenson (1967) on U.S. data, However, not much evidence

exists on the adjustment of the stock of R&D to its desired level. Nadiri

 (11980) and Nadiri and Bitros (1980) obtained an ownadjustment coefficient
                                                                                 14



   for R&D from ,16 to .32 on U,S, firm and total manufacturing data, Second,

   the adjustment coefficients of capital and R&D differ among the

  manufacturing sectors of the countries, For the U.S., both stocks of plant
                                                                                      4
  and equipment and R&D adjust to their desired levels much more slowly than

  in the other countries, The pattern of adjustments of plant and equipment and

  R&D in Japan and Germany are quite similar, i,e,, about 50% of the adjustment

  of the capital stock and 26% of the adjustment of the R&D stock takes place in

  the first year.

     Another interesting feature of the model is the look at the magnitude of

the average adjustment cost Eor one investment unit       as   a percentage of the

acquisition price of investment, These calculations are indicated in panel A

of Table 3. The figures for both the average costs of adjustments for plant

and equipment and R&D show that the Japanese manufacturing sector experienced

lower adjustment cost than the U,S. and German manufacturing sectors, This

was especially true in the case of R&D,

     Because of adjustment cost we observe in the short run a wedge between the

rate of technical substitution and relative input prices. This is evident by

inspection from equation (4). In the long run, adjustment costs are zero and

hence            =
                     q (r + 5.), i.,e,, the rate of technical substitution will equal
the (normalized) equilibrium user cost of the inputs. But, in the short run,

the adjustment casts serve as a wedge. This implies that the marginal pro-

ductivity of the quasi-fixed inputs is in the short run much larger than their

equilibrium values to compensate for both the user costs and the adjustment

costs of investment. In panel B of Table 3, we present some estimates of the

percentage gap between the ratios of the marginal products of the quasi-fixed

factors and labor as compared with the equilibrium rental prices normalized by

the wage rate. Again, these results confirm the conclusions stated above that

the Japanese manufacturing sector faced in the period under consideration a

Because the quasi—fixed factors do not adjust immediately to their long—run

equilibrium values, some of the variable factors have to overshoot in the short

run   their    long-run equilibrium levels, That is the short—run elasticities of

some of the variable factors have to be larger than the long—run elasticities,

        using the expressions (lOa) and (lOb), we calculate the own— and cross—

price elasticities of the inputs as well as their output elasticities in the

short, intermediate and lông run, We have also derived and calculated the

response pattern of the inputs to technical change, which are reported below,



        31 Price elasticities

        The own—price elasticities of labor, energy, capital and R&D are reported

in Table 4, The first row contains own-price elasticities of employment the

short—run values of this elasticity are small and positive in every case, but

its intermediate— and long—run values are larger and have the expected negative

signs, The positive sign of this elasticity is due to the fact that, in the

short run, the firm cannot substitute labor for its quasi-fixed input, but must

bear the costs of adjustment in terms of labor input, The long—run labor price

elasticity is low in the u.S. and German manufacturing sectors but very high in

        The own—price elasticity of energy is negative in all cases but -very         small
 in Japanese -manufacturing. It has the largest magnitude in the case of Germany,

followed by the U.S. The Qwn-price elasticity of capital is negative in every

case: its-magnitude is- snali in the short run but becomes relatively large in

the intermediate run and long run. Surprisingly, the magnitudes of the own--

price    elasticity of capital are for the US. and Germany larger than those of
                                                                            19




labor, The long—run own—price elasticity of the capital stock is highest in

Japan. The pattern of the own—price elasticities of the stock of R&D

is, in general, similar to that of the capital stock, and the ranking of

countries does not change significantly. It seems that in general the

own—price elasticities of the inputs are much greater in the Japanese

manufacturing sector than in the other two countries, As expected, the

elasticities of the quasi-fixed inputs are higher in the long run than in

the short run.

     The cross-price elasticities of inputs are shown in Table 5. They

reveal the following patterns; The cross—price elasticities are generally small

except for the elasticities of capital with respect to the price of labor in

the U.S. and Germany, and the elasticities of R&D with respect to price of

labor and energy,   The intermediate- and long-'run cross-price elasticities of

labor with respect to user cost of capital and the elasticities of energy

with respect to prices of the quasi—fixed factors are also fairly large,

Labor seems to be a substitute for capital, R&D   and   energy in all countries;

the degree of substitution between labor and the quasi-fixed inputs are much

stronger in Japan than in the manufacturing sectors of the U.S. and Germany

over the period under consideration, Capital and energy are complements in

Japan and Germany and substitutes in the U,S., but the strength of these

elasticities is quite weak,

     These patterns of substitution and complementarity among inputs are

generally in accordance with the findings of some of the studies reported in

the literature. Capital and energy are often reported tG be complements in

time series studies but substitutes in studies using panel data,8 Previous
                                                                                      20




studies based on cost—of—adjustment models using IJS,           data    (Berndt, Fuss and

Waverman (1980), Morrison and Berndt (1981), and Pindyck and Rotemberg (1982))

have found capital and energy to be complements., while labor and energy were

found to be substitutes. However, a nore careful analysis is required to

compare our   findings   on the input elasticities to those reported in the

literature, a task that we haye postponed for the present

        32 Output Elasticities

        The output elasticities of employment, energy, capital stock, and

stock of R&D are shown in Table 6, The long—run elasticities of the inputs

are equal to unity, as is implied by the underlying linear homogeneous

technology. The results indicate that, in all cases, employment responds

very    strongly in the short run to a change in output; the reason is tlat
employment overshoots its long—run equilibrium value in the short run to
compensate    for t1'e sluggish adlustments of the two quasi-fixed   inputs.
It   slowly adjusts. toward its long-run equilibrium value   as capital and R&D

adjust.     The short— and intermediate-run output elasticities of employment

are somewhat higher in Japan, but, in general, the pattern of adjustment is

remarkably similar among the manufacturing sectors of these countries.

     The output elasticities of energy are fairly high for Japan, about unity

in the short and intermediate run. This contrasts to the situation in the U.S,

and German manufacturing sectors, where the short—run output elasticity of

energy is fairly small, This contrast between Japan and the other two

countries is quite interesting in light of the high degree of the Japanese
economy's dependence on imported energy supplies,

     The output elasticities of capital and R&D are small in the short run,

but they increase over time. The short- and intermediate-run elasticities of
                                                                              .23



 capital with respect to output are   fairly   high for Japan and Germany in
 comparison   to those for the U,S. manufacturing sectox, Similarly, the output

 elasticities of stock of R&D are high for Japan and Germany, and quite alike.

 On the whole the output elasticities of both the variable and the quasi-fixed

 factors exceed substantially thcir own—price elasticities noted earlier. Also,

 in Japan factor inputs respond to both changes in relative prices and output

 much more than in the U.S. and German-manufacturing sectors.



      33 Impact of Technical Chan

      The impact of technological change   on   factor inputs is shown in Table 7,

 The s,igns of these estimates indicate the direction of technical change1 i,e,

 if the coefficient is positive
                                   technological change is using more of the

particular input and, if it is negative, it is using less of the input.

In all cases the estimated technical change is
                                                   labor-saving, The impact of
technical change is small in the short run but increases in the long run, The

results for the U,S, are similar to those reported by Berndt et al, (1980) but

the magnitude of our long—run effect of
                                           technological change is somewhat
higher, It is interesting to note that the magnitude of labor-.saving

technological change is high.   in Japan and Germany in comparison to that   in the
U,S, The long-run magnitude of labor—saving due to technical progress is more

than twice in manufacturing sectors of these countries than in the iJ,S,

manufacturing sector,

     Technological advance is also energy—saving in all three countries, with

the highest impact registered in Japan, The energy-saving effect of technical

change in Germany is small in the short run but becomes
                                                           fairly large in the

intermediate and long run,     The magnitude of the energy-saving effect of

technical change in the TJ,S, manufacturing sector seems to be fairly small,

     It seems that technical change is capital-,saving in both Japan and Germany

but capital-busing in the tJ,S manufacturing sector, The magnitude of the

capital saving is very high in Japan in comparison to those in Germany1 the

capit4.using effect of technical change in the CJ,S, is fairly small, Technical

change is R&D—using in the U.S. and German manufacturing sectors but R&D-saving in the
                                                                            25




Japanese            manufacturing sector ,   Again, the magnitude of this
biased technical change is much larger in Japan than in the other two countries.

     These results suggest that the effect of technical change on different

inputs varies across countries. As one would expect, the effect of technical

change is much stronger in the long run. The technological bias seems to

be factor-saving in the majority of the cases, but it is R&D- and capital-

using in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Finally, the magnitudes of the effect

of technological progress on all factors of production, like the effect of

changes in relative input prices and output, are much stronger in Japan than

in the other two countries.



4.   Average Rate of Return on Individual Factors

     In this section we define a measure for the rate of return on the

investment expenditures on an individual factor in period t. Because of

adjustment costs, the firm's invesuient decisions are intertemporally connected.

In defining the rate of return we hence have to be specific about the firm's

behavior in future periods.

     The maintained hypothesis in this paper is that the firm chooses its

inputs such that it minimizes, for a given output stream, the discounted value

of its costs. However, for expository reasons, consider for a moment a firm

whose objective is to maximize the discounted value of its net profit stream.

In our empirical model we considered the case of two quasi—fixed factors, i.e.

     = K and x2 R, and two variable factors, i.e.            = L and v2 = E. 9

The firm's net revenues in period t can then be written as
                                                                                      26

where         is the output price. Given that the firm has static expectations on

all prices, we can state the firm's objective as to choose its inputs such that

it maximizes

                                         tl   •    Let   {t+t,   t+t T0 denote that
maximizing input sequence.

        Assuming that the firm realizes the initial portion of its investment plan,

the firm's net investment expenditures on (say) the first quasi—fixed factor are

                               Clearly the expected returns on this investment

(discounted by the opportunity rate r) are maximal only if the firm plans to

follow the entire plan also with respect to the other factors. To calculate the

net returns from this investment we have to compare these returns with the returns

from an input sequence where that particular investment is not undertaken. To

capture the entire effect of the firm's investment we assume that this alternative

input sequence is conditionally optimal, Le, optimal subject to the condition that

the firm's investment in the first quasi—fixed factor in period t is not undertaken

and hence zero° More formally, we consider as the alternative input sequence, say

                   the input sequence that maximizes (12) subject to the constraint

       = 0,   We now define as our rate of return the internal rate p that equates the

present value of the differences in the two net return streams with the initial

investment expenditure, i.e,

For additional interpretation of the above definition, consider the special case

of only one quasi-fixed factor. In this case the rate of return defined by (13)

is identical to the rate obtained by specifying as the alternative policy that the

firm maintains forever the quasi-fixed factor at its initial level, i.e.

while choosing the variable inputs correspondingly optimal. To see this, note

that in case of one quasi—fixed factor                            = ic    and             =              for t > 1.

Consider further the case of no adjustment costs, i.e., F/B.x                                 0.     It is not

difficult to see that in this case definition (13) implies the following

expression for the rate of return on optimal investment in period t:


                     {F(v,x) -          F(v,x1)}       -          I. it (vit - v.)        -

{xt+T,vt+}0 are established under the additional constraint that

F(vt÷T,xt+T,xt+T,Tt) =     for   all T   0, We can still use (13) as our

measure for the rate of return on investment, Note however that gross revenues

will be identical for both input sequences. Hence in case of a cost—minimizing

firm we actually compare the difference in cost streams,



     In Table 8 we present the estimated internal rates of return on net

investment in plant and equipment and R&D for the period 1965—1977, These

rates are net of the adjustment costs and depreciation rates of the two

quasi-fixed inputs They are calculated using equation (13). Several

interesting points should be noted; First, that the average rates of return

over the period for capital and R&D are fairly similar except in Germany,

where the rate of return on R&D is about 50% larger than that on capital.

Second, there are variations in the rates of return over time for both

capital and R&D, but especially in the rate of return on capital. The

timing of thes.e variations differs from country to country. Finally, the

approximate equality of the rates of return across countries is interesting,

for it suggests that none of the countries is earning excessive return on

its investment in plant and equipment and R&D exclusive of the depreciation

rates and the costs of adjustments of the investinents

      All expressions in the above decomposition can be evaluated directly from

the restricted cost function, The first component, R1(t), is attributable to

technical change: Note that 3F/aT =                  -(G/T)/(G/Q),            The second term, R2(t),

is attributable to the short-run inequality between rate of technical

substitution and the equilibrium relative factor prices: Note that

(F/ax)/(aF/av1) =       - aG/3x          The third component, R3(t), stems from the

presence of x in the production function, In a long—run equilibrium situation

both R2(t) and R3(t) will be zero,

      In Table 9 we present the decomposition of the growth rate of total

factor productivity (TFP)             with R1,   R2, B3 and the unexplained residual.

Technical change plays. the dominant role in explaining the growth of total factor

productivity in all the countries. The contribution of R1 ranges from .90 in

Germany to .80 in Japan to .70 for the U.S. The magiiitude of R2 seems to be

small. As a percentage of the growth of TFP it ranges from .09 for the U.S. to

about .06 for Japan. Also the magnitude of R3 is very small, practically zero,

while the disequilibrium factors the sum of          and R3, have a minor role in

explaining growth of the traditional TF measure Thus the presence of

adjustment cost makes a substantial difference to the process of accumulation

of capital and R&D and to the dynamic behavior of factor demand, but its

implications for the tradItional TFPineasure are small,

     The contributions of inputs, technical change and adjustment costs to

growth of output in the manufacturing sectors of the three countries are shown

in Table 10, In this period the growth rate of manufacturing output has been

very high in Japan, about 9,5% per annum     while   it was about 4% in Germany and

slightly more than 3%   in   the U,S, The contributions of various inputs to the

growth of output differs substantially across countries, The most significant

source of growth of output in all the countries is technical changes it

contributes over 30%, 40%, and 90%, respectively to the growth of output in

the manufacturing sector of the U,S,, Japan, and Germany, The next most

important sources of growth of output can be attributed to capital accumulation;

it accounts for about 20 to 25% of the growth of output in the Pmerican and

German manufacturing, while its contribution is a dramatic 42% in the growth

of the Japanese ro.anufacturing sector, The contribution of labor is fairly

high in U,S, manufacturing, hut yerysmall in Japan, about 2%, partly because

of the low growth o employment over this periods The contribution of

employment is negatiye, nd fairly large, to the growth. rate of output in the

German manufacturing sector. The reason for this is the decline in both

employment and hours worked in German manufacturing over the period under

consideration If technical change and capital accumulation had not contributed

so significantly as they did, the growth rate of output in German manufacturing

could have been small or even negative,

      The contribution of R&D to the growth o output seems to be highest in

the U • S.   manufacturing, about 11%, followed by Germany, about 9%. It

contributed only half as- much, about 5%, to the growth rate of -manufacturing

output in Japan, Giyen that the share of R&D is small, these rates are fairly

significant. The contribution of energy to growth of output is generally very

small, about 4% in the Japanese, 1,5% in the U,S,, and less than 1% in the

German manufacturing sector, Finally, the contribution of the adjustment costs

of capital and R&D is generally small in the rapidly growing economies of Japan

and Germany, and fairly large, ever 110%, in the U.S. -manufacturing sector. The

adjustment-costs effect of capital is much larger in comparison to that of R&D,

which partly xelects the larger share of capital. The inference that can be

drawn is that if the adjustment costs were lower, the growth of output would

have been larger, especially in the U.S. manufacturing sector.

Summary and Conclusions

     A dynamic factor demand model with two variable inputs (labor and energy)

and two quasi-fixed factors (capital stock and stock of R&D) was formulated

and estimated using data for the period 1965 to 1977 for the manufacturing

sectors of the three major industrialized countries, the U.S., Japan, and

Germany. The model was derived from an intertemporal cost-minimization problem

formulated in discrete time. The empirical results suggest that:



      (a)   The adjustment cost model explains the behavior of inputs fairly well.

     The speed of adjustment of stocks of plant and equipment and R&D investments

     are generally different from each other and vary across countries. It

     takes a considerably longer time for the stock of R&D to adjust to its

     optimum value than for the capital stcck.



     (b) The patterns of own- and cross—price elasticities of the inputs vary

     considerably among countries. The magnitudes of the own—elasticities

     differ across countries, and there is a substitutional relation between

     labor an other inputs. Capital and energy are complements in some

     countries and substitutes in others.. The output elasticities of the inputs

     in the short and iritermedjate runs differ from each other and across

     countries. The labor input overshoots, in the short run, its long—run

     equilibrium value to compensate for the sluggish adjustments of the two

     quasi-fixed inputs; the output elasticities of capital stock are generally

     larger than those of R&D in the short and medium runs. Technical change

     seems to be generally labor-, capital-, and R&D—saving. There are, however,
                                                                     37




exceptions: In the U.S., technology seems to be R&D- and capital-

using. The magnitude of the effect of technical change is often

larger on capital than on R&D.



(c) An interesting result is that the average net rate of return

exclusive of the costs of adjustment and depreciation rate are similar

for both R&D and capital in the manufacturing sectors of the three

countries. The rate of return on R&D is often somewhat greater than

that on capital in each sector.



(d) The presence of the cost of adjustment does not contribute a great

deal to the growth of total factor productivity, but makes a significant

difference in the process and timing of investment and calculation of

the rates of return in the short run. The adjustment lags differ

greatly among the manufacturing sectors and between capital and R&D; we

find an 'verage lag of 2 years for capital in the U.S. and about one year

for Japan and Germany. The average lag for R&D is about 5½ years in the

U.S. and about 3 years in Japan and Germany. The results for U.S.

manufacturing are similar to some evidence reported in the literature.

Our results as a whole confirm the notion that it takes a much longer

period for R&D to contribute to output than does capital.



(e). Factor demands in Japanese manufacturing behave quite differently than

in the other countries. The contrast is fairly sharp between the U.S. and

Japanese experiences. The quasi-fixed factors adjust more quickly and the
                                                                            38



     inputs respond much more to changes in output, prices and technical

     change in the Japanese manufacturing than in the U.S. Also, the

     contributions of various factors of production to growth of output are

     quite different in the two countries.



     There are several issues that require further research. One is the

relaxation of the assumption of constant returns to scale. Another possibility

is to relax the assumption of instantaneous adjustment of labor. Our assumption

of static expectation is very restrictive. Some attempt has recently been made

to incorporate non—static expectations with adjustment costs in a unified

analytical framework (see Prucha and Nadiri (1982)), which could be extended to

this study. The strong assumption of separability between the two quasi-fixed

inputs, which rules out any substitution between them, and the interdependency

of their adjustment pattern requires further work. Finally, there is a need for

increasing the span of time for the study by collecting new data for the recent

years and re—estimating the model.

      *This study is part of an ongoing research project on the role of R&D
       in productivity growth, at NBER's New York Off ice. Similar studies on
       other European countries are currently underway involving the authors
       and Professor Angelo Cardani. Miguel Oviedo provided extremely
       useful assistance in preparation of this study.




1.      For a brief survey of contributions of R&D to growth of output and tte
        determinants of R&D expenditure see Nadiri (1980). Also see Griliches
        (1980, a)

2.      See Mansfield (1980) and Griliches (1980,b) for a discussion of the rates
        of return on R&D in various U.S. sectors and industries.

3.      Pakes (1981) has recently examined the lags between R&D and patents.

4.      There is a vast literature on the role of energy in growth of output,
        productivity growth and technic&l change; see Jorgenson and Fraumeni
         (1981) and Berndt (1980) for some contrasting findings.

5.      For a general dynamic factor demand model see Prucha and Nadiri (1982).

6.      In case of nonstatic expectations it is generally difficult to solve
        first-order conditions explicitly. For a discussion of how to estimate
        cost—of—adjustment models under general nonstatic expectations see
        Prucha and Nadiri (1982).

7.      The normalized restricted cost function corresponding to a linear
        homogeneous technology is in general of the form



        For a generalization of the above functional form tc the homothetic case
        see Prucha and Nadiri (1983).

8.       For a review of the empirical studies on this issue see Mittelstdt (1983).

 9.      We note that tle subsequent discussion generalizes in a trivial way to
         more than two quasi—fixed factors.
10. In case we want to calculate the rate of return on the last, say, 50
     units, we have to make a comparison with returns attainable from an
     input sequence for which net investment in period 5 is      - 50.


11. Man—hours worked in the German manufacturing sector declined over the
     period 1965 to 1977, especially after 1974. Similar figures are
     reported by Kendrick (1981), Table 1, p. 128.

                      Data   Sources and Constructions



     The data cover the period from 1965 to 1977 and pertain to the total

manufacturing sectors of the U.S., Japan and Germany. The data have been

assembled from various sources, indicated below:



     Labor: Employment (L) is measured in man—hours per year. The

employment data for the U.S. and Japan are from the OECD (1981). Those for

Germany were obtained directly from the Statistical Office of the European

Communities, Luxembourg. For all countries the figures on hours worked are

provided in ILO (1980) and earlier publications.
     Capital: The figures on net capital stock (K) are obtained from

various sources. The capital stock series for the U.S. comes from the U.S.

Department of commerce (1982). For Japan, the gross capital stock series

reported by the Economic Planning Agency (1977) is converted to a net capital

stock series using the gross—to—net capital stock ratios contained in

Denison and Chung (1973). The capital stock series for Germany is taken from

the OECD (1983). All capital stocks are measured as end—of—period stocks in

1970 prices.

     nergy;    The source for energy consumption (E) is OECD (1980) and

earlier issues, The data are spliced to obtain a consistent series. Energy is

measured in millions of tons of oil equivalent.

        'R&D; The R&D' stock (R) is constructed by the perpetual inventory method
with a depreciation rate of ,lO, The benchmark is obtained from the first
period    R&D' expenditure divided by the depreciation rate and the growth rate in

real    value—added, The nominal       R&D expenditures   are from   the OECD (1979) and

(1982),      The GNP deflator is used     as a deflator for R&D.

        Wage   Rate;   Total   compensations per hour worked (wL) are    obtained from U , S.

Department of Labor (1980),
        User   Cost of Capital; The user cost of capital (cK) is constructed as
   =    qK      + 'r), where qK =   investment deflator, 5K = depreciation rate of
capital stock, and r government bond yield, The nominal and real investment

data used to compute the implicit investment deflator are from the same sources

as the capital stock data, For Japan, we use the investment deflator for

machinery and equipment published by the Bank of Japan (1981), The IMF (1979)

has the figures on the government bond yields, The depreciation rates are

obtained implicitly from the perpetual inventory formula, using the gross

investment and net capital stock figures,

        User CostofR&D The user cost of R&D (.cK) is constructed in the same

way as c using the R&D depreciation rate and the GNP deflator,

       Energy Price; The energy price (WE)        for   the United States in 1970 is

constructed by dividing the nominal energy consumption, provided by Norsworthy

and Harper C1981), by the real energy consumption figures, published by the OECD.

The 1970 value for Japan and Germany is computed by multiplying the U,S, figure

by a relative price factor derived from Mittelst'ádt and Hall (1981), The 1970

yalues are then linked to country indices, which have been provided by the

OECD,
                                     A3




     0utDutz   Output (Q) is measured as gross value-added at 1970 prices plus

the energy expenditures and the R&D serivces, both in 1970 prices. The real

value—added figures are taken from the OECD (1982) for the US, and Japan. Those

for Germany were obtained directly from the Statistical Office of the European

Communities, Luxembourg. The energy expenditures in 1970 prices are obtained

by multiplying the energy series by their 1970 price. The R&D services are

obtained by multiplying the stock of R&D (in 1970 dollars) by the sum of the

depreciation and interest rates.

     For the data of different countries to be comparable, all currencies are

converted to IJ,S, dollars, using the purchasing power parities for gross

dc*nestic income for 1970 computed by R, Summers, I,B, Kravis and A. Heston

(1980), Variations in the exchange rates are therefore eliminated!

       The Trnqu.ist approximation of the standard Divisia index is based on a

(This reflects that the scale elasticity of the underlying technology is one

slightly different context). Using (A,4) we get

It is now readily seen that substitution of (A,3) and (A,5) into (16) yields

the decomposition (17),
