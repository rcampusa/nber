                                 ABSTRACT




      The potential of reverse annuity mortgages to increase the
current income of the elderly is analyzed. We conclude that most
low-income elderly also have little housing equity, although this
is not always the case. In general, a reverse annuity mortgage
would substantially affect the income only of the single elderly
who are very old —— whose life expectancy is short. On the other
hand, if the transfer were in the form of a lump sum          amount   ——

rather   than an annuity -—   the payment would increase the liquid
wealth of most elderly families by a large fraction. Thus
legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse
mortgages could improve substantially the financial status of a
small proportion of the elderly. But the specter of a large
number of poor widows with vast amounts of "locked—in" housing
equity does not reflect the reality. Most low-income elderly
have relatively little housing wealth.

    The vast majority of the personal saving of most Americans is in the form

of housing equity. Indeed most reach retirement age with very little liquid

wealth, like bank saving accounts. One might expect therefore that housing

wealth would be used to finance consumption as the elderly age. In fact

reverse annuity mortgages have been proposed to facilitate drawing down of

housing wealth while at the same time allowing families to continue living in

their homes. Yet recent studies have shown that at least through age 73

housing wealth is typically not reduced as persons age.1 We concluded in

earlier work (Venti and Wise (l989b, 1989a]) that the retention of housing

equity was not simply the result of transaction costs associated with moving.

Housing equity increases with appreciation in home values as long as a family

remains in the same home, but even the elderly who move from one home to

another are as likely to increase as to decrease housing equity. Thus we also

concluded that even if reverse annuity mortgages were readily available the

demand for them would be very limited. The implication was that the typical

elderly family did not want to reduce housing equity to finance other

consumption.

       We analyze in this paper the extent to which housing equity could in fact

change the consumption of the elderly, if housing equity were converted to a

more liquid form. The mechanism for home equity conversion that we consider

is a reverse annuity mortgage. The primary goal is to understand the

potential effect on the current income of the elderly of conversion of

illiquid housing wealth into an income stream. The demand for reverse annuity

mortgages may be limited simply because these mortgages are too costly or

because families that have low income from other sources also have low housing

equity. We proceed as follows:

       • First, we present the most recent data on the wealth of the elderly,
         emphasizing the large fraction of non-pension assets accounted for by
         housing equity.

       • Second, we document that even among the older old housing equity is
         typically not reduced as the elderly age. Our earlier results were
         based on the Retirement History Survey (RHS) that followed elderly
         persons only through age 73. The analysis in this paper is based on
         the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), which includes
         all age groups.

       • Third, we consider whether housing equity is treated as a substitute
         for liquid saving, by analyzing the relationship between housing equity
         and the change (possibly the reduction) in liquid assets as the elderly
         age. In particular, we ask whether persons with more housing equity
         more likely to consume liquid wealth as they age?

       • Fourth, the potential of reverse annuity mortgages to increase the
         current income of the elderly is analyzed. In particular, we determine
         by how much the current income of elderly families would be increased
         if they were to obtain reverse mortgages, and thus convert housing
         equity into cash that could be used for day to day expenses.

       We conclude that most low-income elderly also have little housing equity,

although this is not always the case. In general, a reverse annuity mortgage

would substantially affect the income only of the single elderly who are very
old - -   whose life expectancy is short. On the other hand, if the transfer

were   in the form of a lump sum payment - - rather than an annuity - - the
payment would increase the liquid wealth of most elderly families by a large
                                      (3)


fraction. Thus legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse

mortgages could improve substantially the financial status of a small

proportion of the elderly. But the specter of a large number of poor widows

with vast amounts of "locked-in" housing equity does not reflect the reality.

Most low-income elderly have relatively little housing wealth.



I.   The Data and Housing Equity versus other Wealth.

     A. The Data.

     The analysis is based on the first panel of the new Survey of Income and

Program Participation (SIPP). The SIPP is an ongoing rolling survey of the

U.S. population. It is organized by panel. Each panel consists of eight

interview waves administered every four months for 32 months. The first panel

initially contained approximately 20,000 households and was first surveyed in

1984. The fourth and seventh waves included questions about housing costs.

Most of the cross section results presented below are based on the fourth wave

(administered in September through December 1984). It includes 6,579

households with reference persons age 55 and over, 3,891 age 65 and over,

1,592 age 75 and over, and 291 age 85 and over. The longitudinal analysis is

based on the fourth and seventh waves.2 The seventh wave (administered in




     2The fourth and seventh waves were not matched directly, but instead each
was linked to the 1984 SIPP Full Panel Research File, provided by the Bureau
of the Census. Without this special longitudinal file, it is not possible to
determine the reasons for changes in family composition between the fourth and
seventh waves.
     The Census Bureau has provided the following statement about the data:
"This report uses data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
1984 Full Panel (Preliminary) File, which was released by the Census Bureau
for research to improve understanding and analysis of the SIPP data. The data
on the file are preliminary and should be analyzed and interpreted with
caution. At the time the file was created, the Census Bureau was still
exploring certain unresolved technical and methodological issues associated
with the creation of this data set. The Census Bureau does not approve or
endorse the use of this data set. The Census Bureau does not approve or

September through December 1985) includes 4,947 households with reference

persons over age 55, 3,122 over age 65, 1,297 over age 75, and 263 over age

85.

      The 1984 panel is the largest of the SIPP panels. Subsequent panels will

include approximately 12,000 households. Ultimately the number of old old in

all of the panels taken together will be much larger than the number now

available. Detailed analysis of some questions is not possible with the

current sample size. In particular, the number of homeowners that moved

between 1984 and 1985 is small. Nonetheless, the key questions that we pose

can be answered with considerable confidence.


      B. Housing Wealth and the Composition of Total Wealth.

      The composition of total wealth for all households, for homeowners, and

for renters is summarized in figures la, ib, and Ic, which are based on median

wealth by asset category.3 It is clear from figure la that most families

approach retirement age with very little personal saving other than housing

equity. For example, among households with heads 60 to 65, the median of




endorse the use of these data for official estimates."

     3The numbers on which the figures are based, and the comparable means,
are shown in appendix tables la, lb, and ic of the working paper version of
this paper, Venti and Wise [1990], and are available from the authors on
request. In many instances throughout the paper both medians and means are
shown. Although the asset category means provide a consistent summary, in
that they sum to the total wealth mean, in some instances they are a
misleading indicator of the wealth of the typical household. This is
particularly true for liquid wealth; the median for all households is $7.8
thousand, compared to a mean of $34.3.
                                     (5)


liquid wealth is only $6.6 thousand; the median of housing equity is $43.O.

     The majority of families rely heavily on Social Security (SS) benefits

for support after retirement, and to a more limited extent on the saving that

is done for them by employers, through defined benefit pension plans. The

SIPP data allow estimation of the value of SS and pension plan benefits only

after the payments are received.5 Thus wealth in the form of SS and pensions

is only recorded for persons who have begun to receive the payments. Most

persons have retired by 65 and thereafter are receiving the benefits to which

they are entitled. About 59 percent of households with reference persons

between 65 and 70 receive pension benefits; 89 percent receive SS benefits.

The present value of pension and SS wealth is based on life tables together

with the amount of the annual payments. Social Security benefits are indexed

to inflation; private pension benefits typically are not.6 As can be seen

from figure la, SS and pension wealth is by far the most important component

of the wealth of most elderly. Among households with heads 65 to 70, for




     4The category "liquid wealth excluding stocks" is broadly defined to
include interest earning assets held in banks and other institutions,
mortgages held, money owned from sale of businesses, U.S. Savings Bonds, and
checking accounts, less unsecured debt.   The category "liquid wealth
including stocks" also includes equity in stocks and mutual fund shares.

     5The SIPP data do not contain SS earnings histories - - that determine SS
benefits, nor do they contain detailed pension plan provisions


     6The present values of pension and SS benefits are the discounted
survival weighted streams of income from each source received by the reference
person and the spouse if present. Discounting is at 6 percent and survival
probabilities are calculated from mortality tables by sex. Payments from SS,
military pensions, federal employee pensions, and the railroad retirement
pension are assumed to be indexed at an annual rate of 4 percent. All other
sources of pension income are not indexed in the wealth calculations.
                                         (6)



example, the median of SS and pension wealth combined is $113.4 thousand; the

median of housing wealth is $38.0 thousand and the median of liquid financial

assets is only $10.0 thousand. The decline in SS and pension wealth with age

is largely an artifact of declining life expectancy. As will be shown below,

the lower housing equity of older households is a cohort effect and does not

reflect a reduction of housing equity as individual households age; in fact,

housing equity increases on average as the elderly age; there is little change

in housing equity even among families that move from one home to another.

        Comparison of figures lb and lc shows that households who rent have

substantially less wealth than homeowners in all asset categories. The median

total wealth of homeowners is $170.4 thousand; the median for renters is $59.3

thousand.

        In summary: the majority of elderly households live on fixed annuity

income. The fixed income of most households could be increased by only a

small amount by depleting liquid assets; most households have very small

amounts of liquid wealth. Housing is the only form of wealth that could

potentially add appreciably to the fixed annuity income of the typical elderly

family. Whether housing equity is now used for this purpose is considered

next.


II. Aginz and Housing Eguity.

        Because changes in housing equity -   - other   than the increase due to

market appreciation in home values - -   have   almost always been associated with

moving, we emphasize here the extent to which the elderly reduce housing

equity when the family preference is the easiest to realize. Based on the

Retirement History Survey (RHS), we concluded in an earlier paper (Venti and

Wise (l989a1) that elderly homeowners who moved, through age 73, were as
                                        (7)


likely to increase as to decrease housing equity. Indeed, the average change

in the housing equity of movers was not significantly different from the

average change for stayers, whose housing equity increased simply because of

appreciation in home values. The largest changes were among those with low

income and high housing equity -   - who tended to reduce housing equity - - and

among those with high income and low housing equity - - who tended to increase

housing equity when they moved. We want to consider here whether that result

is different for the older elderly, who may be more likely to face the need to

use housing equity to meet other expenses.

     Because of the small number of movers in the SIPP sample of elderly

households, it is not possible to obtain estimates from the SIPP data exactly

comparable estimates based on the PBS. A simplified version of our earlier

specification can be estimated, however. In addition, it is possible to

compare the housing equity of recent movers with the equity of those who have

owned their homes for some time. We consider each method in turn.


     A. Moving and Change in Housing Equity.

     Because of reporting errors, families who report an unusually high level

of income or housing equity in one year tend to report a lower level the next

year. That is, errors in variables create a regression toward the mean. This

tends to exaggerate the reported change in housing equity for movers with low

income and high housing equity and with high income and low housing equity.

We correct for this effect by considering only the change for movers that was

above and beyond the reported change for stayers.
                                                                                   of
     This is accomplished be by using an analysis of variance specification

the form
                                                    (8)



               111985 - H1984 —      p + jdij      ,       for   stayers
 (1)

              H1985 -     1984 —     p' + ijdjj for movers,
                                                       ,




where H1985 -
                    H1984 is the change in housing equity between 1984 and 1985, p +

       represents the average change in housing equity for stayers in the th

income and the jth housing equity interval, and p'                         +       represents the

change for movers. The estimates are normalized by setting                           Xd 0 and
       — 0.    Thus p     is   a weighted average change in housing equity for

households that do not move and p'            is   the weighted average change for movers.

Separate estimates are obtained for stayers and movers. The results are shown

in the top two panels of table 1.

       The effect of reporting errors is clearly evident in the estimated

changes by income and housing equity for stayers. Households who report the

unusual combination of low income and high housing equity in 1984, tend to

report lower housing equity the next year; households who report high income

and low housing equity in 1984 tend to report higher housing equity the next

year. This is the regression toward the mean. There is essentially no

reported change for households who report income and housing equity around

their mean levels (income interval 2 and housing equity interval 2).

       The pattern for movers is much more pronounced. Treating the change for

stayers as due to reporting errors, the actual change for movers can be

estimated by subtracting the change for stayers from the change for movers.

The estimated change for movers in the ith income and the th housing equity

interval,     net   of   reporting   errors, is given by p'            +       -         The results
                                                                                   d3.
are reproduced in the lower panel of table 7.
                                                (9)



      The average change for stayers is 1.6, with a standard error of 1.2; the

average for movers is -8.9, with a standard error of 5.3. Thus although there

is a reduction in the average housing equity of the small sample of movers, it

is not possible to reject the hypothesis that the average change for movers is

zero, nor that on average the change for movers is the same as the change for

stayers.


      B. Housing Eciuitv and Years Since Purchase.

      Data for a larger sample can be used by considering housing equity by the

number of years since the house was purchased. Table 2 shows median housing

equity by age and by the number of years since the home was purchased. These

data suggest that families that moved in the past three years. or in the past

six years, have approximately as much housing equity as households in the same

cohort that have owned their homes longer. Indeed, of households over 65.

recent movers tend to have the largest housing equity, suggesting that they

increased equity when they moved.

      A more formal decomposition of the means into cohort effects, years owned

effects, and interaction effects, is provided by a specification of the form



(2)        H1984 —   Ii + a1   +
                                   El Ejrij +




where z is an overall mean, the a are age effects, the l are years owned

effects,   and the rjj are interaction terms.7 The results are shown in table



      7The parameters are normalized by setting
jaj
      —
          Xl   —      —            —   0.
                                           (10)



3, with the years owned effects to the right, the age effects across the

bottom, and the interaction terms as cell entries. The cohort effects show a

decline in housing equity with age, but given the cohort, there is little

relationship between housing equity and years owned, as indicated by the years

owned effects. In particular, families over 65 who have bought homes in the

last three years have no less housing equity than families who have owned

their homes longer; the relevant coefficient is -1.8 with a standard error of

4.2. The hypothesis that all of the interactions terms are zero cannot be

rejected, based on an F-test, nor can the hypothesis that both the interaction

and the years owned effects are zero. An F-test does reject the hypothesis

that the cohort effects are zero.

        In summary:   Consistent   with the RHS   data,   the evidence from the small

sample of Sipp movers shows that families with unusually large amounts of home

equity wealth, given income, are likely to reduce home equity when they move;

families with unusually little home equity, given income, are likely to

increase home equity when they move. These data also suggest that when older

families move there may    be   some reduction in home equity on average, but the

small   sample   of movers does not allow a precise estimate. The data on home

equity by years since purchase suggest that older families do not typically

reduce housing equity when they move. We conclude therefore that the weight

of the evidence indicates little change, on average, in the housing equity of

older families when they move. The evidence for the older households in the

SIPP is consistent with the evidence for the younger old in the R}S.           At   the

time of a move, conscious choice does not lead to a reduction in housing

equity. But because of appreciation in home values, housing equity increases

among families who do not move. Thus these results, like similar results
                                          (11)



based on the R}IS, suggest a limited demand for reverse annuity mortgages, were

they readily available. But among the small proportion of families with low

income and relatively large home equity, the demand could be important.



III. Is Home Equity a Substitute Liquid Wealth?

      Although the findings reported in the previous section show little

reduction on average in housing equity as persons age, it may be that the

reduction in housing equity depends on the availability of other more liquid

assets and vice versa. It is common to treat home equity just like any other

form of saving, when considering saving and wealth accumulation, with the

implication that one is a good substitute for the other. If this were true,

and assuming that the elderly would like to hold some wealth for precautionary

purposes, it might be expected that the reduction in liquid assets with age

would depend on the amount of home equity, with those with more home equity

more willing to use liquid assets to meet current expenses.

      To determine whether this is the case, we consider the change in liquid

wealth between 1984 and 1985 as a function first of housing equity and liquid

wealth, and then as a function of housing equity and total non-housing wealth.

Median changes are shown in table 4. The data suggest little relationship

between housing equity and decumulation of liquid wealth. The median change

in liquid wealth is          More formal estimates are obtained with an analysis

of variance model of the form



(3)        1.985 -   L1984(l+r)
                                  —   +

                                                           ij   (ey)ij



where r is the return on bank saving accounts (taken to be 6 percent), L

represents liquid assets, eL represents the ith home equity interval effect,
                                           (12)



Yj
     represents   the jth income interval effect, and (eY)jj the interaction

effect associated with the ith home equity and the jth income interval. The

estimates are shown in table 5. Unreported estimates with total non-housing

wealth instead of income yield similar results. Two aspects of the results

are striking: First the data show, on average, no decline in liquid wealth

with age; the weighted average is $2,000, with a standard error of $3,200.

Second, the data show no relationship between housing equity and the reduction

in liquid wealth. (The result is confirmed statistically by an R2 value of

0.002, indicating that there is no statistically significant relationship

between housing equity --     or   income -- and change in liquid assets.)   Thus

these data show no substitution of one form of wealth for the other.8 The

result of course may simply reflect the fact that most elderly have very

little liquid wealth and thus have almost nothing to deplete.



IV. Reverse l4ortzaees and the      Annuity   Value of Housina Equity.

      The analysis in section II suggests that the potential demand for reverse

mortgages, even among the older old, is likely to be small on average; it

appears that the typical elderly family would not choose to withdraw funds

from housing equity to meet day-to-day living expenses, even if it were easy

to do so. And, the simple calculations reported in section III suggest that

depletion of other liquid assets is not typically substituting for transfers

from housing equity. In this section we consider directly the potential of

reverse mortgages to affect the financial position of the elderly. In




     8Further evidence that different forms of assets may not substitute for
each other is provided by Shefrin and Thaler [1988] and Thaler [1990].
                                      (13)


particular, how would they affect the current income of the poorer elderly,

if, contrary to the apparent limited demand for them, the elderly took

advantage of this financial instrument?


      A. Assumntions.

      The question is most easily addressed by considering the potential income

from a "life-time" reverse annuity mortgage. Assume that the bank obtains the

house at the death of the owner (or owners). In the meantime, the owner

continues to live in the house. Thus the bank will have title to an asset at

some uncertain future time. Suppose that the current value of the house is

Ha that it will appreciate at an annual rate g, that the owner who is now age

a will die at age t with probability d(tla), and that the bank discounts

future income at the rate m (possibly the mortgage rate). The present value

of the house to the bank is then

where A is as long as any owner will live, here taken to be 110. Assume that

L is the lump sum that the bank would pay the owner now for the future title

to the house.

      The owner could in principle use the lump sum in any number of ways,

including investment in liquid assets like saving accounts or stock funds. To

assure a certain future income, however, the owner may wish to buy an annuity.

In this case, the income from the sum L depends on the "annuity yield," r.       If

l(tla) is the probability that the owner will be living at age t,   then   the

annual reverse annuity mortgage payment P is determined by the relationship

Both L and P are reported below for subsets of the SIPP population.

       A life-time reverse annuity mortgage like the one described above tends

to exaggerate the potential income from housing equity, and is in fact the

least common of current arrangements. Sale-leaseback and fixed term loans           are

more common. Under the sale-leaseback arrangement, the bank buys the home

outright and leases it back to the owner. Fixed term loans provide a payment

to the owner for a fixed term. At the expiration of the term the loan

payments are repaid, through sale of the home. The "loan" is typically

restricted to 80 percent of the value of the home. Under some arrangements,

the owner shares in the appreciation of the home.9

       The payment under the life-time annuity arrangement depends on several

parameters: the bank discount (mortgage) rate in, the home value appreciation

rate g, and the annuity yield r. New home mortgage rates averaged 8.80

percent in the 1970's and 12.31 percent between 1980 and 1987. The average

annual increase in the median price of one-family homes was 9.32       percent in

the 1970's and 6.22 percent between 1980 and 1985. The increase has not been

above 4 percent since 1981. Annuity yields are typically 4 to 6 percentage

points below the long-term interest rate, according to Friedman and Warshawsky

[1985]. In the calculations below, the bank discount rate is assumed to be 10

percent, home values are assumed to appreciate at 5 percent a year, and the

annuity yield is assumed to be 5 percent.

      To illustrate the sensitivity of the calculations to these assumptions

the annual payment to a single women with home equity of $45,700 (the median

housing equity of home owners over age 65) is shown in table 6 for several

ages and for alternative parameter assumptions.


       B. Simulations.

      The potential additional income from reverse annuity mortgage payments is

summarized in figures 2a through 2c. The figures are based on medians by

income interval and age. More detail is provided in appendix table 1 by

marital status, age, and income. An annual payment is calculated for each

homeowner. The income thirds are determined separately for each age interval.

(For example, the "low" income interval for persons age 65 to 70 refers to the

third of homeowners with the lowest incomes in the 65 to 70 age group.) For

comparison, the median income and the median home equity within each interval

are also shown. The SIPP "top codes" age at 85; thus all persons 85 or older

are reported to be 85. The annuity payment are calculated assuming that each

person in this age category is 85. Thus the simulated payments underestimate

the median payment to all persons 85 or older.

      The amount   of   the reverse annuity mortgage payment depends on how long

the   family is expected to remain in the house. Thus the payments increase
with age because the expected number of     years   over which payments will be
received   declines (and because the bank obtains title to the house sooner).

Because life expectancy is greater for women than men at any age, the annual

payment is less for women than for men, given home equity. (Of course, home

equity may also differ.) Married couples will also tend to receive less than
                                     (16)


single persons because payments will continue as long as either of them is

still living, according to our assumptions. Homeowners with higher incomes

also have higher reverse annuity mortgage payments because home equity

typically increases with income.

     The income of typical married couples would be affected very little by

reverse annuity mortgage payments. The median income of couples is $24,625;

the median annual reverse annuity mortgage would be $1,358. Even for most low

income couples the median payment would be a small proportion of median annual

income. A reverse annuity mortgage would mean only a 4 percent increase in

the income of the typical low-income couple aged 55 to 60; it would mean

approximately a 10 percent increase for those 65 to 70. Only for the oldest

low income couples would a reverse mortgage mean a substantial relative

increase in income. For those who are 85 and over the increase would be about

35 percent. The payment is larger for the older group and their income is

lover.

     Single persons stand to gain the most, in relative terms, from reverse

annuity mortgages primarily because they have much lower incomes than married

couples)0 The median income of single men is only 60 percent of the median

for couples; the median income of single women is only 44 percent of the

median for couples.   The median payment for low-income single men is almost

50 percent of their median income. The median payment for low-income single

women is about 36 percent of their median income. Indeed for both low-income




            is consistent with the limited operational experience with reverse
mortgages. Three variants of reverse mortgage programs are summarized in U.S.
HUD [1985]. Single women accounted for 69, 89, and 82 percent of each
program's participation.
                                            (17)

men and women 85 and over, the median reverse annuity mortgage payment is

almost   as large as other income. The difference between the payments          to

single   men and single women arises primarily because of the longer life
expectancy of women.
     It is a common perception that       widows - -   the   large majority of single

women - -   have   relatively large   amounts of home equity wealth compared to

income. These data suggest that that is true only for the small proportion of

widows who have the lowest incomes and are at least 70 years old. But it is

not the situation of the typical widow. Overall, the median reverse annuity

mortgage payment is about 20 percent of the median income of widows.

     One of the reasons that the annuity payments are so low is that the

annuity yield is low. The stream of         payments that can be     purchased" with a

dollar is much less than actuarially fair; either because the profit and fees

on annuities are large or because of adverse selection; the buyers of private

annuities may have unusually long lives. Thus a lump sum payment may be of

greater value than an annuity to the typical elderly person.11 Figures 3a

through 3c summarize the potential addition to liquid assets from reverse

mortgage lump sum payments. The figures are based on median values in each

interval. More detail is presented in appendix table 2. The table shows the

median potential reverse mortgage lump sum payment, together with median

liquid wealth and other non-housing wealth (principally pension and SS

wealth).




     11Again, this is supported by the limited operational experience. Of the
first 43 reverse mortgages closed in a trial program in Buffalo during 1983-
84, only four families chose to receive an annuity; the remainder chose a lump
sum option. See Weinrobe [1985].
                                         (18)



      The lump sum payments are typically much greater relative to liquid

wealth than the annuity payment is relative to annual income. The median lump

sum payment for married couples would be almost twice as large as median

liquid wealth, whereas the annuity payment would be less than 6 percent of

income. The median lump sum for low-income couples over 85 would be almost

ten times as large as liquid wealth. Relative to liquid wealth, the lump sum

is especially large for the oldest low-income single persons; the median for

single men and for single women is over 17 times as large as their median

liquid wealth, Indeed for the low-income oldest old single persons the lump

sum is approximately equivalent to all other wealth combined.



IV.   Summary.

      Although   housing equity is the vast majority of the saving of most

Americans, the weight of the evidence from the 1984 SIPP panel suggests that

even the older elderly do not typically reduce housing equity as they age,

consistent with earlier findings for the younger old.12 In addition, summary

calculations show essentially no substitution of housing equity for non-

housing saving; the depletion or accumulation of non-liquid wealth with age

seems unrelated to housing equity. Indeed in this sample, the liquid wealth

of the typical elderly family changes very little with age. The median change

is zero. Thus          elderly live on Social Security and pension annuities

without using housing equity for current consumption. Because housing equity




     12This conclusion is qualified because of the relatively small number of
movers in the sample. When the data from all four of the SIPP panels become
available and can be combined, a more precise estimate will be possible.
                                         (19)


is such a large fraction of the non-pension wealth of most families, it        is
natural to consider the extent to which current consumption could be increased

by converting housing equity to liquid assets, that could be used for current

consumption.

     Our   calculations   show that the income of most elderly families would be

increased very little if housing equity were converted to current income

through a reverse annuity mortgage. This may be a principle reason for the

limited demand for such mortgages. On the other hand, a reverse annuity

mortgage would double the income of typical single persons over 85. In

general, the relative addition to income from a reverse annuity mortgage

increases with age and is largest for low-income single persons.

     Lump sum reverse mortgage payments would be much larger, relative to

liquid wealth, than annuity payments are relative to income. That is, the

elderly could increase liquid wealth much more than income by means of a

reverse mortgage. This is because most non-housing wealth of the elderly is

in the form of SS and pension assets -    - from   which most income is derived - -

and, to a lesser extent, because of the low yield on privately purchased
annuities.

     Legislation that would facilitate the market for reverse mortgages could

improve substantially the financial status of a small proportion of the

elderly. But the specter of a large number of poor widows with vast amounts

of locked-in housing equity does not reflect the reality. Most low-income

elderly have relatively little housing wealth.
