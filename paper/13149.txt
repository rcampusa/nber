Offshoring and Unemployment

                                              ABSTRACT

In this paper, in order to study the impact of offshoring on sectoral and economywide rates of unemployment,
we construct a two sector general equilibrium model in which labor is mobile across the two sectors,
and unemployment is caused by search frictions. We find that, contrary to general perception, wage
increases and sectoral unemployment decreases due to offshoring. This result can be understood to
arise from the productivity enhancing (cost reducing) effect of offshoring. If the search cost is identical
in the two sectors, or even if the search cost is higher in the sector which experiences offshoring, the
economywide rate of unemployment decreases. We also find multiple equilibrium outcomes in the
extent of offshoring and therefore, in the unemployment rate. Furthermore, a firm can increase its
domestic employment through offshoring. Also, such a firm's domestic employment can be higher
than a firm that chooses to remain fully domestic. When we modify the model to disallow intersectoral
labor mobility, the negative relative price effect on the sector in which firms offshore some of their
activity becomes stronger. In such a case, it is possible for this effect to offset the positive productivity
effect, and result in a rise in unemployment in that sector. In the other sector, offshoring has a much
stronger unemployment reducing effect in the absence of intersectoral labor mobility than in the presence
of it. Finally, allowing for an endogenous number of varieties provides an additional indirect channel,
through which sectoral unemployment goes down due to the entry of new firms brought about by offshoring.

1      Introduction
"O¤shoring" is the sourcing of inputs (goods and services) from foreign countries. When production of these
inputs moves to foreign countries, the fear at home is that jobs will be lost and unemployment will rise.
In the recent past, this has become an important political issue. The remarks by Greg Mankiw, when he
was Head of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, that "outsourcing is just a new way of doing
international trade" and is "a good thing" came under sharp attack from prominent politicians from both
sides of the aisle. Recent estimates by Forrester Research of job losses due to o¤shoring equaling a total of
3.3 million white collar jobs by 2015 and the prediction by Deloitte Research of the outsourcing of 2 million
…nancial sector jobs by the year 2009 have drawn a lot of attention from politicians and journalists (Drezner,
2004), even though these job losses are only a small fraction of the total number unemployed, especially when
we take into account the fact that these losses will be spread over many years.1 Furthermore, statements
by IT executives have added fuel to this …re. One such statement was made by an IBM executive who
said "[Globalization] means shifting a lot of jobs, opening a lot of locations in places we had never dreamt
of before, going where there is low-cost labor, low-cost competition, shifting jobs o¤shore", while another
statement was made by Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorna in her testimony before Congress that "there
is no job that is America’s God-given right anymore" (Drezner, 2004). The alarming estimates by Bardhan
and Kroll (2003) and McKinsey (2005) that 11 percent of our jobs are potentially at risk of being o¤shored
have provided politicians with more ammunition for their position on this issue.
     While the relation between o¤shoring and unemployment has been an important issue for politicians, the
media and the public, there has hardly been any careful theoretical analysis of this relationship by economists.
In this paper, in order to study the impact of o¤shoring on sectoral and economywide rates of unemployment,
we construct a two sector general equilibrium model in which unemployment is caused by search frictions
a la Pissarides (2000). Firms in an imperfectly competitive, di¤erentiated products sector use two inputs
to produce varieties of an intermediate good. The production of one of these inputs can be o¤shored
after incurring a …xed cost, while the other input (which we call headquarter services) must be produced
domestically. There is a large variety of these intermediate goods used in the production of a homogeneous
good produced under perfect competition. There is another sector that produces a homogeneous good under
perfect competition and whose production is less sophisticated in that it uses only labor (under constant
    1 The   average number of gross job losses per week in the US is about 500,000 (Blinder, 2006). Also see Bhagwati, Panagariya
and Srinivasan (2004) on the plausibility and magnitudes of available estimates of the unemployment e¤ects of o¤shoring.




                                                                 1
returns to scale). In the absence of o¤shoring there is a unique equilibrium in the economy. It is shown
that when we allow the possibility of o¤shoring, there exists the possibility of multiple equilibria: (1) an
equilibrium with no o¤shoring, (2) a mixed equilibrium where a fraction of …rms o¤shore while others source
their inputs domestically, and …nally (3) an equilibrium where all …rms o¤shore their input production.
O¤shoring reduces the cost of producing intermediate goods, and consequently the cost of the good using
these intermediates. When a large number of intermediate …rms o¤shore, the cost of production of the
intermediate-using sophisticated good is low and therefore, its price is low. This, in turn, results in a high
quantity demanded and hence a large scale of production of this good and a large market for intermediate
goods. Thus, a large amount of o¤shoring is feasible and large scale production at a low cost and selling
at a low price remain sustainable. On the other hand when very few intermediate …rms o¤shore, the cost
of production and the price of the intermediate-using good are high and the resulting scale of production is
small, which in turn can support o¤shoring only by a few …rms.
   Looking at the impact of o¤shoring on unemployment and wages, we …nd that, contrary to general
perception, wage increases and sectoral unemployment decreases due to o¤shoring. This result can be
understood to arise from the productivity enhancing (cost reducing) e¤ect of o¤shoring.2 While the incentive
to create vacancies (per worker) in the sector where o¤shoring takes place increases due to the productivity
e¤ect of o¤shoring, in the other sector this incentive increases due to an improvement in its relative price.
Therefore, more jobs are created in both sectors, thereby putting an upward pressure on wages and a
downward pressure on unemployment in each sector.3
   The impact of o¤shoring on overall economywide unemployment, however, depends on how the structure
or the composition of the economy changes. Even though both sectors have lower unemployment post-
o¤shoring, whether the sector with the lower unemployment or higher unemployment expands will also
be a determinant of the overall unemployment rate. If the search cost is identical in the two sectors,
implying identical rates of sectoral unemployment, then the economywide rate of unemployment declines
unambiguously after o¤shoring. Alternatively, if the search cost is higher in the sector which experiences
  2 This   is due to the increase in the marginal product of the workers at the headquarters arising from employment of more
production input per headquarter worker (since the input is now cheaper) in the o¤shoring …rms.
  3 O¤shoring   of production activity in one sector makes the other sector relatively more intensive in the use of domestic labor.
At the same time, o¤shoring raises the relative price of the good whose production is not o¤shored, i.e., of the good that is
domestic labor intensive. Therefore, cost of domestic labor (wage rate and market tightness) goes up. This e¤ect is analogous
to the Stolper-Samuelson e¤ect.




                                                                2
o¤shoring (implying a higher wage as well as higher rate of unemployment in that sector), the economywide
rate of unemployment also decreases then because some workers move to the other sector which has a lower
unemployment rate.
   Masked behind the intersectoral reallocation of labor is intra-sectoral reallocation of labor within the
di¤erentiated goods sector in response to o¤shoring. Output is reallocated from …rms that do not o¤shore
to …rms that o¤shore because the latter have lower marginal costs of production and hence charge lower
prices. However, the reallocation of employment is not the same as that of output. Firms that o¤shore a part
of their production process increase their employment of workers involved in the production of headquarter
services. However, since they reduce their employment in production activities, the net impact is ambiguous.
The higher the headquarter intensity of an industry, the more likely it is that o¤shoring …rms increase their
employment relative to …rms that do not o¤shore.
   Next, we modify our model to disallow labor mobility across the labor forces of the two sectors. This can
be considered to be the shorter-run version of the model with labor mobility. It also provides some extra
insights that we otherwise would have missed. Under both labor mobility and no labor mobility, there are two
e¤ects of o¤shoring on the sector that uses the o¤shored input. One is the cost reducing or the productivity
enhancing e¤ect, while the other is the reduction in the relative price: The second e¤ect is stronger under
no labor mobility than under mobile labor and if this e¤ect is strong enough, the sectoral unemployment
rate may go up in this sector. Whether this will be the case or not will depend on the importance of this
good in …nal consumption and on the headquarter intensity in the production of this good. We want to
reiterate that the rise in unemployment upon o¤shoring is only a possibility that can happen under certain
conditions. A reduction of unemployment is also possible in this shorter run model. The favorable relative
price e¤ect of o¤shoring on the other sector (in which production is always fully domestic) is stronger under
no labor mobility than under mobile labor. Therefore, the reduction in the unemployment rate in this sector
(due to o¤shoring) is greater in the short-run than in the model with intersectoral labor mobility.
   We …nally perform another extension of the model in which we have an endogenous number of varieties
of the intermediate good. O¤shoring leads to an increase in the variety of intermediates in equilibrium that
leads to a further productivity increase and therefore a further reduction in unemployment. Thus, allowing
for an endogenous number varieties in the o¤shoring sector provides an additional indirect channel through
which sectoral unemployment goes down.
   Our theoretical results are consistent with the empirical results of Amiti and Wei (2005a, b) for the
US and the UK. They …nd no support for the “anxiety” of “massive job losses” associated with o¤shore




                                                     3
outsourcing from developed to developing countries.4 Using data on 78 sectors in the UK for the period
1992-2001, they …nd no evidence in support of a negative relationship between employment and outsourcing.
In fact, in many of their speci…cations the relationship is positive. In the US case, they …nd a very small,
negative e¤ect of o¤shoring on employment if the economy is decomposed into 450 narrowly de…ned sectors
which disappears when one looks at more broadly de…ned 96 sectors. Alongside this result, they also …nd a
positive relationship between o¤shoring and productivity. These results are consistent with opposing e¤ects
on employment (and unemployment) created by o¤shoring. In this context , Amiti and Wei (2005a) write:
“On the one hand, every job lost is a job lost. On the other hand, …rms that have outsourced may become
more e¢ cient and expand employment in other lines of work. If …rms relocate their relatively ine¢ cient
parts of the production process to another country, where they can be produced more cheaply, they can
expand their output in production for which they have comparative advantage. These productivity bene…ts
can translate into lower prices generating further demand and hence create more jobs. This job creation
e¤ect could in principle o¤set job losses due to outsourcing.”This intuition is consistent with the channels in
our model and the reason for obtaining a result that shows a reduction in sectoral and overall unemployment
as a result of o¤shoring.
    Before, we try to relate our work to the existing literature, we would like to say a couple of things in defense
of our modeling strategy. Firstly, it is quite easy to imagine that there will be …xed costs associated with
o¤shoring. An analytically tractable way to handle …xed costs here is to depart from perfect competition.
This is why the intermediate goods sector which o¤shores input production is assumed to be imperfectly
competitive in this paper. An additional bene…t of using the imperfectly competitive framework is the ability
to study the case when the number of …rms is endogenous and to look at productivity e¤ects of o¤shoring
through changes in input variety. We also introduce cost or productivity heterogeneity, which has been done
to make the coexistence of o¤shoring and non-o¤shoring …rms more likely in the same industry in equilibrium
(when o¤shoring is allowed at a cost).
    We next turn to the existing literature. While the relationship between o¤shoring and unemployment
has not been analytically studied before by economists, there is now a vast literature on o¤shoring and
outsourcing.5 All the models in that literature, following the tradition in standard trade theory, assume full
   4 The   o¤shoring variable they use, which they call o¤shoring intensity, is de…ned as the share of imported inputs (material
or service) as a proportion of total nonenergy inputs used by the industry.
   5 See   for instance Grossman and Helpman (2002, 2003, 2005), Antras (2003), Antras and Helpman (2004) and Feenstra and
Hanson (2005).




                                                                4
employment. In spite of this assumption in the existing literature, it is important to note that our results
are similar in spirit to those in an important recent contribution by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2006)
where they model o¤shoring as "trading in tasks" and show that even factors of production whose tasks
are o¤shored can bene…t from o¤shoring due to its productivity enhancing e¤ect. Also closely related to
our work is a very recent working paper by Davidson, Matusz and Shevchenko (2006) that uses a model of
job search to study the impact of o¤shoring of high-tech jobs on low and high-skilled workers’ wages, and
on overall welfare. Another paper looking at the impact of o¤shoring on the labor market is Karabay and
McLaren (2006) who study the e¤ects of free trade and o¤shore outsourcing on wage volatility and worker
welfare in a model where risk sharing takes place through employment relationships. Rodriguez-Clare (2006)
analyzes the positive productivity e¤ect and the negative terms of trade e¤ect of o¤shoring on wages and
welfare within a Ricardian framework. Bhagwati, Panagariya and Srinivasan (2004) also analyze in detail
the welfare and wage e¤ects of o¤shoring.
    It is also important to note that there does exist a literature on the relationship between trade and
unemployment. Previous work on unemployment in an open economy includes minimum wage models
(Brecher, 1974a, b and Davis,1998a, b), implicit contract models (Matusz, 1986), e¢ ciency wage models
(Brecher, 1992; Brecher and Choudhri,1994; Copeland, 1989; Hoon, 2001; and Matusz, 1994), and search
models (Davidson and Matusz, 2004 and Şener, 2001, Moore and Ranjan (2005)).          None of these models
deals with o¤shoring.



2     A Model of O¤shoring and Unemployment

2.1    Preferences

All agents share the identical lifetime utility function
                                                Z 1
                                                              rt
                                                     Ct exp        ds;                                     (1)
                                                t=0

where C is consumption, r is the discount rate, and t is a time index. Asset markets are complete. There
is perfect certainty, aside from one-time, unanticipated shocks. The form of the utility function implies that
the risk-free interest rate, in terms of consumption, equals r.
    Each worker has one unit of labor to devote to market activities at every instant of time. The total size
of the workforce is L: The …nal consumption good C could be assumed to be produced using two goods Z




                                                       5
and X as inputs follows, or equivalently can be considered to be a composite (basket) of these two goods as
follows:
                                                                 Z X1
                                                   C=                                                   (2)
                                                                 (1   )1
We choose the composite consumption good C as numeraire. Let Pz and Px be the prices of Z and X;
respectively. Since the price of C = 1; we get

                                      Pz Px1         = 1 () Px = (Pz )                        1
                                                                                                        (3)

Therefore, an increase in Pz implies a decrease in Px :
   Also, (2) implies that the relative demand for Z is given by
                                               d                                          1
                                        Z               Px      (Pz ) 1
                                                   =          =                                         (4)
                                        X            (1   )Pz   (1    )
   So, the relative demand for Z is decreasing in Pz :


2.2    Production and Pro…t Maximization in the Z sector

Z is produced using a continuum of di¤erentiated intermediate goods produced by monopolistically compet-
itive …rms. The production function for Z is given as follows.

                                               2                         3
                                                   Z                          1
                                                                   1
                                       Z=4               z(i)          di5         ;     >1             (5)
                                                   i2I

where z(i) is the intermediate good of variety i and I is the set of all existing varieties. Now, the above
production function for the …nal good results in the following demand function for intermediate good of
variety i:
                                                                 p(i)
                                            z(i) = R                              Pz Z                  (6)
                                                                 p(i)1       di
                                                           i2I

where Pz Z denotes the aggregate expenditure on Z, the price of Z, Pz is given by
                                                       2                      311
                                                           Z
                                            Pz         4        p(i)1        di5                        (7)
                                                          i2I

So the demand for each intermediate good can be re-written as

                                                                  p(i)
                                                   z(i) =                         Z                     (8)
                                                                   Pz




                                                                  6
Note from the above equation that the elasticity of demand facing each intermediate good producer is               ;
which is also the elasticity of substitution between any two varieties: The productivity of an intermediate
good producer is denoted by      , and the distribution of the productivity levels of all intermediate good
producers is given by a distribution G( ); where             2 [ ; ]: We assume here (for the most part) a …xed
mass of …rms. In the penultimate section (section 4), we will relax this assumption where each entering …rm
will have to incur a sunk cost equal to FE in terms of the numeraire good, after which it will observe its
realization of productivity drawn from G( ):

marginal cost of a …rm with productivity      by c( ): Given the constant elasticity of demand for each …rm,
the price charged by a …rm with productivity ;denoted by p( ) is going to equal           1 c(   ): If M is the mass
of …rms in the industry, we can write the price of Z as follows.

In this section we will assume M = 1; that is, there is a unit mass of …rms in the industry. As mentioned
above, in a later section we endogenize M; where we show that the qualitative results are unchanged.
Therefore, for the purposes of this section, the price of Z is simply
                                              "Z                  #11

   If we denote the total amount of labor employed by …rm with productivity             by N ( ); then we have

   To produce intermediate goods, a …rm needs to open job vacancies and hire workers. The cost of vacancy

                                                                                                                                      m(vz ;uz )
of unemployed workers searching for a job in sector Z. The probability of a vacancy …lled is q( z ) =                                    vz

where m(vz ; uz ) is a constant returns to scale matching function. Since m(vz ; uz ) is constant returns to scale,
                                                                                               m(vz ;uz )

in    z:

      Assuming that each …rm employs and hires enough workers to resolve the uncertainty of job in‡ows and
out‡ows, the dynamics of employment for a …rm is
                                                     :
                                                    N ( ) = q( z )V ( )            N( )                                                   (14)

      The wage for each worker is determined by a process of Nash bargaining with the …rm separately which is
discussed later. While deciding on how many vacancies to open up the …rm correctly anticipates this wage.
Therefore, the pro…t maximization condition for an individual …rm can be written as
                                Z 1
                         M ax       e r(s t) fp( )z( ) w( )N ( ) cz V ( )gds                                                              (15)
                                V ( );z( )   t

where z( ) is given in (9) and N ( ) is given in (13) and w( ) is taken as given.
      Therefore, the …rm maximizes (15) subject to (14), (9), and (13). We provide details of the …rm’s
maximization exercise in the appendix. Denoting the Lagrangian multiplier associated with (14) by ; where
     is the shadow value of an extra job; we get in the steady state

The expression on the extreme left-hand side is the marginal bene…t from a job which equals the present
value of the stream of the marginal revenue product net of wage of an extra worker after factoring in the

                      1
Alternatively,   q(   z)
                           is the average number of vacancies required to be posted to create a job per unit of time.
 cz
q( z )   will be the asset value of an extra job for a …rm in the wage determination below. An alternative way
to write (16) is
                                                                   w( )           (r + )cz
                                                 p( ) =                   +                                                               (17)
                                                               1              (     1)q( z )
This is the mark up equation in the presence of search frictions. So, in addition to the standard wage cost,
search cost is added to the marginal cost of producing a unit of output. Note that just as the wage cost is




                                                                      8
inversely related to …rm productivity, search cost is inversely related as well, because a more productive …rm
needs a smaller labor force to produce a given level of output.
    Further, it is straightforward to see from the …rst-order conditions that z( ) = N ( ) which when plugged
                                                                                 :
                                                                                                                           z( )
into the dynamic equation of N ( ) with the steady state condition N ( ) = 0 imposed gives us V ( ) =                    q( z )   .
Thus, the number of vacancies that a …rm posts is positively related to output and negatively related to …rm
productivity. The equation above also implies that the ratio of vacancies to employment is the same for all
…rms. Now, if Lz is the total size of the labor force in the Z sector, then
                                 Z                              Z                              Z

                       vz Lz =       V ( )dG( ) =                   N ( )dG( ) =                          dG( )             (18)
                                                       q( z )                         q( z )

                                                   Z
Note that, by de…nition total employment               N ( )dG( ) equals (1            uz )Lz ;which after minor manipulation

gives us
                                                       uz =                                           (19)
                                                    + z q( z )
The above is the standard Beveridge curve in Pissarides type search models where the rate of unemployment
is negatively related to the degree market tightness                z:



2.3        Wage Determination in the Z sector

Wage is determined for each worker through a process of Nash bargaining with his/her employer. The value
of an occupied job for a …rm, J( ); is the value of                 obtained from …rm’s maximization problem. It equals
 cz
q( z ) .   Denoting the unemployment bene…t in terms of the …nal good by b and letting Uz denote the income
of the unemployed in the Z sector, the asset value equation for the unemployed in this sector is given by

                                                 rUz = b +       z q( z )[Ez   Uz ]                                         (20)

where Ez is the expected income from becoming employed in the Z sector.                               As explained in Pissarides
(2000), the asset that is valued is an unemployed worker’s human capital. The return on this asset is the
unemployment bene…t b plus the expected capital gain from the possible change in state from unemployed
to employed given by      z q( z )[Ez    Uz ]:
    The asset value equation for an employed worker working for a …rm in sector Z with productivity                           is
given by
                                                                                      w( )    Uz
                             rE( ) = w( ) + (Uz                 E( )) ) E( ) =             +                                (21)
                                                                                      r+     r+




                                                                    9
Again the return on being employed equals the wage plus the expected change in the asset value from a
change in state from employed to unemployed. The surplus for an unemployed worker from getting a job
with a …rm is E( )    Uz : The surplus for a …rm from an occupied job is J( ): Since the wage is determined
using Nash bargaining where the bargaining weights are                             and 1           ; we get the following wage bargaining
equation:


                                           E( )         Uz = (J( ) + E( )                         Uz )                                               (22)
                                                                                                                                            cz
The equation above is important in delivering our wage equation. Since as seen above J( ) =                                                q( z )   is the
                                              cz
same for all …rms, E( )      Uz =      1     q( z ) ;   and therefore E( ) = Ez are the same for all                                   : Plugging this
value of Ez   Uz into the asset value equation for the unemployed we have a simpli…ed version of this asset
value equation
                                                        rUz = b +                  cz    z                                                           (23)
                                                                       1
                                       1
                                           p( ) w( )
Since we know that J( ) =         =        (r+ )     ;    this in conjunction with the wage bargaining equation and the
asset value equation of an employed worker gives us the wage of a worker in a …rm as the weighted average
of the return on the asset value of an unemployed person and the marginal revenue product of the worker,
the weights being the bargaining power of the …rm and the worker respectively. More precisely we have
                                                                                                                                 1
                             1                                                                                                       p( ) w( )        cz
w( ) = (1     )rUz + [           p( ) ]; which in conjunction with (23) and the fact that                                            (r+ )       =   q( z )

gives us the following simpli…ed wage equation:
                                                                  cz                   r+
                                               wz = b +                    [   z   +          ]                                                      (24)
                                                             1                         q( z )
Next, we write down the expression for equilibrium pro…t which is useful in deriving the bene…t from
o¤shoring. It is shown in the appendix that the present discounted value of pro…ts of a …rm at time t is

                                                                                          1

where we have introduced the subscript D to capture the fact that input is produced domestically. The
above equation shows that the pro…t of a …rm is increasing in its productivity. To obtain the present
discounted value of pro…t of a …rm in steady-state, substitute Nt ( ) in the expression above by its steady-
state employment. When we allow for free entry of …rms to produce di¤erentiated goods, we will assume
that each …rm enters with N = 0; and therefore, its expected present discounted value of pro…t is obtained
by setting Nt = 0 in (25).




                                                                  10
2.4    Production, Wage Determination and Employment in the X sector

Production of good X is undertaken by perfectly competitive …rms. To produce one unit of X a …rm needs
to hire one unit of labor. In order to hire a worker a …rm has to open a vacancy which is costly. The cost of
                                                                             vx
vacancy in terms of the numeraire good is cx . De…ne                      x   =
                                                                             ux as the measure      of market tightness in the X
                                                                     m(vx ;ux )
sector. The probability of a vacancy …lled is q(            x)   =      vx      where m(vx ; ux )   is a constant returns to scale
function same as in the Z sector. Also, jobs are destroyed with probability : The cost of posting a vacancy
in sector X is denoted by cx : Firms in the X sector are perfectly competitive, as opposed to imperfect
competition among intermediate goods producers in the Z sector.
   Repeating the exercise in the previous section for competitive …rms (see Pissarides (2000) for details),
we obtain the following three key equations.

                                          wx      = (1   )b + [Px + cx               x]                                         (26)
                                                         (r + )cx
                                          Px      = wx +                                                                        (27)
                                                           q( x )

                                          ux      =                                                                             (28)
                                                            +     x q( x )

   The above 3 equations determine wx ;           x;   and ux ; for a given Px .
   Since unemployed workers can search in either sector, the income of the unemployed must be the same
from searching in either sector. Imposing (23) which gives us the income of the unemployed searching in Z
sector and the corresponding equation for the X sector given by rUx = b +                      1      cx   x   on the labor mobility
condition Uz = Ux implies
                                                            cz   z   = cx     x                                                 (29)

That is, the labor market tightness for each sector is inversely proportional to the vacancy cost.


2.5    Solving the Model

Let us de…ne the average productivity of …rms as follows.
                    hR                i   1

 De…nition e                 1

                                              1




   Next, using (17) write the equation for the price of Z given in (7) as

                                                                          (r + )cz       1
                                      Pz =                       wz +                e                                          (30)
                                                        1                   q( z )




                                                                     11
Now, start with a Px : Determine wx and                   x   from (26) and (27). Next,       z   is determined from (29). Then wz
is determined from (24). Since we know                z       and wz ; we can determine Pz from (30). Therefore, for each Px
there is an associated Pz ; determined as described above. It is easy to verify that an increase in Px implies
an increase Pz via the relationship described above. Let us call this P P P .
     Next, note from (3) that Px = (Pz )             1
                                                          . That is, an increase in Pz requires a decrease in Px to keep the
price of numeraire at 1. Let us call this P P N .
     The two relationships between Px and Pz ; P P P and P P N , uniquely determine the equilibrium values
of Px and Pz : Once we know Px and Pz we obtain wx ;                        x;   and ux from (26)-(28), then we obtain         z ; wz ;   and
uz from (29), (24), and (19), respectively.
     Notice the Ricardian element in the model. All the prices are determined by the technological variables
independent of demand conditions. Diagrammatically, the relative supply of Z is a horizontal curve at the
Pz
Px    determined by the intersection of PPP and PPN curves described above. The relative demand for Z is
                                                      1

                                       Z
downward sloping as given by           X   =     (1   )       and is represented by the RD curve in Figure 1. The horizontal
RS curve (at the price determined by PPP and PPN curves) is the relative supply curve. The intersection
                                                               Z
of the two curves determines the equilibrium                   X   .


2.6         Equilibria with the possibility of o¤shoring

Now, suppose …rms in the Z sector have the option of procuring input mp from abroad instead of producing
them domestically.6 However, they need to incur a …xed cost of rFV in terms of the numeraire good in
each period. Therefore, the present discounted value of the …xed cost of o¤shoring is going to be FV :
The per unit cost of imported input is wS in terms of the numeraire good: Now, a …rm o¤shoring its input
          R1
maximizes t e r(s t) fp( )z( ) w( )N ( ) ws mp ( ) cz V ( )gds: The production function now becomes
                    1
z( ) =         (1       )1   N ( ) mp ( )1     , while the other constraint is the equation of motion of employment that
remains the same.
                                                                                                                     cz
     From the …rst-order conditions of this altered maximization problem, we still have                         =   q( z ) :   With each

     6 We   are assuming that under autarky a …rm uses one unit of labor to produce every unit of this input. Therefore, under
o¤shoring in place of using mp units of home labor in production activities the …rm just imports mp units of the imported
input from abroad.

The pricing equation in this case is given by

in an equilibrium where …rms have the option to o¤shore. There are three possible post-o¤shoring equilibria
in the model: 1) No …rm o¤shores (                                      ); 2) Some …rms o¤shore (                   2 ( ; )); 3) All …rms o¤shore
(              ). Below we provide an intuitive discussion of these equilibria. We …rst trace out a curve in the

         Z
           )   space, called the o¤shoring curve, such that the fraction of …rms o¤shoring varies from zero to 1

along this curve. The o¤shoring curve is the locus of mutually consistent pairs of                                        Px   and Z=X along which

the cuto¤ productivity varies. The intersection of this curve with the relative demand curve                                            X     =   (1    )Pz

will give us the equilibrium in the post-o¤shoring case.


2.6.1          Derivation of the O¤shoring Curve

Denote the price of Z when the marginal …rm o¤shoring is                                           by Pz : The expression for Pz is given by
    8 Very     loosely speaking, the o¤shoring curve is the general equilibrium relative supply curve of Z after factoring in the
endogenous o¤shoring decision of …rms. For any price, it gives us the relative supply exactly consistent with the number of
…rms o¤shoring leading to that price. Note, however, that this relative supply is not a behavioral relationship.

   Intuitively, for a given Z an increase in the number of …rms o¤shoring has two e¤ects on the net pro…t

an increase in the cost of hiring domestic labor increases or reduces the attractiveness of o¤shoring depends
on what happens to CV           CD : If CV        CD decreases with o¤shoring; then Z must increase for more …rms to
              0
o¤shore: Z (         ) < 0. Note that CV         CD is the di¤erence in the pro…ts caused by di¤ering marginal costs in
cases of o¤shoring and no o¤shoring. Since o¤shoring …rms also use domestic labor to provide headquarter
services, more o¤shoring increases the marginal costs of both domestic …rms and o¤shoring …rms. Therefore,
due to this e¤ect the pro…ts of both decrease. Since pro…t is convex in marginal cost (c1                ), if both marginal
costs (of o¤shoring and not o¤shoring) increase proportionately, there would be a greater decline in the pro…t
from o¤shoring. Moreover, the decline in pro…t from o¤shoring is higher the greater the : However, since
o¤shoring …rms use less domestic labor, there is a smaller increase in the marginal cost of o¤shoring (the
lower the         the smaller the increase in marginal cost of o¤shoring). Therefore, the impact of an increase in
domestic labor cost on the net pro…tability from o¤shoring is ambiguous. If the net pro…t from o¤shoring
either decreases or not increases enough to o¤set the e¤ect of decrease in Pz ; then Z must increase for more
…rms to o¤shore. Condition (40) above is su¢ cient to ensure that Z 0 (             ) < 0 which in turn generally implies,
                                      Z(     )
as shown in the appendix, that        X(     )   is decreasing in    in the range      2 ( ; ).
   In the case when Z 0 (        ) > 0; that is when an increase in the hiring cost of domestic labor raises the

net pro…t from o¤shoring enough to o¤set the e¤ect of decrease in Pz ; then              X(   )   is increasing in   in the
range       2 ( ; ):


2.6.2     Types of Equilibria

Under the su¢ cient condition (40), the O¤shoring Curve(OC) looks like the one depicted in Figure 2a. The
equilibrium can be obtained by the intersection of the two curves denoted by RD and OC, since Z and X
are not being traded in the world market. Given the O¤shoring Curve in Figure 2a, we have the following
equilibria:

        a) Unique equilibrium with no o¤shoring when the RD curve is one labeled I in Figure 2a.
        Allowing o¤shoring does not change the equilibrium.

        b) Unique equilibrium with complete o¤shoring as depicted in Figure 2a when the RD curve is




                                                               16
       one labeled IV. The intersection of the relative demand curve with the dotted line shows us the
       initial equilibrium when o¤shoring was not allowed. Allowing o¤shoring moves the economy from
       no o¤shoring to complete o¤shoring.

       c) Multiple equilibria as in Figure 2a when the RD curve is the dotted one labeled II. The initial
       no o¤shoring equilibrium remains an equilibrium even after o¤shoring. In other words, there is a
       coordination problem among …rms after o¤shoring is allowed. A temporary tax break could shift
       the economy permanently to the o¤shoring equilibrium

       d) Unique, mixed o¤shoring equilibrium as in Figure 2a when the RD curve is the one labeled
       III. Mixed equilibrium is one where a fraction of …rms o¤shores while others do not. Allowing for
       o¤shoring in this case moves the economy from no o¤shoring to o¤shoring by the most productive
       …rms.9

    Since we get multiple equilibria in some cases, a few words on the stability of equilibria are in order.
Note that the O¤shoring Curve depicted in Figure 2a is not the standard relative supply curve except in the
extreme cases of no o¤shoring and complete o¤shoring. Therefore, we cannot use the standard Marshallian
or Walrasian notions of stability. For each                   ; the conventional relative supply for Z is a horizontal line.
Therefore, we use the following reasonable notion of stability relevant for di¤erentiated goods producing …rms.
In order for an equilibrium to be stable, any unilateral deviation by a small mass of …rms, in terms of their
alternative strategies of o¤shoring or producing their inputs domestically, should result in incentives that
alter …rms’actions (o¤shoring versus producing domestically) to push the economy back towards that same
(starting) equilibrium outcome. With this de…nition in mind, look at the interior equilibrium obtained by the
intersection of the dotted RD curve with the OC curve in Figure 2a. Starting from this interior equilibrium,
if a domestic …rm o¤shores (deviates) Pz falls which results in an increase in the relative demand for Z
greater than the required increase in Z=X for an extra …rm to o¤shore. Therefore, more domestic …rms have
an incentive to o¤shore, taking us further away from this interior equilibrium. Hence this equilibrium is not
stable. Using this concept of stability and instability, it can be seen that all the other equilibria in Figure 2a
are stable. In particular the unique, mixed equilibrium obtained by the intersection of the RD curve labeled

P areto[:2; 3:4];   = :5; b = :25; r = :03; = :035;   = :5;    = :5; L = 1; we get a unique, mixed equilibrium with FV = 1; ws = :25;
a complete o¤shoring equilibrium with FV = :5; ws = :25; and a no o¤shoring equilibrium with FV = 1; ws = :55: The rationale
for choosing these parameter values is provided in the appendix.




                                                                    17
III and the OC curve in Figure 2a is stable.
          Z(   )
   When   X(   )   is increasing in   ; the O¤shoring Curve looks like the one shown in Figure 2b. We cannot
get a unique, mixed equilibrium in this case. We get either a no o¤shoring equilibrium even after allowing
for o¤shoring, if the RD curve is like the one labeled I in Figure 2b, or a complete o¤shoring equilibrium
when the RD curve is like the one labeled III in Figure 2b. If the RD curve is like the one labeled II in
Figure 2b, then we get multiple equilibria, however, the argument in the previous paragraph implies that
the interior equilibrium is unstable.
   Since the types of equilibria in Figure 2b are a subset of the equilibria depicted in Figure 2a, in the
comparative static analysis below, we focus on the cases depicted in Figure 2a.


2.7     Impact of o¤shoring on allocation of labor and unemployment

In this section we do two things. First, we study the impacts of decreases in the …xed cost of o¤shoring,
FV ; and transportation/communication cost (or foreign wage), ws : Second, we compare the outcome when
o¤shoring was not possible to the two cases of mixed equilibrium and complete o¤shoring equilibrium when
o¤shoring becomes possible.


2.7.1   Change in the …xed cost of o¤shoring or in the transportation/communication cost

Suppose there is a decrease in FV : It is easy to verify from the discussion of the O¤shoring Curve that it
will shift to the left rendering equilibria with positive amount of o¤shoring more likely. In Figure 3a the
solid curve is the O¤shoring Curve for initial level of FV , while the dashed curve is the O¤shoring Curve
after FV has decreased. An implication of the leftward shift of the O¤shoring Curve is that even in the case
when the no o¤shoring equilibrium is the unique equilibrium, as in the case with RD curve I in Figure 2a,
a decrease in FV will make equilibria with positive o¤shoring more likely. If we start from from a unique,
mixed equilibrium where only a few …rms o¤shore, this reduction in FV will lead to o¤shoring by more …rms
as the equilibrium moves from point A to B in Figure 3a. In both cases the relative price of Z will fall and
that of X will rise. Px rises means wx ,   x,   wz ; and   z   also rise. Since   x   and   z   go up, both ux and uz fall,
i.e., the rates of unemployment in both sectors decrease.
   A change in transportation, communication cost, or a decrease in Southern wage can be captured by a
decrease in ws in our model. It can be seen from the earlier discussion that Z decreases with ws : As well,
a decrease in ws would imply a lower PzCO and a higher PxCO : Therefore, the relative price pCO at which

complete o¤shoring obtains shifts down. A higher PxCO implies higher wzCO and higher                   z    as well. The
impact on Z is as follows. A decrease in ws has a direct negative e¤ect on Z; however, the indirect e¤ects
                                CO
through changes in wzCO and     z    are ambiguous. The e¤ects can be seen as follows.

                                                            FV 1
                                             Z=
                                                  (PzCO )    CVCO    CO
                                                                    CD

It turns out from the above expression that Z decreases as ws decreases. It can also be veri…ed that for
                                             Z
each p(    ) 2 (pCO ; pN O ), the required   X   is smaller the smaller the ws : Therefore, the O¤shoring Curve
shifts to the left as shown in Figure 3b. Again, the possibility of equilibria with o¤shoring increases, as one
would expect. Also, if we start from from a unique, mixed o¤shoring equilibrium where only a few …rms
o¤shore, this reduction in ws will lead to o¤shoring by more …rms as the equilibrium moves from point A to
B in Figure 3b. In both these cases the relative price of Z will fall and that of X will rise, and through the
mechanism outlined above we will get a reduction in sectoral unemployment in each of the two sectors.
   Thus we can summarize the comparative static results above in the following proposition:

Proposition 1 A decrease in the …xed cost FV of o¤ shoring or in the transportation or communication cost
captured by ws makes an o¤ shoring equilibrium more likely when o¤ shoring is allowed. Also, if we start
from a unique, interior (mixed) equilibrium where only a few …rms o¤ shore, this reduction in o¤ shoring or
transportation or communication costs will lead to o¤ shoring by more …rms. In both cases the relative price
of Z will fall and that of X will rise, and we will get a reduction in sectoral unemployment in each of the
two sectors.


2.8     Comparing no-o¤shoring and o¤shoring equilibria

2.8.1     Sectoral and economywide demand for labor

In an o¤shoring equilibrium Px is higher, which means wx ,          x,   wz ; and   z   are also higher. Since   x   and   z

are higher, both ux and uz are lower than in the no-o¤shoring equilibrium, i.e., the rates of unemployment in
both sectors decrease. An increase in the price of good X is able to support higher labor costs in that sector.
Since the wage bargaining equation implies that wage and market tightness increase together, we have an
increase in both these variables in the X sector. Unemployment goes down as a result. Market tightness in
the X and Z sectors go together, and so we get a reduction in Z sector unemployment rate as well. While
the reduction in Pz by itself, everything else held constant, should increase unemployment in sector Z, this




                                                            19
is more than o¤set by the decrease in the cost of production brought about by o¤shoring. Note that, for
…rms that o¤shore, there is now a higher marginal product of headquarter labor, arising from employment
of more production input per headquarter worker (since the input is now cheaper) in the o¤shoring …rms.
This e¤ect o¤sets the e¤ect of a decline in the price of Z: An alternative way to look at this is the following.
O¤shoring of production activity in one sector makes the other sector relatively more intensive in the use of
domestic labor. At the same time, o¤shoring raises the relative price of the good whose production is not
o¤shored, i.e., of the good that is domestic labor intensive. Therefore, cost of domestic labor (wage rate and
market tightness) goes up. This e¤ect is analogous to the Stolper-Samuelson e¤ect.
   The impact on aggregate unemployment depends on what happens to Lz ; the share of labor a¢ liated
with sector Z; and whether cx is more or less than cz :
   Case I: In the special case of cx = cz , we have          x   =       z   and hence ux = uz : Therefore, aggregate
unemployment falls along with the fall in sectoral unemployment due to o¤shoring.
   When cx = cz ; it is easy to show that the size of the labor force in the Z sector post-o¤shoring is less
than in the pre-o¤shoring equilibrium (See proof in appendix). Even though the result above obtains for
cx = cz ; using a continuity argument we can say that it will hold if cx and cz are not too di¤erent. Numerical
simulations con…rm that the result on Lz decreasing upon o¤shoring is valid even when cx 6= cz : In this case
we get the following additional results.
   Case II: cx < cz : In this case, it is easy to verify that    x   >       z,   and hence ux < uz : That is, Z sector has
higher wage as well as unemployment. Now, since o¤shoring shifts labor from sector Z to sector X; there is
going to be an unambiguous decrease in aggregate unemployment. Although the wages of workers in both
sectors increase, the number of workers earning higher wage declines.
   Case III: cx > cz : In this case, even though the rate of unemployment decreases in both sectors, since
labor moves into the sector with higher unemployment, the impact on aggregate unemployment is ambiguous.
   The comparison of the o¤shoring and no-o¤shoring equilibria can be summarized as follows:

Proposition 2 In an o¤ shoring equilibrium, sectoral wages are higher and sectoral unemployment lower
than in the pre- or no-o¤ shoring equilibrium. When cx           cz ; there is an unambiguous decrease in aggregate
unemployment as a result of moving from a no- (or pre-) o¤ shoring equilibrium to an o¤ shoring equilibrium.
When cx > cz ; the impact on aggregate unemployment is ambiguous.

2.8.2     Firm-level demand for labor

In the model, the reallocation of labor, as a result of o¤shoring, can be summarized as follows. Firstly, there
is intersectoral reallocation of labor from sector Z to sector X. Secondly, within sector Z some or all …rms
move some of their production activities overseas. Thirdly, within that sector demand for labor shifts to
headquarter services in …rms that end up o¤shoring their production. Finally, since foreign labor is cheaper,
o¤shoring …rms will increase the use of production services and depending on the elasticity of substitution,
decrease or increase the use of headquarter services.
     To see the impact of o¤shoring on employment for an individual …rm we need to do the following. Let
us look at the marginal …rm,                           that is indi¤erent between o¤shoring and no o¤shoring. If this …rm doesn’t
o¤shore then its employment is given by

                                         z(    )            p( )        Z                                          (r + )cz
                N NO(              )=              =                        =                          1
                                                                                                           wz +                ZPz
                                                             Pz                          1                           q( z )

Similarly, the domestic employment of this …rm, if it decides to o¤shore is given by
                                                                        1

Comparing the above two expressions, note that N O (                                 ) > N NO(         ); under the su¢ cient condition !        >

                     discussed earlier.
     Intuitively, a high                 implies greater headquarter intensity, and therefore, employment of o¤shoring …rms
can increase because their headquarter activities increase (due to their complementarity with labor used in
production). A high ! means a higher relative labor cost in the North relative to the South, which means
that o¤shoring …rms steal more business from non-o¤shoring …rms. Therefore, their domestic employment
can increase. Finally, a high                      implies greater elasticity of substitution, and therefore, o¤shoring …rms again
can steal more business from non-o¤shoring …rms. Thus, if the business stealing e¤ect is su¢ ciently strong,
the domestic employment of o¤shoring …rms can be higher than that of non-o¤shoring …rms.
     To compare domestic employment of a …rm before and after o¤shoring we need to compare

                                                     (r + )cz                                          (r + )cz

There are several e¤ects. ! (1                         )(    1)
                                                                  captures the business stealing e¤ect as discussed earlier. However,
domestically produced inputs have become costlier due to the higher domestic wage compared to the no
o¤shoring case. This increase in the price of domestic inputs would tend to reduce domestic employment. In




                                                                                21
addition, what happens to ZPz becomes important. An increase in this implies an increase in employment
for all …rms in the industry. Therefore, the net e¤ect depends on the relative strengths of these e¤ects.
     The above discussion on …rm-level employment can be summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition 3 For high enough headquarter intensity , a high enough !, the relative North-South labor cost
and for a high enough elasticity of substitution   , an o¤ shoring …rm, controlling for …rm-level characteristics,
will have higher domestic employment relative to that of a …rm which remains fully domestic. Similar
variables determine, albeit in a much more complicated manner, whether a …rm after o¤ shoring increases its
domestic employment or not.


2.9     Other Comparative Static Exercises

While the focus of this paper is to understand the implications of o¤shoring for unemployment, we can also use
the model to understand how labor market institutions a¤ect o¤shoring and consequently unemployment. To
this end, we study the impact of an increase in the unemployment bene…t, b; on o¤shoring and unemployment.
We will also look at the impact of a change in the country size, L.
     When b goes up, holding cz = cx ; the average cost of employing domestic labor in each sector, given
             (r+ )ci
by    wi +    q( i )   ; i = x; z; remains unchanged for a given Px : Therefore, holding the number of …rms
o¤shoring …xed, from the production side Pz does not change due to this increase in b at a given Px . It
also means that the threshold Z consistent with just making exactly as many …rms o¤shore remains the
same. However, an increase in b at given Px (and therefore, at given Pz ) reduces labor market tightness
and increases unemployment in both sectors. Therefore, even though the threshold Z remains unchanged
we now have a higher threshold Z=X. The o¤shoring curve shifts right from OC to OC’as a result of the
increase in b (Figure 3c). Starting from an initial mixed equilibrium A, we move to B which corresponds to a
mixed equilibrium with o¤shoring by fewer …rms and a higher relative price of Z. On top of the direct e¤ect
of an increase in b on unemployment, there is a further indirect adverse e¤ect on unemployment through
the reduction in Px : Intuitively, at unchanged Px ; an increase in b increases wage but reduces the market
tightness. While the former raises the domestic labor cost, the latter reduces it and o¤sets the e¤ect of
the former. A reduction in Px reduces domestic labor cost, making o¤shoring less attractive. Therefore, an
increase in b a¤ects o¤shoring adversely through intersectoral price changes. E¤ectively, an increase in the
unemployment bene…t works like a reduction in country size. This in turn leads to fewer …rms being able to
jump the …xed costs of o¤shoring.




                                                        22
    A comparative static exercise of directly reducing country size, L will give us similar e¤ects in terms
of shifting the o¤shoring curve, the fall in Px and the consequent rise in unemployment (only the indirect
e¤ect).



3     The Case of No Intersectoral Labor Mobility
Since studying the transitional dynamics of the model is very complicated, to study the shorter run implica-
tions of o¤shoring on unemployment, we discuss a case where there is no intersectoral labor mobility. The
only connection between the two sectors is through goods prices.
    We know that since the composite good C is the numeraire good and its price equals unity, Px and Pz
                                                  Pz
move in opposite directions. Also, when           Px   rises, it means Px falls and Pz rises. With no intersectoral labor
mobility, i.e., with Lx and Lz held …xed, we need to solve the wage and price equations simultaneously within
a sector but separately for the two sectors. Clearly the solution to the equations wx = (1                                            )b+ [Px +cx           x ];

Px = wx + (r+ )cx
           q( x ) will be such that as Px goes down (as
                                                                              Pz
                                                                              Px   rises) both wx and                 x    fall. A fall in    x;   plugged
                                                                                                                                                            Pz
into the Beveridge curve, implies that sectoral unemployment rate ux rises. However, as Pz goes up (as                                                      Px
                                                                                       cz                r+                                (r+ )cz           1
rises), the solution to the simultaneous equations wz = b +                        1        [   z   +   q( z ) ];   Pz =      1   wz +      q( z )      e     ;
that hold under autarky, is such that both wz and                z   rise. Plugging this rise in                      z    into the Beveridge curve,
                                                                                                                                                   Pz
we get a decline in the sectoral unemployment uz : Thus, under autarky, for given Lx and Lz , as                                                   Px   rises,
Z
X   rises. Let us call this relationship, the short-run relative supply curve, and the horizontal relative supply
curve we derived earlier, shown in Figure 1, the long-run relative supply curve. At Lx = LN
                                                                                          x
                                                                                            O
                                                                                              and Lz = LN
                                                                                                        z
                                                                                                          O


(where LN
        i
          O
            represents equilibrium labor force in sector i = x; z; in autarky when labor is mobile across
sectors) it is easy to see that both the long-run and the short-run curves cut the relative demand curve at
exactly the same point A (See Figure 4 where SRS stands for short-run relative supply).
    Let us now look at a situation of complete o¤shoring equilibrium under no intersectoral labor mobility and

in the case of autarky, the short-run supply curve under complete o¤shoring is again upward sloping. As seen
in Figure 4, the long-run complete o¤shoring equilibrium is also a short-run complete o¤shoring equilibrium

     Holding the economy’s labor force constant, increasing Lz shifts the short-run relative supply curve to the
right. For small enough …xed costs of o¤shoring, allowing the possibility of o¤shoring will give us complete
o¤shoring under both intersectoral labor mobility and no labor mobility. At Lx = LN

Pz
Px   under complete o¤shoring is lower when there is no labor mobility than under labor mobility. Therefore,
under complete o¤shoring Z sector wages are lower and unemployment there higher under no labor mobility
than under labor mobility. Under both labor mobility and no labor mobility, there are two e¤ects of o¤shoring
on sector Z. One is the cost-reducing or the productivity-enhancing e¤ect, while the other is the decline in
                            Pz
relative price (a fall in   Px ):   The second e¤ect is stronger under no labor mobility than under mobile labor
and if this e¤ect is strong enough, the sectoral unemployment rate may go up in the Z sector. Whether
this will be the case or not will depend on parameter           which represents the importance of Z in the …nal
numeraire good C and headquarter intensity : Intuitively, a higher          implies a higher demand for Z sector
output and consequently a higher derived demand for labor in the Z sector, while a higher         implies higher
demand for domestic labor in sector Z. Therefore, with a high             or ; a larger amount of labor can be
absorbed in the Z sector without a rise in unemployment:
     Also the favorable terms-of-trade e¤ect of o¤shoring for the X sector is stronger under no labor mobility
than under mobile labor. Therefore, the reduction in the unemployment rate in the X sector (due to
o¤shoring) is greater in the short-run than in the long run. This means unemployment falls by a considerable
amount in the short run and then rises in the long run, with the new long run unemployment rate being
lower than the initial long-run unemployment rate.
     In the case of incomplete o¤shoring, when only the most productive …rms are able to jump the …xed costs
of o¤shoring, there are several more e¤ects we need to take care of. Firstly, the labor force in the Z sector
is larger in size under no labor mobility which shifts, as in the complete o¤shoring case, the relative supply
curve to the right. Second, the equilibrium number of …rms o¤shoring also a¤ects this curve. There are two
factors acting in opposite directions on the equilibrium number of …rms o¤shoring. Under no labor mobility
(relative to the mobile labor case), wages and labor-market tightness are lower in the Z sector in the North,
which reduces the attractiveness of o¤shoring. However, since the labor force is not allowed to shrink in
this sector, the scale e¤ect (captured by Pz Z) and hence the attractiveness of o¤shoring are stronger when
labor mobility is not allowed than when it is allowed. The impact of o¤shoring on sectoral unemployment

rates is qualitatively similar to that in the complete o¤shoring case. Below we provide numerical examples
to con…rm that unemployment can go down in the Z sector starting from an initial situation of a mixed
o¤shoring equilibrium.

these parameter values in the appendix.
   Row I presents the results of the initial mixed o¤shoring equilibrium. Rows II and III present results of
a 25% reduction in the …xed cost of o¤shoring FV with and without labor mobility, respectively. Comparing
rows I and II, we see that reduction in FV leads to increased o¤shoring and decreases in unemployment
rates in both sectors when there is labor mobility. When the amount of labor in the Z sector is restricted
to that in row I, then o¤shoring reduces unemployment in X sector but increases it slightly in the Z sector.
In rows IV and V FV goes back to 1, but ws is lowered by 20% compared to row I. Again there is increased
o¤shoring both with and without labor mobility, however, in this case even in the absence of labor mobility,
the unemployment rates in both sectors go down as shown in row V, even though the decline is larger in
sector X:

Proposition 4 In the shorter run case where intersectoral labor mobility is not allowed, in an o¤ shoring
equilibrium, the reduction in the relative price of Z is greater than what we get with o¤ shoring under in-
tersectoral labor mobility. Thus, the increase in wage and the reduction in sectoral unemployment in sector
Z under o¤ shoring are smaller under no labor mobility than under intersectoral labor mobility , with the
possibility being there that sectoral unemployment goes up as a result. In the X sector, the increase in wage
and the reduction in sectoral unemployment as a result of o¤ shoring are greater.

4      An Extension: Free Entry
The extension we present here is allowing for free entry of …rms in the di¤erentiated inputs sector, so that
the mass of …rms operating in equilibrium is endogenously determined.11 We are back here to the case of
intersectoral labor mobility. As discussed in section 2, before entering, …rms incur a sunk cost equal to FE
in terms of the numeraire good. Then they observe their realization of productivity which they draw from
a distribution G( ); where             2 [ ; ]: The price of Z, Pz , can now be written as
                                                                      2                       311

where M is the mass of active …rms. Assuming                               to be the cuto¤ productivity above which …rms o¤shore,
the key equations determining the equilibrium in the case of endogenous entry are given as follows. The
pricing decision of di¤erentiated goods …rms is same as before. The equation determining cuto¤ productivity
    is again given by (37) which can be written as

                                                                       1

The only additional equation is the free entry condition in the di¤erentiated goods sector which can be
written as                     2                                                          3

The product market clearing condition is still given by
                                                                                              1

Equations (41)-(45) along with (60)-(66) in the appendix determine the following 12 endogenous variables
of interest:Px ; Pz ; wx ; wz ;    x; z ; ux ; uz ; Lz ; Z;       ; and M:

                                                                            26
     Next, we show that the results obtained on the impact of o¤shoring on unemployment continue to hold
when the number of varieties is endogenously determined. Establishing this result analytically in the general
case is di¢ cult, therefore, we look at the case where cx = cz : In equilibrium, a potential entrant must be
indi¤erent between entering and not entering an industry. Let                      be the expected annualized per period
pro…t of a potential new entrant in the di¤erentiated intermediate good sector when the economy is in the
steady state. This pro…t is net of both search and production costs, but gross of …xed costs and is given by
r times the expression on the left hand side of (43) Since we have cx = cz = ce ; we have wx = wz = we ,
 x   =   z   =   e;   and ux = uz = ue ; where the subscript e denotes “economywide”. Let R be the annualized
per period expected revenue of a potential new entrant. Given the markup equation we derived earlier, we
                                         Z X1
have         = R= . Since C =             (1 )1    , a constant share     of total expenditure on C is indirectly on the Z
good and consequently on all the intermediate varieties, z(i) combined.
     Total expenditure on the numeraire good C is the sum of the wage bill, total pro…ts net of …xed costs,
search costs. total …xed costs and export sales that pay for (therefore equal) the import of the o¤shored
production input. As explained earlier, incumbent …rms already in the steady state will earn rents relative to
a potential new entrant. Such rents will be earned by incumbent …rms in both sectors because each occupied
                           ce
job has a value of        q( e ) .   Let us denote total per-period rents of this type by :12 We denote the total per
period expenditure on the o¤shored production input by M. Also, in our framework, when a …rm incurs a
sunk cost of entry, FE ; right in the beginning, it is equivalent to paying rFE every period. Recall that rFV
is the per period …xed cost of o¤shoring. With a total of M …rms producing the di¤erentiated intermediate
good z we have total revenue in the intermediate goods sector sector equal to total expenditure, Ez ; on Z

 M R = Ez = f(1              ue ) we L + M [      (1 G(      ))rFV      rFE ] + + S + M [(1 G(      ))rFV + rFE ] + Mg (46)

where S is the total search costs incurred by all …rms in the economy and is given in steady state by                      q( e )   .
In equilibrium with M endogenously determined, the free entry condition in (43) can be re-written as

                                                      = (1    G(     ))rFV + rFE                                               (47)

using which and using the relation                = R= ; we have the equilibrium condition given by

      The above can be re-written as

                               [(1   G(     ))rFV + rFE ] =                  f(1    ue ) we L +     + S + Mg                                     (49)

which can be further re-written as

                                                                               (r + )ce                                     M
                       [(1     G(    ))rFV + rFE ] =                   (we +            ) (1      ue ) L +                                       (50)
                                                        (         )M             q( e )                          (           )M

Now, for a given                , we and      e   are increasing in M; while ue is decreasing in M: Therefore, (we +
(r+ )ce
 q( e ) ) (1        ue ) L on the r.h.s of the above equation is clearly increasing in M: In the case of autarky,
which equals the case where                  =     and M = 0; it is shown in the appendix that the proportional change
in   (we + (r+  )ce
             q( e ) ) is less than the         proportional change in M; and since the impact on ue is of second order,
                   (r+ )ce
(      )M (we + q( e ) ) (1     ue ) L,       which we from now on call '(M ); would be decreasing in M in autarky.
                                                                                                                                    (r+ )ce
[It is shown in the appendix that under the su¢ cient condition (                         1) >     (1       (1       )) ,   (we +    q( e ) )   under
o¤shoring increases less than proportionally with M for any                         :] Therefore the r.h.s. of the last equation
which equals '(M ) under autarky, is represented by a downward sloping EE curve in Figure 5.
      When FV is small, for a given M; allowing for o¤shoring leads to complete o¤shoring, i.e.,                                            =      at
which point G(               ) = 0: We now look at the various components of '(M ) under complete o¤shoring and
under autarky. For a given M , we and                   e   are decreasing in        ; while ue is increasing in                      : Therefore,
           (r+ )ce
(we +       q( e ) ) (1       ue ) L is higher under o¤shoring than under autarky. On top of that now M>0, which
means exports are positive and add to the total demand for C and therefore to the expenditure on Z: Thus,
                                                                                                            M
in Figure 5, the EE curve under complete o¤shoring, representing '(M ) +                                (    )M ;           lies completely above
the EE curve under no o¤shoring. The per-…rm total costs of entry and o¤shoring combined are greater
under complete o¤shoring than under no o¤shoring. If FV is relatively small, we clearly have equilibrium
M , given by the intersection of EE and the per …rm …xed cost curve, higher under complete o¤shoring
                                     13
than under no o¤shoring.                  A higher M under o¤shoring implies that Pz is lower with endogenous M than
with M exogenously …xed at the autarky value; and hence unemployment is lower in a complete o¤shoring
equilibrium with endogenous M than with exogenous M:
      Thus, with free entry, we have an increase in the total mass of …rms operating in the di¤erentiated
intermediate goods sector as a result of o¤shoring. This, clearly, is an additional channel through which
    1 3 This   is true irrespective of the shape of the EE curve under complete o¤shoring, since it is completely above the downward
sloping EE curve under autarky. This means that the EE curve under o¤shoring cannot intersect the …xed cost curve to the
left of the equilibrium M under autarky (assuming …xed costs of o¤shoring are relatively small).




                                                                       28
o¤shoring increases the wage rate and reduces unemployment, since this e¤ect increases productivity in
the Z sector and thereby increases the relative price of X. While the analysis in this section sharpens our
understanding of the free entry case and guides us on how to think about it, it requires making the restriction
of relatively small …xed costs of o¤shoring (that leads to complete o¤shoring). Free entry in the incomplete
o¤shoring case (the case with larger …xed costs) is analytically intractable, especially since both M and
are endogenously determined and they together determine the unemployment rate. Therefore, we construct
some numerical examples of incomplete o¤shoring (mixed equilibrium) to check the robustness of our insights
from our above analysis of the complete o¤shoring case.
    Numerical Examples : The movement to greater o¤shoring here is a result of a reduction in FV :
O¤shoring leads to greater decrease in unemployment in the case of endogenous entry. The table below
provides numerical examples to show the impact of decreases in FV and ws in the cases of no entry and free
entry.

    The other parameters are same as in the numerical examples presented in Table 1.
    The …rst row gives the results of the initial mixed equilibrium with the entry cost chosen to make M = 1:
The required entry cost turns out to be FE = 3:31: The second row shows results of lowering FV with no entry
while the third row shows results with free entry. Rows IV and V show the results of lowering ws from .25 in
row I to .2 while keeping FV at the same level as in row I. The results above make it clear that allowing for
entry makes the unemployment reducing e¤ect of o¤shoring stronger, but the e¤ect is quantitatively small.



5     Discussions and Conclusions
In this paper, in order to study the impact of o¤shoring on sectoral and economywide rates of unemployment,
we construct a two sector general equilibrium model in which unemployment is caused by search frictions.




                                                      29
We …nd that, contrary to general perception, wage increases and sectoral unemployment decreases due to
o¤shoring. This result can be understood to arise from the productivity enhancing (cost reducing) e¤ect of
o¤shoring. This result is consistent with the recent empirical results of Amiti and Wei (2005a, b) for the
US and UK, where, when sectors are de…ned broadly enough, they …nd no evidence of a negative e¤ect of
o¤shoring on sectoral employment.
   Even though both sectors have lower unemployment post-o¤shoring, whether the sector with the lower
unemployment or higher unemployment expands will also be a determinant of the overall unemployment
rate. If the search cost is identical in the two sectors, implying identical rates of unemployment, then the
economywide rate of unemployment declines unambiguously after o¤shoring. Alternatively, even if the search
cost is higher in the sector which experiences o¤shoring (implying a higher wage as well as higher rate of
unemployment in that sector), the economywide rate of unemployment decreases because workers move from
the higher unemployment sector to the lower unemployment sector. Interestingly, when the possibility of
o¤shoring is allowed for we …nd the existence of multiple equilibria, resulting in the indeterminacy of sectoral
and overall unemployment rates.
   Next, the domestic employment of …rms that o¤shore may be higher than those of …rms that decide not
to o¤shore. This arises from the complementarity between headquarter services and production that can
be o¤shored, as well as from the business stealing e¤ect. These e¤ects can also increase a …rm’s domestic
employment after o¤shoring relative to its pre-o¤shoring level.
   When we modify the model to disallow intersectoral labor mobility, the negative relative price e¤ect on
the sector in which …rms o¤shore some of their production activity becomes stronger. In such a case, it is
possible for this e¤ect to o¤set the positive productivity e¤ect, and result in a rise in unemployment in that
sector. In the other sector, o¤shoring has a much stronger unemployment reducing e¤ect in the absence of
intersectoral labor mobility than in the presence of it.
   Finally, allowing for an endogenous number varieties in the o¤shoring sector provides an additional
indirect channel through which sectoral unemployment goes down.
   Before ending the paper some remarks on some of our modeling assumptions are in order. Instead of
writing a two sector model, we could have written a one sector model to examine the impact of o¤shoring
on unemployment. We have veri…ed that the unemployment reducing e¤ect of o¤shoring is present even in
a one sector model with endogenous entry a la Melitz (2003), but we preferred a two sector model because
it provides additional insights about the intersectoral reallocation. We have modeled vacancy cost, c; in
terms of the numeraire good which seemed natural given the two sector structure of the model. One could




                                                      30
alternatively model the vacancy cost either in terms of labor or foregone output. In the former case, the
vacancy cost would be ci wi for sector i = X; Z; where wi is the sectoral wage. In the latter case, it would
be ci pi : Our preliminary investigation suggests that the qualitative results would be unchanged.
   The model in the paper can be extended along several dimensions. In our current paper we do not
explicitly model outsourcing, as is currently understood to be subject to contracting problems.14 If …rms
have the choice to outsource their production activities to a foreign supplier in an incomplete contract
framework, whether a …rm outsources or produces inputs domestically will depend on the tradeo¤ between
the domestic labor market frictions and contracting costs.
   Another possible extension would be to endogenize the bargaining power of workers in the wage bargaining
process. In our current model, wages increase with o¤shoring, however, there is some evidence to suggest
that wages of workers have stagnated despite productivity gains coming from globalization and technological
progress. If we make workers’bargaining power a decreasing function of the number of …rms o¤shoring, it
would be possible to show a decrease in wages resulting from o¤shoring. This would be similar in spirit to
the Mitchell (1985) description of “norm shift” in wage determination. Since our focus in the present paper
is on unemployment e¤ects of o¤shoring, we do not pursue this extension in the present paper.
   We can also extend the model to allow for workers with di¤erent skills and see whether o¤shoring a¤ects
them di¤erentially. We plan to pursue these extensions in a separate paper, as they seem to be beyond the
scope of the current one.

6.1     Maximization problem of the …rm in the no o¤shoring case


The …rm maximizes (15) subject to (14), (9), and (13). Denoting the Lagrangian multiplier associated with
(14) by , with (9) by , and with (13) by ; the current value Hamiltonian for each …rm can be written as

               H   = p( )z( )         w( )N ( )         cz V ( ) + [q( z )V ( )           N ( )]

                                                                         :

Now, (52) and (53) imply

using the above in (52) gives

Next, note from (54) that for a given        z,       is constant. Using         = 0 in (55) we get

Denoting the elasticity of demand facing each producer by ;from (51) (57) and (58) we get

6.2    Derivation of Expression for Present Discounted Value of Pro…ts

The present discounted value of a …rm’s pro…t at time t is given by
                          Z 1
                               e r(s t) fps ( )zs ( ) ws ( )Ns ( ) cz Vs ( )gds
                                     t
                                               :
Next, substitute out Vs ( ) using Ns ( ) = q( z )Vs ( )   Ns ( ) to get
                   Z 1
                                                            cz                                                   cz :
                        e r(s t) fps ( )zs ( )   ws ( ) +        Ns ( )                                                N s ( )gds
                    t                                     q( z )                                                q( z )

We know that w( ) = wz . Also, if the industry is in steady-state at time t; then wz ;                                             z ; Pz ;   and Z do not
change over time and are taken as given by a …rm. Since the economy is in steady state and so Z;                                                    and
are …xed, and because adjustment costs are linear, a …rm with employment Nt at time t will immediately
jump to the steady state level of employment and output. Incorporating all this, after integrating the last
term of the previous expression by parts, we obtain the present discounted value of a …rm’s pro…t at time t
as                     Z    1
                                    r(s t)                                    (r + )cz                              cz
                                e            fp( )z( )           wz +                             N ( )gds +              Nt ( )
                        t                                                       q( z )                             q( z )
                                                                                                                                        z( )
where the variables without time subscripts denote steady state values. Next, use N ( ) =                                                      and the the
…rst order condition given in (17) to write the present discounted value of pro…t of a …rm with employment
                      z( )p( )            cz
Nt ( ) at time t as      r          +    q( z ) Nt (   ). Finally, using (12) the above can be written as

                                                                                           1

In the case of autarky,                  ; therefore,               d log M    =    1   < 1: In the complete o¤shoring case,              =   ;

Thus,   d log M    < 1 as long as   (    1)(1        (1        ))   < 1 or (        1) >    (1    (1    )) :   Note from the above that for any

corresponds to the monthly average job destruction rate in the United States. The time preference parameter,
r = :03; is in the range of values commonly used in Macro literature. m = kv u1                                        is the standard matching
function used in the literature and our choice of                               = :5 is in the range of the estimate of this matching
parameter in Blanchard and Diamond (1989) where it ranges from .43 to .75. k = :25 was chosen to get
reasonable values of unemployment rates. The Nash bargaining parameter                                              = :5 is the most commonly
used in the literature. In the absence of any clear guidance for other parameters we tried many di¤erent
values and found the results to be robust to their alternative values. We report the results obtained using
some speci…c values.
