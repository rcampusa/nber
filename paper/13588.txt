                                            ABSTRACT

The popular Nelson-Siegel (1987) yield curve is routinely fit to cross sections of intra-country bond
yields, and Diebold and Li (2006) have recently proposed a dynamized version. In this paper we extend
Diebold-Li to a global context, modeling a potentially large set of country yield curves in a framework
that allows for both global and country-specific factors. In an empirical analysis of term structures
of government bond yields for the Germany, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S., we find that global yield
factors do indeed exist and are economically important, generally explaining significant fractions of
country yield curve dynamics, with interesting differences across countries.

        The yield curve is of great interest both to academics and market practitioners. Hence yield curve

modeling has generated a huge literature spanning many decades, particularly as regards the term structure

of government bond yields. Much of that literature is unified by the assumption that the yield curve is

driven by a number of latent factors (e.g., Litterman and Scheinkman, 1991; Balduzzi, Das, Foresi and

Sundaram, 1996; Bliss, 1997a, 1997b; Dai and Singleton, 2000). Moreover, in many cases the latent yield

factors may be interpreted as level, slope and curvature (e.g., Andersen and Lund, 1997; Diebold and Li,

2006). The vast majority of the literature studies a single country’s yield curve in isolation and relates

domestic yields to domestic yield factors, and more recently, to domestic macroeconomic factors (e.g., Ang

and Piazzesi, 2003; Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba, 2006; Mönch, 2006).

        Little is known, however, about whether common global yield factors are operative, and more

generally, about the nature of dynamic cross-country bond yield interactions. One might naturally

conjecture the existence of global bond yield factors, as factor structure is routinely present in financial

markets, in which case understanding global yield factors is surely crucial for understanding the global

bond market. Numerous questions arise. Do global yield factors indeed exist? If so, what are their

dynamic properties? How do country yield factors load on the global factors, and what are the implications

for cross-country yield curve interactions? How much of country yield factor variation is explained by

global factors, and how much by country-specific factors, and does the split vary across countries in an

interpretable way? Has the importance of global yield factors varied over time, perhaps, for example,

increasing in recent years as global financial markets have become more integrated?

        In this paper we begin to address such questions in the context of a powerful yet tractable yield

curve modeling framework. Building on the classic work of Nelson and Siegel (1987) as dynamized by

Diebold and Li (2006), we construct a hierarchical dynamic factor model for sets of country yield curves,

in which country yields may depend on country factors, and country factors may depend on global factors.

Using government bond yields for the U.S., Germany, Japan, and the U.K., we estimate the model and
extract the global yield curve factors. We then decompose the variation in country yields and yield factors

into the parts dues global and idiosyncratic components. Finally, we also explore the evolution (or lack

thereof) of global yield curve dynamics in recent decades.

        Our generalized Nelson-Siegel approach is related to, but distinct from, existing work that tends to

focus on spreads between domestic bond yields and a “world rate” (e.g., Al Awad and Goodwin, 1998),

implicit one-factor analyses based on the international CAPM (e.g., Solnik, 1974, 2004; Thomas and

Wickens, 1993), multi-factor analyses of long bond spreads (e.g., Dungey, Martin and Pagan, 2000), and

affine equilibrium analyses (e.g., Brennan and Xia, 2006). Instead we work in a rich environment where

each country yield curve is driven by country factors, which in turn are driven both by global and country-

specific factors. Hence we achieve an approximate global bond market parallel to the global real-side work

of Lumsdaine and Prasad (2003), Gregory and Head (1999) and Kose, Otrok and Whiteman (2003).

        We proceed as follows. In section 2 we describe our basic global bond yield modeling framework,

and in section 3 we discuss our bond yield data for four countries. In section 4 we provide full-sample

estimates and variance decompositions for the global yield curve model, and in section 5 we provide sub-

sample results. We conclude in section 6.



                                         2. Modeling Framework

        Diebold and Li (2006), Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006) and Diebold Piazzesi and

Rudebusch (2005) show that, in a U.S. closed-economy environment, a generalized Nelson-Siegel model

accurately approximates yield curve dynamics and provides good forecasts. Here we extend that

framework to a multi-country environment, allowing for both global and country-specific factors.

Single-Country

        The Diebold-Li factorization of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve for a single country (at a particular

and arbitrary point in time) is

                                                    -3-
                                                                              ,                   (1)



where       denotes the continuously-compounded zero-coupon nominal yield on a ô-month bond, ,                 ,

and     are parameters, and        is a disturbance with standard deviation           . Following Diebold and Li,

we dynamize the model by allowing the parameters to vary over time,



                                                                                  ,                      (2)



and we interpret   ,     , and    as latent factors. In particular, as shown by Diebold and Li, they are level,

slope and curvature factors, respectively, because their factor loadings are a constant, a decreasing function

of    and a concave function of . (Hence the notation l, s and c.) As the yield factors vary over time, this

generalized Nelson-Siegel model can generate a variety of time-varying yield curve shapes.

         Henceforth we will work with a simplified version of the yield curve (3). First, we will assume

constancy of the       parameters over countries and time. Following Diebold and Li (2006), there is little

loss of generality from doing so, because primarily determines the maturity at which the curvature

loading is maximized. Second, because the curvature factor is normally estimated with low precision due

to missing data at very short and/or very long maturities in most of the countries used in our study, and

because curvature lacks clear links to macroeconomic fundamentals as shown in Diebold, Rudebusch and

Aruoba (2006), we focus on the model with level and slope factors only. Hence we write



                                                       .                                                 (3)



Note that (3) is effectively the measurement equation of a state space system with state vector                , as

emphasized by Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006). Hence the generalized Nelson-Siegel model does

                                                      -4-
not need to be cast in state space form – it is already in state space form. Subsequently we will discuss the

details of specific parameterizations of that state space form, but for now we simply note its immediate

existence.

Multi-Country

           We now move to an N-country framework. We allow global yields to be depend on global yield

factors,



                                                            ,                                                   (4)



where the           are global yields and    and        are global yield factors. We endow the global yield factors

with simple autoregressive dynamics,




                                                            ,                                                   (5)




where the          are disturbances such that                     if                , and 0 otherwise,           .

           Each country’s yield curve remains characterized by (3), but we now allow the country common

factors,     and      , to load on the global factors      and    , as well as country idiosyncratic factors:



                                                                                                    (6a)



                                                                                                                (6b)




                                                            -5-
where {          } are constant terms, {       } are loadings on global factors, and {      } are country

idiosyncratic factors,              . Because we include constant terms in (6), we assume with no loss of

generality that the country idiosyncratic factors have zero mean. In addition, we make two sets of

identifying assumptions. First, because the magnitudes of global factors and factor loadings are not

separately identified, we assume that innovations to global factors have unit standard deviation, that is,

     , n = l, s.1 Second, to identify the signs of factors and factor loadings, we assume that the U.S.

loadings on the global factors are positive; that is, we assume that         , n = l, s.

          As with the global factors, we allow the county idiosyncratic factors to have first-order

autoregressive dynamics,




                                                                                                (7)




where the         are disturbances such that                   if                    , and 0 otherwise,           .

We also assume the shocks to the global factors          and the shocks to the country-specific factors     are

orthogonal:                    for all n, n', , and s.

          Many variations, extensions and specializations of this basic model are of course possible. For

example, a useful specialization to facilitate tractable estimation would restrict the dynamic matrices in (5)

and (7) to be diagonal. (We shall do this.) As another example, an interesting extension would include not

only global factors, but also regional factors, in which case country factors could depend on regional

factors, which in turn could depend on global factors. We shall not consider such extensions in this paper;

instead, we now implement empirically our basic model sketched thus far.

3. Data Construction, Data Description, and Preliminary Analysis

        In this section, prior to fitting the full global yield model, we discuss and describe the data. We

perform several preliminary analyses that provide background, motivation and a foundation for the

subsequent analysis.

Data Construction

        Our data, generously supplied by Michael Brennan and Yihong Xia for 1985.09-2002.05 and

extended by us to 2005.08, consist of government bond prices, coupon rates, and coupon structures, as well

as issue and redemption dates, in local currency terms for the U.S., Germany, Japan, and the U.K.

        We calculate zero-coupon bond yields using the unsmoothed Fama-Bliss (1987) approach.2 We

measure the bond yields on the second day of each month. We also apply several data filters designed to

enhance data quality and focus attention on maturities with good liquidity. First, we exclude floating rate

bonds, callable bonds and bonds extended beyond the original redemption date. Second, we exclude

outlying bond prices less than 50 or greater than 130 because their price premium/discounts are too high

and imply thin trading, and we exclude yields that differ greatly from yields at nearby maturities. Finally,

we use only bonds with maturity greater than one month and less than fifteen years, because other bonds

are not actively traded. To simplify our subsequent estimation, using linear interpolation we pool the bond

yields into constant maturities of 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108 and 120

months, where a month is defined as 30.4375 days.

Data Description

        In Figure 1 we show the government bond yield curves across countries and time. It is apparent

that each yield curve displays substantial level movements. Cross-country comparison of the yield curves,

moreover, reveals clear commonality in level movements. Yield curve slopes vary less, although they do of


        2
         Our zero-coupon bond yields are highly correlated with those obtained by Brennan and Xia
(2006), who use a cubic spline and maturities of 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, 96, 108 and 120 months.

                                                     -7-
course vary, and Figure 1 suggests that they may also display some cross-country commonality in

movements.

          In Table 1 we report summary statistics for bond yields at representative maturities. Japanese

yields are lowest on average, typically around two or three percent. All yield curves are upward-sloping,

and yield volatility decreases with maturity. In addition, all yields are highly persistent for all countries,

with average first-order autocorrelation greater than 0.95.

Preliminary Analysis

          Our ultimate goal is to estimate the global yield model (4)-(7), extract the global yield factors, and

so forth. To facilitate that goal, we first conduct a preliminary estimation of the Nelson-Siegel factors

separately for each country. That is, we estimate the level and slope factors, {         },            and

              , via a series of ordinary least squares regressions for each country, as in Diebold and Li

(2006).

          In Table 2 we present descriptive statistics for the estimated factors, movement in which potentially

reflect both global and country-specific influences.3 The mean level factor is lowest for Japan, and the

mean absolute slope factor is greatest for the U.S.4 The comparatively steep average U.S. yield curve slope

may reflect comparatively optimistic average U.S. growth expectations during our sample period. The

factor autocorrelations reveal that all factors display persistent dynamics, with the level more persistent

than the slope.

          Of central interest is the possible existence of commonality in country level and/or slope factor


          3
        In section 4 we will explicitly decompose the country factors into global and country-specific
components.
          4
          It is interesting to note that the U.K. has the smallest ratio of mean to variance for both estimated
factors. This is consistent with the U.K. yield data plotted in the lower right panel of Figure 1, which
appears noticeably noisier than that for the other three countries. We are unsure as to whether the
comparatively noisy U.K. data accurately reflect U.K. bond market conditions during our sample period, or
whether they are simply of comparatively poor quality.

dynamics, as predicted by our global factor model. To investigate this, in Figure 2a we plot superimposed

estimated level factors for all the countries, and in Figure 2b we plot the superimposed estimated slope

factors. For both sets of factors, there is clear visual evidence of commonality in factor dynamics.

        Finally, as an alternative and complementary preliminary assessment of commonality of

movements in country yield curves, we conduct a principal components analysis of the estimated level and

slope factors. The results, reported in Table 3, suggest the existence of global factors. Specifically, the

first principal component for levels explains more than ninety percent of level variation, and the first

principal component for slopes explains roughly fifty percent of slope variation. We interpret this as

suggesting the existence of one dominant global level factor, and one important (if not completely

dominant) global slope factor. Armed with these preliminary and suggestive results, we now proceed to

formal econometric estimation of our model, and extraction of the associated global factors.



4. Global Model Estimation

        In this section, we estimate the global yield curve factor model, exploiting its state-space structure

for both parameter estimation and factor extraction.

4a. State Space Representation

        The global yield curve model has a natural state-space representation. The measurement equation

is:




                                                                                                       (8)




                                                       -9-
where




                                                                                                       (9)




                                                                                                       (10)




The transition equations are the union of (5) and (7).

        Note that our approach fortunately does not require that we observe global yields or global yield

factors. Global yields       do not appear at all in the state space representation, the measurement

equation of which instead relates observed country yields to the latent global yield factors    and    , which

appear in the state vector. Once the model is estimated,     and     can be immediately extracted via the

Kalman smoother. Hence we now turn to estimation.

4b. Model Estimation

        Under a normality assumption for the measurement and transition shocks, Gaussian maximum

likelihood estimates are readily obtained in principle via application of the Kalman filter to the model in

                                                     -10-
state space form, as in the single-country framework of Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006). In

practice, however, maximum likelihood is particularly difficult to implement in multi-country

environments, because of the large number of parameters to be estimated. Hence we maintain the

normality assumption but take a different, Bayesian, approach, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

(MCMC) methods to perform a posterior analysis of the model, in the tradition of recent Bayesian

estimation of large-scale dynamic factor models of real economic activity (e.g., Kim and Nelson, 1998;

Kose, Otrok and Whiteman, 2003; Bernanke, Boivin and Eliasz, 2005).

           We use a convenient multi-step estimation method in the tradition of Diebold and Li (2006), but

which still exploits the state space structure emphasized by Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006). In the

first step, we estimate the model (3) separately for each country to obtain the series of level and slope

factors,     and    . In the second step, we estimate a dynamic latent factor model composed of the country

factor decomposition equations (6), the global factor dynamics (5), and the country idiosyncratic factor

dynamics (7).

           Motivated by the results of single-country analyses, which indicate little cross-factor dynamic

interaction, we assume that the VARs given by equations (5) and (7) have diagonal autoregressive

coefficient matrices. This drastically simplifies the second-step estimation, because it implies that we can

estimate the model factor-by-factor, first estimating the model relating the four country level factors to the

global level factor, and then estimating the model relating the four country slope factors to the global slope

factor. For each of the two state-space models there are seventeen parameters to estimate: one

autoregressive coefficient for the global factor, four intercepts, four loadings on the global factor, four

autoregressive coefficients for the idiosyncratic factors, and four standard deviations for the innovations to

the idiosyncratic factors.

           Our state space models, whether for levels or slopes, are simply statements that certain “data”

(the set of country level or slope factors estimated in the first step), conditional on a set of parameters

                                                       -11-
and a latent variable     (the global level or slope factor), have a certain normal distribution.5 We use

MCMC methods – effectively just Gibbs sampling – to produce draws from the joint posterior distribution

            by iterating on the conditionals           and            .6 At generic iteration , we first draw

from                 by exploiting the fact that, conditional on F, the state space measurement equations (6)

are simply regressions with autoregressive errors, so draws from the conditional posterior

are readily obtained via the Chib-Greenberg (1994) algorithm. After drawing from                     , we then

draw from               , which is analogous to a standard signal extraction problem, except that we seek not

just to know the posterior mean but rather the entire posterior distribution. The solution is provided by the

multi-move Gibbs sampling algorithm of Carter and Kohn (1994), which lets us draw entire realizations of

the factor F, governed by              .7 We constrain the autoregressive coefficients to the stationary region

in our draws. In the MCMC we discard draws corresponding to AR coefficients bigger than one, and we

redraw them. In practice, the redrawing doesn't happen very often after the "burn-in" phase.

4c. Estimated Parameters and Factors

        We present the estimation results in Table 4. Consider first the results for the country level

factors, all of which load positively on the global level factor, which is highly serially correlated. The



        5
         Jarque-Beta tests for normality have p-values of 0.0001 to 0.2 for the 5 four country level factors
        and 0.01 to 0.5 for the four slope factors. Thus there is not overwhelming evidence against
normality. For that reason, and because it would be challenging to implement MCMC with non-Gaussian
innovations, we maintain the normality assumption.

        6
           We use        priors for all factor loadings and serial correlation coefficients,      for all
intercepts where    is sample mean of ith data series, and inverse gamma priors for all variances. Given the
bounded likelihood and proper priors we use, the joint posterior is well-behaved, and the empirical
distribution of draws from the conditional posteriors converges to the joint marginal posterior as the
number of iterations goes to infinity. We use chains of length 40,000, discarding the first 20,000 draws as
a burn-in, and then using the remaining 20,000 to sample from the marginal posteriors. See the Appendix
for details.

factor models, see Kim and Nelson (1999).

global level factor loadings in the country level factor equations are estimated with high precision, with

posterior means much greater than posterior standard deviations. The country-specific level factors are

also generally highly persistent. Relative to the middle-of-the-road results for the U.S. and U.K., the

German level loading on the global level factor is larger, and the persistence of the German-specific level

factor much smaller, implying that the dynamics of the German yield level match closely those of the global

level. Conversely, and again relative to the U.S. and U.K., the Japanese level loading on the global level

factor is smaller, and the persistence of the Japan-specific level factor larger, implying that the Japanese

yield level is comparatively divorced from the global level. The Japanese results are particularly sensible

given the very low level of Japanese yields, relative to those elsewhere, in the second half of our sample.

        Now consider the results for the country slope factors. In parallel with the earlier results for the

level factors, all slope factors load positively on the global slope factor, which is very highly serially

correlated, albeit slightly less so than the global level factor. The country-specific slope factors are also

generally highly persistent. A number of novel results are apparent as well. The German slope factor

effectively does not load on the global slope factor; instead, its movements appear completely idiosyncratic,

just the opposite of the behavior of the German level factor. The U.K. slope results also differ from those

for the U.K. level: U.K. slope loads entirely on global slope with little persistence in its country-specific

slope factor. Like its yield level, the Japanese slope loading on the global slope factor is small (and

insignificant), and the persistence of the Japan-specific slope factor large, implying that the Japanese yield

slope is also comparatively divorced from the global slope.

        In Figure 3 we plot the posterior means of the global level and slope factors extracted, along with

two posterior standard deviation bands. The narrow bands indicate that the factors are estimated with high

precision. In Figure 4 we plot the global level and slope factors together with the earlier-discussed first

principal components of country levels and country slopes. The global factors and first principal

components are highly correlated, which is reassuring. It is important to note, however, that although

                                                      -13-
related, the extracted global factors and first principal components are not at all identical.

4d. Links to the Global Macroeconomy

        Several studies, for example Ang and Piazzesi (2003) and Diebold, Rudebusch and Aruoba (2006),

show that latent country yield factors are linked to, and interact dynamically with, domestic macroeconomic

factors. The key factors, moreover, are inflation and real activity, which are linked to the yield curve level

and slope, respectively.

        In parallel fashion, our extracted global level and slope factors reflect the major developments in

global inflation and real activity during the past twenty years. The temporal decline in the global level

factor reflects the reduction of inflation in the industrialized countries; the correlation between our

extracted global level factor and average G-7 inflation during our sample is 0.75.8 Similarly, movements in

the global slope factor reflect the global business cycle, with the global slope factor peaking just before the

two global recessions of the early 1990s and early 2000s.9 The correlation between our extracted global

slope factor and average G-7 GDP annual growth during our sample is 0.27.10

        All told, the picture that emerges is one of hierarchical linkage: Country yields load off country

factors, which in turn load off global factors. This is similar, for example, to standard results in other

markets such as equities, in which excess returns on country stocks are driven by country factors, which

are in turn driven by global factors, leading to an “international CAPM” (e.g., Solnik, 1974, 2004; Thomas

and Wickens, 1993). Moreover, this hierarchical factor structure of global asset markets mirrors that of

macroeconomic fundamentals: Country real activity is typically driven by one real factor (e.g., Stock and


        8
            We use inflation data from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.
        9
          Our slope factor tracks the negative of yield curve slope, as shown in Diebold and Li (2006), so
large values correspond to a flat or inverted yield curve. Hence it seems that flat or inverted global yield
curves tend to lead global recessions.
        10
            We use G-7 quarterly GDP data from the IMF’s International Financial Statistics, and we
correlate it with our extracted global slope factor aggregated to quarterly frequency.

Watson, 1989), but country factors load on global factors, consistent with an “international business cycle”

(e.g., Kose, Otrok and Whiteman, 2003).

4e. Variance Decompositions

        We conduct two sets of variance decompositions. First, we decompose the variation in country

level and slope factors into parts driven by global yield variation and country-specific variation. Second,

we directly decompose the variation in country yields as opposed to country factors, determining for any

given country yield the fraction of its variance due to variation in underlying global factors, whether level

or slope.

        The global and country-specific factors extracted from a finite sample of data may be correlated

even if they are truly uncorrelated in population. Hence we orthogonalize the extracted factors by

regressing the country factor on the extracted global factor and updating the global factor loading and

country-specific factor variance accordingly. Then from (6) we have:



                                                                                                       (11a)



                                                    ,                                                  (11b)



for             . This splits the variation in each country factor into a part driven by the corresponding

global factor and a part driven by the corresponding country-specific factor.

        We present the results in Table 5, reporting the posterior median as well as the fifth and ninety-

fifth posterior percentiles for each variance share.11 Variation in the global level factor L explains a large



        11
          We present explicit posterior percentiles, rather than posterior means and standard deviations as
elsewhere in the paper, because the posterior distributions of the variance shares are quite highly skewed,
whereas the posterior distributions elsewhere in the paper are not.

                                                        -15-
fraction of the variation in country level factors, for all countries, typically in the range of sixty to eighty

percent. Indeed variation in L explains almost all variation in the German level factor, which is natural

because, as discussed earlier, the German level factor loads heavily on L and the German-specific level

factor is simply white noise with a small variance.

        The country-factor variance decomposition results for slopes are more diverse. Variation in the

global slope factor accounts for small percentage of the variation in the U.S. and German slope factors,

indicating comparative independence of the U.S. and German business cycles. In contrast, variation in the

global slope factor accounts for almost all of the variation in the U.K. slope factor, consistent with the

earlier-discussed fact that the U.K. slope factor loads almost entirely on the global slope factor.

        Now we provide variance decompositions for yields, as opposed to yield factors. We regress

Nelson-Siegel fitted yields on our extracted global level and slope factors jointly as implied by equations

(3) and (6), and we calculate the variance of the bond yield explained jointly by the global level and slope

factors in that regression. In Figure 5 we show the variance decompositions; more precisely, we show the

posterior median of the fraction of variation coming from global factors for bonds yields at four

representative maturities of 3, 12, 60 and 120 months. The shaded area is the range from the fifth

percentile to the ninety-fifth percentile of the posterior distribution.

        There are three major results. First, and strikingly, for all countries and maturities, variation in the

global factor is responsible for a large share of variation in yields. The global share is never less than a

third, typically more than half, and often much more than half. Hence global yield factors are important

drivers of country bond yields. Second, the global share of bond yield variation is smallest for the U.S.

across all maturities, consistent with relative independence of the U.S. market. Third, the global share

tends to increase with maturity, which effectively means that the importance of the global level factor tends

to increase with maturity (naturally, since long yields load little on slope), emphasizing the crucial

importance of inflation expectations in pricing long bonds.

                                                       -16-
5. Sub-Sample Analysis

          In this section we assess the evidence on the stability (or lack thereof) of the dynamics linking the

four countries’ yield curves. As mentioned earlier, for example, one might naturally conjecture the

enhanced importance of global yield factors in recent decades, due to enhanced global bond market

integration.

          We split our sample into two equal-length sub-samples, 1985:9-1995:8 and 1995:9-2005:8. In

Table 6 we report sub-sample summary statistics for the country level and slope factors. The mean levels

are lower in the second sub-sample, reflecting the global disinflation of the past twenty years. In contrast,

the mean slopes vary less across the sub-samples, reflecting comparatively stable cyclical patterns in real

activity.12

          In Table 7 we report log likelihoods for the full-sample models and sub-sample models, as well as

the corresponding log posterior odds. The log posterior odds (assuming flat priors) is simply the difference

between the sum of the sub-sample log likelihoods and the full-sample log likelihood. The log likelihoods

used in the calculation of the posterior odds ratio are based on the maximum likelihood estimates. The

results would be similar if the posterior means are used instead, because the MLEs and the MCMC

posterior means are quite close.13 The evidence strongly suggests instability for both the country level and

slope systems.

          In an attempt to uncover the sources of instability, we report sub-sample estimation results in

Table 8 and sub-sample variance decompositions in Table 9. The results display interesting nuances and

are certainly more involved than, for example, a simple uniform increase in importance of the global factor



          12
          Germany is an exception. Its mean slope is positive in the first sub-sample and negative in the
second sub-sample.
          13
               An alternative method is to calculate marginal likelihood based on Gibbs output, say use Chib
(1995).

                                                       -17-
in the second sub-sample.

        Consider first the level factors. For three of the four countries, the importance of the global level

factor for country yield levels either increases or remains roughly unchanged across the sub-samples; the

exception is Germany. The comparative importance of the German country-specific factor may perhaps be

linked to the successful emergence of the Eurozone in the second-subsample, so that in recent years

Germany loads less on the global level factor than do Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.

        The evolving role of the global slope factor is more involved. First, the importance of the global

slope factor for country yield slopes decreases across the sub-samples, except for Germany. Second,

Japan’s slope factor has a negative loading on the global slope factor in the second sub-sample, reflecting

the unique characteristics of the Japanese economy post-1995. Similarly, global slope factor variation

accounts for only a very small fraction of Japanese slope factor variation in the second sub-sample. It

would be interesting to know whether there was an absolute decline in variation due the world and

country-specific factors in the second half of the sample period. But our current model identification setup

is not suitable to address this question, because we assume that the global factors have a unit variance in

order to identify factor loadings. Therefore any absolute decline in variation would be reflected in the

global factors loadings or country-specific factors.

        In Figure 6 we report the sub-sample variance decompositions of yields, as opposed to factors. For

both subsamples, the global shares of bond yield variation are economically important. Just as the global

factors impact the country factors differently across the two sub-samples, so too do they impact the

dynamics of yields differently. Overall the evidence suggests that global factors play a larger and important

role in the second sub-sample, but the details are again richly nuanced. In the first sub-sample, the

contribution of global factor greatly differs across countries, with the lowest share of 20% for the U.S.,

which again reflects the independence of the U.S. bond market in the first sub-sample. Moreover, the

importance of global factors decreases with maturity for all countries except Germany. For the second

                                                       -18-
sub-sample, the global factors account for more than 50% of variation in bond yields for all the bonds

considered except for the 3 and 12 months bond issued by Japan.14 The importance of global factors

largely increases with maturity with the exception of U.K. Moreover, the global shares for the countries in

our sample have more homogeneity in the second sub-sample, in particular for bonds with maturity longer

than five years. This result, together with the increasing role of global yield factors, reflects the greater

degree of globalization of the world economy as well as better integration of bond markets.



6. Summary and Concluding Remarks

        We have extended the yield curve model of Nelson-Siegel (1987) and Diebold-Li (2006) to a global

setting, proposing a hierarchical model in which country yield level and slope factors may depend on global

level and slope factors as well as country-specific factors. Using a monthly dataset of government bond

yields for Germany, Japan, the U.S. and the U.K. from 1985:9 to 2005:8, we extracted global factors and

country-specific factors for both the full sample and the 1985:9-1995:8 and 1995:9-2005:8 sub-samples.

The results indicate strongly that global yield level and slope factors do indeed exist and are economically

important, accounting for a significant fraction of variation in country bond yields. Moreover, the global

yield factors appear linked to global macroeconomic fundamentals (inflation and real activity) and appear

more important in the second sub-sample.

        We look forward to future work producing one-step estimates in an environment with many

countries, richer country-factor and global-factor dynamics, richer interactions with macroeconomic

fundamentals, non-normal shocks, and time-varying yield volatility. Such extensions remain challenging,

however, because of the prohibitive dimensionality of the estimation problem. Presently we are estimating

240+17=257 parameters in each of our separate global level and slope models, composed of the 17

parameters discussed earlier, plus the 240 parameters corresponding to the values of the state vector at 240

different times. Incorporating the generalizations mentioned above could easily quadruple the number of

parameters, necessitating the use of much longer Markov Chains.

                                       Appendix: Details of MCMC Estimation
         We estimate the dynamic generalized Nelson-Siegel model in equation (3), (5), (6) and (7) using a
two-step procedure. Let         denote the set of parameters                                     ,               , where                  .
Denote by       the corresponding set of global factors                   .
         In the first step, we estimate model (3) using OLS to obtain level and slope factors,                           and         ,
separately for each country. We treat the estimated country level and slope factors as observed data                                      in
the second step estimation. In the second step, we view the dynamic factor model in equation (5)- (7) as a
Gaussian probability density for the data {               },                   , or    , conditional on a set of parameters
and a set of latent global factors       . Under the assumption of diagonal autoregressive coefficient matrices,
we estimate the model factor-by-factor.
         Consider, for example, the level factor. The density is                            where          denotes the              vector
of country level factor data and        denotes the             vector of global level factor data. In addition,
conditional on the parameters there is a specification of a Gaussian probability density                                 for        itself.
Given a prior distribution for     ,       , the joint posterior distribution for the parameters and the latent
variables is given by the product of the likelihood and prior,                                                           .
         Given the conjugate prior for       , we first obtain the two conditional densities                                 and
             via the Chib-Greenberg (1994) algorithm. Then we generate an artificial sample                                         for
              and get the joint posterior distribution                   . More precisely, we proceed as follows:
(1) Conditional distribution of the parameters given the factor,                           .
         We first generate the conditional distribution of measurement equation parameters given the factor.
Conditional on the data and draws of the latent factor                 , the state space measurement equations (6) are a
set of independent regressions with autoregressive errors given in equation (7). To begin, define
                ,                 and                          , for                  . We use the usual conjugate prior
densities,                  ,                             ,                               , where IG is the inverted gamma
distribution and           is the indicator function for stationarity. We use standard normals for                                       and
improper inverted gammas for all variances; experiments with tighter and looser priors for both the factor
loadings and the autoregressive parameters did not produce qualitatively important changes in the results.
         We first generate      , conditional on      ,           ,    , and                             . By multiplying both sides
of equation (6a) by                and using equation (7) we have                                                  , where
                       , and                          . In matrix notation this is
                                   ,                                                                                               (A1)
where                              and     is a vector of ones. This is a standard regression inference problem
with known variance. The posterior is then                                                     , where
                                                   and                                               .
          We also need to generate        , conditional on        ,       ,       , and                        . We focus on
equation (7), which is a standard AR(1) regression with known variance. From equation (6a) we can
generate                      . In matrix notation equation (7) is
                                  ,                                                                                       (A2)
where        is a vector of lagged country idiosyncratic factors              . The posterior is then
                                          , where                                                          ,
                             .
          Finally, we need to generate          , conditional on      ,       ,     , and                          . Given     and
     , we can use either equation (A1) or (A2) to derive the posterior distribution of                     , which is
                                      , where                     ,                                            .
          Next, we generate the conditional distribution of the autoregressive parameters                          in the global
level factor transition equation, given the factor      . Conditioning on the factor, the factor dynamics equation
(5) is independent of the rest of the model. In matrix notation, the global level factors follow
                  , where X is a vector of lagged global level factors               .
          We assume a normal prior for           , given by                                     , where            is an indicator
function for stationarity. The posterior for           is then                                            , where
                                      ,                       .
(2) Conditional distribution of the dynamic factor given the parameters,
          We next need to generate a random draw              from the conditional density                         . Based on a
result of Carter and Kohn (1994), Kim and Nelson (1999) show that draws from the conditional distribution
of the latent factors    can be obtained as follows. First, put the model in a standard state-space form.
Multiplying both sides of equation (6a) by                and using equation (7) we have the measurement
equation:




                                                                                            ,




or                          , with
                                                                  ,




where                        ,                . Similarly , the transition equation is:


                                                       ,


or                     , with


                                                .


        The covariance matrix of the shocks to the transition equation,           , is not positive-definite (Kim and
Nelson (1999), pp. 194-196), but the first          , J=1, block of the Q matrix, denoted by Q*, is positive
definite. Denote the first J rows of       by        , and the first J rows of G by G*.
        We then run the Kalman filter forward to obtain estimates                of the factors in period T, and their
covariance matrix         based on all available sample information. Then, for                    , we proceed
backward to generate draws             from                                        , where
                                                           ,                                                  ,
and     and      are updated estimates of the factor           and its covariance in the Kalman filter. We then
use the first J rows of           as our generated global level factors      .
(3) Joint posterior distribution of the parameters and the factors
        We repeat steps 2 and 3, drawing                         and                     at each step. The empirical
distribution of draws from the conditional posterior densities converges to the joint marginal posterior
distribution as the number of iterations goes to infinity. We use chains of length 40,000 in the simulation.
We discard the first 20,000 draws and use the remaining 20,000 to sample from the marginal posteriors.
For chains of length 40,000 or greater, the results were the same. Sampling from the known conditional
posterior densities of factors and parameters is equivalent to sampling from their unknown joint posterior
distribution. We can then draw inferences about the parameters and factors from the posterior distribution.
