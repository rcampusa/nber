                                          ABSTRACT

We develop an international financial market model in which domestic and foreign residents
differ in their beliefs about the information content in public signals. We determine how
informational advantages by domestic investors in the interpretation of home public signals
impact equity markets. We evaluate the ability of our model to generate four international finance
anomalies: (i) the co-movement of returns and capital flows; (ii) home-equity preference; (iii) the
dependence of firm returns on home and foreign factors; and (iv) abnormal returns around foreign
firm cross- listing in the home market. Their relationships with empirical differences-of-opinion
proxies are consistent with the model.

         “In almost all models of economic theory, behavioral di¤erences among consumers are attributed to

     di¤erences in preferences or in the information they possess. In real life, di¤erences in consumer behavior

     are often attributed to varying intelligence and ability to process information. Agents reading the same

     morning newspapers with the same stock price lists will interpret the information di¤erently.”

         Ariel Rubinstein (1993) cited by Kandel and Pearson (1995).


   How do di¤erences in interpreting the same information a¤ect …nancial markets? This question

is at the core of a growing Di¤erence-of-Opinion (hereafter DOO) literature. While di¤ering opinions

may exist between agents in any market, international markets provide a natural place to study their

e¤ects. Evidence of …nancial market segmentation across countries has been documented extensively,

with di¤erent perceptions across those countries often cited as a source. Perhaps people of di¤erent

countries harbor di¤erent opinions that a¤ect their ability to process information relevant to the

analysis of economies other than their own. As such, the international …nancial market may be

viewed as a natural laboratory for analyzing the e¤ects of di¤ering opinions.

   In this paper, therefore, we propose a fully dynamic DOO model based upon international dif-

ferences in perceptions about economic information, incorporating the equilibrium consumption of

utility-maximizing investors. We assume that home investors are better at understanding home sig-

nals, and, as such, are rational about home information. However, investor groups in both countries

misinterpret the information about the other country’s prospective growth and are, therefore, equally

rational or irrational. We call this new feature “foreign sentiment.”

   The information assumption captures the idea that, while foreigners may see home information as

well as home residents do, they do not know how to interpret it. The assumption may be motivated (in

an unmodeled way) in at least three di¤erent ways, all stemming from the hypothesis that investors

start history with priors that ignore the relationships (i.e., correlations) between the signals and the

growth rates, and gradually discover them as data comes in. First, it could be that home investors

have had a longer time to study the relationship. From this perspective, it may be taking foreigners

a longer time to learn how to interpret the home signal and, if so, our model is analyzing a long


                                                         1
transitional time period. Second, foreigners may simply have chosen not to become informed about

the signal because they have viewed home investment as too risky in the past and consider becoming

informed too costly.1 Third, foreign investors may not be able to learn the same information as

home residents.2 The assumption can also be viewed as a natural extension of the Merton (1987)

“investor-recognition”hypothesis, to which we add the explicit modelling of information processing.3

In Section 1, we review the empirical evidence found in the extant literature that supports the DOO

hypothesis.

       To highlight the e¤ects of DOO, we embed our information processing in a two-country model

that is otherwise as stylized and parsimonious as possible. Each country has an output process

with an unobserved conditional mean that can be inferred from observable outputs and signals, each

generated by subjective Brownian motions. Moreover, markets are complete and all information is

public. Investors in each country have an identical set of …ve assets that complete the market: a risk-

free asset, two equities with payo¤s in the output process in each country, and two futures contracts

with payo¤s marked to signal innovations. The manner in which information is processed by investors

is modelled in Section 2 and the equilibrium is calculated in Section 3.

       We then ask to what extent our model can produce international empirical regularities related

to asset pricing, portfolio choices and capital ‡ows. For that purpose, we gather data, described

in Section 4.1, to re-estimate standard empirical relationships in the literature, allowing comparison

with simulated data from our model. After examining the implications of the model and parameter

values for some traditional moments of asset prices, capital ‡ows, output and consumption (Section

4), we evaluate the e¤ects of DOO on four known empirical regularities. Two of these relationships

have been found at the country level (Section 5). The …rst of these empirical regularities is the

positive relationship between foreign capital in‡ows and home stock returns, sometimes called “return-
   1
     For example, Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2009) show in a noisy-rational-expectations model that, when
investors are endowed with a small home information advantage, they choose not to learn what foreigners know.
   2
     Acemoglu, Chernozhukov, and Yildiz (2015) show that when agents are uncertain about the conditional distribution,
even a small amount of uncertainty can lead to signi…cant di¤erences in long-run beliefs.
   3
     On the investor-recognition hypothesis, see also the empirical work of Lehavy and Sloan (2008), and Richardson,
Sloan and You (2012).



                                                          2
chasing.” We show that our model implies this same co-movement when home investors have an

informational advantage in interpreting home signals. For the second regularity, we examine “home-

equity preference,”the observation that home residents weight home assets more heavily than foreign

assets in their portfolios. Since home investors ignore foreign signals in our model, they shy away from

holding foreign equity because they perceive higher sensitivity of the foreign stock return to foreign

dividend shocks. Therefore, our model generates this relationship as well.

   Next we analyze the other two regularities based upon …rm-level pricing observations (Section 6).

For this purpose, we introduce an additional equity from a new …rm we call the “home …rm” that

operates in the home market. We …rst evaluate the …nding that home …rm returns depend upon both

home- and foreign-market factors. Using our extended model, we show that foreign sentiment risk

indeed generates a home-and foreign-factor model in consumption. We also show that regressing our

…rm-level excess returns on the home and foreign country stock excess returns implies a somewhat

higher beta on the home market than the foreign market, consistent with typical empirical …ndings.

We then move to our next pricing observation: stock prices on home …rms that cross-list in foreign

markets tend to increase around this event, and expected returns decline thereafter, responses often

attributed to increased information to foreign investors about the cross-listed …rms. To examine this

e¤ect in our model, we conjecture that cross-listing by the home …rm in the foreign market enables

the foreign country’s investor to correctly interpret information about the home …rm. Because cross-

listing aligns perceptions about the information in public signals, the resulting decline in disagreement

risk decreases the required return and increases the price, as in the data.

   Simulations show that the model can qualitatively generate all four of these regularities with

varying degrees of quantitative success. In addition, the model suggests several empirical relationships

across countries and …rms depending upon their sensitivity to measures of DOO. Using dispersion in

professional forecasts of economic activity to examine these relationships, we …nd evidence consistent

with our model.

   Overall, our paper provides a signi…cant contribution on at least three fronts. First, we present



                                                   3
the …rst two-country general equilibrium model in which investors have heterogeneous con…dence

about public information. On the technical side, we extend the model by Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal

(2009) to a multiple-trees setup.4 Second, to our knowledge, this paper provides the …rst information-

based attempt to explain the above four international empirical regularities simultaneously. Third,

we provide new empirical evidence that DOO may a¤ect these regularities.



1       The di¤erence-of-opinion hypothesis

In this section, we argue that the DOO hypothesis is a legitimate contender as an explanation of

phenomena in the …nancial market and that it deserves examination, alongside the alternative hy-

pothesis that says that di¤erent people receive di¤erent, private information.5;6 Indeed, a growing

body of direct and indirect empirical evidence suggests that di¤erences of opinion play an important

role.

    Direct evidence is provided by data on professional forecasters, of the kind we explore in Section 7.

Patton and Timmermann (2010) show that di¤erences in individual-forecaster views persist through

time. Based on a statistical model of the e¤ect of public vs. private information, they conclude

that “such di¤erences in opinion cannot be explained by di¤erences in information sets; our results

indicate they stem from heterogeneity in priors or models.”They also observe (as do Dovern, Fritsche

and Slacalek (2012)) that “Di¤erences in opinion move countercyclically, with heterogeneity being

strongest during recessions where forecasters appear to place greater weight on their prior beliefs.”It

would be hard to imagine that more private information induces forecasters to disagree more during
   4
     Cochrane, Longsta¤ and Santa Clara (2008), and Martin (2013) show that this extension is already far from trivial
with homogeneous investors. Osambela (2015) considers a model with two trees, DOO, and funding liquidity constraints,
but with deterministic disagreement. To our knowledge, we are the …rst to solve a multiple-trees model in a setup with
DOO and stochastic disagreement, driven by heterogeneous con…dence in public signals. Moreover, in Appendix B, we
extend the model to correlated trees, still yielding explicit solutions.
   5
     Previous contributions to the DOO approach include: Harris and Raviv (1993) and Cecchetti, Lam and Mark
(2000). See Morris (1995) for a discussion of this approach.
   6
     In both approaches, investors learn about the current state of the economy, knowing exactly how the economy
operates, although they do not observe it completely. In yet a third approach, called “parameter uncertainty,” investors
are uncertain about the parameters of the model that govern the economy. See Collin-Dufresne, Lochstoer and Johannes
(2015).

recessions than during expansions whereas, in our DOO model, disagreement and output growth are

found to be correlated, in conformity with that observation.7

    Indirect evidence comes from the observed relationship between volume of trading and returns in

the stock market at the time of public announcements of quarterly earnings. In a sample of more than

60,000 …rm/announcements, Kandel and Pearson (1995) …nd that, around a public announcement

date, the relationship between volume of trade and returns is clearly di¤erent from what it is at other

times. They consider many candidate models for the treatment of information by investors, trying to

…t them to the observed relationship and conclude that “it is inconsistent with most existing models

in which agents have identical interpretations of the public announcement.”8 Bamber, Barron and

Stober (1999) directly test the relationship between trading volume and a proxy for the measure of

di¤erential interpretations that had been suggested by Kandel and Pearson (1995). They …nd that

“around earnings announcements that generate minimal price changes (where many models predict

there should be no information-based trading) trading volume increases signi…cantly with Kandel

and Pearson’s measure of di¤erential interpretations.”9 In the international sphere, the dramatic

capital ‡ow waves –classi…ed as “surges, stops, ‡ight, and retrenchment”–that Forbes and Warnock

(2011) examine make sense if we consider that home and foreign investors hold di¤erent and highly

‡uctuating views about a country’s growth prospects, about which there is unlikely to exist much

private information.
   7
     Avramov, Kaplanski and Levy (2015) show that the recommendations of analysts who rely on technical analysis
are superior to those relying on fundamental analysis. They both have access to public information but the former, by
construction, use public information only and process it di¤erently.
   8
     Similarly, earlier work by Kim and Verrecchia (1991) concluded that di¤erential interpretations had to be present
to some degree.
   9
     Motivated by …ndings such as these, Cao and Ou-Yang (2008) analyze the e¤ects of disagreement about volatilities
upon the pricing of options. Private information about volatilities is hard to come by. In a very recent paper, Jia, Wang
and Xiong (2015) compare the empirical reactions of Chinese and foreign investors to the same public news. They …nd
that Chinese investors react more strongly to earnings forecast revisions published by Chinese analysts while foreign
investors react more strongly to revisions published by foreign analysts. Individual household portfolios provide separate
and complementary evidence about di¤erences of opinion. In a panel-data analysis of Norwegian household portfolios,
Doskeland and Hvide (2011) …nd preference both in holdings and in trades for the equity of the householder’s employer.
With no return-based evidence of informational advantage, this phenomenon looks similar to home-equity preference.
They conclude that “Overcon…dence seems the most likely explanation for the excessive trading in professionally close
stocks.”




                                                            5
       Further indirect evidence for di¤erences of opinion can also be found in commodity markets.

Singleton (2014) observes a positive price drift (which he calls a “boom”) in commodities prices –re-

‡ecting an additional risk premium –during periods when there is more disagreement among analysts’

forecasts. This …nding is directly in line with our DOO theory, which says that more disagreement

implies more volatility in sentiment risk.

       Models that rely on private information – such as Noisy Rational Expectations (NRE) models –

have also been used to explain two of the empirical regularities we study – capital ‡ows and home-

equity preference. Early models about these regularities typically assumed that the informational

advantage to home residents arises from more precise, privately observed signals. For example, Gehrig

(1993) posits that home residents have more certainty about home fundamentals information than do

foreigners, thereby reducing the optimal holdings of foreign assets.10

       Brennan and Cao (1997), in a model in which investors have initially received private signals, show

that foreign purchases of home equities are positively correlated with home stock returns, because

they both react the same way to public signals. In our DOO model, instead of receiving initial private

signals, di¤erent investors make di¤erent assumptions about parameters; but the reaction to public

information is very similar.

       An important di¤erence introduced by our model is the endogenization of the rate of interest.

To our knowledge, all extant implementations of NRE assume an exogenous and constant rate of

interest, so that they are not fully general-equilibrium models. As Loewenstein and Willard (2006)

pointed out, this assumption implies that capital goes in and out of a storage facility that returns

the …xed rate of interest, thereby a¤ecting the implied behavior of capital ‡ows. Albuquerque, Bauer

and Schneider (2007) present an NRE model that delivers persistence of net capital ‡ows, as in the

data.11 The serial dependence of capital ‡ows between investors or between countries when the rate
  10
     Many NRE models rely on the presence of noise traders –a behavioral feature. That assumption has been relaxed
by Wang (1994) and Hatchondo, Krusell and Schneider (2014).
  11
     The articles by Dvoµrák (2003), Albuquerque, Bauer and Schneider (2007, 2009) and Hau and Rey (2008) all highlight
the need to study not just a country’s international capital ‡ows but also the gross ‡ows into the various securities of one
country executed by investors who di¤er from each other within each country. In order to explain simultaneous foreign
purchases and sales, they argue that some US investors must be transacting with other US investors and, therefore,



                                                             6
of interest is held …xed is presumably quite di¤erent than when the rate of interest is endogenous.12

Indeed, we demonstrate below that our DOO model can explain only a small degree of capital ‡ow

persistence, in part due to the adjustment in the rate of interest.

    Overall, our endeavor below is not predicated on an assertion that the DOO approach is better than

the NRE approach in explaining the international phenomena we study, or that these international

phenomena provide a way to discriminate between the two approaches. Nothing at this point positions

one approach as the incumbent and the other as the challenger. Indeed, it seems plausible that both

di¤erences of opinion and asymmetric information are important forces in the market.



2     The foreign sentiment risk model: information processing

In this section, we provide a simple framework that captures two features. First, the information in

current economic variables and public signals a¤ects forecasts of future variables and hence current

prices of …nancial securities. And, second, investors di¤er across countries in their beliefs about the

informativeness of these currently observed public signals.

    The basic features of these di¤ering beliefs and their impact on future expectations can be shown

most parsimoniously using a model with two ex ante identical countries. Representative investors

live in each of the two countries. The countries are completely integrated in that they are open to

international trade in securities and in a single, perishable good. Investors in each country are initially

endowed with one share of their own output process, itself initialized at the value 1. The …nancial

market is complete.
introduce two types of investors within a country. In our paper, by contrast, we consider transactions on only one …rm
per country, summarizing the net securities transactions within that country. In principle, our dynamic equilibrium
could also be extended to any number of investors and securities. This extension would necessarily complicate the model
and likely make the DOO channel less transparent. We therefore leave this topic for future research.
  12
     Admittedly, our rate of interest is too volatile (see Panel A of Table 2). The sentiment-risk model produces too
much volatility in one place and/or not quite enough in another, which is why some articles on the subject have either
examined the equity market without looking at the bond market or vice-versa.

The output delivered by Country i 2 fA; Bg at time t is denoted                            i;t dt:   The stochastic process for

 i;t   is

                                                  = fi;t dt +     dzi;t ; i 2 fA; Bg ;                                      (1)
                                          i;t

where zi are Brownian motions under the objective probability measure, which governs empirical

realizations of the process. The conditional growth rates fi;t of outputs are also stochastic:


                                                                          f
                                  dfi;t =         f       fi;t dt +   f dzi;t ;   i 2 fA; Bg ;                              (2)


where        > 0 and zif are also Brownian motions under the objective probability measure.

       Neither the conditional growth rates of outputs fi nor the z shocks are observed by any investor.

All investors must estimate, or …lter out, the current value of fi in order to determine the way

future conditional mean growth rates a¤ect forward-looking asset prices. They estimate this value by

observing current outputs and two public signals (sA ; sB ). The signals follow the processes

                                                           q
                                                    f                 2     s
                                  dsi;t =         dzi;t   + 1             dzi;t ; i 2 fA; Bg ;                              (3)


where j j 2 [0; 1] and where zis is a third pair of Brownian motions, under the objective probability
                            f
measure as well. The term dzi;t in the stochastic di¤erential equation for the signals means that the
                                                           f
signals are truly informative about output growth shocks dzi;t .

       For expositional purposes, we describe in the text the model assuming that the six Brownian
                f      s ;z       f      s
motions zA;t ; zA;t ; zA;t B;t ; zB;t ; zB;t          are independent of each other. As we show below, this inde-

pendence, together with symmetry, provides a signi…cantly simpli…ed version of our model with an

intuitive solution. For our quantitative analysis below, we allow for cross-country output correlation,

however. Details of the solution with output correlation are provided in Appendix B.

       Note that, in these output and signal processes, the parameters are identical across countries for



                                                                 8
symmetry. Thus, the volatility of the outputs and conditional growth rates,                     and   f,   the long-

run means of the conditional growth rates and their mean reversion parameters, f and , and the

information in the signal, , do not depend upon the country.


2.2     Benchmark beliefs: the viewpoint of the “econometrician”

In the information model we develop below, no investor knows the true state of the economy. We

consider as a benchmark the perspective taken by a nonexistent being who interprets data correctly

and whom we call “the econometrician.”This abstract agent is not a participant in our economy. As in

Xiong and Yan (2010), the econometrician observes the same information as do both sets of investors.

Like the investors of both countries, the econometrician does not observe the true conditional growth

rate of outputs and must …lter out this process. The econometrician’s measure, therefore, is not

the same as the objective probability measure under which we wrote Equations (1), (2) and (3).

The di¤erence between the two measures is the observation or non observation of state variables,

ffi;t gi2fA;Bg .

    We assume, however, that the econometrician knows the true structure of the economy (Equations

(1), (2) and (3)). Accordingly, the econometrician …lters the signal process under the hypothesis stated

in Equation (3). We formulate the probability measures of home and foreign groups as deviations

from the econometrician’s probability measure.

This variance would normally be a deterministic function of time. But for simplicity we assume, as

did Scheinkman and Xiong (2003) and Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009), that there has been a

su¢ ciently long period of learning for people of both countries to converge to their long-run level of

variance, independent of their prior.

       Equation (4) shows how the econometrician …lters out the conditional growth rates based upon

observations of outputs and signals. When he sees an increase in the output of Country i, he updates

his estimate of the conditional mean growth rate by the ratio of its steady state variance            E   and the

variance of the output          . When he sees an increase in the signal of Country i, he increases his view

of fi;t according to       f,   the information precision in the signal about this growth rate.

2.3      The investors’viewpoints

The di¤erence in information processing by the investors of the two countries is implemented as

follows. Investors in Country A perform their …ltering under the belief that the signal sA has the correct

conditional correlation with fA but they believe incorrectly that the signal sB has zero correlation



                                                                   10
with fB : The “model” they have in mind is

Notice that investors in Country A have the same model of signal sA as the econometrician (incorpo-

rating the true correlation        in Equation (3)) but a di¤erent one (incorporating a correlation equal

to zero) for the signal sB . Symmetrically, the “model” that investors of Country B have in mind is

                                                                             q

Note from Equation (5) that              decreases as the information in the signal measured by                rises

toward one. Intuitively, the signal si allows the econometrician and investors in Country i to get a

more precise estimate of fi , thereby reducing the steady-state variance for investors in Country i’s

estimate. By contrast, investors in Country j 6= i ignore the information in the signal si and thereby

attribute more of the variability to fi : The result is a relationship we use below:

Proposition 1 The steady-state variance of the forecast error of the home-output growth rate made

                                                          11
by home investors is lower than the steady-state variance of the same forecast error made by foreign

investors; i.e.,        E   <   =   E           .
                                          =0


      Since the econometrician’s hypothesis about signals is not in line with that of investors in any of

the two countries, di¤erences in beliefs are generated. We de…ne the “disagreements” between the

econometrician and the investors as

In principle, gbij stands for two pairs of disagreements for each country’s investor. However, the

investors agree with the econometrician about the estimate of the conditional growth rate of their

      The econometrician’s and investor’s …lters in Equations (4) and (10), respectively, make clear the

drivers for the disagreements in Equation (12). On the one hand, a positive output shock of, say,
                                                                                                                             E
Country A, dwEA ;t , causes the econometrician to increase his estimate fbAE according to                                        . This

same output change induces investors in Country B to increase their estimate by                                      . Recall that

      >     E     (Proposition 1): because these investors ignore the signal information, they update their

estimate by more than the econometrician (and more than investors in Country A). Thus, Country

B investors over-adjust their estimate of Country A output growth in response to its output shock
 13
    When output is correlated, however, both pairs of disagreement move over time and are jointly persistent. See
Appendix B for details.



                                                                      12
and the disagreement between these investors and the econometrician declines, dbB < 0: Given
                                                                               gA;t

the de…nition in Equation (11), this relationship means that Country B investors become relatively

optimistic about Country A output. On the other hand, an increase in the signal dwsEA ;t induces the

econometrician to increase his estimate of the conditional mean fbAE in Equation (4). Since Country

B investors ignore the signal information, the signal increases the disagreement about Country A

output, dbB > 0. Country B investors become relatively pessimistic about Country A. This insight
         gA;t

leads to the following proposition.


Proposition 2 Foreign investors under-adjust their estimate of home output growth in response to

home signal shocks and over-adjust their estimate of home output growth in response to home output

shocks. By contrast, home investors adjust properly their own output growth rate estimate in response

to both home output and home signal shocks.


   We now derive the changes in measures between the econometrician and investors. For this

purpose, consider also a set of four-dimensional processes for each country that is Brownian under

the probability measure of investors in Country j; wtj = wjA ;t ; wjB ;t ; wsjA ;t ; wsjB ;t ; j 2 fA; Bg. These

processes di¤er from the econometrician’s according to

                                                                    j
                                         E             j          gbi;t
                                    dw   i ;t
                                                = dw       i ;t
                                                                          dt,     dwsEi ;t = dwsi i ;t :              (13)


The probabilities of events will look di¤erent from the point of view of the econometrician and the

investors in the two countries. The change in measure between the sets of Brownians perceived by the

econometrician, wtE , and by the investor in country j, wtj , indicates the evolution of their di¤erence

in beliefs. Based on Equation (13), we can apply Girsanov’s theorem to obtain the changes from the

probability measure of the econometrician to those of investors in Country A and B. Doing so implies

that the ratios of probability beliefs between these countries evolve according to:

                                               A

We give the ratio of beliefs            i   the picturesque name of “Country i foreign sentiment” or, more

generally, “foreign sentiment risk”. By contrast the stochastic term in the disagreement equation (12)

is referred to as “disagreement risk”. Equations (14) show the following:


Proposition 3 The foreign sentiment risk of the investors of one country is perfectly correlated with

the output shock of the other country (with the sign of the perfect correlation being opposite to the

sign of current disagreement).


      Notice that the ratios of probability beliefs are not impacted by signal shocks. Also, the evolution

of    A;t   does not depend upon the Country A output shock since the econometrician and the Country

A investors agree about the …lter of that process.14 The change of measure between an investor of a

country and the econometrician is perfectly (positively or negatively) correlated with the output in
                                   A and g
the other country. Disagreements gbB;t     B are the drivers of the instantaneous volatilities of the
                                         bA;t

foreign sentiment variables. For example,                  A;t   depends upon realizations of the output in Country

B; according to dwEB ;t : The size of this e¤ect depends upon the current disagreement between the
                                             A : If investors in Country A are currently optimistic
econometrician and investors in Country A, gbB;t
                        A < 0: Since Country A investors over-adjust their estimate of Country B
about Country B, then gbB;t

output growth in response to its output realizations, this response will further increase the di¤erence

in probabilities and        A;t   increases.

      The Markovian system comprised of Equations (4), (6), (12), and (14) completely characterizes

the dynamics of eight exogenous state variables that drive the economy, de…ned by the vector: Yt
                                                     |

                   A;t B;t ; B;t ; fB;t ; gB;t A;t       . However, since outputs are uncorrelated, the …rst four

components of the vector are only driven by the Brownians on the output and signal of Country A,

while the last four components of the vector are driven by the corresponding Brownians for Country
 14
    When output is correlated, however, these correlations generate disagreement between each investor and the econo-
metrician about both output growth rates. See Appendix B for details.

Thus, the state vector can be evaluated as two independent processes, each governing the evolution of

views about each country’s output, providing a block diagonal structure exploited in our description

of the equilibrium below. This convenient block diagonal structure no longer holds when output are

correlated, as we describe in Appendix B.

We now use the information structure to derive equilibrium pricing relationships. The derivation of

equilibrium in a complete market is standard.

    The investors in the two countries have identical time-separable utility functions in a common

   The two priced factors are conditionally correlated. As we have seen (Equation (14)), foreign

sentiment     A   is perfectly correlated with the output shock of Country B, dwEB ;t , with the sign of
                                                                     A . Only if and when there is
that correlation depending on the sign of the current disagreement gbB;t

full agreement today (bA = g
                      gB;t   B = 0) are these correlations equal to zero. In all cases, the state
                           bA;t

price density in Equation (17) shows that, in the presence of foreign sentiment, equilibrium prices

now contain additional risk premia, over and above the classic premium based on world consumption.

These premia are related to the risks in individual country output shocks but not related to the risk

in signal shocks, since the ratios of probability measure are not impacted by signal shocks.

   In equilibrium, each country’s share of world consumption is given by a monotonic transformation

of the ratio of the two ratios of probability beliefs. De…ning Country A’s share as !, its equilibrium

value is                                                                                   1

As in Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009), the consumption-sharing rule is linear in world consumption

cW;t and its slope, !. Here ! is driven by the ratio of Country A beliefs to Country B beliefs,                 A;t = B;t .

   This relationship can be understood intuitively as follows. When the investors of Country A have

deemed an event more likely to occur than did investors of Country B, they have bet on that event

through     A;t = B;t   and, when it occurs, they get to consume more. In this way, ratios of probability

beliefs act as endogenous taste shocks in each country.

   In the standard case without foreign sentiment, perfect risk sharing would result in consumption

growth being perfectly correlated contra empirical cross-country consumption growth correlations that




                                                                   17
are typically well below 1, thereby posing a well-known puzzle.16 With foreign sentiment, however,

the presence of the stochastic term               A;t = B;t   in the sharing rule in Equation (19) means that the cross-

country conditional consumption correlation is below one all the time, except when disagreements

happen to be equal to zero.

      In order to obtain the portfolios of the two national groups of investors, we need to derive their

to optimal consumption. The wealth of the representative Country i investor is

      Since the whole mathematical framework is exponential linear quadratic (as in Cheng and Scaillet

(2007)), we can obtain the conditional expectation terms and thereby the wealth, pricing functions,

functions are described in Appendix A and in Appendix B when outputs are uncorrelated and corre-

lated, respectively, taking into account the fact that there are two “trees” in the world with outputs

that need to be summed. We obtain the di¤usion of wealth from a straightforward application of

Itô’s lemma. The elements of this di¤usion are the target risk exposures of the investor.

      To examine the aggregate equity market implications, we require a set of securities that both

completes the market and makes our DOO e¤ects most transparent. To complete the market, we need

…ve securities with nonlinearly dependent payo¤s since we have four linearly independent Brownians

that are observable by investors.

      Given the aggregate equity market focus of our empirical regularities, stocks that are claims to

each country’s output are a natural choice to make our e¤ects transparent. Therefore, equities for

country A and B comprise the …rst two securities in the menu of assets, with prices denoted SA;t and

SB;t , respectively. Equities are in…nitely long-lived and pay amounts equal to outputs perpetually at

    We need three more securities to complete the market. For this purpose, we choose a menu of

securities that allows investors to allocate their risk exposures to output shocks exclusively through

country equities so that the equity preference is not polluted by indirect allocations via non equity

securities. To that aim, we add three securities with payo¤s that are neutral vis-à-vis output shocks.

The …rst one is the instantaneous maturity locally riskless bond, paying the interest rate rt . The

other two are futures contracts (in zero net supply). We choose futures contracts that are marked to

the ‡uctuations of the signal shock from each country and designed to be hedges of signal shocks only.

Since the market value of a futures contract is always adjusted to be equal to zero, a zero market-value

amount of capital ‡ow is induced.

    With the available menu of the two country stocks and the two futures contracts, investors must

replicate the desired exposures. The 1                    4 vector     i;t   represents the numbers of units held by investors

in Country i of each available …nancial security:


                                          =       i        i         i           i         ; i 2 fA; Bg :

    Given the closed form solutions for the wealth of investors and the equity prices, we are able to

obtain their di¤usions by Itô’s lemma. De…ning xi;t as the 1                                    4 di¤usion vector of the wealth of

be computed directly from a system of linear equations: xi;t =                                 i;t   t;   i 2 fA; Bg.



4    Quantifying the model

As argued above, the international …nancial market is a natural laboratory for analyzing DOO.

Therefore, we next examine the implications of DOO for various well-known empirical regularities

                                                                      19
using our model. In particular, we conduct a simulation under the objective probability measure (as

described in Subsection 2.1). From this measure, we generate 20,000 simulated paths over 50 years

with monthly time steps. Using these simulated paths, we then evaluate the ability of our model

to replicate patterns similar to the empirical regularities described in the introduction. Although

our model is too stylized to replicate these regularities precisely, Section 7 provides evidence using

empirical proxies for disagreement that are consistent with its implications. Details of the data and

simulation are explained in Appendices C and D, respectively.


4.1    Data

To provide an empirical reference for our model, we replicate basic …ndings in the literature, as

described below. This analysis requires various data series, compiled to match those used in the

literature. First, we follow the literature by measuring capital ‡ows using US net foreign equity

purchases data from the Department of Treasury. For robustness, we analyze three di¤erent versions of

these capital ‡ows: the raw measure of equity purchases corresponding to national income accounting,

this same measure scaled by lagged foreign market capitalization as in Albuquerque, Bauer, and

Schneider (2007, 2009), and the same measure scaled by lagged US investment in foreign equities

as in Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011). To compare with this most recent study,

we reconstruct the data for both sets of scaled capital ‡ows over the time period of 1980 to 2008.17

Excess returns are calculated using the corresponding set of stock market returns from Morgan Stanley

Capital International and the one-month Treasury Bill rate, all in US dollars. To provide base-line

results for the international two-factor model commonly found in the literature, we also study a set of

non-US companies that are listed in the US market, using the stock returns for these companies and

their home market returns from Data Stream. These data are also used below to reproduce standard

pricing e¤ects around cross-listing events. We focus upon the returns for these …rms because they are

easily traded across international markets and, hence, are unlikely to be a¤ected by forms of market
  17
    Data availability over this period implies a smaller set of 13 countries for the foreign market capitalization scaling
than the wider range of 42 countries for the US investment scaling. See Appendic C.1 for details.

segmentation that are unrelated to DOO such as transactions costs or capital controls.


4.2      Parameters

Table 1 summarizes our speci…c parameter assumptions. Our calibrated parameters are taken from

Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009). They in turn chose these values based upon Brennan and Xia

(2001) who considered a model of learning similar to ours but without di¤erences of opinion. To arrive

at these numbers, they considered a range of parameters for fundamentals and preferences chosen to

match key features of US data. In addition, the parameter             captures the degree to which home

residents know the home signal conveys information about the conditional home output growth rate,

but foreigners disregard. To highlight the potential e¤ects of DOO, this parameter is set at level near

one in the baseline model. We describe the potential impact of varying degrees of           in our empirical

Section 7 below.

       To evaluate the e¤ects of foreign sentiment risk, we calculate some basic unconditional moments

for asset prices, capital ‡ows, output and consumption produced by our model along with their

data counterparts. The simulated foreign sentiment model moments for asset pricing assuming both

uncorrelated output growth and a modi…ed version with output growth correlation equal to 0.5 are

reported in Panel A of Table 2. For comparison, the panel also provides the simulated model results

without sentiment and those from the data. As the table shows, our foreign sentiment model delivers

a stock return mean and volatility that is close to the data, though the mean and volatility of the

rate of interest are too high.18 Panel B of Table 2 also reports cross-country consumption growth

correlation and cross-country output growth correlation. As could be anticipated from Proposition

3, foreign sentiment lowers the unconditional consumption correlation below one, shown in Panel B.

Furthermore, when       = 0:5 the cross-country consumption growth correlation (equal to 0:3) is lower

than cross-country output growth correlation, as observed in the data. Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland

(1992) pointed out that complete-markets models have di¢ culty generating a higher cross-country
  18
    The di¢ culty of matching the moments of the interest rate are common in DOO models such as Dumas, Kurshev
and Uppal (2009).



                                                     21
correlation in output growth than in consumption growth. Clearly, our DOO model provides an

important exception due to the incorporation of foreign sentiment or belief shocks, which are e¤ectively

endogenous taste shocks making utility state dependent. These belief shocks are positively correlated

across countries but are also correlated with output shocks, since each output growth provides a signal

that is useful for the inference of both home and foreign fundamentals. The combination of these

e¤ects generates the observed consumption growth correlation, that is little a¤ected by increasing

output correlation.

    We next consider the implications for the autocorrelation in capital ‡ows using our base capital

‡ow measure and that measure scaled by market capitalization. Panel C of Table 2, shows that

these empirical autocorrelations are positive for both unscaled and scaled capital ‡ows, with the

mean and range across countries under “Data Mean” and the “Data Range”, respectively. Simi-

larly, Albuquerque, Bauer and Schneider (2007, Table 3a) estimate the autocorrelation of market

capitalization-scaled capital ‡ows for six OECD countries over an earlier period (1977:2 to 2000:3),

…nding a range from 0.16 to 0.52.

    Table 2 Panel C also reports the autocorrelation from our model for these measures. In our setup,

the international capital ‡ows –or “foreign purchases”– are interpreted as the demand of home-

country (for instance, Country B) investors for the foreign (Country A) stock valued at current

market prices SA;t           SA ;t    SA ;t dt   , as in balance-of-payments accounting.19 Scaling by foreign

market capitalization as in Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider (2007,2009) produces the change in

physical shares of the foreign equity, or           SA ;t       SA ;t dt .   As Table 2 shows, this autocorrelation is

negligible in our model, regardless of the measure and the degree of autocorrelation, showing that the
                                                        B            B
persistence in unscaled capital ‡ows SA;t               SA ;t        SA ;t dt   is entirely due to the persistence in the

price SA;t .20 Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider (2007) are able to generate persistence in capital

‡ows in a model with investor heterogeneity within a country. Here, for tractability, investors are
  19
     Recall that futures, being zero-market value securities, do not give rise to capital ‡ows. There are ‡ows of borrowing
and lending but these would be mostly the mirror image of ‡ows into equities.
  20
     One insightful referee pointed out this fact.




                                                                22
homogeneous within countries and the focus is on the heterogeneity across countries and on the role

of general equilibrium pricing. In our model, the excess volatility of the endogenous rate of interest

and the lack of persistence of capital ‡ows are part and parcel of the same defect. It would be

conceivable to introduce more persistence in the rate of interest and the capital ‡ows by modifying

the speci…cation of the processes for the signals.21 That possibility will be investigated in future

research.



5     Portfolios and capital ‡ows

5.1    The basic mechanism: foreign capital in‡ow and home return comovement

We now turn to our …rst international empirical regularity: the co-movement between stock returns

and capital ‡ows. As a number of papers have documented, capital ‡ows into countries when the stock

market experiences above average returns, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “return chasing.”22

According to the asymmetric-information model of Brennan and Cao (1997), this phenomenon occurs

because foreigners’ private signals are less informative about the home country’s stock return than

are those of the home country’s residents. As public information arrives and they see home stock

prices going up, less informed foreigners speculate that home investors see in the public signal a

con…rmation of their private signal, which must have been favorable to home stocks. Accordingly

they buy the home country’s stocks. In other words, the reason foreign, uninformed investors buy

more of the home asset is that they update their priors regarding the quality of the home asset after

positive public news about that asset.23

    In our model, the behavioral assumption is di¤erent but the logic is similar. All investors fully

observe two kinds of information: current output growth and news about the future output growth
  21
     Speci…cally, one could let the signal processes have a non-zero drift equal to the conditionally expected growth rates
of output. This additional information about the slow-moving expected growth would cause the investors’estimates of
that growth to be slower moving.
  22
     See for example, Brennan and Cao (1997), Bohn and Tesar (1996), Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000), and Brennan,
Cao, Strong and Xu (2005).
  23
     We are grateful to a referee for emphasizing this interpretation.

in the form of the signal. There is a di¤erence of perception about the latter.

       Figure 1 shows the basic mechanism graphically using our simulated data for our basic capital
                              foreign   foreign
‡ow measure: Shome,t          home,t    home,t-dt   .24 This …gure plots the median capital ‡ows and price

changes conditional on the sign of home shocks. To calculate these medians, we categorize 20,000

simulated outcomes into four di¤erent groups depending upon the home shocks signs; that is, whether

the output shock is positive “u”or negative “d”and the signal shock is positive “u”or negative “d”.

The labels in the …gure then plot the median for the speci…c subsample, where the …rst letter refers

to output shock while the second letter refers to the signal shock. For example, “ud” is the median

for all simulations when the output shock is positive dwEh o m e ;t > 0 and the signal shock is negative

 dwsEh o m e ;t < 0 . Then to see the relationship between capital ‡ows and price changes, suppose a

positive output shock occurs at home (…rst label “u”). All investors want to buy, driving the price

up; i.e., Shome,t     Shome,t-dt > 0. Half of the time this positive output shock is accompanied by a

negative home signal (second label “d”) –a fact that foreigners ignore, which leads to disagreement.

In that case, home investors are willing to sell and foreigners are able to execute their buys, increasing

capital in‡ows to home for the “ud” pair. The combination of the four label pairs clearly shows a

positive relationship between capital ‡ows and price movements, consistent with the empirical …nding.

       We further illustrate this relationship by simulating a standard regression found in the literature.

Beginning with Brennan and Cao (1997), a number of papers have regressed net purchases of foreign

equities by US investors on the foreign-market return.25 To reproduce the relationship implied by

this regression, we consider two types of regression. This …rst type follows the relationship in Figure

1 with base capital ‡ows. We use our simulations to regress foreign purchases by Country B investors
                                                                      B              B

foreign country given by the change in the stock price, SA;t        SA;t      dt .   The …rst two columns in Panel

A of Table 3, show signi…cant regression coe¢ cients of 0.575 and 0.734 from the model simulations

using our base capital ‡ow measure without and with output growth correlation, respectively.26 While

this regression relates capital ‡ows to the change in stock prices, it potentially confounds the e¤ects

of stock prices on both sides so that empirical studies typically scale the capital ‡ows with various

measures. Accordingly, for our second type of regression we use scaled capital ‡ows. Albuquerque,

Bauer, and Schneider (2007) scale by foreign market capitalization, providing a particularly useful
                                                                                        B       B

‡ows to the foreign return or, in our model, (SA;t              SA;t   dt )=SA;t dt .   The results of the Brennan-Cao

regression coe¢ cients for this version are reported in Table 3 Panel A in the columns labeled “Capital

Flows - Scaled.”27 Similar to the results with unscaled capital ‡ows, the Brennan-Cao coe¢ cients

increase with correlated output growth from 0.541 to 0.952. Intuitively, when home output is high

at the same time foreign output is high (which, with the positive correlation, happens more often

than not), foreign investors, who ignore the home signal, ascribe a higher probability that the home

conditional mean is high. Therefore, the foreign investors buy more home stocks while home residents,

using the home signal, are willing to sell. As a result, an increase in home stock price is associated

with even more foreign buying of the home stock than when output is uncorrelated.

       Despite the increase in the coe¢ cients with correlated output, all model implied regression coe¢ -

cients are within the range in Brennan and Cao (1997) of 0.12 to 5.13. Moreover, they lie within the

range of -0.02 to 1.04 using the US investment-scaled data set as well as within the range of 0.012

to 0.64 using the foreign market capitalization scaled data set. For parsimony, we report in Table 3

only the pooled regression coe¢ cients.

       As these results show, foreign sentiment generates a positive comovement between capital ‡ows

and returns. By contrast, there would be no capital ‡ows in the absence of di¤erences in perceptions of

the news content in signals, as parameterized by : Thus, the tendency to …nd a positive Brennan-Cao
  26
     Without foreign sentiment, the capital ‡ows would obviously be equal to zero, as in that case investors are identical
and hence there is no incentive for …nancial trade. Accordingly, we only present results for our model with foreign
sentiment.
  27
     As an alternative, Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011) scale capital ‡ows by wealth, and also
decompose portfolio changes by isolating changes in ‡ows that are not driven by portfolio rebalancing. In Appendix
C.3, we replicate their empirical results and show that a similar pattern holds in our simulated model.

coe¢ cient depends upon how much the investors di¤er in their interpretation of the foreign signal, a

relationship to which we return in Section 7 below.


5.2      Home-equity preference

Home-equity preference is the observation that home residents tilt their portfolios towards home

equity beyond the level suggested by standard theory.28 Explanations proposed for this preference

include non-tradeable goods or leisure, incomplete markets, and asymmetric information.

       We next show that our foreign sentiment risk model also generates home-equity preference even

though in our model all goods are tradeable, markets are fully complete, and all information is public.

       The mechanism by which equity-preference is generated in the model is one re‡ecting intertemporal

hedging and it stems from the capital-‡ow mechanism that we outlined in the previous section. Sitting

at time t; an investor knows that at time t + dt and thereafter he will revise his portfolio. He faces

re-investment risk, which is precisely the risk that intertemporal hedging is meant to alleviate, to

the extent possible. Looking at time t + dt and thereafter, this sophisticated investor is aware of the

correlation that we described in the previous subsection. He knows that, when it comes to foreign

equity, because of his information processing handicap, he will be able to buy on the occasion of a

high output shock that causes the price to be high and he will be able to sell on the occasion of a

low output shock that causes the price to be low, whereas the opposite is true for domestic equity.

For that reason, even though rates of return in equilibrium are symmetric between the two types of

equity, he knows that he will not be able to earn as much holding and revising his holdings of foreign

equity than he does doing the same with home equity. As a hedge against his handicap and as a way

to forestall this unfavorable correlation, he holds less of foreign than he does of domestic equity, while

still holding both for the sake of diversi…cation. This is true as an average across states of nature (or

across simulation paths).
  28
    An extensive literature has documented this regularity. For a few examples of studies spanning several decades,
see Grubel (1968), French and Poterba (1991), and more recently Ahearne, Griever and Warnock (2004). Lewis (1999,
2011) and Coeurdacier and Rey (2013) synthesize potential explanations.

    We use our simulated model to evaluate portfolios held by the home investor. Panels B and C of

Table 3 show the median of these holdings. The columns labeled “No foreign sentiment” show that

the median share invested abroad is equal to 50% without foreign sentiment risk. By contrast, the

simulations including foreign sentiment risk (columns “Foreign sentiment”) show a clear bias towards

greater home equity holdings. The median across paths is approximately 64% for the number of

home shares held in Panel C and between 57% to 60% for the proportion of wealth held in Panel

B. The table also shows that holdings of futures are small compared to equity holdings and that the

volume of trading in futures is less than half the volume of trading in stocks.



6     Pricing issues and …rm-level returns

6.1   Two-factor consumption CAPM

In integrated markets, risk factors are common to all securities and all securities are priced with these

same factors. In our model, with no market segmentation and with all tradeable goods, equilibrium

prices, such as Equation (20), are functions of seven state variables, each of which is driven by four

Brownian motions that in turn can be seen as having a home or a foreign dimension. Moreover,

Proposition 4 and the state price density in Equation (17) reveal that ultimately only two factors are

priced: world consumption and world average foreign sentiment. The next proposition says that our

model is consistent with a two-factor consumption CAPM.


Proposition 5 The following consumption-CAPM holds:
                                                                                !

where cW;t = cA;t + cB;t is world consumption and         W;t   (de…ned in Equation (18)) is a measure of




                                                     27

                                  W;t        B;t       A;t              B;t         B;t



       Proof. The market price of risk is obtained by applying Itô’s Lemma to the state price density,

and identifying its di¤usion vector. The CAPM risk premia are derived from the market price of risk.



       As in the standard consumption-based CAPM, a security risk premium is positively correlated

with the covariance of its return with the world consumption growth. In our model, the risk premium

is also decreasing in the covariance of the security’s return with the world average foreign sentiment.

The conditionally expected excess returns on the left-hand side of the CAPM relationship correspond

to the way in which the econometrician would collect and process data on returns.

       In empirical studies, a home risk factor often appears to be priced, in addition to a world, or

foreign, factor. Our interpretation of that fact is based on Proposition 3 above, which says that the

foreign sentiment risk of the investors in one country is conditionally perfectly correlated with the

output shock in the other country (with the sign of the perfect correlation being opposite to the sign

of current disagreement). In CAPM Equation (21), the apparent pricing of home output risk, over

and above world consumption risk, derives from its correlation with world average foreign sentiment

risk. The latter is the true unobserved risk factor.


6.2      Pricing puzzle: factor model

Much of the empirical literature on international stock returns focuses not upon a consumption-

based CAPM, but rather on the factor structure of the returns. In this literature, international …rm

returns appear to depend upon home factors as well as foreign or world factors, an observation often

interpreted as evidence for market segmentation or non-tradeable risks.29 Moreover, the beta on the
  29

(1973), Lessard (1976), Heston and Rouwenhorst (1994), Cavaglia, Brightman and Aked (2000), Cavaglia and Moroz
(2002), Brooks and Del Negro (2005, 2006), and Bekaert, Hodrick and Zhang (2009). For evidence that the factors are

home market is typically higher than that on the foreign market.

    To evaluate this relationship in our model, we now introduce a new Firm C in Country A with

an output process similar to that of A and B. The dynamics of Firm C’s output and conditional

expected output growth rate are

                                    d   C;t
                                              = fC;t dt +      dzC;t ;
                                        C;t
                                                                              f
                                     dfC;t =          fC;t     f dt +     f dzC;t ;



                 f
where zC;t and dzC;t are independent Brownian motions under the objective probability measure.

Similarly to A and B, investors also observe a signal about the output growth rate. Further assump-

tions and notational details are spelled out in Appendix E. Since …rm C is listed in Country A,

investors of Country A process properly the signal that is correlated with the output growth of …rm

C while investors of Country B ignore it.

    With this expanded model, we examine the regression relationship of individual …rm returns on

home and foreign markets using our simulated data for the uncorrelated output model.30 Speci…cally,
                                                             dSC + C dt
we regress individual Firm C’s stock excess return,             SC        rt dt, on the corresponding Country A
                      dSA + A dt
stock excess return      SA        rt dt, and Country B stock excess return, dSBS+B B dt       rt dt.31 Panel A of

Table 4 shows the results of the two factor regressions on our simulated data as well as our estimates

based upon the company return data. Without foreign sentiment, the symmetry assumed in our model

implies foreign and home factors have the same betas. However, the di¤erence of interpretation of

signals captured by       in our model generates foreign sentiment risk. When this risk is present, the

beta on the foreign factor is smaller than the beta on the home factor, the qualitative implication of

the empirical evidence. Accordingly, in Section 7 below we show empirically that the tendency for
related to market segmentation, see Bekaert and Harvey (1995), among others.
  30
     The signi…cantly greater computational burden of adding another …rm prohibits simulations for the correlated
outputs case.
  31
     The return on the stock market index of Country A would normally include …rm C: However, in our regression of
dSC + c dt
    SC
            rdt on the country A index excess return, we exclude Firm C in the index for the stock market of Country
A, as this would bias the beta against that index.

home and foreign betas to di¤er is greater for …rm returns that are more sensitive to variations in the

dispersion of forecaster’s views.


6.3      “Abnormal” cross-listing returns

Cross-listing events present another feature of international security-return behavior, often associated

with di¤ering economic perceptions across countries. At the time foreign …rms list in home markets,

the returns on equity shares of the cross-listing …rm become abnormally high relative to the market,

generally between 1:5% and 7%. On the other hand, the cost of capital is lowered. For example,

typical estimates for the cost of capital drop after cross-listing is between 0.22% and 1.3%.32 An

oft-cited explanation for these responses is that cross-listing improves information processing about

the future behavior of the …rm to investors in the home market.33

       To evaluate this pricing behavior with our model using the motivation from the literature, we

return to the three-…rms extended model above. We now compare the equilibrium in which Firm

C is listed in Country A to the equilibrium in which it is listed both in Country A and in Country

B: To capture the idea that cross-listing provides home investors with increased ability to process

information about the foreign …rm, we postulate that, once Firm C is cross-listed, investors in Country

B know how to correctly interpret the public information about Firm C. Therefore, under cross-

listing, “foreign”Country B investors now recognize that the signal process conveys information about

the home Firm C. This assumption implies that the dependence of returns on forecast disagreements

will change after …rms cross-list, a relationship we examine in Section 7.

       Using our simulated data, we calculate average “abnormal returns” due to Firm C cross listing

from Country A to Country B; as described above. Although these results simply compare the

price with and without foreign sentiment risk in Firm C, they demonstrate the e¤ects of removing
  32
     On abnormal returns and the lower cost of returns, see Hail and Leuz (2009), Sarkissian and Schill (2009) and
Gozzi, Levine and Schmukler (2008), for a few examples. Karolyi (2006) provides a survey.
  33
     For example, Co¤ee (1999, 2002) argues that the cross-listing stock prices increase because these …rms commit
to abide by the stricter reporting standards, thereby reducing investor uncertainty. Ahearne, Griever and Warnock
(2004) show that US investors are more willing to invest in …rms from countries that list on US exchanges, noting that
cross-listing provides information from these …rms that is easier to interpret.

informational uncertainty across countries, as suggested by the literature.

    The results are displayed in Panel B of Table 4. Without foreign sentiment, the abnormal returns

would obviously be equal to zero. With foreign sentiment, the model generates a mean percentage

price increase due to cross-listing equal to 4.487% for the …rm that cross-lists. This level is within the

range in the literature noted above and close to our estimated price response of 3.418%. Our model

also generates a lower cost of capital, as in the literature. In the model, the mean reduction in the

cost of capital is equal to 0.142%, somewhat lower than the range of values found empirically, but

similar to our estimate of 0.194%. Overall, the improvement in the processing of information about a

…rm’s growth prospects due to cross-listing a¤ects its price quite clearly but a¤ects its cost of capital

much less, consistent with the empirical evidence mentioned above.



7    Empirical regularities and di¤erence of opinion proxies

We have shown that DOO can potentially help explain several well-known international …nance anom-

alies both qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, additional information might be found by look-

ing at empirical evidence about DOO. Although directly testing our model is precluded by its highly

stylized nature, we can examine indirect evidence by noting that countries presumably face varying

degrees of DOO about the information content in news, captured in our model by . For some coun-

tries and …rms, opinions about the information content in news may be rather unanimous, while for

others there may be more disagreement. As such, our model suggests we should …nd greater evidence

of …nancial anomalies for countries and …rms that are more sensitive to di¤erences in information

processing.

    Therefore, in this section, we empirically investigate some relationships predicted by our model

using proxies for these di¤erences. We begin by describing these measures and relationships before

turning to the results.




                                                   31
7.1     Data and Model Relationships

To proxy for DOO about future economic activity, we use data based upon professional forecasters.

We conjecture that these forecasters likely have common information so that disagreements about

macroeconomic predictions result from di¤erences of opinion.34 In the empirical analysis, we study

three sets of variables. The …rst set is the di¤erence between the 75th and 25th percentile of forecasts

for US GDP and investment growth, both residential and non-residential, from the Survey of Pro-

fessional Forecasters (SPF). Although these data only provide forecasts for the US, the forecasters

are individuals and institutions from various countries, thereby providing a range of international

views.35 A second proxy for di¤ering opinions is the variance of the SPF individual forecasts for

the four-quarter-ahead GDP growth, a variable analyzed by Bansal and Shaliastovich (2010) and

Shaliastovich (2015). The third set of variables includes the “sentiment risk indices” proposed by

Baker and Wurgler (2006) for the cross-section of US data and Baker, Wurgler and Yuan (2006) for

global data. Unlike our other measures, these variables need not directly relate to disagreements, but

we include them since they have been associated with sentiment risk in the literature. Although these

various measures likely capture di¤erent e¤ects arising from disagreements, we collectively call these

measures “DOO proxies” below for simplicity.

      Using these proxies, we can then ask whether relationships suggested from the model are borne out

by the data. Accordingly we examine relationships based upon three of the regularities in the model.36

The …rst relationship is that countries with capital ‡ows that are more sensitive to DOO have a higher

Brennan-Cao coe¢ cient. That is, as noted in Section 5, countries with greater di¤erences in views

about the information content of news arising from higher               generate greater co-movement between

capital in‡ows and returns. The second suggested empirical relationship is that …rms with returns

that are more sensitive to di¤ering opinions have a greater di¤erence between their home and foreign

betas. We showed in Section 6.2 that di¤erences in processing the foreign signal generated a wedge
 34
    We are grateful to Geert Bekaert for emphasizing this point to us.
 35
    We focus upon the US data because similar measures for other countries have an insu¢ cient number of observations.
 36
    We have insu¢ cient annual observations to econometrically analyze the fourth regularity, “home-equity preference.”



                                                         32
between home and foreign betas so, conversely, …rm returns that face no disagreements should have

no such wedge. The third empirical relationship arises from our model conjecture in Section 6.3 that

cross-listing changes the way in which the investors in the newly listed market view the cross-listed

company, implying a shift in information processing. If so, the e¤ects on …rm returns due to di¤ering

views about public information should change after cross-listing. We next examine empirical evidence

of these three relationships.


7.2    Empirical Evidence

To consider the …rst empirical relationship, we ask how capital ‡ow responses would di¤er across

countries depending upon their sensitivity to DOO proxies. For this purpose, we …rst establish

whether proxies help explain capital ‡ows with the following regressions: N Pti = ai0 + ai1 Dt + uit ,

and N Pti = ai0 + ai1 Dt + ai2 Rmt
                                i + ei , where N P i are scaled U.S. net purchases of equity of country
                                     t            t
                                i
i, Dt are the DOO proxies, and Rmt is the market return of country i, all at time t. Studying the

e¤ects of Brennan-Cao coe¢ cients across countries requires a cross-section of countries. Therefore,

for this analysis we focus upon net purchases scaled by US holdings of foreign securities as in Curcuru,

Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011) because a wider cross-section of 42 countries is available

with this scaling. These initial regressions verify that the coe¢ cients on DOO measures, ai1 , are

generally signi…cantly di¤erent from zero (not reported for parsimony).

    For each DOO proxy, we then sort countries into three groups based upon the absolute value of

their country-speci…c a1 coe¢ cients.37 The absolute value captures the possibility that the capital

in‡ows of some countries may be positively related to the DOO proxy while for others the capital

in‡ows may be negatively related, but any deviation from zero generates exposure. Using these

groups, we run a pooled regression of their capital in‡ows on their respective market returns. Panel

A of Table 5 reports the coe¢ cients on the market returns, that is, their Brennan-Cao coe¢ cients,
  37
     The paper reports the results for regressions with DOO proxies alone although including returns as independent
variables gave similar results.




                                                        33
where each column provides the sort on a di¤erent DOO proxy.38 Notably, the average response of

capital ‡ows to equity market return increases for countries with greater sensitivity to DOO proxies.

For example, using GDP forecasts, the Brennan-Cao coe¢ cient for the “Low jab1 j” country group is

only 0.005 while that of the “High jab1 j” country group is 0.096. A similar pattern can be seen for

almost all the other proxies. Thus, consistent with the …rst relationship suggested by our model, the

countries with capital ‡ows that are more sensitive to opinion dispersion are also the countries with

capital ‡ows that are more sensitive to domestic returns.

       We next consider the second empirical relationship suggested by the model. Since the presence

of di¤ering opinions in our model generates a wedge between home and foreign betas, conversely,

…rms with no sensitivity to forecast dispersion should have no di¤erence between these betas. To

evaluate this possibility, we run initial time series CAPM regressions of the excess returns Rit for
                                                                                     Home and
each of our non-US …rms on the excess returns of the home and foreign (US) markets, Rmt
 U S , respectively, and on the DOO proxies as in: R =
Rmt                                                                                 Home +          US
                                                    it               0+       Home Rmt         U S Rmt +   D Dt + ut :We

then conduct a cross-sectional regression of j                                      39
                                                        Home       USj   on j   D j.     Panel B of Table 5 reports the

results of this regression showing that the coe¢ cient is indeed positive across all measures. Thus, as

suggested by the model, …rms with higher sensitivity to di¤ering views about the information content

in news also have higher deviations between home and foreign betas.

       The third relationship from our framework is that the e¤ects of disagreements on …rm returns

change after cross-listing. To estimate this change, we follow the literature by regressing the foreign

company excess returns on the “Foreign”(US) market and the “Home”market and interacting these

variables with a dummy after the cross-listing event.40 In other words, we run regressions of the form:

Rit = bP RE Rmt + bP OST Rmt It + bPDRE Dt + bPDOST Dt It +              t,   where Rmt is the vector of Home and
  38
     We also examined the robustness of these results along several dimensions including di¤erent time periods, using
a smaller subsample of countries also studied by Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011), and using lagged
returns as regressors, …nding a similar pattern in all these cases.
  39
     Our larger data set of over 500 …rms allows this cross-sectional regression while the shorter data set of 42 countries
precluded this possibility for capital ‡ows above. Note that the standard errors from these cross-sectional regressions
should be viewed with caution because they ignore the sampling error in the …rm level time-series regressions.
  40
     See, for example, Foerster and Karolyi (1999) and Sarkissian and Schill (2009). The latter paper provides a
breakdown of the periods into a pre- and post-listing steady state, as in our analysis.



                                                            34
Foreign market factors, bP RE and bP OST are the factor loadings and It is a dummy variable equal to

one if the period is after cross-listing and equal to zero otherwise. In these regressions, the empirical

relationship suggested by our framework would mean a change in sensitivity to DOO measures, that

is: bPDOST       bPDRE 6= 0.

         Table 5 Panel C reports the estimates for the coe¢ cients on the DOO variables.41 Given in

the row labeled “Before: bPDRE ”, the coe¢ cient estimates on Dt prior to cross-listing are generally

insigni…cantly di¤erent from zero. Consistent with the suggested model relationship, the row labeled

“Change: bPDOST          bPDRE ” indeed shows a signi…cant change in this coe¢ cient after cross-listing for

most of the DOO variables.



8         Conclusions

By allowing international investors to di¤er in their interpretation of home and foreign public infor-

mation, we showed that four regularities in international …nance can be at least partially explained:

(i) the co-movement of returns and international capital ‡ows; (ii) home-equity preference; (iii) the

dependence of …rm returns on home and foreign factors; and (iv) abnormal returns around foreign

…rm cross-listing in the home market. We also analyzed how di¤erences in forecasts relate to the

regularities across countries and …rms, …nding evidence consistent with our model.

         Overall, our model clearly demonstrates the e¤ects of di¤ering opinion across countries. According

to that viewpoint, if someone asked: “What is a foreigner?”, our answer would be: “A foreign

investor is one who interprets news about home …rms less correctly than home investors do.”Because

of this behavioral phenomenon, risk and risk premia are created over and beyond the risk of the

fundamentals, by the risk that the opinions of investors living in di¤erent countries will in the future

diverge from each other.




    41
   The estimated factor loadings re‡ect standard …ndings in the literature such as an increase in betas on the US
market and little or no change on the beta from the …rm’s home market. Therefore, they are subsumed for parsimony.

    In a “one-tree”version of our economy, Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009), following Yan (2008),

show that, by assuming that risk aversion 1                is a positive integer (which can be true only when

investors have risk aversion greater than or equal to 1) and using the binomial theorem, the moment

function of outputs and sentiment is enough for obtaining prices and portfolios. While this property

is useful in our setup, our problem is further complicated by the fact that the state price density (see
                                                                                                                 1
Equation (17)), in our model, contains a power of the sum of two outputs: (                 A;t   +     B;t )        . To see

why this complicates our problem, note that, since investors are risk averse,                   1 < 0; the binomial

theorem cannot be used to expand that term. Clearly, obtaining exact solutions for the stock prices

and portfolio choice is more challenging in our “two-trees” setup.

    The moment generating function in Proposition 6 contains precisely these types of elements, and

can be used to obtain stock prices and wealths.

     Because the system of state variables                                       bE bE             bij ; gbji

quadratic class, we can obtain the solution of this PDE from the solution of a simpler system of

ODEs (see Cheng and Scaillet (2007)). Moreover, because of the block-diagonal structure of the

di¤usion matrix of the state variables (as shown in Section 2.3), we obtain the solution in closed-

form, as shown in the remainder of this proof.

Therefore, we can split the required moment function into the product of two separate ones, one for

each subset of independent state variables. Since the dynamics of the state variables in each of these

groups are similar to those in Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009), and since the object is also the

same as in that paper, we obtain a very similar result:

In this section we show how to solve our model when outputs are correlated across countries. To

introduce output correlation symmetrically, we posit that the stochastic process for                                                        i;t   (i 2 fA; Bg)

empirical realizations of the process. The dynamics of the conditional growth rates fi;t of outputs

and of the signals under the true measure remain exactly the same as in Equations (2) and (3),

respectively.

quadratic class, we can obtain the solution of this PDE from the solution of a simpler system of ODEs

(see Cheng and Scaillet (2007)). With output correlations, however, the di¤usion matrix of the state

variables does not have a block diagonal structure, and the solution of the system of ODEs, while

in principle available in closed form, becomes complicated and is more quickly obtained numerically.

Our solution is still explicit, and it is exact up to the numerical solution of a Riccati system of ODEs,

which can be obtained at arbitrarily high precision in Mathematica.



C     Data Description

In this appendix we describe the data employed in the text. These data are used for two purposes:

(a) to provide the summary measures of empirical regularities for the simulated model in Sections 4,

5, and 6; and (b) to consider how those regularities relate to various market disagreement proxies in

Section 7.


C.1    Summary Measures for Model Comparison

The means and standard deviations of the asset pricing moments in Panel A of Table 2 are calculated

using the same aggregate US market equity return and US Treasury bill data over the same time

period as recent capital ‡ow analysis in the literature, described below. In particular, equity is the

Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index for the U.S., and the interest rate is the

one-month T-bill rate from Data Stream, both series from 1980 to 2008.

    The capital ‡ow data used to estimate the autocorrelations and regressions in, respectively, Panel

C of Table 2 and Panel A of Table 3 are from the U.S. Treasury data base. We consider three di¤erent

versions of capital ‡ows: (a) U.S. net purchases of foreign equities; (b) U.S. net equity purchases scaled

by beginning of period foreign market capitalization as in Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider (2007,

2009), and (c) U.S. net equity purchases scaled by beginning of period holdings of foreign securities

by U.S. investors following Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011). For analysis with set

                                                       46
(b), we use the six non-US countries considered by Albuquerque, Bauer, and Schneider (2007) along

with another seven countries for which we have a full set of net equity purchases and foreign market

capitalization over the full period. Scaling the data in this way provides capital ‡ows from the follow-

ing thirteen countries: Austria, Australia, Canada, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, France, Great

Britain, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Africa. For the set (c) results, we use the

42 countries in Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2011). These monthly measures of net

equity purchases combine low frequency positions from security-level surveys with higher frequency

‡ow data. The set of countries for this scaling is: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,

Canada, Chile, Columbia, Czech Republic, Denmark. Finland, France. Germany, Great Britain,

Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mex-

ico, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South

Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey. Much of the general results in the

paper were also estimated using the smaller 20 country set analyzed by Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock

and Wongswan (2011) yielding similar results.

       The Brennan-Cao regressions in Panel A of Table 3 and Section 7 also require market returns

for each country. For this purpose, we construct a data set of foreign returns using Morgan Stanley

Capital International Total Return Indices for the country markets, all measured in US dollars. To

be consistent with the main …ndings of the more recent Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan

(2011) study, these data are analyzed over the period 1980 to 2008.

       The foreign stock returns analyzed in the two-factor CAPM regressions in Panel A of Table 4

and the cross-listing statistics in Panel B of Table 4 are the set of foreign company returns traded

on US exchanges. In order to provide returns with su¢ cient liquidity as well as time series data,

we chose the set of foreign companies traded in the US by 2004 on the NYSE or NASDAQ, a …lter

that provides 576 potential …rms.42 The returns were calculated from the Data Stream International

Total Return Indices in US dollars for each of these …rms as well as for their home markets. For the
  42
    Speci…cally, these foreign stocks are traded either as American Depositary Receipts or are directly listed on the
exchanges as in the case of Canadian companies.

analysis based upon pre- and post-cross-listing, we dropped …rms with fewer than 52 observations

before cross-listing, resulting in 311 …rms for that analysis. The constituent companies and their

cross-listing dates were obtained from the three custodian banks for the ADRs and from Doidge,

Karolyi, and Stulz (2004) for the Canadian …rms. To provide a standard benchmark using the DOO

measures described below, we conducted our …rm level analysis from 1980 to the beginning of 2010,

when the US Sentiment Index data ends.


C.2    Di¤erence of Opinion Measures

In Section 7, we considered the relationship between some regularities and various DOO measures

used in the literature. The …rst two sets are calculated from the Survey of Professional Forecasters

(SPF) database. The other set of measures are the Sentiment Risk Indices based upon the …rst

principal components of a number of variables considered to capture US investor sentiment by Baker

and Wurgler (2006) and global investor sentiment by Baker, Wurgler, and Yuan (2012). For each of

these variables, we use the data over the available time period, although their frequencies vary. The

U.S. sentiment indices are monthly and available through 2010. However, the Global Sentiment Index

is annual and ends in 2005. For this proxy, therefore, we generate a monthly series using the annual

sentiment data following the steps in Yu (2013).


C.3    Active Portfolio Reallocation Measures

The positive coe¢ cients on foreign returns from capital ‡ow regressions have been called “return chas-

ing”by Bohn and Tesar (1997), among others. However, Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock and Wongswan

(2011) note that this positive relationship may simply re‡ect a passive increase in the value of foreign

assets when their returns increase. They address this possibility by isolating the change in the port-

folio allocation in foreign equities that result from active changes in share holdings, an approach also

taken by Hau and Rey (2008). When they regress these active portfolio reallocations on returns, they

…nd on-average much lower coe¢ cients that are generally insigni…cant from zero. To investigate this



                                                   48
possibility, we calculate the “active portfolio reallocations” speci…ed in Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock

and Wongswan (2011) as43

                                                               B                                  B
                                                 SA;t          SA ;t                  SA;t        SA ;t dt
  Active Portfolio Reallocations =                B                    B              B                      B
                                                                                                                        :
                                         SA;t     SA ;t   + SB;t       SB ;t   SA;t   SA ;t dt   + SB;t      SB ;t dt


Thus, the active reallocation is the change in the value of foreign portfolio shares owned by Country

B investors, due to changes in equity holdings and not in prices.

       To determine whether our model captures the relationship found by Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock

and Wongswan (2011), we simulate this variable in the uncorrelated and correlated output growth

versions of our model. We …nd that the coe¢ cient on Active Portfolio Reallocations is closer to

zero than the corresponding coe¢ cient on foreign returns alone, for both correlated and uncorrelated

output models. This …nding re‡ects a more muted relationship between active portfolio reallocation

and returns, than for total foreign purchases, consistent with the Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock and

Wongswan (2011) results. Moreover, the coe¢ cients on Active Portfolio Reallocations are not signi…-

cantly di¤erent from zero as in Curcuru, Thomas, Warnock and Wongswan (2011). Overall, therefore,

our highly stylized model is remarkably consistent with two co-occurring …ndings in the literature

about capital ‡ows - a positive Brennan-Cao coe¢ cient and little-to-no response in Active Portfolio

Reallocations.



D        Non-stationarity and simulation

Stationarity. Existing studies on the survival of irrational traders ask whether excessively pessimistic

or optimistic agents survive in the long run in an economy in which one population of agents knows the

true probability distribution. These studies include Kogan, Ross, Wang and Wester…eld (2006), Yan

(2008) and Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009). These studies conclude that, although “irrational”

traders do not survive in the long-run, they disappear very slowly, in terms of consumption shares.
  43
    CTWW only consider the share of equities as a proportion of foreign equities. In our two country model, we use
the same concept to consider foreign equities as a proportion of all equities, in this case home and abroad.


                                                          49
In our model, both types of investors are symmetrically undercon…dent about the foreign signals. It

is not obvious ex-ante, therefore, whether the equilibrium we have obtained is stationary or not.

   To throw some light on the issue, we obtain, as in Dumas, Kurshev and Uppal (2009), the proba-

bility distribution of the future Country A’s consumption share (! u ) under the objective probability

measure, by Fourier Inversion of the characteristic function of the ratio of foreign sentiments         A
                                                                                                            .
                                                                                                        B

Figure 2 plots the probability density function of ! u for di¤erent initial values ! t . The left panel

displays the case in which Country A’s consumption share is currently smaller (! t = 0:25) and the

right panel displays the case in which both countries’s consumption shares are currently the same

(! t = 0:5). We see from this …gure that, independently of the current relative consumption shares,

as time passes, the probability distribution expands to the edges, exhibiting non-stationarity of the

consumption shares. But it does so rather slowly.

   Details of the simulation analysis. Using monthly time steps, we perform an exact simulation

of the state variables           bE bE bB ; gbA
                         A ; B ; fA ; fB ; g       for which exact transition probability distributions are
                                            A B

known. For variables (   A; B ) ;   we rely on a simple Euler-Maruyama discretization. We sometimes

get outlier paths. Prompted by a referee, we have veri…ed that these are legitimate observations and

not the result of simulation errors. To con…rm that, we have gradually reduced the time step of

the simulation (down from one year to 1/32 of a year) and observed no change in the histograms

of any of the state variables. We have also found no systematic increase or decrease in the Min or

the Max of any of them. The referee provided the rationale for these outliers being actually part of

the solution: “Consider the process for disagreement described in Equation (12). The public shock

decreases disagreement because        >   E.   But a high    also increases mean reversion in disagreement

accelerating the decrease in disagreement. Therefore, periods of high disagreement that are followed

by output news that everyone follows, may look like outliers.”

   Although these paths occur very rarely, statistics calculated across paths that involve portfolio

choices are sensitive to them. For that reason, we resort to robust statistics whenever portfolio choices

are involved. This choice is also made, for example, by Beeler and Campbell (2012).



                                                      50
       While the simulation is conducted under the objective probability measure (as in Subsection 2.1),

the comparison of simulated data with empirical results remains a delicate exercise because of the

non-stationarity of our model. As a way of alleviating the problem created by the non-stationarity

of our model, we take several precautions. First, to obtain moments that are as little dependent on

initial conditions as possible, or to approach unconditional moments, we run the simulations over as

long a span of time as we can a¤ord. We chose T = 50 years (600 monthly observations).44 Second,

we draw many paths, namely 20,000 paths. Third, we split these 20,000 paths into …ve subsamples,

and use di¤erent sets of initial values for the state variables in each subsample. Fourth, we compute

moments across paths at the terminal points of the simulation. Moments calculated across paths are

valid representations of the behavior of the model, whether or not the model is stationary.

       We verify that the frequency distribution of the consumption share obtained from the simulation

for the 50-year horizon closely matches the theoretical probability distribution shown in Figure 2.

       We are careful to impose symmetry between the two markets A and B.45 And, when we introduce

the third …rm C, we run the simulation in such a way that A and B remain symmetric in their joint

relationship with C. In this way, we have a clean no-foreign-sentiment benchmark when we examine

the empirical regularities.



E        A cross section

As indicated in the text, let there be one …rm listed in Country B, which we call Firm B; and let there

be two …rms listed in Country A, which we call Firm A and Firm C. Under the objective probability

measure, the outputs of Firms A and B are as they were before but we now introduce the output of

the new Firm C as
                                           d   C;t

     Although we run the model over 50 years, the economic agents in our simulation have an in…nite horizon, not a

     For more precision in the means and medians, we have also used the technique of antithetic variates.

where zC;t is an independent Brownian motion under the objective probability measure, which governs

empirical realizations of the process.

   The conditional expected growth rate fC;t of output is also stochastic:


                                                                       f
                                   dfC;t =    f    fC;t dt +       f dzC;t :




   As before, all investors must estimate, or …lter out, the current value of fi;t and its future behavior.

They do so by observing the current cash ‡ows and the three public signals (sA ; sB ; sC ) The signal
                  f
correlated with dzC;t evolves according to

       s is a Brownian motion, under the objective probability measure as well. All the Brownian
where zC

motions are independent from each other.

   Investors in Country A (where …rms A and C are listed) perform their …ltering under the belief

that the signals sA and sC have the correct correlation with fA and fC ; but they believe incorrectly

that the signal sB has zero correlation with fB ; which means that they ignore the information about

the …rms listed in the other country. The “model” they have in mind for this signal, in addition to

those for the signal processes of A and B in Equation (7), posits that the dynamics of the signal

process of C are those given in Equation (22).

   Investors in Country B (where Firm B is listed) perform their …ltering under the belief that the

signal sB has the correct correlation with fB ; but they believe incorrectly that the signals sA and

sC have zero correlation with fA and fC , which means that they ignore the information about the

      By following exactly the same steps as in Section 2, we can show that the vector of exogenous

state variables under the reference measure of the econometrician is given by the Markovian system

comprised of Equations (4), (6), (12) and (14), to which we now add the following three analogous

equations for Firm C’s output, expected conditional growth rate, and disagreement, respectively:



                          d   C;t
                                        = fbC;t

                                                                                                               f dwsC ;t ;



and the new change from the measure of investor B to that of the econometrician eB;t :

                                            deB;t             1      B
                                                  =                gbA;t             B
                                                                         dwEA ;t + gbC;t dwEC ;t :
                                            eB;t



      Therefore, we get an extended vector of ten exogenous state variables which drive the economy:
                                                                                                 |

                       A;t B;t ; B;t ; fB;t ; gB;t A;t ; c;t ; fc;t ; gC;t C;t                       where     C   is de…ned as:


                                                      d   C;t             1      B
                                                                   =           gbC;t dwEC ;t ;
                                                          C;t


so that eB;t =      B;t         C;t .   The structure is very similar to that of our two-…rm model of Section 2.




                                                                          53
But there is now a third system YC;t where

                                                n                                   oT
                                       YC;t =             bE bB ;

   Therefore this system can be written as


                                                                                E

                                                                                         7

   Thus, the state vector can be evaluated as three independent sets of processes. For instance, the

full vector of twelve state variables Yet can be written as


                                             dY~t = et dt + ~ t d!

where ~ t is still block diagonal, a property we exploit again in seeking the equilibrium in this extended

model.

   In this setting we now have six di¤erent Brownian motions. Hence we need seven linearly inde-

pendent securities in order to complete the market. Since we intend to replicate a regression of a

…rm stock excess return on a home country stock excess return and a foreign country stock excess

return, we choose our menu of securities accordingly. In particular we consider three stocks: (i) a

stock SC which is a claim on the output of Firm C (       C );   (ii) a stock SA;C which is a claim on the

output of Firm A, taken to represent the equity market of Country A (       A );   and (iii) a stock SB which

is a claim on the foreign output   B.   As in Section 3, we complete the market with a locally riskless,

instantaneously maturing bond deposit and three zero-net supply futures contracts whose prices are

marked to the ‡uctuations of the three signal shocks, and are designed to hedge these shocks only.

zero (in parenthesis), and R2 from regressions of capital ‡ows on foreign returns in the data and in
the model using robust least squares (MM estimation). Capital ‡ows are measured both as foreign
net purchases of equity and as active portfolio reallocations. Panel B shows the value of home stock
held as a proportion of wealth, for the model simulations and for the data. Panel C gives the median
value generated by the model for asset holdings by the home investor and for changes in his holdings
of each asset class. For the home investor, the panel reports the median number of home and foreign
equity shares and the median number of home and foreign futures held. The table also gives the
median of the absolute value of changes in his holdings of each asset class, as measures of the stock
and futures trading volumes.

Table 5: Regularities and DOO Proxies. Panel A reports coe¢ cients from pooled Brennan-Cao
regressions where country groups are sorted by Low, Medium, and High absolute values of a1 , from
initial time series regressions by country given by: N Pti = ai0 + ai1 Dt + uit , where N Pti represents
US net purchases of country i, and Dt is a proxy for DOO at time t. Panel B reports estimates
from cross-sectional regressions of the absolute value of the di¤erence between home and foreign (US)
coe¢ cients on the absolute value of the DOO proxy coe¢ cients. The data are based upon initial
time series regressions of individual …rm returns on their respective home and foreign returns and
DOO proxies that provide the cross-sectional series of coe¢ cients on home and US markets, de…ned
as Home and U S , respectively. Panel C reports coe¢ cients on DOO proxies in regressions of non-US
stock returns on a constant, their home market return, on the foreign (US) market return, and on
various proxies, all pre- and post- cross-listing in the US market. In all panels, the DOO proxies
are: the di¤erence between the 75th and 25th percentile of forecasts for US GDP, Non-Residential
Investment, (NR INV), and Residential Investment (R INV); the variance of GDP forecasts (V GDP);
and the US and Global Sentiment Indices (US Sent and G Sent, respectively). Standard errors are
in parenthesis.     indicates signi…cant at 5% MSL, and indicates signi…cant at 10% MSL.
