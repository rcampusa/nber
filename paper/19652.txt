                                             ABSTRACT

It is well understood that investment serves as a shock absorber at the time of crisis. The duration of
the drag on investment, however, is perplexing. For the nine Asian economies we focus on in this
study, average investment/GDP is about 6 percentage points lower during 1998-2012 than its average
level in the decade before the crisis; if China and India are excluded, the estimated decline exceeds
9 percent. We document how in the wake of crisis home bias in finance usually increases markedly
as public and private sectors look inward when external financing becomes prohibitively costly, altogether
impossible, or just plain undesirable from a financial stability perspective. Also, previous studies have
not made a connection between the sustained reserve accumulation and the persistent and significantly
lower levels of investment in the region. Put differently, reserve accumulation involves an official
institution (i.e., the central bank) funneling domestic saving abroad and thus competing with domestic
borrowers in the market for loanable funds. We suggest a broader definition of crowding out, driven
importantly by increased “liability” home bias in finance and by official capital outflows. We present
evidence from Asia to support this interpretation.

        The literature on early warnings of financial crises generally singles out overvalued currencies, widening

current account deficits, large capital inflows, rising leverage, and low and declining international reserves as

precursors to disaster.1 These patterns have been prevalent in innumerable emerging market crises and (with the

exception of depleted international reserves) were also prevalent in most of the recent financial crises in the

advanced economies. Indeed, as Gourinchas and Obstfeld (2012) document, the most notable difference between

the emerging markets and advanced economies is that the output declines during currency crisis are larger in

emerging markets, while other patterns are qualitatively similar.


        Faced with a sudden stop à la Calvo, (1998), current account deficits can no longer be financed by

borrowing from abroad—at least not to the same extent.2 Sharp output declines, private and sometimes public

debt overhangs, and the scarcity and high cost of finance combine to produce dramatic swings in the current

account balance, most often from deficit to surplus. The brunt of this adjustment usually falls on investment.3


        The Asian crisis of 1997-1998 was most acute in Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and

Thailand. Yet, in 1998, investment as a share of GDP fell across the board in the major Asian economies, from

wealthy Japan and Singapore to lower income India and China, which were relatively shielded from the crisis. In

Indonesia, the investment-GDP ratio was nearly halved falling from 32 percent in 1997 to 17 percent the

following year.


        The decline in investment-GDP ratios among the advanced economies since 2007 has been no less

draconian, if somewhat more spread out. From 2007 to 2012, Ireland’s investment-GDP ratio fell 15 percentage

points. Even countries with continued access to international capital markets, such as the United Kingdom and the

United States, have recorded declines of around 3½ percentage points over that time frame.

        While it is not difficult to understand the role of investment as a shock absorber at the time of crisis, it is

perplexing why it takes so many years after the crisis to recover--if it recovers at all. For the nine Asian

economies we focus on in this study, average investment/GDP is about 6 percentage points lower during 1998-

2012 than its average level in the decade before the crisis; if China and India are excluded, the estimated decline

exceeds 9 percent.4 Over the same pre- and post-crisis sample the decline in growth is 2.5 percent for all countries

and 3.3 percent if China and India are excluded. 5


        A prolonged investment slump is not a new phenomenon following a deep crisis. Kaminsky and Pereira

(1996), who focus on explaining the poor growth performance of Latin America vis à vis Asia during the crisis of

the 1980s, show that public and private consumption as a share of GDP rose more than 5 percentage points in

Latin America during 1982 to 1988 while for the Asian economies the comparable ratio fell by almost 2

percentage points. With public and private saving rates falling sharply in Latin America, current account deficits

were closed by even larger declines in investment. The evidence they provide supports Sachs’ (1989) earlier

observation that the significant income inequality in Latin America, coupled with rising political instability, were

at the root of Latin American governments inability to implement austerity measures at the time of crisis. The

same factors also made downward adjustments in private consumption less likely. In that episode, at least,

investment was importantly crowded out by a rising share of public and private consumption.6 Though not

discussed by these authors, we would add that the decline in measured domestic saving was also significantly

exacerbated by leakages to the domestic system in the form of private capital flight, which escalated in the region

to record highs.7

  The countries are: China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.
5
  This growth comparison, showing lower growth during the era of high reserves is not at odds with the finding in Bussiere et
al (2013) that emerging markets with higher reserves performed better (in terms of output) during the global financial crisis
of 2008-2009. The period we are comparing spans 26 years (11 years through 1997 and 1998 to 2012); our focus is on the
long–term growth performance.
6
  In the Kaminsky and Pereira (1996) sample, public and private consumption increases (as a share of GDP) were of
comparable magnitudes.

  See Claessens, (1997) for a comprehensive analysis of the capital flight magnitudes involved.




                                                              2
        Unlike Latin America in the 1980s (or modern-day United States), post-1997 Asia is a region of high- to-

very-high domestic saving rates. The significant economic inequality issues that continue to plague Latin America

are not a feature of the region (notwithstanding China’s increasing troubles on that front). There is little to

suggest private capital flight has been an issue in the past decade. Hence, it is unlikely that the many of factors

that drove the investment slump during Latin America’s lost decade have been at work in Asia on a similar scale

in the past 15 years. And yet, countries in both regions (in the case of Latin America more driven by necessity)

turned inward for financing sources in the post crisis era.


        In this paper, we aim to shed light on some of the factors that may account for the sharp and sustained

decline in investment as a share of GDP in many Asian countries since the events of 1997-1998. While the

evidence does not support “one size fit all” explanations, the topic may have broader resonance within and outside

Asia. China and India (for different reasons) may be in the cusp of a significant investment correction; other large

emerging markets (Brazil, South Africa, and others) may be similarly placed; and much of Europe and the US are

entering their fifth or sixth year of an investment slump.


        It is not our goal to offer a comprehensive model of the determinants of investment nor do we compare

actual investment ratios to some optimal benchmark. Supply-side hysteresis effects of financial crises are not

explored. Young (1995)’s hypothesis that the East Asian growth miracle may have well been “primarily the result

of one-shot increases in output brought about by the rise in participation rates, investment to GDP ratios, and

educational standards and the intersectoral transfer of labor from agriculture to other sectors (e.g. manufacturing)

with higher value added per worker” may be a primary explanation for the slowdown. But the fact remains that

the Philippines and Japan (which were at very phases of the development cycle) have experienced sustained and

sharp declines in investment as well. As we discuss here, all these countries also experienced a shift in policy that

importantly significantly altered the allocation of domestic saving.

        We focus on finance and examine trends that affect the availability of domestic funding for investment

and the allocation of the pool of domestic saving. The old concepts of leakages and crowding out, which we re-

define here to be more encompassing than the conventional definitions, are central to our analysis.

                                                             3
           In the wake of crisis, home bias in finance usually increases markedly as governments look inward when

external financing becomes prohibitively costly or altogether impossible. Even in milder cases, when capital

market access is not lost, governments may seek the relative stability of captive domestic audiences, such as

pension funds, insurance companies and domestic banks to lessen roll over risk.8 This post-crisis pattern is not

unique to Asia; it was prevalent in acute form in Latin America during the 1980s and it is also a feature of the

post-crisis landscape in Europe, especially (but not exclusively) in the periphery economies. In cases where the

government is running substantial deficits and/or rolling over a large stock of debt, these activities would fall

under the conventional definition of crowding out. Japan and India, in different dimensions, are examples where

this channel may be at work. However, most of the remaining Asian economies do not have particularly high

levels of public debt nor are they financing large sustained fiscal deficits. This leads to a second (related)

financing leakages channel.


           The rise of home bias in Asia has not been symmetric. Acquiring liabilities to the rest of the world

(ROW) is avoided while acquiring assets (reserves) from the ROW is actively pursued. But the acquisition of

assets is selective, favoring safe low yield assets; the accumulation of these assets is not left in the hands of the

private sector, but orchestrated by the official sector via the central banks. The desire to keep a tight lid on current

account deficits and encourage surpluses has translated into an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves on an

unprecedented scale. A good deal has been written on the subject, but on the motives for holding reserves, we

broadly concur with the interpretation offered in Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010):

        “That a primary reason for a central bank to hold reserves is to protect the domestic banking sector, and
domestic credit markets more broadly, while limiting external currency depreciation. The need for such
protection increases given the multiplication of risks in more financially open economies, where potential
currency mismatches and a combination of internal drains (runs from bank deposits to currency) and external
drains (flight to foreign currency or banks) can place extraordinary demands on a central bank’s foreign
exchange reserves.

Supporting this view, we sketch in this paper a slice of Asia’s history with credit events (or near-credit events)

and quantify the lack of adequate reserve cover at these critical moments, which (not surprisingly) has given rise

to the insurance motive described above.9 However, we would add that fear of floating is not asymmetric, and

that leaning against the wind of an appreciation has been an important driver of reserve accumulation after the

2007-2009 financial crisis.10


         A related literature has attempted to model reserve accumulation via a precautionary motive on the part of

households or investors (Caballero and Krishnamurthy, 2009 and Carroll and Jeanne, 2009) but this misses the

point that the acquisition of foreign asses both in timing and magnitude are determined by the central bank (i.e.,

the official sector) . A framework closer to the motivation of a central concerned about possible runs is offered

in Aizenman and Lee (2006). As of mid-2013, according to the Federal Reserve Data about 72 percent of the US

Treasuries held abroad are in the hands of official institutions. Furthermore, Warnock and Warnock’s (2009)

careful study of this phenomenon point out that the reported figures significantly understate actual official

holdings, as oil exporters and other central banks and governments purchase US Treasuries through offshore

centers. The dominant role played by official entities in uphill capital flows is also extensively documented in

Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and Volosovych (2013).


         Some studies have stressed the social costs associated with this policy, which is closer to our theme in this

paper. Rodrik (2006) focused on the income loss associated with acquiring assets that deliver a lower yield than

the interest cost of borrowing abroad. Mohanty and Turner (2006) went further, suggesting that sustained reserve

accumulation fuels domestic credit booms, asset price bubbles, and introduces distortions in the banking system.

Filardo and Yetman (2012) provide further evidence on those concerns and suggest compelling reasons why the

taxes often associated with sterilized intervention can funnel activity in to the riskier and nebulous world of

shadow banking.11 Jeanne (2012), who connects the accumulation of reserves in a financially repressed economy

(closed capital account) to forced saving, lower consumption, and welfare losses (he is interested primarily in the

10
   Calvo and Reinhart (2002); Aizenman and Lee (2006) find the “mercantilist” motive statistically significant but
quantitatively small relative to self-insurance, but their sample does not extend to recent post subprime years. Jeanne (2012)
also emphasizes the fear of floating motive in or in this particular instance “fear of appreciation” (see Levy-Yeyati and
Sturzenegger, 2007 for compelling documentation of this tendency in emerging markets for the pre-crisis period)

Vuletin (2013).

                                                               5
case of China) comes closer to the “cost of reserve accumulation” we are interested in investigating. To our

knowledge, these and other related papers have not made a connection between the sustained reserve

accumulation and the persistent and significantly lower levels of investment in the region.12 Put differently,

reserve accumulation involved an official institution (i.e., the central bank) funneling domestic saving abroad and

thus competing with domestic borrowers in the market for loanable funds. We suggest a broader definition of

crowding out, driven importantly by official capital outflows, is applicable to most of the Asian economies (and a

significant number outside Asia) in varying degrees. In principle, reserve accumulation could also crowd out

private consumption (as in the case of China) or public consumption. Our focus on total (private and public)

investment is driven by the large and persistent declines we have already alluded to.


         The paper proceeds as follows. The next section examines the evolution of the current account and

investment in a 26-year window around the Asian crisis of 1997-1998; for comparative purposes, we present the

corresponding macroeconomic data for Europe and the United States from the 10 years prior to the 2007-2009

crises to the present. In Section III, we use our historical data on the level and composition of debt to document

the rise of home bias while Section IV presents and reinterprets the evidence on reserve accumulation as a source

of crowding out. The hybrid Asian experiences, which encompass high debt-current account surplus Japan and

low debt-current account deficit Indonesia, are discussed in the context of the home bias-crowding out framework.

Concluding remarks focus on further research and speculate to what extent elements of the Asian experience are

present elsewhere.


                                   II. Crises and Investment: The Long Aftermath


         The literature on sudden stops (see, Calvo, 2012) and capital flow surges (Reinhart and Reinhart, 2009)

has documented the sharp reversals of the current account that take place at crisis times, including the famous

Asian crisis episode of 1997-1998. In this section, we document current account reversals that persist well after

the financial crisis is over. Linked by an accounting identity (briefly discussed below), we connect the current
12
  This is not to suggest that some declining investment ratios have other important drivers relating to technological change
and the transition to a more mature stage of development. We would observe that, by 1991, Japan was considered a mature
economy and that Singapore did not lag far behind.

account reversal to a change in investment; the corresponding exercise for growth is presented in the appendix.

To set the stage for the discussion on the connection between domestic and external debt and reserves, we review

episodes of the Asia’s brush with default and restructuring (or near default).


1. Basics


        The simple rules of double-entry accounting ensure that, excluding statistical discrepancies, the capital

account surplus or net capital inflow (denoted by KA) is related to the current account surplus (denoted by CA)

and to the official reserves account RA of the balance of payments (BOP) through the identity,


        CA +KA+ RA ≡ 0.


Notice that RA < 0 implies an accumulation of reserves by the monetary authority.


A property of the current account is that it measures the economy’s net foreign wealth. A country that runs a

current account surplus must have a capital account deficit (private capital outflow) and or an increase in reserves

(an official outflow). Another related identity is that the current account surplus equals the difference between

national savings and national investment,


        CA ≡ S – I.


2. External balances

        Table 1 presents selected developments for the current account for two groups of countries: the nine

Asian economies we focus on (China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and

Thailand); and a comparison group comprised of Europe and the United States. For Asia, we compare 1987-1997

(the 11-year period in the run-up to the Asian crisis) with 1998-2012—the long 15-year aftermath. We avoid

extending the comparison further back, as Asia was also in crisis in the earlier part of the 1980s. For the Europe

and US sample we compare the 1997-2007 pre-crisis with the five years (2008-2012) since. Table 1 reports the

peak deficit level and year it was recorded from 1980 to 2012. The memorandum item calculates the pooled

means for the relevant periods before and after the crisis.

                                                          7
           Starting with Asia in 2012 (last column), there are two groups, India and Indonesia with current account

deficits and all others with surpluses of varying magnitudes-an issue we will retake in Section V. Of the core

Asian crisis countries (Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand), all except Indonesia shows a

deteriorating current account in the 11 years ahead of the crisis and an improvement in the subsequent 15 years

(first two columns).13 Indeed, if we had ended the exercise in 2011 Indonesia would also be showing a surplus

and subsequent improvement. A more meaningful comparison, than point-to-point are the pooled means. For

1987-1997, the average current account deficit is 0.1 percent; during the 15 years since the crisis the average turns

to a surplus of 5.4 percent (the 5.5 percent difference is statistically significant at all standard levels of

confidence).


           For the Europe and US sample, which involve a mix of debtor and creditor countries, a common pattern

in the crisis countries (marked by and asterisk) is the swing from a worsening deficit to a post crisis surplus, as in

Asia. The most dramatic turnaround shown in Table 1 is Iceland, which records a deterioration of 14 percent,

followed by an improvement of nearly the same magnitude. As of 2012, Ireland, Portugal and Spain had shifted

into impressive surplus territory.




13
     If we use a narrower window around the crisis of three or five years, this pattern is even more pronounced and uniform.

  An asterisk denotes a banking crisis in the “common crisis year”; the common crisis years for the advanced and Asian
economies are 2007-2008 and 1997-1998, respectively. The years refer to the start of the crisis.

  Japan’s financial crisis began in 1992.
Notes: The difference in pooled means tests are significant at standard confidence levels.

2. Investment in the shadow of “Sudden Stops”

        Table 2 presents the Investment/GDP ratio in the same format as Table 1, replicating the same coverage

of countries and time. The table shows the phenomenon we are trying to understand. With the exceptions of

China, India and Indonesia, the second post crisis column stands out by showing the large declines in investment

recorded following deep crises. The top panel showing Europe and the US is even more uniform in this regard, as

not a single country records a higher level of investment in 2012 than in 2007. As with the current account, we

place more weight on the pooled means reported as memorandum items. These show a 6.2 percent decline in

investment for the full Asian group. If China and India are excluded, however, the decline is 9.4 percent, the

standard difference in means tests yield significant results at all standard levels of confidence.


        Five years into the aftermath of what began as the subprime crisis in the United States in the summer of

2007, the European economies and the US seem to be on a similar track. The pooled means point to a decline of

2.6 percent since the onset of the crisis. Furthermore the magnitudes of the declines in a number of the periphery

crises countries match and surpass the investment in Asia.


        The investment slump unfolds during a period of lower average growth. Appendix Table A.1 replicates a

third time the format used in Tables 1 and 2. The pooled estimates show mean growth in the 15-year span after

the crisis as 2.5 percent lower for the 9 country Asian sample and 3.3 percent lower if China and India are

excluded.


        Having shown that current account surpluses and lower investment ratios and growth are the post-crisis

“new normal,” we now turn to the crisis episodes that cemented the policies of self-insurance via large scale

reserve accumulation. The motivation of governments for holding reserves is well established in the literature, as

discussed in Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010) and Calvo, Izquierdo and Loo-Kung (2012). The sketch

presented here of past crisis only serves to highlight the gap between international reserve “cover” then and now.

4. Disasters and near disasters


        Table 3 presents a list of external credit events in the form of outright default, debt restructuring, or “near

train wrecks” in that the country was on the verge of default. This list does not include banking, currency, and

inflation crises; the dates for these can be found in the accompanying Asia Chart book. While the intent of this

discussion is not to evaluate the indicator properties of debt or reserves, two features of Table 3 are noteworthy.

First, with the exception of Indonesia’s external debt in 1998, none of the debt ratios at the time of crises seem

obviously high--certainly not by advanced economy standards. In effect, Indonesia’s external debt/GDP ratio in

1997 was 63.2 percent, an implosion in the rupiah and a sharp decline in GDP drove the debt ratio higher by

nearly 100 percent in less than a year. In seven of the 11 episodes shown external debt levels would have met the

Maastricht criteria--indeed, Reinhart, Rogoff and Savastano (2003) show that in more than one half of the defaults

since 1970 that would have been the case also. Second, as the last column reveals, while external debt might not

have been alarming in its own right, the central bank did not have the reserves to back even a quarter of the

outstanding debt stock at the time the crisis broke out. In nearly half the cases, the reserve backing amounted to

less than 10 percent of the hard currency debt. The point that the common practice of focusing on reserves-to-

import ratios was not especially useful to convey vulnerability to financial crises and that reserves should be

compared to the potential stock of liabilities these have to back (such as M2 or external debt, or at least the short-

term component of debt) was forcefully made by Calvo and Mendoza (1996).


        The crisis experience sets the stage for both a policy that redirects government borrowing toward the

domestic market and a central bank that strives to build a foreign exchange war chest as a financial stability policy

tool. To what extent private external borrowing was discouraged through “macroprudential” measures or more

explicit capital controls has varied considerably across countries and across time.


        In the next section, we document the evolution of home bias in public finance and provide some markers

on the magnitudes of the accumulation in foreign exchange reserves.

                                                         III. Home Bias

           Home bias in finance has many dimensions, so it is impossible to measure it by a single indicator or even

a handful of indicators. We do not use the term as in the original work of French and Poterba (1991) to describe

low shares of foreign equity in domestic portfolios or low shares of foreign bonds in private domestic portfolio.

We focus on “liability home bias” as a preference for borrowing domestically (and usually in the domestic

currency) post 1997-1998 crisis. In what follows, we focus primarily on the internal-external composition of

government debt as well as the evolution of external total debt (pubic plus private) in comparison to domestic

credit to the private sector.




                                                                    13
1. Domestic and external public debt

        The analysis here builds on Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and (2011), who trace out the long (and

forgotten) historical evolution of domestic public debt. The debt series begin as early as 1835 for “British” India

and 1872 for Japan; for Korea and Thailand the starting date is 1913; for Malaysia and the Philippines it is the

1940s and so on. The data for China is the least comprehensive in every dimension both in terms of time frame

and coverage. The Data Appendix provides the details. Figure 1 traces the share of domestic central government

debt; as such the range of variation is bounded by zero and one. The solid line is the average for eight of the nine

economies (China is excluded); the long dash plots the ratio for Japan, which is the country with the highest share

of domestic debt for the most extended period of time while the short dash is the time series for Indonesia, which

recorded the most significant dependence of external borrowing right up to the 1997 crisis (and even

subsequently).

           On the basis of the eight-country average, it is evident that, with the exception of the financial autarky

imposed by World War II, Asian governments relied heavily on external financing. In the period of financial

repression and capital controls during Bretton Woods, home bias was higher than in the more liberal international

capital markets of the late 1970s and beyond. During the multiple crises in Asia during 1980-1986 (these were not

as synchronous as 1997-1998) about 40 percent of government debt was external. After that crisis the pendulum

began to swing toward domestic debt and after the 1997-1998, the share of domestic debt edged higher still. The

average shows the share of domestic debt hovering around 80 percent but that largely reflects that Indonesia and

the Philippines still rely far more heavily on external debt than the others. For Japan and Singapore domestic debt

is the while story while for India, Korea, Malaysia and Thailand at present domestic debt accounts for 90 percent

or more of the total. 14


2. Total (public and private) external debt


           The preceding evidence is confined to the central government. Historically a substantive part of the

external borrowing has come from other sectors of government, such as enterprises and, of course, the private

sector. To ascertain how total public and private external indebtedness has evolved, we plot the average external

debt/GDP ratio for eight of the nine economies over 1970 to 2013:Q1. Singapore, which ranks 4th in the Global

Financial Centres Index is the obvious outlier and is excluded from the average shown.15 Singapore’s gross

external debt, which is a multiple of GDP, is shown in the inset of Figure 2. Of the 69 countries that participate in

providing quarterly gross external debt data in the joint IMF-World Bank QEDS exercise, only four report higher

external debt ratios than Singapore, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Mauritius. The latter two are offshore

centers and the previous two once were. For China, we report the aggregate external debt of Hong Kong and

Mainland relative to the aggregated GDP.


           In line with the home bias re-direction, total external debt has been halved since 1987 and hovers around

30 percent. While deleveraging usually follows a deep crisis, the debt reduction, as we shall see, has been far

boom.

3. Hidden debts, contingent liabilities and private credit

“There are four things every person has more of than they know; sins, debt, years, and foes.”
-Persian Proverb

        The broad debt picture would not be complete without a discussion of domestic credit to the private sector,

with its history of past booms and bust and where significant vulnerabilities have re-emerged in a number of the




                                                           16
countries studies here.16 The ratio of domestic credit to the private sector outstanding to GDP, as of the second

quarter of 2013, is shown in Figure 3 for the Asian, and Europe and US sample.17 As with the composition of

public debt and the extent of external private and public indebtedness, there is considerable cross-country

variation within our sample, but the general prevailing pattern (with the exceptions of the Philippines and

Indonesia) is that in the remaining seven countries domestic levels are high (if not necessarily at peak levels) by

their own historical standards, if not by a broad cross-country comparison (as shown in Figure 2).


          Japan’s ratio is the highest (slightly above 250 percent) and it hovers near its 1996 peak. The banking

crisis in Japan began in 1991 and unlike in most severe banking crisis where debt ratios begin to decline usually

two years after the crisis, deleveraging was slow and partial, as the debt ratio never dips below 215 percent (see

Asia Chartbook.) Korea’s drastic external deleveraging after the crisis has no obvious domestic counterpart, as

domestic credit ratio continued to climb. At 103 percent as of mid-2013 credit/GDP is only slightly below the 109

peak in 2009. Thailand and Malaysia have also experienced a marked rebound in domestic private credit,

especially connected to household debt. China, while still classified as a low income country, has a domestic

credit ratio that is at par with advanced economies; these data reflect the growth of domestic credit in the “formal”

banking sector. Hong Kong’s average annual increase in credit/ GDP during 2007-2013 exceeded Ireland’s during

the decade before the crisis (1997-2007) and has been only surpassed by Iceland’s credit boom over the pre-crisis

decade (Figure 4). Credit ratios are at all-time highs for Hong Kong, India, Singapore and the group as a whole

(Figure 5). 18


         A missing component in this analysis is domestic securitized debt, which varies in importance with the

size of the domestic bond market across these countries. Also, important “hidden debts” for the case of China are

provincial liabilities often contracted through the burgeoning shadow banking sector in that country and directly

tied to real estate activity. To the extent that central banks issue their own debt to facilitate open market

16
   For a historic dimensions of these credit cycles, see Schularick and Taylor (2009)—Japan is in their sample; for the
interaction between capital flows, credit and crisis (including the nine Asian economies covered here, see Mendoza and
Terrones (2012).
17
   Denmark is excluded as there is a substantive break in the credit series reported in International Financial Statistics in
2000, which needs to be sorted out.

   In Figure 5, Hong Kong is not combined with Mainland China, as for external debt in Figure 2.

                                                               17
operations or to sterilize the effects of large purchases of foreign exchange reserves, this type of domestic debt is

also not quantified here.19 In Malaysia, there are ongoing discussions of hidden debts in the form of an assortment

of off-balance sheet expenditure involving government enterprises.


         We have not yet discussed public debts as whole but observed that these have become increasingly

domestic, as external debt levels have declined and the share of domestic debt in the total pie has risen. The

preceding discussion highlighted the growing private domestic debts. Taken together, the implication is that for

Asia’s largest economies domestic leverage is an issue of some concern. Banking crises need not have an

external dimension.

    4. Original sin and debt intolerance


             The discussion that follows revolves around seven (excluding Japan and Singapore) of the nine sample

    countries. On the surface, the preceding discussion would suggest that the challenges posed by “original sin” in

    Eichengreen, Hausmann and Panizza (2005) have been overcome in this sample. Before jumping to that

    conclusion, we note that the full original sin phenomenon, as described by the authors, had two dimensions: first,

    the inability of governments to borrow domestically, (in the domestic currency) long term at fixed rates; second,

    the inability of governments to borrow in their own currency abroad (i.e, debt issues under international law).


             We have presented evidence that governments turned inward in their funding pattern but there is

    considerable variation within the group. China and India have had historically a significant domestic debt market,


                                                                 21
(understandably given their size and inward development strategy for many decades). Korea, Malaysia, and

Thailand, which relied extensively on external funding (had both dimensions of original sin) have shifted

overwhelmingly to domestic debt fulfilling the criteria described above. Indonesia (see Figure 1) and the

Philippines have also shifted markedly to domestic funding, but external debt still accounts for about half of

central government debt.


           We have also documented the more generalized (encompassing the private sector and other layers of

government) pattern of declining external debt and rising domestic debt. This trend is silent, however, on the

external dimension of whether these governments are able to place domestic currency debt in international capital

markets, as we have not examined the currency composition of debt issues under external law. In sum, the

domestic strand of original sin has significantly diminished, but that is about all that can be said.


           Our analysis is equally silent on whether debt intolerance has been overcome or not, as external debt levels

are low by historical standards. Table 3 is a reminder that crises often occurred at low (and sometimes extremely

low) levels of external debt, which is the essence of debt intolerance. At present, the Indian rupee together with

Brazil’s real, China’s remimbi, South Africa’s rand, and the Turkish lira, have been dubbed the fragile five. 20

Since the spring of 2013, the central banks of India and Indonesia have lost a substantive amount of reserves in

efforts to stem a slide in the currency; India has introduced measures to limit capital flight. As of the first quarter

of 2013 India and Indonesia’s total external debt amount to 19.8 and 26.8, respectively.



                                              IV. Crowding Out Redefined


           In this section, we revisit the old concept of “crowding out” (conventional definition) as it applies to Asia.

We move on to redefine and broaden the concept of crowding out to the official sector at large, which includes

central banks. In light of this broader definition of the official sector, we ask whether the record reserve

                                                             22
accumulation that took root at the time of crisis in much of Asia is related to the persistently lower levels of

investment since 1997-1998. Put differently, we ask has central bank reserve accumulation been crowding out

private investment in the past 15 years?


1. Conventional crowding out


         Crowding is usually understood as the process when increased government borrowing displaces

investment spending. If the government is competing with the private sector for a limited supply of loanable funds,

then the higher public borrowing 'crowds out' private investing. This crowding out can occur via rising cost of

borrowing for firms, or it can occur without rising interest rates if the government receives preferential access to

the supply of loanable funds. Financial regulation can (and often does) tilt the balance in favor of government

debt; financial repression does this more explicitly, often through directed credit. 21 Crowding out is typically a

pressing policy concern when the public and private sectors’ access to international capital markets is limited or

non-existent, when government new financing needs are large, and when the government has to roll over large

debts on a continual basis. To this list we would add the obvious point that in cases where foreign saving cannot

be tapped, the smaller the pool of domestic saving (other things equal), the greater the problem of crowding out.


         As with other indicators, the range of variation in public debt profiles within the region is vast, both in

terms of debt levels and their composition.22 Table 1, which provides a snapshot of the public debt in selected

countries in the region, highlights this diversity. Public debt/GDP levels range from around 20 percent for

Indonesia and China (for the latter it is a likely understatement) to Japan’s record (a multiple of 12) near 240

percent. These extremes support obvious point that the fiscal policy challenges faced by these countries are of a

very hybrid nature. Our intention is not to have a discussion of the complex regional fiscal panorama but to focus

on two cases (Japan and India) where the conventionally defined challenge of crowding out is most applicable.23

1 For China, General Government Debt is used in lieu of Central Government Debt

Japan

         Since 2009, Japan’s general government debt/GDP ratio has surpassed 200 percent (Figure 6). According

to Reinhart and Rogoff’s (2009) historical public debt database, few sovereign have recorded comparable levels.

Of the seven episodes we identify of debt/GDP above 200 percent (France 1921-1923; Germany 1944; Greece

1894-1897; Netherlands, 1821-1853; New Zealand 1932-1934; UK 1813-1825 and 1945-1948), only two lasted

longer than five years.24 In three (Germany, Greece and New Zealand) of the seven cases, the country was in full

default or undergoing a restructuring. Still, in the four episodes that did not involve a default or restructuring, the

debt was intimately connected with a war or a series of wars; France in the aftermath of World War I, the UK in

the wake of the Napoleonic and Second World wars, and the Dutch, who fought to wars in what is now Indonesia

in 1821-1837 while engaged in the Belgian fight for independence (1830-1839) at home.


         To say history offers little guidance on how the debt is unwound in these more extreme cases is an

understatement. On the surface, the two longer episodes involving the UK and the Netherlands in the 1800s are


24
  While the UK public debt data is available from 1692, the nominal GDP data prior to 1830 is of a more tentative nature
(see Bank of England, 2011), as such the debt ratios immediately following the Napoleonic Wars are to be interpreted with
care.

                                                                      24
of greater interest. Both countries played a prominent role as international financial centers at the time and as the

high level of public debt co-existed with high levels of private saving, both the UK and the Netherlands were

creditors to the rest of the world (like Japan). Even so, the comparison is a stretch, as the UK and the Netherlands

enjoyed a stream of substantial transfer of resources from their colonies that modern day Japan cannot count on

and in both cases the tapering of war efforts played a role in debt reduction that is strikingly at odds with the

concerns of an ageing population.25 It is noteworthy that the post 1900 episodes (even in less extreme cases than

those listed here) often involved substantial debt erosion through inflation and/or financial repression.26

        More to the point of this paper, since its peak shortly before the 1991 crisis (Table 2), Japan’s investment

ratio has declined by 12 percentage points while household consumption as a share of GDP has risen by about 6

percentage points over that period (not a surprise in light of the country’s aging population). Private debt has

remained above 210 percent of GDP, where it has oscillated since the mid-1980s. Government debt, which was

47 percent of GDP in 1991 on the eve of crisis has multiplied by a factor of five. In light of these combined

developments, it may be possible in an in-depth case study to fully account for the observed investment slump.

However, as the next section discusses this is not the full picture, a significant share of Japan’s savings were

channeled abroad the through reserve accumulation (official capital outflows) during this period. Foreign

exchange reserves (excluding gold) relative to GDP rose from about 2 percent of GDP in 1991 to 24 percent in

mid-2013.


India


        If Japan’s predicament is rare, a more common pre-crisis “vulnerability” pattern is recently visible in

India. The troublesome combination involves: relatively high public debt (especially evident in general

government, Figure 2); coupled with large budget deficits (about 8.5 percent of GDP); a widening current account

deficit (despite what are still low levels of external debt); slowing growth; and private domestic credit is at a

historic high.27 Added to this list are accumulated past mistakes or missed opportunities. Frankel, Vegh, and

Vuletin (2013) have recently re-examined the issue of fiscal procyclicality. Their analysis, which controls for the

endogeneity of institutions and other determinants of procyclicality, shows that, over the last decade, about a third

of the developing world has been able to escape the procyclicality trap and actually become countercyclical.

Unfortunately, this uplifting finding does not apply to India’s fiscal policy, which they find to be procyclical as in

the past. With growth rates consistently above 5 percent in the past six years, fiscal deficits have oscillated

between 8 and 10 percent of GDP; one can only imagine what fiscal finances will look like with slower growth. If

the past is any guide, India will rely on financial repression and negative real interest as one of the tools for debt

erosion. Reinhart and Sbrancia (2011) estimated the financial repression tax to amount to 2 percent of GDP a

year.28

           India along with China showed no evidence of an investment slump post 1997 as investment rose by

about nine percentage points since that time, while household consumption fell by about six percentage points. An

outlier in this group, investment has been partially financed by foreign saving (India as it is the only country in the

Asian group that has recorded consistent current account deficits since 2004). In 2012, the current account deficit

widened to 5 percent of GDP in (Table 1), its peak level since 1980. If external finance falters, India’s strong

investment could quickly reverse.

2. Central bank crowding out


        We discuss some understudied aspects of what is a well-documented and researched phenomenon--the

build-up of foreign exchange reserves in much of Asia. This process began immediately after the Asian crisis of

1997-1998 but became especially marked since 2000-2001, when China accelerated its purchases of foreign

exchange to an unprecedented scale. The premise explored here is an extremely simple one and connected to the

balance of payments identity and the definition of the current account.



                                                           28
        We have presented evidence that most governments in the region have, in varying degrees, shifted from

external financing to domestic financing and that the private sector, especially households, have entered domestic

credit markets forcefully. Both public and private sectors were relying on foreign saving prior to the crisis. Taken

together, these observations suggest that there are more players competing for domestic saving in post 1997 crisis

Asia. These trends by themselves would, perhaps, have more modest implications for domestic investment, if it

were not coupled with a macroeconomic policy objective of building an insurance war chest of foreign exchange

reserves and avoiding current account deficits (or fickle foreign saving) if at all possible. Possibly, fear of floating

combined with fear of current account deficits—a very understandable prudential reaction to severe crisis.


        A reserve buildup is an official capital outflow, funneling domestic saving abroad. The decision to

intervene or not and at what pace to accumulate reserves is determined by an official institution (the central bank)

and is distinct from the process of the private sector’s allocation of saving. Accordingly, we broaden the definition

of crowding out to include the central bank under the umbrella of the public sector. This broader definition might

not have made much difference over large tracts of history. Ironically, under fixed exchange rates, annual changes

in reserves relative to GDP were smaller (except in the immediate vicinity of a crisis) than those observed under

“floating exchange rates” since 1997.29 30 Furthermore, under fixed exchange rates reserve changes were more

symmetric (years of reserve losses alternating with reserve accumulation) than post 1997. If reserve purchases are

sterilized to some degree, as is most often the case, it is done by increasing reserve requirements or by open

market sales of government or central bank bills (or bonds).31 In the narrower conventional definition of crowding

out, the government is issuing more debt; in the more encompassing definition, the government need not be

issuing more debt—the central bank is—either by selling its holdings of government debt or by selling its own

sterilization bonds, a key point is that it is doing so persistently over an extended period of time.




29
   Commodity price booms and busts were also associated with larger-than-normal fluctuations in reserves.
30
   Standard textbook definitions of floating exchange rates do not involve foreign exchange market intervention and a
common simplifying assumption is that reserve changes are zero.
31
   See Reinhart and Reinhart (1999) and Cordella, Vegh and Vuletin (2013).

                                                             29
           In the debt crisis of the 1980s in Latin America, private capital flight funneled domestic saving abroad, to

the detriment of investment in the region. We do not suggest that from a macroprudential and signaling

standpoint the process of a central bank accumulating reserves and capital flight are comparable. Foreign

exchange purchases create a backing for foreign currency debt in times of stress, and more generally, for the

monetary aggregates (M2), as in Calvo and Mendoza (1996) and Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2010). Large

current account deficits (capital flow bonanzas, Reinhart and Reinhart, 2009) are precursors of crises, avoiding

these has a distinct financial stability objective. But the fact remains that whether the outflows are official or

private, a slice of domestic saving is directed to the purchase of foreign assets in lieu of domestic investment. In

the case of capital flight, this wealth held outside the country is difficult or impossible to tax; in the case of

reserves, given the low yield of the assets purchased and domestic foreign interest rate differentials, quasi fiscal

losses have often been significant. 32


3. Not all that glitters is gold

           Table 5 presents some summary statistics quantifying the reserve build up in the nine Asian economies in

the sample plus Hong Kong, which we report separately as well as combined with Mainland China. As scale

variables, we use two domestic and two external variables. Reserves, both the stock and the annual change are

expressed as a share of GDP, so as to facilitate magnitude comparisons, with investment, saving consumption and

the current account. Since a major impetus to reserve accumulation is to provide insurance, particularly (but not

exclusively) in the event that foreign currency debts (public and private) have to be immediately repaid, we also

report reserves relative to these external debts. To gauge from the perspective of the United States, who is a major

recipient of the official flows, the magnitude of the reserve build up (stock and flows), we present the data relative

to US GDP and the level of marketable US Treasury debt. The evolution of reserves over the 1980-2013 is also

traced in Figures 8 and 9.


           Starting with the averages for the region, which conceal cross country variation (in magnitudes not

direction), reserves on average rose around four percent of GDP; Singapore and China are on the upper end and

32
     See for instance, Mohanty and Turner (2006), Rodrik (2006).

                                                              30
Indonesia on the low end. On average, as of August 2013 reserves to GDP are 36 percent, which is very close to

the total amount of public and private external debt outstanding. At 93.1 percent, reserves/external debt is indeed

a contrast to the reserve/debt ratios reported in the last column of Table 3, when reserve ratios in time of crises

were uniformly less than 25 percent and frequently less than 10 percent. As shown in Table 5, the magnitude of

official outflows (reserve accumulation), relative to the size of the economy are on a scale that can potentially

help account for an important component of the decline in investment (simply from the narrow vantage point of

balance of payments accounting).


        The magnitude of the reserve build up in these nine countries combined from the US vantage point is no

less substantial, although may somewhat overstated by Table 5 which presents total reserves minus gold not just

Treasury securities or GSE debt. That line of inquiry, however, is beyond the scope of this paper.

Notes: The standard error on the correlation coefficient of the investment and reserve ratio reported in Figure 8 is 0.073; if
China and India are included the correlation is 0.66 and the corresponding standard error is 0.098. Both sets of correlations
are significant at the standard confidence levels.

         Table 5 covered the period of most intense reserve accumulation post 2001 but Figure 8 traces the

evolution of reserves since 1980 thus covering pre- and post-1997-1998 crisis. It is important to remember that

while 1997-1998 was the most severe crisis (by a number of metrics including investment) and certainly the most

synchronous, it was not the only crisis in Asia since 1980. Indeed from 1980 to 1985, in addition to the Korean

debt crisis (no default or restructuring ensued) of 1979-1980 and the default by the Philippines in 1983 (Table 3),

there were systemic banking crises in Korea in 1983, and in Malaysia in 1985, Philippines in 1981, Singapore in

1982 and Thailand in 1983.33 These crises did not produce as sharp a change in public policy attitudes toward the

external sector as did the later crises, specifically as regards the danger of current account deficits and the

desirability of a generous pool of foreign exchange reserves. So, while there is a sharp downturn in investment


33
 See Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Park (2005) for a comparison of the two Korean crises and
Athukorala (2010), who reviews the mid-1980s and 1997-1998 crises in Malaysia and the turbulence of 2008.

                                                              33
(which falls five percentage points between 1983 and 1986), the post crisis recovery in reserves is neither as sharp

nor sustained as post 1997.34 The simple correlation between the foreign exchange reserve and investment ratios

over 1980-2013 is -0.76. In interpreting the correlation, it is important to remember that these are linked via the

balance of payments accounting identity. An increase in official outflows (reserve accumulation), however, could

just as plausibly translate to a reduction in the consumption-GDP ratio (public, private, or both) as in China post-

2001. While reserve intervention/accumulation is a policy choice, it is improbable that it is not connected to a

policy reaction function of one form or another, a point made by Obstfeld (1982).


         The obvious question is, of course China, the country with the most significant build-up in reserves and

where average investment ratios are almost 3 percent higher post 1997. If China is included, so it is nine-country

average the correlation drops to –0.66. The “space” for simultaneous reserve accumulation and higher investment

in the case of China was largely accommodated by a sharp decline in household consumption (Figures 9 and A.1)

that leave the consumption share of households in 2011 at around 35 percent of GDP, roughly one half the US

share and more than two standard deviations lower than the Asia average. Lardy (2008) and (2012) has connected

the decline in household consumption (and household income) share of GDP in China to the large reserve build-

up post 2000 in combination with financial repression. Jeanne (2012) formalizes this connection. Massive

purchases of foreign exchange reserves ( as we document here these range from 9 to 13.5 percent per year from

2004 to 2009) coupled with partial sterilization helped fuel a credit boom and accelerating inflation. With interest

rates on deposits capped, real ex-post interest rates fell from around 1.5 percent to about -7 percent during this

period. The financial repression tax on households depressed incomes and consumption, as shown in Figure 9.




34
  The 5-percentage point decline in investment in a period of three years is not far off from the 5.4 percent decline for the US
and Europe in the five years since the crisis (Table 2).

                                                   V. Concluding Remarks

           Much has been said about the macroprudential rationale for holding sufficient foreign currency reserves

to cover short term liabilities. There is less agreement on how broad that coverage should be, especially if there is

the potential for hidden debts and implicit guarantees on private sector liabilities. As a consequence, the concept

of an optimal level of reserves is subject to debate. As reserve accumulation picked up momentum around 2000-

2001, a number of studies have also emphasized that there is no free lunch. Reserve accumulation carries costs.

Calvo’s (1991) “perils of sterilization,” written well before the Asian crisis, focused on the higher nominal

interest rates that result from the central bank’s effort to sterilize reserve accumulation. 35 Other perils, ranging

from creating distortions in the banking sector, fueling credit booms, and impairing central bank balance sheet,

have been considered.

           The point emphasized in Bussiere et al (2013) that reserve accumulation and capital controls may be best

viewed as complements (rather than substitutes) has resonance to the analysis presented here. They found the

greatest resilience to the global shock of 2008-2009 was among countries with high reserves and less than open

capital account. In the longer horizon focus of this paper, the parallel would be that countries with relatively more

pervasive capital account barriers may have a better chance of limiting the “crowding out effects” of reserve

accumulation (official outflows) on investment. This may be because the controls themselves limit private

outflows or capital flight--a leakage (to the extent, of course the measures are effective), because the magnitude of

the desired the reserve accumulation is smaller (as the controls also insulate the domestic economy form external

shocks), or a combination of the two.

           The global consequences of this reserve build-up have been debated under various heading’s, including

Bernanke’s saving glut and what risks that poses to capital importing countries like the United States. Bernanke

(2005) argued that interest rates in advanced economies were held down by a glut of saving from Asian

economies. To this we would add that, Asia’s investment has been held down because Asian governments have

been absorbing domestic saving to purchase the securities of the rest of advanced economies.



35
     This has not been the case in the most recent period of heavy financial repression in China, as discussed in Lardy (2008).

                                                                36
        Then there is the eternal quest in the international finance literature on how to measure capital mobility.36

For one, the reserve buildup drives a large and variable wedge between domestic saving and investment. Thus a

test of the mobility of capital in the spirit of Feldstein and Horioka might conclude capital flows freely because

national investment is not constrained by saving. Actually, domestic investment may be crowded out from using

domestic saving because of the government’s decision to build reserves. Interest parity conditions are silent on

the volume of official to official versus private international capital flows, a phenomenon convincingly

documented in Alfaro, Kalemli-Ozcan, and Volosovych, (2013) and our discussion of rising post-crisis home bias.

        This paper is silent on the global implications of official capital outflows from Asia but it adds another

dimension to the policy dilemma of capital exporting countries--when are high and rising levels of reserves too

much of a good thing? Since the 1997-1998 crisis, investment ratios in Asia have not recovered outside of China

and India, and now those two countries may be in the cusp of a correction. We have hypothesized here that the

persistent and quantitatively important official outflows orchestrated by central banks have crowded out

investment—and not necessarily just private investment but public as well. Since 1997, growth has slowed

significantly in the region, even when China and India are included in the calculus.

        We are not aware of other studies addressing this particular tradeoff between the size of the security

blanket and the price in terms of the medium term growth consequences it may carry. This is to say that this is a

fruitful area for policy research. It is relevant for Asia, not just because China and India are now part of the

“fragile five,” but because several of the other countries have their own challenges, ranging from Japan’s

gargantuan public debt to signs of internal household credit booms in some of the other former crises countries as

discussed. Perhaps Asia’s investment slump has been largely overlooked because, after all, Asia’s investment

ratios are still among the highest world wide—but their post crisis average is more than nine percentage points

below average in the decade before the crisis. If there were another round of turbulence in Asia with its usual

attendant impact on investment that gap could narrow further.




36
  Obstfeld (1995) provides a comprehensive tour of this literature and Obstfeld, Shambaugh, Taylor (2010) also deal with
some of these issues.

                                                            37
        Of course, the problem of dwindling investment is also a compelling policy challenge for many of the

advanced economies facing large public and private debt overhangs. Indeed, it is an acute problem in the cases of

periphery Europe, where capital market access remains limited at best and an ongoing credit crunch unfolds. In

much of Europe, finance has turned inward and banks, pensions, and insurance are largely in the business of

buying domestic government bonds and ever-greening significant levels of moribund private debt. Unlike Asia,

however, the “leakage” draining domestic saving is not coming from central bank purchases of foreign assets as a

rainy day fund is built. As Eichengreen, et.al. (2013) convincingly illustrate, much of Europe’s post-crisis

experience to date aligns more closely with Latin America’s lost decade—to their analysis we would add that, like

Latin America in the 1980s, capital flight from the periphery remains as drain on its domestic saving.
