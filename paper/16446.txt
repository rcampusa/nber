                                             ABSTRACT

Because of large and rapid growing export volumes and its formal status as a non-market economy;
China has been the subject of large numbers of both antidumping initiations and measures. Current
estimates are that around 40% of such actions are against China; India, in turn, is the largest source
of initiation against China by number of actions. Here we explore the reactions of Chinese firms and
industries to these actions. No other papers to our knowledge explore these reactions empirically. We
use industrial panel data on all Chinese firms in the industry, foreign firms operating within China
and state owned enterprises (SOE) for aggregated firms group between 1997 and 2007. This provides
information on sales, profits, firm numbers, labor productivity, and employment. We are able to link
this data with a World Bank dataset on antidumping actions by industry by country (both by and against)
for the same period. We then use a dynamic system GMM estimator to explore the importance of different
forms of Chinese firms’ overall response to both initiations and measures. We also separately analyze
antidumping actions against China from developed and developing countries, US and EU to compare
their different effects. We find that antidumping actions by developed and developing countries negatively
impact industrial profits and employee and firm numbers and also exports. Output impacts are the
smallest. Labor productivity is improved by antidumping actions. We also find that different kinds
of firms show different responses. All firms together in an industry react to antidumping the most,
and foreign and SOE firms show a much smaller response. Also, developed countries’ antidumping
actions have more negative impact than developing countries’ actions for all firms and SOEs, but foreign
firms’ impacts are the opposite. Chinese industry reactions to antidumping actions by the US and EU
are the same as for other developed countries, but the effects of US actions are larger. US antidumping
actions have more impact than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and exports, and EU antidumping
has more influence than US on output, profit and labor productivity. Finally, comparing Chinese, foreign,
and SOE firm’s reactions to US and EU antidumping actions, our results show foreign firms to be
hurt more by antidumping from EU. We discuss policy implications in a concluding section.

 Chinese Firm and Industry Reactions to Antidumping Initiations

                                     and Measures


    Abstract: Because of large and rapid growing export volumes and its formal status as a

non-market economy; China has been the subject of large numbers of both antidumping

initiations and measures. Current estimates are that around 40% of such actions are against

China; India, in turn, is the largest source of initiation against China by number of actions.

Here we explore the reactions of Chinese firms and industries to these actions. No other

papers to our knowledge explore these reactions empirically. We use industrial panel data on

all Chinese firms in the industry, foreign firms operating within China and state owned

enterprises (SOE) for aggregated firms group between 1997 and 2007. This provides

information on sales, profits, firm numbers, labor productivity, and employment. We are

able to link this data with a World Bank dataset on antidumping actions by industry by

country (both by and against) for the same period. We then use a dynamic system GMM

estimator to explore the importance of different forms of Chinese firms’ overall response to

both initiations and measures. We also separately analyze antidumping actions against

China from developed and developing countries, US and EU to compare their different

effects. We find that antidumping actions by developed and developing countries negatively

impact industrial profits and employee and firm numbers and also exports. Output impacts

are the smallest. Labor productivity is improved by antidumping actions. We also find that

different kinds of firms show different responses. All firms together in an industry react to

antidumping the most, and foreign and SOE firms show a much smaller response. Also,

developed countries’ antidumping actions have more negative impact than developing

countries’ actions for all firms and SOEs, but foreign firms’ impacts are the opposite.

Chinese industry reactions to antidumping actions by the US and EU are the same as for

other developed countries, but the effects of US actions are larger. US antidumping actions

have more impact than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and exports, and EU antidumping

has more influence than US on output, profit and labor productivity. Finally, comparing

Chinese, foreign, and SOE firm’s reactions to US and EU antidumping actions, our results

show foreign firms to be hurt more by antidumping from EU. We discuss policy implications

in a concluding section.

1. Introduction
      In this paper, we discuss firm and industry responses in China to

antidumping (AD) initiations and measures. As China’s exports have grown, so

along with them have trade actions against China through antidumping duties.

In the last decades, China was the largest AD initiation and measure recipient

country in the world. There are a lot of reasons why China is a prime target for

those AD measures. One is China’s rapid export growth and the adjustment

pressures these create in foreign markets. Another is China’s non-market

economy (NME) status 1 in key countries (US and EU especially), relatively

ineffective legal defenses, and the low concentration ratio in many Chinese

industries which makes industry coordination to resist these measures more

difficult.

      China's NME status is a reflection of its accession terms to the WTO. In

2001, China agreed that it be treated as a NME for 15-years to 2016 (Chen,

2009). As a result petitioners do not have to use Chinese domestic input prices in

determining the cost of the production of an investigated product. This has been

part of the reason for the growth in antidumping initiations against China since

the low cost of labor is the major source of comparative advantage in trade for

China. China’s non-market status also grants greater discretionary power to

initiators which again increased the frequency of AD measures.

       When faced with an antidumping measure, a Chinese industry or the firm

may react in various ways. These may include refocusing production on

domestic markets, increased exports to other countries, or location abroad.

Another is producing something else to avoid the foreign trade barriers. Fighting

  There are 10 NMEs at present: China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Mongolia.
Russia was granted market status in 2000, while Vietnam's request for MES has been considered and rejected.

                                                               2
the action and trying to solve the dispute by reaching agreement on a price

undertaking is also an option. The final option is to close down production and

exit the market.

        The reaction of Chinese firms and industries to these antidumping actions is

now an important element in the policy debate in China as it affects what to do

in response. If firms can easily adapt by producing different products and

maintain profits and employment, active response seems less of an issue than if

they are severely impacted. Therefore, analysis of the effects of antidumping

actions on Chinese firms as industry groups is central to this debate.

        Specifically, we build all firm summed industry and other two kinds of firm

summed (foreign firm and state-owned firm) 2 industrial division group panel

data sets covering 39 industries from 1997 to 2007 for use in our analysis. We

separate out AD actions into those undertaken by developed and developing

countries, and also divide AD actions between the United States (US) and the

European Union (EU). We exam their different effects on exports, output, profit,

total firm number, total employee and industry labor productivity. The results

allow us to assess both Chinese industries’ and firm groups’ reactions. Our

regression method involves system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)

estimator (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998).

        In the next section we discuss Chinese AD experience and offer a brief

literature review. Section 3 is data description and methodology. Section 4

reports and discusses empirical results. The final section concludes and discusses

policy implications.

  It is important to also analyze private firm group reactions, but because of data availability, we can only obtain three years of this group
data which are not enough for regression analysis, so their reactions can just be deduced indirectly.

                                                                      3
2. Chinese Experience with AD and Prior Literature on the Impacts
of AD
    According to the WTO antidumping database (WTO, 2010), China was the

recipient of 19.75% of 3427 worldwide antidumping initiations and 21.87% of

2190 antidumping measures globally between 1995 and 2008. In the last three

years, 2006-2008, China was the recipient of 72, 61 and 73 AD initiations and 37,

48, 52 AD measures respectively. These account for nearly 40% of the world

totals (Fig. 1). Compared with China’s total exports, the export value of AD

initiations and measures is not nearly as high since the product coverage of

actions is usually narrowly focused. Per unit export coverage of AD measures in

India and Korea are higher than in China (Fig. 2), but in the top ten AD

measure receivers in the period 1995-2008 China ranks first (Table 1). China’s

main AD initiator complaint countries are India, US, EU, Argentina, Turkey

and Brazil (Table 2).

                          [Fig. 1- Fig. 2 around Here]

                        [Table 1- Table 2 around Here]

    A significant theoretical and empirical literature devotes exists on the

impacts of AD measures, but does not discuss the Chinese case. Most papers

focus on trade effects and reactions of AD by firms and industries, and find that

AD have both trade depression and trade diversion effects. This literature

includes Staiger and Wolack (1994), Prusa (2001), Ganguli (2005), Baylis et al

(2009), Carter and Trant (2010). Some literature has also explored export or

import countries’ reactions to AD in other dimensions; for example technological

innovation, market power, and pricing etc (Crowley, 2006; Konings and

Vandenbussche, 2005; Duc, 2010).



                                        4
     As heterogeneous firm trade theory has evolved in recent years, recent

papers have also studied AD effects in this theoretical framework. These papers

mainly analyze firms’ productivity response to AD protection, and include

Konings and Vandenbussche (2008a), Konings and Vandenbussche (2008b) and

Pierce (2009). There is also some literature analyzing AD effects in other ways.

Brown (2005) uses a specific case study to examine the response of Korean steel

firms after being assessed AD duties in the US. Francois (2009) sets up a global

simulation model for analysis of tariffs and AD policy impacts on price, output,

income and employment.

    Literature on China largely analyzes the reasons for AD and does not

empirically analyze AD impacts on Chinese industry or firms. McGee and Yoon

(1998) use five AD action cases initiated by US against China to assess

development impacts. Messerlin (2004) analyzes both China’s antidumping

recipient and user characteristics. Chu and Prusa (2004) study the reasons for

and the impact of AD on China. Park (2009) studies Chinese trade diversion

effects of AD actions. His results show that AD protection has both significant

trade depression and trade diversion effects. Bown and Crowley (2010) analyze

US and EU AD duties impacts on China’s export; findings that trade depression

effects are weak and trade deflection effects are significant.

3. Methodology and Data
       In this paper we explicitly study China’s industry and firm group reactions

to AD. We separately compare effects of AD from developed and developing

countries on Chinese industries, and in addition separately analyze the US and

the EU. We use system GMM methods to obtain results.

       3.1 Methodology

       We use panel data regression to analyze AD effects on Chinese industry and

firm groups. Affirmative and negative measures have different effects.

Additionally, AD can have lag effects. We use an estimation equation (1) where

Yi,t denotes the dependent variable.
      ln(Yi ,t ) = α + β1 ln(Yi ,t −1 ) + β 2 ADi,t-1 + β3 ADi ,t + β 4 AD1i,t-1
              + β 5 AD1i,t + β 6 AD 2i,t + β 7 AD3i,t + β8 AD 4i,t +
                                                                                                                             (1)
               β9 AD1i,t * AD 2i,t + β10 AD1i,t * AD3i,t +
             β11 AD1i,t * AD 4i,t + β12Time + ε i +υi,t

       In our regressions we specifically consider industry exports, output, firm

numbers, profits, and employee and labor productivity as endogenous variables.

Yi,t-1 are one year lag effects of dependent variables. ADi,t-1 and AD1i,t-1 are

separately one year lag terms of ADi,t and AD1i,t. In order to control for long

term trend effects, we add a time trend variable in the equation. In dependent

variables, labor productivity equals added value divided by numbers of

employees. We use logarithmic values in our regressions to simplify the results

and reduce heteroscedasticity. Table 3 summarizes these variables.

                                                 [Table 3 around Here]

       We use a general-to-specific method to determine the lag length numbers for

dependent and independent variables (Hendry and Clements, 2004) 3 . Our data

3
  For dynamic time series data, we can use an AIC and BIC rule to determine lag numbers. But there are no such rules for panel data.
Here in the general-to-specific method developed by Hendry and Clements, the specific rule is first select a large lag order in the
regression, if the coefficient is significant keep it, if not drop.

                                                                   6
embodies autocorrelation with one lag and so we include one lag in the

right-hand side of our empirical specification. Because of lags in our dependent

variable, we use dynamic panel methodology to estimate our equations. We

deploy the Arellano-Bond instrumental variable procedure (Arellano and Bover,

1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998) and which proposes a GMM estimator which

accounts for within-panel autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity and estimates

a dynamic panel specification similar to equation (1) above.

    The dynamic panel estimator first put forward by Arellano and Bond (1991)

as a first order difference GMM produces estimates after taking first order

differences in order to eliminate individual effects. Such methods however can

induce sample partial bias (Blundell and Bond, 1998). Blundell and Bond (1998)

propose a GMM-system estimator which not only first order differences but also

uses lagged difference variables as instrumental variables to construct level

equations. This method avoids endogeneity problems. This GMM estimator can

be divided into one step and two step forms; the two step GMM method can give

more robust results (Arellano and Bond, 1991; Windmeijer, 2005). Regressions

in our paper are all two step system GMM results of this form.

    3.2 Data

    We use three data samples; an all firm summed industry sample, a foreign

firm summed group sample, and a state-owned firm summed group sample.

These data are firm summed within industries, and not firms by firm. Each

sample yields observations of 39 industries from 1997 to 2007. Tables 4 and 5

give the overall summary statistics of the dependent and independent variables

in the empirical analysis.

                             [Tables 4-5 around Here]



                                        7
    Data on dependent variables except export values come from the Chinese

Statistical Yearbook, and we use producer price indices as deflators. Export

value data come from the Chinese Customs Statistical Yearbook. The AD data

come from a World Bank global AD database (Bown, 2010). All of the

dependent variables except export values are classified by Chinese “National

Economy Industrial Classification” (NEIC) and have 39 2-digital manufacturing

industries. The independent variables and export values are classified by the

Harmonized System Codes Commodity Classification (HS). They cannot be

directly merged together by industry. We take the NEIC as our benchmark; and

allocate all of the AD cases into NEIC industries according to the detailed AD

products as named one by one. We only have all firm summed industry data for

export values.

    The global AD database (Bown, 2010) provides detailed AD case

information by country division. Because our data are firm summed by industry,

we cannot include AD duty variables in our regressions because most cases

involve specific firms. Independent variables in our regressions are thus all

dummies. Hence, if one or more firm in an industry received an AD investigation

or measure in one year, we take that year’s AD investigation or measure variable

to equal 1, otherwise it equals 0.




                                       8
4. Empirical Results
    This section reports our empirical results. Since AD measures from

developed and developing countries may have different effects, we first explore

Chinese industry and firm group reactions with added discrimination among AD

actions by developed and developing countries. Since the US and the EU are the

two main trading partners of China, it is useful to also analyze and compare

their separate AD effects.

    The global AD database (Bown, 2010) only has main countries’ AD

information. We take the US and the EU to jointly denote developed countries

(these two countries account for more than 25% of China’s total received AD

initiations and measures (WTO, 2010)); and Argentina, India, Brazil, and

Turkey as developing countries (these four countries account for about 40% of

China’s total received AD initiations and measures (WTO, 2010)).

    4.1 Impacts of AD from Developed and Developing Countries on Total

Firm Numbers, Output, Employee, Profit, Labor Productivity and Exports

    Tables 6 to 7 report our estimation results. AD from both developed

countries and developing countries adversely affect industry and firm groups’

output, employee, profit, firm numbers, and exports, but improve labor

productivity. Comparatively, profits are hurt the most; the next are employees,

firm numbers, and exports, and output is impacted the least. This suggests that

when facing an AD measure, firms decrease their prices and profits, and then

reduce employment to lower costs, but try to maintain exports and output.

Different kinds of firms also show different kinds of response to AD measures.

All firm summed industry react the most. Foreign and SOE firm groups show a

small reaction. This suggests that AD mainly influences private firms.



                                       9
Developed countries’ AD have greater negative effects than developing

countries’ on all firm summed industry and SOE firm groups. But the foreign

firm group is impacted more by developing countries’ AD. This may because

most foreign firms in China are from developed countries and they can avoid

impacts easily by intra-firm trade adjustments.

    AD measures have generally significant effects on firm numbers. Also,

variables related to one year before an investigation or the year of investigation

and measure all have significant positive effects on all firms summed industry,

and developed countries’ ADs have more influence. This suggests that firms

enter the market and increase export before AD investigation and measures

which directly induced other countries’ AD countermeasure. Variables of one

year after measure, one year after if more than one investigation and interaction

term of one year after if affirmative in developed countries and one year after if

affirmative in developing countries also have significant negative effects using all

firm summed industry data. The developed countries’ AD influence is more

pronounced than for developing countries. Foreign firms and SOE firms response

is less. Only variables of one year after if more than one investigation and the

cross term of one year after if affirmative have negative effects. SOE firms show

no significant influence for measures. In our data sample, all firms include SOE,

foreign and private firms, so these results suggest that private firms responded

more in firm numbers.

    For Chinese industrial output reaction, variables of one year after measure

and interaction terms of one year after if affirmative and one year after if more

than one investigation all have negative impacts on all firm industry output.

Developed countries’ ADs again have more impact. Variables of year of



                                         10
investigation, measure and before measure in both developed and developing

countries all have positive effects on all firm output. Foreign firm output has

little reaction which may suggest that firms can easily circumvent AD barriers.

SOE firm output shows little response; most of the reaction is by private firms.

Since continuously increasing output may be one of the reasons for AD to China,

these AD investigations and measures may exhibit simultaneity bias in our

regressions.

    Chinese industrial employee reaction also shows significant coefficients only

one year after an affirmative decision in developed countries and is significantly

negative for all firm employees. This suggests that all firm employees only

respond to developed countries’ affirmative AD measures. Variables of year of

investigation in developing countries and one year before investigation in both

developed and developing countries have positive relationships with all firm

employees. One year after if affirmative and interaction term of one year after if

more than one investigation in developed countries have large negative impacts

on foreign firm employees. Also, variables of one year after if affirmative, one

year after if more than one investigation from developing countries have negative

impacts on foreign firm employees. Foreign firm employee numbers seem more

sensitive to AD measures, which may because foreign firms are more flexible to

change their workers. SOE firm employee numbers have little reaction to both

developed and developing countries’ AD.

    Chinese industrial profit reactions suggest developed countries’ variables of

year of investigation, year of measures, one year after measures and one year

after if more than one investigation are all negatively related with all firm profits.

Developing countries’ influences here are prominently weak. Developing



                                         11
countries’ variables of one year before and year of investigation and year of

measure are all positively related to all firm profits. Total foreign firm profits are

negatively influenced by AD measures from developing countries. Although AD

measures have little impact on exports and output of foreign firms, they impact

their profit significantly. AD has little impact on the profit of SOE firms.

    As for as Chinese industrial labor productivity reaction is concerned,

developed countries’ AD investigations and measures have little effect on all firm

industrial labor productivity, only the variable of one year before investigation is

significantly positive. Developing countries’ AD variables are positively related

with labor productivity with large coefficients. This suggests that AD threats

have incentive effects on industrial labor productivity. Labor productivity

improvement for foreign firm summation industry is more than for all firms.

Foreign firms’ larger labor productivity improvement may reflect the larger

negative impact on employees than on output. In contrast, SOE firms’ industrial

labor productivity has virtually no response, but the variable of one year before

investigation has a negative influence, perhaps because SOE firms find it harder

to adjust employees in the short run when facing an AD threat.

    Finally comes Chinese industrial export reactions. We only have all firm

summation industrial data on exports. Both developed and developing

countries’ ADs have a negative influence on industrial exports, especially the

variables of year of measure and one year after if affirmative. In general,

developed countries’ AD has a greater negative influence on industrial exports

than developing countries’.

                              [Tables 6-7 around Here]

    Generally, most of the estimation results imply that private firms react



                                          12
much more than foreign and SOE firms. One reason is that Chinese private firms

are the main AD targets and most of the AD initiations and measures from

abroad are aimed at private firms.

    4.2 Specific Impacts for AD from U.S. and EU

    There is a large difference in the impact of US and EU AD measures. Since

US AD measures are aimed at specific firms, but EU AD measures are largely

against whole industries, a difference in regime affects country results.

    Tables 8 to 9 report US and EU AD estimation results. AD from US and EU

have a negative influence on industrial and firm groups’ firm numbers, output,

employees, profits and exports but have positive effects on labor productivity.

AD from US and EU have more impact than for developed and developing

countries, because the US and EU are larger trade partners for China. US AD

measures have more influence than EU’s on firm numbers, employees and

exports; and EU AD measures have more influence than US’s on outputs, profits

and labor productivity. AD from US and EU have little impact on foreign and

SOE firm groups, the same as AD from developed and developing countries.

Comparatively, foreign firms are affected more by AD from EU. This may be

because EU AD has wider scope and foreign firms in China from the EU are

relatively fewer.

    Both US and EU variables of year before investigation and measure have a

positive influence on all firm numbers. Variables of one year after if more than

one investigation from both US and EU and one year after measure from US

have significant large negative coefficients, and US’s values are bigger than the

EU, which mean that all firm numbers react significantly both to US and EU

AD and especially to US. Foreign firm numbers have no significant relationship



                                        13
with US AD but are significantly related with EU measures. SOE firm numbers

have actually no significant relationship with both US and EU AD. Overall, all

firm numbers react significantly to both US and EU AD, but foreign and SOE

firm numbers react only a little, most of the reaction is by private firms.

    Industrial output reacts only a little to both US and EU AD investigations

and measures, and EU effects are more. Foreign firm output shows little reaction

to AD from US and EU. Both countries’ AD measures have negative impacts on

SOE firm output, and also EU effects are larger.

    AD from US has significant influence on all firm industrial employees, but

AD from EU has little negative impact. Foreign firm employees respond

negatively to AD from both US and EU, and US effects are greater. Generally,

foreign firm reactions for employees are smaller than for all firms. SOE firm

employees react little. These results also show that US variable of one year after

if more than one investigation from both countries has negative influence to SOE

firm employees, and also US effect is more intensive. US AD measures seem to

have more employee effects than EU.

    The variable of one year after if more than one investigation from both

countries has significant negative impacts on all firm profits, and EU’s influence

is much larger. AD from US has little influence on foreign firm profits. But EU’s

AD has significant negative impact on foreign firm profits. This may be because

the EU is an important export partner for foreign firms. SOE firms’ profits show

little reaction to AD from both countries.

    AD from both US and EU have labor productivity incentive effects.

Variables of one year after measures and one year after if more than one

investigation from US and EU separately have positive effects on all firm labor



                                        14
productivity, and overall EU effects are bigger than US. Foreign and SOE firm

labor productivity show no significant response to AD from both countries.

      AD from both US and EU have significantly impacts on industrial exports,

and US have more influence. Overall, AD measure impacts on exports are small.

      4.3 Robustness Checks of Results

      Our empirical model contains lag terms for dependent variable, and hence

endogeneity is a potential problem. Our system GMM method can partly

overcome these endogeneity problems. We use two methods to test the validity

of the parameter estimates. The first is the Sargan over-identification test to

assess the validity of instrumental variables. If this cannot reject the null

hypothesis, it suggests that the instrumental variable is appropriate. The second

is using an AR(2) test to check for residual non-autocorrelation, that is testing

the existence of second-order residual autocorrelation.

      In the empirical results presented in Tables 6-9, all of the P values for AR(2)

test are bigger than 0.15, so there would seem to be no residual autocorrelation

problem for the estimation. All of the P values for the Sargan over identification

test reveal that instrumental variable selections are appropriate.

      In order to further check the robustness of our estimation results we

separate AD from developed and developing countries and AD from US and EU

to estimate results individually. After comparing the mixed and separate

regression results 4 , we find that AD effects from developed and developing

countries, and from US and EU are all the same in both forms of estimation.

These feasibility checks suggest that the estimates presented earlier are robust.

4
  Mixed estimation results are presented in the Tables 6 to 9. Separate estimation results for robustness checks are
omitted in the paper because of the limitation of paper length. Readers interested in these results can contact the
authors.

5. Conclusions and Policy Implications
    In conclusion, our analysis suggests that AD investigations and measures

have significant impact on Chinese industries and firm groups. AD from

developed and developing countries including US and EU all reduce firm

numbers, output, employee, profit and export, but improve labor productivity.

Comparatively, developed countries’ AD have more severe impacts than

developing countries except for the foreign firm group; and all firm summed

industry react the most. Foreign and SOE firm groups just have a little response.

     If we take the US and EU as specific country cases, we find that their

measures have larger impact than those of other developed and developing

countries. Also, US AD measures have more impact on firm numbers, employees

and exports; and EU AD measures have more impact on outputs, profits and

labor productivity. In addition, AD from both countries have only a small

impact on foreign and SOE firm groups. Foreign firm group are relatively

affected more by AD from EU.

    From these findings, we can assess overall Chinese industrial and firm

groups’ reactions to AD. They suggest that some Chinese firms have closed

down and exited the market under the pressure of AD. When we compare the

reaction of output and export, we can see that relocation may be happening

since industrial output reacts much more than exports. Firms may also choose to

sell more in domestic or export to other countries to avoid the impacts of AD.

There is no information to indicate whether producing something else has the

reaction, and also we have no data on whether firing against action.

    Our results also suggest that Chinese industry and private firm group have

been significantly hurt by AD, but exports are comparatively less affected which



                                       16
may imply trade diversion. From these results, Chinese industry and firms

seemingly might not need to care too much about AD from abroad, but firm

profit and return plus employee have been significantly affected by them, which

means firms have tried to maintain their exports by reducing costs and prices, so

that their trade conditions have deteriorated.

    We also show that SOE and foreign firm groups have been less impacted by

AD measures and most of the reactions are by private Chinese firms for they are

the main ones targeted. Also Chinese firm groups respond little to AD from

developing countries. These results suggest that only main trade partners’ AD

measures significantly influence Chinese industry and firms. Thus in guarding

AD response China should perhaps emphasize and pay more attention to main

trade partner’s measures.
