This paper studies how better access to public health insurance affects infant mortality during
pandemics. Our analysis combines cross-state variation in mandated eligibility for Medicaid with
two influenza pandemics -- the 1957-58 "Asian Flu" pandemic and the 1968-69 "Hong Kong
Flu" -- that arrived shortly before and after the program's introduction. Exploiting heterogeneity
in the underlying severity of these two shocks across counties, we find no relationship between
Medicaid eligibility and pandemic infant mortality during the 1957-58 outbreak. After Medicaid
implementation, we find that better access to insurance in high-eligibility states substantially
reduced infant mortality during the 1968-69 pandemic. The reductions in pandemic infant
mortality are too large to be attributable solely to new Medicaid recipients, suggesting that the
expansion in health insurance coverage mitigated disease transmission among the broader
population.

1       Introduction

    Does improved access to public health insurance save lives during a pandemic?
On the one hand, the health benefits from extending medical services to uninsured
populations may be especially large during a health crisis. On the other hand, the
high case volume caused by an infectious disease outbreak may overwhelm medical
resources, lowering the quality of care that patients receive.
    This paper studies how better access to public insurance affects infant mortality
during a pandemic. Our analysis combines the expansion in public insurance following
the introduction of Medicaid in 1965 with two influenza pandemics ­ the 1957-58 "Asian
Flu" pandemic and the 1968-69 "Hong Kong Flu" ­ that arrived shortly before and
after the program's introduction. Each outbreak was responsible for more than 100,000
deaths in the United States (Glezen, 1996; Simonsen et al., 1997), although pandemic
severity varied widely across localities.
    Our empirical strategy combines cross-state variation in Medicaid eligibility with
cross-county differences in underlying size of the health shock to estimate the impact
of Medicaid on pandemic-related infant mortality. We use panel data on county infant
mortality for 1950-1979. Infant health was acutely sensitive to pandemic influenza,
which affected mortality through both post-birth infection and prenatal exposure.1 To
measure state eligibility for insurance under the Medicaid program, we use information
on the share of women receiving benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program in 1965, which generated wide cross-state differences in
eligibility for Medicaid. Variation in AFDC rates across states stemmed from long-
standing institutional differences in welfare programs, and we confirm that outcomes
in high- and low-AFDC states trended similarly prior to 1965 (Goodman-Bacon, 2018).

    1
    Pregnant mothers were particularly susceptible to pandemic infection, and in utero exposure has
been linked to a range of negative short- and long-run outcomes in infants.

                                                1
   To measure cross-county heterogeneity in the magnitude of the health shocks, we
focus on two predictors of pandemic severity: urbanization ­ measured by the county
urban population share, and local air pollution ­ measured by total capacity of coal-
fired power plants, which were the leading source of air pollution by mid-century (see
Figure A.2). Both factors have been linked to pandemic severity (Clay, Lewis and
Severnini, 2018, 2019; Aiello et al., 2010; Gosc´
                                                e, Barton and Johansson, 2014), and we
document a strong relationship between each county-level measure and excess infant
mortality during both pandemics.
   We adopt a triple-difference estimation strategy that compares the deviation from
trend in infant mortality in pandemic years (first difference) across counties that were
more or less exposed to the shock (second difference) across states with higher or lower
AFDC-based Medicaid eligibility (third difference). Additionally, we explore how these
relationships differ across the two pandemics that occurred before and after Medicaid
implementation (fourth difference).
   We find that expansions in healthcare access from Medicaid substantially miti-
gated the severity of the 1968-69 pandemic. The point estimates for infant mortality
are large, negative, and statistically significant. The effects are stable across various
specifications and unaffected by county-level controls. In contrast, we find no rela-
tionship between future Medicaid expansions and infant mortality during the 1957-58
influenza pandemic, supporting our identifying assumption that the 1968-69 outbreak
would have been similarly severe across states absent the expansion in health insurance
under Medicaid.
   The effects are quantitatively meaningful. We estimate that better access to public
health insurance in high-AFDC states led to a 6 to 7 percent decrease in infant mortality
during the 1968-69 pandemic, averting between 2,646 and 2,777 infant deaths. These
effects represent mortality reductions over and above the health benefits of public


                                           2
insurance in non-pandemic years. Comparing the size of the mortality effects to the
expansion in coverage under Medicaid, we find that the health improvements were
too large to have accrued solely to newly insured households. Instead, the results are
consistent with a local health externality, in which improved healthcare access among
a subset of households reduced disease transmission to the broader population.
   Why did expansions in insurance eligibility mitigate pandemic-related infant mor-
tality? The results appear to have been driven by improved access to physician services
and hospital care, consistent with experimental evidence on the effects of Medicaid ex-
pansions in the 2000s (Finkelstein et al., 2012; Baicker et al., 2013; Taubman et al.,
2014; Finkelstein et al., 2016; Baicker et al., 2017). Comparing the effects by age
of death within the first year, we find that health benefits from Medicaid were con-
centrated during the first hours after birth. These patterns could reflect impacts on
newborn health through improved maternal health or better access to acute care during
and immediately after delivery (Currie and Schwandt, 2013; Schwandt, 2018; Almond
et al., 2010). We also estimate differential effects for non-white relative to white infant
mortality that are roughly proportional to the racial differences in categorical eligibility
for Medicaid.
   This paper contributes to the literature on pandemics. The risk of global pandemics
represents a substantial cost to societies due to both the economic disruption and the
loss of life (Fan, Jamison, and Summers, 2016). Scholars have focused on the 1918
Spanish Flu Pandemic, and a large medical literature has sought to understand the
characteristics of the H1N1 strain responsible for the pandemic (see Taubenberger and
Morens, 2006). Economists have also explored the long-run health and economic effects
of in utero exposure (Almond, 2006; Beach et al., 2017). Much less is known about
what can be done to mitigate the threat posed by pandemics. Researchers generally
consider public interventions to have had little impact on transmission during the 1918


                                             3
Spanish Flu (Brainerd and Siegler, 2003; Crosby, 1989).2 Our results suggest that
improved access to medical care, through expansions in public insurance, may play an
important role in reducing mortality during an outbreak.
    This paper also contributes to the literature on the impact of public insurance on
health. Despite extensive research, evidence on the health benefits of public health
insurance has been mixed. Goodman-Bacon (2018) and Currie and Gruber (1996) find
that the introduction of Medicaid in 1965 and subsequent expansions in eligibility in
the 1980s led to improved health outcomes. In contrast, evidence from the Oregon
Health Insurance Experiment shows increased health care utilization, and improved
self-reported health, but no effects on clinical measures or one-year mortality (Baicker
et al., 2013; Finkelstein et al., 2012). Whereas studies typically focus on the health
impacts immediately following eligibility expansions, our results show that the benefits
may be especially large during periodic health crises.
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a historical background on the
flu pandemics of 1957-58 and 1968-69 as well as on the roll out of Medicaid. Section 3
describes the data used in the analysis, and discusses some descriptive statistics. Sec-
tion 4 presents the empirical strategy; Section 5 reports the results; Section 6 explores
the quantitative impacts of Medicaid on pandemic mortality; and Section 7 concludes.



2       Background

2.1     The Influenza Pandemics of 1957-58 and 1968-69

    Influenza pandemics are infrequent events that spread on a global scale. In February
1957, a new influenza A (H2N2) virus emerged in East Asia, triggering the "Asian Flu

    2
    In contrast, Bootsma and Ferguson (2007) and Markel et al (2007), find evidence that non-
pharmaceutical interventions reduced pandemic mortality.

                                             4
Pandemic." The virus reached U.S. coastal cities in the summer of 1957. Initially,
there were few infections, although there was an upsurge in cases during a second
pandemic wave that struck in October and November of 1957. An estimated 25% of
the U.S. population was infected during this two month period (Henderson et al., 2009;
Trotter Jr et al., 1959). By March, 69,800 pandemic-related deaths had occurred in
the U.S., and by its end the pandemic is estimated to have killed 116,000 Americans
(CDC and Diseases, 2018).
    A second influenza pandemic hit the U.S. roughly a decade later. The "Hong Kong
Influenza Pandemic" of 1968-69 was a global outbreak that originated in China in July
1968. The pandemic was caused by the influenza A (H3N2) virus. It arrived in the
United States in September 1968. Although the virus was highly contagious, the case-
fatality rates were significantly lower than the Asian Flu, and overall U.S. mortality
rates were estimated to be 100,000 (CDC and Diseases, 2018).
    Vaccination had little impact on the spread of either pandemic (WHO, 2009). An
effective vaccine was not developed during the 1968-69 pandemic. During the "Asian
Flu" pandemic vaccines were developed by the summer of 1957, but by the pandemic's
peak, there was enough supply for just 17 percent of the U.S. population. For those
who received a vaccine, the effectiveness ranged from 53-60%. Similarly, preventative
public health measures such as quarantines and closures were not widely implemented
during either outbreak, and they had minimal influence on disease transmission.3
    Pandemic severity varied across locations within the United States and worldwide.
Two factors were important determinants of severity during the 1918-1919 pandemic:
urban density and air pollution (Clay, Lewis and Severnini, 2018, 2019). Greater

   3
      The Association of State and Territorial Health Officers (ASTHO) stated that "there is no prac-
tical advantage in the closing of schools or the curtailment of public gatherings as it relates to the
spread of this disease. (Henderson et al., 2009, p. 267). Quarantines were viewed as ineffective given
"the large number of travellers and the frequency of mild or inapparent cases" (Trotter Jr et al., 1959,
p. 36).

                                                   5
interactions in densely populated areas increased rates of transmission (Aiello et al.,
2010; Gosc´
          e, Barton and Johansson, 2014). Meanwhile, air pollution can increase
susceptibility to viral infection and heighten the risk of severe complications, post-
infection (Jakab, 1993; Jaspers et al., 2005).4 As we show below, these factors also
contributed to the severity of the two mid-century pandemics.5
    Infants were acutely sensitive to pandemic influenza through both in utero expo-
sure and post-birth infection, and infant mortality rose sharply during both pandemic
periods (Figure 1). In utero exposure to influenza has been linked to decreased birth-
weight (Currie and Schwandt, 2013; Schwandt, 2018), and prenatal exposure to the
1918-19 pandemic had negative effects on long-run health and labor market outcomes
(Almond, 2006; Nelson, 2010; Neelsen and Stratmann, 2012; Lin and Liu, 2014).6 Kelly
(2011) finds negative effects of the 1957-58 pandemic on birth outcomes and cognitive
development in Britain. Infants were also susceptible to post-neonatal influenza infec-
tion, particularly through secondary bacterial pneumonia infection, which was often
deadly without intravenous antibiotic and fluid treatment in hospital (Almond, Chay
and Greenstone, 2006).


2.2     Medicaid

    The Social Security Amendments of 1965 established the Medicaid program, with
the goal to improve medical access to the poor and reduce inequalities in health. Since
the 1950s, the federal government had provided matching grants to states to provide
medical care to the poor. Nevertheless, these payments were limited and states var-
   4
      Air pollution also appears to contribute to mortality during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic
(Wu et al., 2020).
    5
      Humidity has also been identified as a determinant of seasonal influenza mortality in urban
counties (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012), however, we find no evidence that it contributed to mortality
during either pandemic period.
    6
      Williams and Mackenzie (1977) find adverse effects of exposure to influenza in mice including
increased maternal and neonatal mortality and decreased growth rates of neonates.

                                                 6
ied widely in their funding for low-income individuals. The introduction of Medicaid
program increased access to medical services among the nation's poor, especially for
children and pregnant women.
   Under Medicaid, the federal government expanded payments to states for the costs
of providing health services to eligible individuals. The program eliminated caps on
federal financing and increased the federal reimbursement rate. While there was con-
siderable latitude in how states set up their medical assistance programs, states were
required to extend coverage by 1970 or else lose federal reimbursements for existing
medical programs. Twenty-six states adopted Medicaid in 1966, 11 in 1967, and the
rest between 1968 and 1970, except Alaska (1972) and Arizona (1982). In the five years
after Medicaid implementation, the share of children with public insurance increased
by 10 percentage points, and the share of adults increased by 2 percent. (Goodman-
Bacon, 2018).
   The Medicaid program mandated coverage for recipients of federally funded welfare
programs, which led to a close link between welfare program participation and Medicaid
eligibility. As a result of underlying state-specific demographics and welfare program
funding, there were significant cross-state differences in the size of the population
eligible for Medicaid beginning in 1965. Given the low employment rates among the
eligible population, Medicaid coverage represented new access to insurance as there
was little scope for crowd-out of existing private insurance. Previous research has
documented a close link between state AFDC recipiency rates and subsequent increases
in public health insurance following Medicaid implementation (Goodman-Bacon, 2018).
   There are a number of channels through which access to public health insurance
may have mitigated pandemic infant mortality. For infants who contracted influenza
after birth, there were effective treatments for secondary bacterial pneumonia. These
treatments included intravenously antibiotics and fluids which were administered in


                                          7
hospitals and may have directly reduced post-neonatal mortality.7 Medical interven-
tions may also have mitigated the effects of in utero exposure by reducing complications
during pregnancy, thereby improving infant health at birth. Conditional on maternal
health, Medicaid may have decreased neonatal mortality rates during the pandemic.
Given the heightened risk of low-birthweight deliveries due to influenza infection, infant
health may have improved due to better care during delivery and access to postnatal
treatments such as oxygenated incubators (Richards et al., 2013). Because of this, our
analysis focuses on pandemic and non-pandemic years, and on pandemics that occurred
shortly before and after the introduction of Medicaid.



3       Data

    To study the effects of Medicaid eligibility on pandemic mortality, we combine
annual county-level health outcomes, state-level information on insurance eligibility,
and underlying county-level characteristics that influenced pandemic severity.
    Our main health outcome is the infant mortality rate, measured as the number of
infant deaths per 1,000 live births. We obtain annual county-level infant mortality
from 1950 to 1979 from the Vital Statistics (Bailey et al., 2018).
    To measure eligibility for coverage under the Medicaid program, we use state-level
information on the share of women receiving benefits under AFDC in 1965 (Goodman-
Bacon, 2018). Given the close link between welfare participation and Medicaid enroll-
ment, this variable captures cross-state differences in the size of the population eligible
for the program. We focus on female AFDC participation, given its importance for
both prenatal and postnatal healthcare access. We construct an indicator above- ver-

    7
    Infants rarely contracted influenza during the first month of life. Regarding the prognosis for
pneumonia, a 1964 pediatrics textbook stated: "The outcome is dependent on early diagnosis and the
appropriateness of treatment" (Nelson, 1964, pp.847-848).

                                                8
sus below-median state Medicaid eligibility based on this variable. Figure A.1 displays
states with above- and below-median AFDC-based eligibility, with diagonal lines iden-
tifying states that implemented Medicaid prior to 1968.
   To identify heterogeneity in the size of the health shocks, we focus on two predictors
of pandemic severity across counties: air pollution and urbanization. We proxy local
air pollution by total capacity of coal-fired power plants within the county boundaries
(Clay, Lewis and Severnini, 2016).8 Coal-fired electricity generation was the leading
source of air pollution by mid-century (Figure A.2). The dispersion of power plant
emissions was localized, with more than 90 percent of particulate matter falling within
a 30-mile radius of the plant (Levy et al., 2002).
   Our second county-level predictor of pandemic severity is the urban population
share, given the link between crowding and disease spread (Clay, Lewis and Severnini,
2019; Aiello et al., 2010; Gosc´
                               e, Barton and Johansson, 2014). Both county-level pre-
dictors are measured in 1965.9 Figure A.3 shows the distribution of coal capacity and
percent urban across counties.10
   We draw on several additional sources for county-level covariates. These include
baseline county demographic and economic characteristics from Haines and ICPSR
(2010); transportation infrastructure (miles of railway lines in 1911 whether the county
was intersected by the 1944 Interstate Highway System Plan) from Baum-Snow (2007)
and Michaels (2008); and the number of hospital beds per capita from (Chung, Gaynor
and Richards-Shubik, 2017).




   8
      Direct measures air pollution are limited through the 1960s. Data for a sample of 85 counties
with air quality monitoring show a strong relationship between local coal-fired capacity and TSP
concentrations (Table A.1).
    9
      Results based on 1955 values for coal capacity and percent urban are similar in magnitude.
   10
      Table A.2 also provides summary statistics for the all the main variables in the analysis.

                                                9
4         Empirical Strategy

     To examine the role of Medicaid in offsetting the impacts of health shocks, we
estimate the following triple difference regression:



IM Rct = 1 (P and57t × M odc ) + 2 (P and68t × M odc )

            + 3 (P and57t × M odc × HighAF DCs ) + 4 (P and68t × M odc × HighAF DCs )

            + 5 (M odc × P ost65t ) + c + st + Xct + t Zc,baseline +       ct                 (1)


where IM Rct denotes infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births in county c in year t.
The variables P and57t and P and68t are dummies for the 1957-58 Asian Flu and the
1968-69 Hong Kong Flu pandemics. The term M odc denotes county-level modifiers
(coal capacity, percent urban) that may have contributed to the underlying severity of
the two pandemics, while HighAF DCs is an indicator for states that had above-median
AFDC-based Medicaid eligibility.
     The regression includes controls for county fixed effects, c , and state-by-year fixed
effects, st , and annual climatic variables, Xct , that may have influenced disease spread
(precipitation, average temperature, days above 29 degrees Celsius, and days below
10 degrees Celsius).         We also include a vector of linear trends based on baseline
county characteristics, t Zc,baseline . The factors include baseline socioeconomic con-
ditions (population density, percent white, percent aged 25 plus with a high school
degree, and median family income, all measured in 1950). In addition, Zc,baseline in-
cludes several factors that have been specifically linked to pandemic severity including
1) baseline population health (measured as the infant mortality rate from 1927 to
1945), which captures potential susceptibility to a negative health shock,11 2) manu-
    11
         This extended time horizon is meant to capture underlying maternal health, which may have

                                                  10
facturing employment in 1950, which was an alternate source of local air pollution, 3)
transportation infrastructure (mileage of railways, rivers, and the 1944 planned Inter-
state highway system), which may have contributed to the spread of the virus, and 4)
healthcare infrastructure (per capita hospital beds in 1948).
    The coefficients 1 and 2 identify the relationship between county-level modi-
fiers and pandemic infant mortality in low-AFDC eligibility states. These coefficients
capture the extent to which within-state variation in excess pandemic mortality was
systematically related to baseline coal capacity and percent urban. The estimated co-
efficients provide a measure of underlying heterogeneity in severity of the health shocks
according to these two county-level predictors.
    The main coefficient estimates of interest are 3 and 4 . These coefficients capture
the differential in the pandemic-modifier gradient in high AFDC-based eligibility states
relative to low eligibility states during both the 1957-58 Asian Flu and the 1968-69 Hong
Kong Flu pandemics. The estimates of 4 capture the extent to which the relative
expansion in AFDC-based public insurance under Medicaid mitigated infant mortality
in counties that were exposed to particularly severe health shocks. Meanwhile, the
estimates of 3 allow us to test whether there were pre-existing differences between high-
and low-AFDC states that contributed to within-state heterogeneity in the severity of
the pandemic.
    Our identification assumption is that within-state heterogeneity in pandemic sever-
ity would have been similar across high- and low-AFDC states absent the implemen-
tation of Medicaid. This assumption is supported by three pieces of evidence.
    First, AFDC-based Medicaid eligibility was based on long-standing institutional
and demographic differences across states. Factors that influenced state-level eligibil-
ity, including long-run institutional barriers, family structure, and household incomes,

influenced susceptibility to the pandemic shocks.

                                                    11
had differed across states since the 1930s (Alston and Ferrie, 1985; Moehling, 2007).
Moreover, AFDC rates were stable across states in the decades prior to Medicaid,
suggesting no anticipatory changes in welfare generosity (Goodman-Bacon, 2018).
    Second, we find little evidence that state AFDC eligibility are correlated with levels
or trends in state socioeconomic conditions. Table A.3 presents results from balancing
tests for differences in levels and trends in pre-1965 characteristics across states with
different rates of AFDC eligibility.12 We find no evidence of differential trends according
to state AFDC eligibility. The coefficient estimates for 0 and 1 are all small and
(with the exception of percent white) statistically insignificant. The overall patterns
are consistent with the results of Goodman-Bacon (2018), who finds that welfare-
based eligibility is uncorrelated with either the levels or trends across a range of state
characteristics.
    Third, the estimates of 3 from equation (1) allow us to directly test whether there
were unobservable differences across high- and low-AFDC states that impacted within-
state heterogeneity in pandemic-related infant mortality. The results (reported below
in section 5), are all statistically insignificant and small in magnitude, supporting our
research design.
    Two final estimation details are worth mentioning. First, robust standard errors are
clustered at the county-level to adjust for heteroskedasticity and within-county serial
correlation.13 Second, all regressions are weighted by the number of live births.

ences in trends.

5        Results

5.1      Coal Capacity, Percent Urban, and the Impact of Medi-

         caid on Pandemic Mortality

     The first set of results explore heterogeneity in pandemic severity according to coal
capacity and urbanization and evaluates the extent to which greater access to public
insurance offsets excess mortality. Table 1 reports the estimates of 1 - 4 from different
versions of equation (1). Columns 1-2 report the results for coal capacity, columns 3-4
report the results for percent urban. We report results from two different specifications.
Odd columns report the estimates from models that include the baseline controls for
county fixed effects, state-by-year fixed effects, temperature and precipitation, and
linear time trends according to baseline county socioeconomic conditions. In even
columns, we report results based on the full set of controls.14
     The estimates of the coal-pandemic interactions terms, 1 and 2 , reveal substantial
within-state heterogeneity in excess pandemic mortality according to baseline county
coal capacity (cols. 1-2). The coefficient estimates are positive and statistically sig-
nificant, consistent with previous research suggesting that poor air quality exacerbates
influenza severity (Clay, Lewis and Severnini, 2018; Hanlon, 2018). We find similar dif-
ferentials in pandemic mortality in counties with a larger percentage of urban residents
(cols. 3-4). The coefficient estimates for 1 and 2 are positive, statistically significant,
and similar in magnitude across the two pandemics. The patterns are consistent with
previous research on heightened transmission in densely populated areas (Clay, Lewis
and Severnini, 2019; Aiello et al., 2010; Gosc´
                                              e, Barton and Johansson, 2014).
     The triple interaction estimates suggest that better access to public health insurance

Table A.5 reports results that progressively add each group of covariates.

                                                13
under Medicaid significantly reduced excess pandemic mortality in polluted and urban
areas. For coal capacity, the coefficients on the 1968-69 pandemic triple interaction
term, 4 , are negative and statistically significant, and similar in magnitude to the
main coal-pandemic interaction effects (cols. 1-2). The positive coal capacity-pandemic
mortality gradient in low-AFDC states did not exist in high-AFDC states during the
1968-69 pandemic, suggesting that better access to healthcare substantially mitigated
the impact of the severe health shock. For percent urban, the estimates on the 1968-
69 triple interaction term are also negative and statistically significant, implying that
better access to healthcare largely offset the differential impact of the shock in urban
areas.
   We also report the coefficient estimates for 3 , the triple interaction term for the
1957-58 pandemic. These estimates identify average differences in the pandemic mor-
tality gradient in high-AFDC states relative to low-AFDC states prior to the enact-
ment of Medicaid. Across the various specifications the point estimates are small and
statistically insignificant, and hypothesis tests for the equality of the two triple interac-
tion coefficients are rejected at a 10 percent significance level. These findings provide
further support for our identifying assumption that absent Medicaid implementation,
within-state heterogeneity in pandemic severity would have been similar across high-
and low-AFDC states.
   Table 1 columns 5-6 report the results from horserace regressions that include in-
teractions effects for both coal capacity and percent urban. These models capture
the independent link between each factor and pandemic severity, and the extent to
which these relationships were mitigated by the Medicaid implementation. The goal
of this exercise is not to establish the relative impact of each factor on pandemic
severity, but rather the extent to which both coal capacity and percent urban reflect




                                             14
two independent sources of heterogeneity in pandemic severity.15 The main pandemic
interaction effects for coal and percent urban remain positive, albeit smaller in magni-
tude, consistent with the concentration of coal-fired generation near urban areas. The
triple interactions effects for 1968-69 pandemic for coal and percent urban are nega-
tive and statistically significant, and roughly two-thirds the magnitude of the previous
estimates. In contrast, the triple interaction estimates for the 1957-58 pandemic are
small and statistically insignificant. Together, these results suggest that better access
to healthcare following Medicaid implementation significantly offset both sources of
excess pandemic mortality in high-AFDC states.


5.2     Robustness Exercises

   We assess whether the observed link between AFDC recipiency and excess mortality
during the 1968-69 pandemic might reflect the impact of other social policies that were
adopted in the 1960s under the War on Poverty. We focus on two major policies
­ Head Start and the Food Stamps program ­ both of which have been linked to
relative improvements in infant health (Ludwig and Miller, 2007; Almond, Hoynes
and Schanzenbach, 2011). We estimate versions of equation (1) that include triple
interaction terms for above median per capita state expenditure under Head Start
(per 1,000 children aged 1 to 9) and the Food Stamps program along with the main
AFDC-based term. To address concerns that implementation of these other two welfare
programs was influenced by underlying state health conditions, we report all triple
interaction effects in differences (post- versus pre-Medicaid): 4 - 3 .
   Table 2 reports the results. For reference, column 1 reports the results for AFDC,
based on Table 1 (cols. 2 and 4). The inclusion of interactions based on per capita

  15
    This decomposition will also allow us to estimate the quantitative impact of Medicaid on coal-
and urban-based pandemic infant mortality (see Section 6).

                                               15
spending on Head Start or the Food Stamps program has little impact on the main
AFDC interaction effects, and the point estimates for these other programs are small
in magnitude and statistically insignificant (cols. 2,3). Together, these results suggest
that relative decreases in excess pandemic mortality in high-AFDC states cannot be
attributed to contemporaneous adoption of War on Poverty programs.
    Table A.6 reports the results from several additional robustness tests. For refer-
ence, column 1 presents the baseline results. Column 2 reports estimates for a restricted
sample of states that had implemented Medicaid by 1967, prior to the onset of the pan-
demic.16 This restriction addresses concerns regarding endogeneity in state decisions
to implement Medicaid, which may have been influenced by the pandemic itself. The
results from these regressions are similar to the baseline findings in sign, significance,
and magnitude. We also report estimates from regressions for sub-samples with pos-
itive coal capacity (col. 3) and with non-zero urban population (col. 4). Despite the
decreases in sample size, the findings are similar to the baseline results. Column 5
reports results from an unbalanced sample that includes an additional 109 counties
with incomplete data.17 The estimates are similar in terms of sign, significance, and
size.


5.3     Pandemic Infant Mortality by Age and Race

    Table 3 reports estimates for infant mortality by age at death (first day, days 2-
27, post-neonatal, and first year) and by race.18 Panel A reports the effects by coal
capacity; Panel B reports the effects by percent urban; and Panel C reports the results

  16
      This restriction excludes 11 states that implemented Medicaid between 1968 and 1970, as well
as Alaska (1972) and Arizona (1982).
   17
      These counties either had missing information on infant mortality in at least one year or lacked
information on hospital beds per capita or median household income.
   18
      County-level infant mortality data by age of death and race are available beginning in 1960 and
in 1962, respectively.

                                                 16
from regressions that include both factors.
    Columns 1 to 4 report the interaction effects by age. The results show that nearly
of the impact of Medicaid on coal-related pandemic mortality occurred during the
first day of life. The point estimates for first day mortality are negative and statisti-
cally significant, and similar in magnitude to the total effects on one year mortality.
The expansion in Medicaid may have reduced day one mortality through a number of
channels. Greater access to healthcare services may have improved in utero health by
mitigating the severity of influenza and secondary pneumonia infection among preg-
nant mothers.19 Better access to acute care, such as early heartbeat detection and
oxygenated respirators, may have increased survival conditional on health at birth.20
Finally, better access to public insurance may have decreased local transmission of the
virus, thereby reducing the likelihood of maternal infection even among non-Medicaid
recipients.21
    We find significant effects of Medicaid implementation on urban-related pandemic
mortality for both day one mortality and post-neonatal mortality. The estimated
effects on day one pandemic-related mortality could reflect a combination of improved
in utero health and better access to healthcare technologies during and after delivery.
Meanwhile, the significant effects on post-neonatal mortality also suggest improved
survival among infants who directly contracted the virus. These findings are supported
by evidence on the importance of improved hospital access for the treatment of post-
neonatal infectious disease (Almond, Chay and Greenstone, 2006).
    Table 3 (col. 5) reports results from regressions that allow the effects on infant

  19
      We find no significant impact of Medicaid implementation on maternal mortality (Table A.7),
consistent with the fact that excess mortality during the 1968-69 Pandemic was largely limited to
infants and the elderly.
   20
      Because county-level information on measures of health at birth, such as birthweight or Apgar
scores, are not available prior to the 1968 pandemic, we are unable to evaluate the relative importance
of these two channels.
   21
      We explore the role of local health externalities in Section 6.

                                                  17
mortality to differ by race.22 The estimates reveal systematically larger impacts of
Medicaid eligibility on non-white infant mortality. In both the coal capacity and per-
cent urban models, we estimate significantly larger reductions in nonwhite pandemic
infant mortality in high-AFDC states. These differential impacts range from a factor
of three in the coal capacity regression to a factor of six in the percent urban regres-
sion. Interestingly, these differential health impacts correspond roughly to the fivefold
difference in AFDC eligibility across white and non-white households. The results also
support previous research on the disproportionate impacts of Medicaid on nonwhite
infant and child mortality (Goodman-Bacon, 2018).
   Together, the results allow us to rule out hospital desegregation as an alternative ex-
planation for the observed Medicaid impacts. First, excluding states that implemented
Medicaid after 1967 ­ the majority of which were located in the South ­ has no impact
on the main estimates (Table A.6, col. 2).23 Second, the estimated decreases in infant
mortality were concentrated among neonates (Table 3, cols. 1-4), whose health was
largely unaffected by southern hospital desegregation (Almond, Chay and Greenstone,
2006). Third, the decreases in pandemic-related infant deaths occurred among both
white and non-white infants in proportions that were roughly similar to their rates of
AFDC eligibility (Table 3, col. 5).




  22
      White and Non-white infant mortality rates are calculated as the number of infant deaths per
1,000 live births, with both numerator and denominator measured separately by race.
   23
      Whereas hospital desegregation occurred shortly after 1965, most southern states implemented
Medicaid in 1970. In fact, the only southern state with above median AFDC eligibility to implement
Medicaid by 1967 was Oklahoma.

6.1      Impacts on Pandemic Infant Deaths

     In this section, we explore the quantitative implications of the findings to evaluate
how the expansion in health insurance under Medicaid mitigated the infant mortality
burden during the 1968-69 pandemic.
     We calculate how better access to health insurance through Medicaid mitigated
excess pandemic infant mortality associated with local coal capacity and urbanization
across high- and low-AFDC states. To obtain the estimated pandemic mortality dif-
ferentials, we multiply the triple interaction coefficients by the county-level means for
coal capacity and urbanization. We report the results based on the 1968-69 triple in-
teraction effect, 4 . We also report estimates based on the difference in the interaction
effects across the two pandemics, 4 - 3 , to account for any underlying differences
in the coal- and urban-pandemic mortality relationship across high- and low-AFDC
states.24
     Table 4, Panel A reports the estimates for coal capacity. The preferred point
estimates imply that better access to health insurance in high-AFDC states offset excess
pandemic infant mortality rate by 0.26 (= (0.071 - 0.023) × 5.49) to 0.39 (0.071 × 5.49)
per 1,000 live births.25 We combine these relative decreases in excess infant mortality
with the size of the exposed population to calculate the number of infant deaths averted.
The preferred estimates imply that the relative expansion of public insurance in high-
AFDC states averted 514 to 760 infant deaths.26

    24
      The two approaches yield similar quantitative findings, since the estimates for 3 are all small
and statistically insignificant (Table 1).
   25
      The county-level mean for coal capacity, 5.49, is weighted by total live births to capture average
infant exposure across high-AFDC states.
   26
      These estimates are obtained by multiplying the implied infant mortality reductions by the total
number of exposed infant in high-AFDC states. For example, the effect implied in col. 1 is given by
4 /1, 000 × Number of live births = 0.00039 × 1, 950, 135 = 760.

                                                  19
   Panel B reports the results for the combined effects of coal capacity and urbaniza-
tion (Table 1, col. 6). The expansion in public health insurance significantly offset
the pandemic mortality burden. We estimate relative decreases in excess pandemic
mortality ranging from 1.36 to 1.42 per 1,000 live births, a 6 percent decrease in the
overall infant mortality rate. By mitigating severe pandemic shocks in high coal and
urban areas, the relative expansion of public insurance averted between 2,646 and 2,777
infant deaths in high-AFDC states.


6.2    Medicaid Recipients and Local Health Externalities

   To conclude the analysis, we explore whether the effects on pandemic infant mor-
tality can be attributed solely to new insurance coverage among the Medicaid eligible
population. We estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET), dividing
the triple-difference estimates by the cross-state difference in insurance access implied
by a first-stage regression of overall children's insurance rates on the fraction of women
age 15-44 on AFDC. The resulting estimates capture the pandemic mortality per pro-
gram beneficiary.
   We find that the effects on pandemic infant mortality are too large to be attributed
solely to newly insured households. The ATETs for the joint effect of coal- and urban-
related pandemic mortality range from 23.6 to 24.8 (Table 4 Panel C, cols. 3-4). Even
adjusting for higher underlying infant mortality rates among the Medicaid eligible pop-
ulation, these estimates imply reductions in infant mortality of more than 70 percent
among newly insured households. These effect sizes are implausibly large, and strongly
suggest that the health benefits from Medicaid implementation extended beyond newly
insured households.
   Our pandemic ATET estimates are substantially larger than the average effects of
Medicaid of infant health across both pandemic and non-pandemic years (Goodman-

                                           20
Bacon, 2018). In normal times, Medicaid's effects should be concentrated among recip-
ient households whose access to medical services was directly affected by the program.
During the pandemic, however, expansions in public insurance may influence local dis-
ease transmission and generate health externalities to non-recipient households. Bet-
ter access to doctors may increase the likelihood that parents isolated sick children at
home. Access to better healthcare may decrease viral load and shorten the period of
contagion. The shift from home-based to hospital care for those with acute illnesses
may further reduce transmission through an isolation effect. Understanding the role of
the health system in influencing disease transmission may be a fruitful area of future
research.



7     Conclusion

    This paper provides new evidence on the role of public health insurance in mitigat-
ing pandemic severity. Our research strategy leverages cross-state variation in Medicaid
implementation with two influenza pandemics that arrived shortly before and after the
program's passage. Prior to Medicaid implementation, we find no relationship between
excess mortality during the 1957-58 "Asian Flu Pandemic." After Medicaid implemen-
tation, we find that better access to healthcare significantly reduced infant mortality
during the 1968-69 "Hong Kong Flu Pandemic." The effects on mortality were size-
able and too large to be solely attributable to newly insured households. Instead, our
findings suggest that better access to healthcare services for a subset of the population
reduced local transmission more broadly.
    Our findings provide new insights into the health benefits of public insurance.
Whereas previous research on the health impacts of Medicaid have been mixed (Cur-
rie and Gruber, 1996; Goodman-Bacon, 2018; Baicker et al., 2013; Finkelstein et al.,


                                           21
2012), our results show that the potential for public healthcare to save lives may be
particularly large during periodic health crises. Because these episodes arrive infre-
quently, however, the benefits may not be captured by policy evaluations focused on
immediate aftermath of implementation.
   Pandemics pose a continued threat to population health. Despite modern testing
capabilities and contact tracing, governments have struggled to contain the ongoing
spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By demonstrating the value of
improved healthcare access in reducing pandemic severity, this study's findings may
have relevance for the mitigation of current and future outbreaks. Understanding how
best to integrate the public and medical response to limit the spread and lethality of
infectious disease outbreaks is a critical area for future research.

Notes : This table reports the main coefficients of interest estimated of equation (1) for coal capacity and percent
urban. The baseline control include state-by-year and county fixed effects, temperature and precipitation vari-
ables (five bins each), and linear time trends in county-level baseline socioeconomic characteristics (population
density, percent white, percent age 25+ with high school, and median family income (all measured in 1950). The
full controls include the differential time trends according to manufacturing employment in 1950, and terciles
of baseline IMR (averaged over the period 1927 to 1945), transportation infrastructure (mileage of navigable
rivers, mileage of railroads, and an indicator for whether a county was supposed to receive a highway from the
1944 Interstate Highway System Plan), and hospital beds per capita in 1948. Standard errors clustered at the
county level are reported in parentheses. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1 percent level, ** at the
5 percent level, and * at the 10 percent level. P-value of the t-test on the equality of 3 , the coefficient of P
1957-58 x AFDC x Modifier, and 4 , the coefficient of P 1968-69 x AFDC x Modifier are reported.

      Notes : This table reports regressions on infant mortality by age of death and by race. County-level data
      on infant mortality by race and by age are available beginning in 1960 and 1962, respectively. Panel A
      reports the triple interactions estimates of 4 for coal capacity, Panel B reports the estimates for percent
      urban, and Panel C reports the estimates from models that include both coal capacity and percent urban.
      All regressions report the full controls described in Table 1. Standard errors clustered at the county level
      are reported in parentheses. *** denotes statistical significance at the 1 percent level, ** at the 5 percent
      level, and * at the 10 percent level.

Notes : Panel A reports the implied differentials in the infant mortality rate between high- and low-AFDC states
due to the relative declines in excess pandemic infant mortality. Columns 1-2 report the effects based on coal
capacity (based on Table 1, col. 2), columns 3-4 report the cumulative effects for coal capacity and percent
urban (based on Table 1, col. 6). These estimates are derived by multiply the triple interaction coefficient
estimates by average infant exposure to coal capacity and percent urban in high-AFDC states. Panel B reports
the implied decrease in total number infant deaths in high-AFDC states based on the reported in Panel A.
Panel C reports the proportional effects of Medicaid on the infant mortality rate of newly insured recipients:
the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET). These effects were obtained by dividing the reduced form
estimates in Panel A by the first-stage relationship between state-level AFDC eligibility and public insurance
recipiency: coefficient (s.e.) = 3.83 (0.94) (Goodman-Bacon, 2018). We derive confidence intervals for Panel C
based on bootstrap draws from normal distributions with means and standard deviations equal to the coefficient
estimates and standard errors from the reduced-form and first-stage regressions. The 95% confidence intervals
are reported in square brackets.

                   Column (1) reports the baseline estimates from column 2 and column 4
                   in Table 1. Column 2 reports results for the subsample of 34 states that
                   implemented Medicaid by 1967. Columns 3 and 4 shows results for coun-
                   ties with positive coal capacity and positive urban population. Column 5
                   includes an additional 109 counties (in Ma and VA) which either have miss-
                   ing information on infant mortality (in various non-pandemic years) or lack
                   information on hospital beds per capita or median family income. These
                   regressions exclude the latter two variables as covariates.
