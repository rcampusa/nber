                                           ABSTRACT

India’s case fatality rate (CFR) under covid-19 is strikingly low, trending from 3% or more, to a
current level of around 2.2%. The world average rate is far higher, at around 4%. Several
observers have noted that this difference is at least partly due to India’s younger age distribution.
In this paper, we use age-specific fatality rates from 14 comparison countries, coupled with
India’s distribution of covid-19 cases to “predict" what India’s CFR would be with those age-
specific rates. In most cases, those predictions are lower than India’s actual performance,
suggesting that India’s CFR is, if anything, too high rather than too low. We supplement the
prediction exercises with the application of a decomposition technique, and we additionally
account for time lags between case incidence and death, for a more relevant cross-country
perspective in the growth phase of the pandemic.

Abstract. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) under covid-19 is strikingly low, trending from
3% or more, to a current level of around 2.2%. The world average rate is far higher,
at around 4%. Several observers have noted that this difference is at least partly due
to India’s younger age distribution. In this paper, we use age-specific fatality rates
from 14 comparison countries, coupled with India’s distribution of covid-19 cases to
“predict" what India’s CFR would be with those age-specific rates. In most cases, those
predictions are lower than India’s actual performance, suggesting that India’s CFR is,
if anything, too high rather than too low. We supplement the prediction exercises with
the application of a decomposition technique, and we additionally account for time lags
between case incidence and death, for a more relevant cross-country perspective in the
growth phase of the pandemic.


1. Introduction

As we write, India has over 2 million confirmed cases of covid-19, with a death toll of
over 43,000. Figure 1 plots the corresponding case fatality rate [CFR] in India, compared
to the world as a whole (Panel A) and with selected countries (Panel B). Over the initial
duration of this epidemic, India has hovered around a CFR of 3% or more, with a steady
downward trend. The world rate is far higher, trending down from a peak of over
7% to a current number around 4%. Several economically advanced countries are far
higher still. Panel B of Figure 1 compares India to a number of other countries — these
comparisons will recur through the paper. India is at or near the bottom of the case
fatality heap. The end-July fatality rate of around 2.2% compares more than favorably
with countries such as the Netherlands (11.5%), Italy (14.2%), and Spain (10%).

Of course, case fatality rates are not to be confused with infection fatality rates, the
latter being the true measure of mortality from the disease. But infection stocks are not

known anywhere in the world, and in India they are currently the subject of considerable
debate.1 Therefore, at least for assessing trends and comparisons, we must currently
make do with CFRs. And it is not a bad measure at all for this purpose, provided that
the absolute numbers are not interpreted literally,2 and are only used to make comparisons
across countries and time; that too with a great deal of care.

Certainly, India’s seeming robustness under this measure (compared to other countries)
has not gone unnoticed by her Government. Spokespersons have tended to attribute
it to “early identification and clinical management of cases." Prime Minister Modi, in
a national address on July 26, 2020, while correctly emphasizing the need to “remain
vigilant," observed that “India’s covid-19 recovery rate is better than others. Our fatality
rate is much less than most other countries."3

To move from a low CFR to an unqualified commendation of deliberate policy-induced
containment of the disease might (to put it mildly) overlook certain crucial aspects of
     1 Bhramar Mukherjee, in private communication, suggests a nationwide underreporting factor of the
order of 15-25, implying a current infected population of 30-50 million. See Bhattacharyya et al. [2] for
more details on the calculation of the underrporting factor for India.
    2 There are many reasons why the absolute values of CFRs have no obvious and natural meaning, some

of which will play an unavoidable role in this paper.

demographic detail. That the age distribution within a country will influence the CFR
is widely known, with “younger countries" exhibiting lower CFRs simply on account
of lower death rates among younger age groups. Many observers have pointed to the
Indian age structure as a possible confound in interpreting the aggregate case fatality
rate; see, for instance, Ray and Subramanian [19] and Mukhopadhayay [15] for India in
particular, and Dudel et al [6] for other countries.4

We take this observation as a starting point, but seek a more precise quantitative
comparison between India and other countries. Sections 2–4 deal with alternative
approaches to this question, so as to provide an overall assessment of India’s case
fatality rate under covid-19.

One way of adjusting for age-distribution in a relatively young country is to ask what
would happen to that country’s overall CFR if it experienced age-specific CFRs similar
to those in countries in which older cohorts account for a larger share of the population.
We do this for India using a set of selected comparison countries in Section 2: the same
countries that appear in Figure 1.

With detailed age-specific data for both India and comparison countries, one can
additionally decompose the differences in case fatality rates for a sharper description of
how the distribution of cases and deaths by age affect aggregate mortality statistics. The
method is different from that in Section 2, in that it precisely separates the difference
in CFR into two effects: one corresponding to case distribution (an “incidence effect"),
and the other to age-specific fatality rates (the “fatality effect"). The case distribution
used to partition these two effects is an average of the case distribution for India and the
comparison country, as opposed to just the Indian distribution; see Section 3 for details.
Our approach corresponds closely to that taken by Dudel et al [6] to explain the observed
cross-country variation in CFRs of selected countries. The decomposition technique
that we use was introduced by Shorrocks [24] and based on the Shapley value — the
so-called Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition. In the specific context of our paper, this
decomposition coincides with a procedure with widespread demographic applications
    4 There are, of course, several other reasons for the CFR to vary across countries.Countries with higher
testing rates will generally have lower CFRs — spotting more cases at an earlier and presumably milder
stage. Moreover, CFRs will tend to trend down over time within the same country, as its testing improves.
Actually, India is pretty low on the world testing scale as measured by per-capita tests, so this logic
suggests that its CFR should be higher, not lower. There are other ancillary issues, such as obvious caveats
associated with using data from multiple sources, such as definitional differences in what constitutes a
”covid-19 death.” There is also the question of under-reporting [18], though this will affect both numerator
and denominator in the CFR.
4


advanced by Kitagawa [13], which seeks to factorize the “difference between two rates"
into its “component" parts [16]. Dudel et al [6] apply this procedure to differences in
case fatality rates, as we do in this paper. We find that India’s low CFR, while seemingly
comparable (at least currently) to countries such as South Korea, masks significant
differences in age-specific incidence and mortality burdens from those of South Korea,
and only appears to be of comparable magnitude by a serendipitous opposition of these
factors in the process of aggregation.

All of the preceding analysis is based on the presumption that reported CFR figures are
to be accepted at face-value. But what if the CFR as usually reported should turn out to
be an inappropriate representation of the actual case fatality rate? Such a contingency
arises from a closer reading—when covid infection results in death—of the time-lag that
typically occurs between the onset of infection and the date of death. Verity et al [27]
report a mean duration of around 18 days from infection to death (in cases where death
occurs).5 It is unclear when such cases would be registered as “confirmed" — that would
depend on testing times — but in any event, cumulative deaths should be related to
cumulative cases at some anterior date. This suggests that the contemporaneous CFR
— the number of covid deaths on a given date divided by the number of covid cases as
on that date — might be an inaccurate reflection of the actual covid case mortality rate,
which could be better approximated by a “lagged" CFR. A better approximation is the
number of covid deaths on a particular date divided by the number of covid cases at
some relevant lag before that date. With cases mounting over time, the contemporaneous
CFR will understate case fatality relative to the lagged CFR. That would be true for all
countries, but the extent of underestimation would be different for different countries
because of inter-country variation in the rate of growth of cases. Section 4 undertakes
a comparison of India with selected countries, while exploring the difference between
contemporaneous and lagged CFRs.

To summarize: there are two potential sources of difficulty in simply accepting the case
fatality rate, as it is usually reported, as a reliable indicator of cross-country comparison.
(This is quite separate from the inadequacy of case fatality rates as a true measure of
covid-19 fatality, a well-known issue that we do not address here.) The first has to do
with the failure of the measure to reflect the precise age-distribution of cases and deaths
that obtains in each particular situation under study. The second has to do with the

    5 Basedon a Chinese study by Yang et al (2020), Wilson et al (2020) conclude that “. . . a median of 13
days passed from pneumonia confirmation to death. . . "
                                                                                            5


strong possibility that a lagged CFR is a more dependable indicator of case fatality than
the customary contemporaneous CFR. Correcting for these complications, as we shall
see, leads to a picture of India’s health-related capability in dealing with the covid-19
epidemic which is altogether less flattering than what might otherwise appear to be the
case. This is one more instance of the general proposition that careful measurement
can make a difference to our assessment of actual country performance in the matter of
human development and capabilities.


2. Predicting Indian Mortality from Age-Specific CFRs of Other Countries

To fix some elementary ideas and notation: let f c be the overall CFR in any country c, f jc
the CFR in age-group j, and let wcj be the proportion of all cases in age-group j. Then,
for any country,
                                           M
                                           X
                                      c
                                     f =      wcj f jc ,
                                            j=1
where M is the number of age groups. Begin by looking at India’s weight distribution
{wIj }, which marks the incidence of the disease across different age groups. Figure 2
displays information on the population distribution by age, the weight distribution by
age, and the impact ratios, which we define to be wcj /ncj , where ncj is the population
share in age group j for country c. These objects are displayed in Table 1. The first

exercise that we conduct is to “predict" case fatality rates for India using age-specific
data from a set of comparison countries, but using weights from the case distribution
pertaining to India. The idea is to approximate how India would perform if it had the
age-specific case fatality rates of these comparison countries. As it happens, our set
of comparisons is perforce limited because information on cases and deaths by age is

    population size. In each panel, India is shown in bold; comparison countries are as listed

not easy to come by and needs to be extracted from individual country dashboards.
Many countries do not provide those data or (as in the case of India) do so infrequently
and irregularly via Ministerial decree. As of August 4, the Wikipedia website https:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019 lists 22 countries with age-specific, country-
level mortality rates, of which we use 14: Argentina, Chile, China, Colombia, Germany
(Bavaria), Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the Philippines, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.6

Figure 2A shows the percentage of covid-19 cases by age group for India and the
comparison countries, with the Indian line depicted in boldface. Relative to our
comparison list — with the exception of other developing countries such as South
Africa — India is a very young country indeed. The Indian case distribution by age

    6 The remaining 8 countries are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Mexico, Norway and

Portugal, and including them does not affect the analysis but lengthens the tables without much added
insight.
                                                                                                          7


sharply falls upon the younger age groups: the corresponding lines for several of the
comparison countries are shifted to the right.

What is less obvious is the pattern shown in Panel B. That panel plots the impact ratio
— the ratio of case incidence to population percentage by age, by country. A ratio
greater than 1 indicates that the age group in question has been disproportionately hit
relative to population size. India is shown in bold. For all countries, the impact ratios
are smaller than one for the youngest age group, which is only to be expected: after
all, the very youngest are relatively isolated from widespread and anonymous social
interaction. But among working adult groups and relative to the comparison countries,
India stands out in having a large impact ratio. These middle-aged working groups
are not only those excessively represented in overall population (Panel A), they are also
disproportionately more affected by covid-19. The impact ratio is closer to 1 for the
oldest age groups, while for many of the comparison countries, that impact ratio spikes
upward quite dramatically. Taken together, these two features (population distribution
and the distribution of impact ratios) create a substantial skew, at least in the measured
incidence of covid-19, among the younger age groups.7 For the exact distributions of
cases and deaths by age for our comparison countries, see Table 7 in the Appendix.

These distributions come from a variety of dates for different countries. Unfortunately,
for countries for which age-based mortality data is taken from data visualization
dashboards, previous information often disappears from the visualization once updated,
so that we typically have access to age-specific data at one date, that of the latest update.
But there are exceptions. These suggest that barring the initial phases of the pandemic,
the distribution of cases and deaths across ages appears to be reasonably stable. We
explore this stability in Appendix 5.3. That is not true of the age-specific mortality
rates, which do change significantly over time. But the point is that the latter changes
because there has been significant movement in the case-fatality rate over time, and not
because the relative dispersion of cases or deaths has been changing. This feature will
be exploited in the analysis below.

We can use India’s case distribution information, along with the CFR patterns from
comparison countries, to “predict" India’s CFR were it to be driven by the age-specific
rates in those countries, coupled with India’s case distribution across ages (which
mirrors Indian demographics). Table 2, which significantly extends Table 3 in Ray
    7 It
       is possible that relative to the comparison countries, the old die at home in India, and covid deaths
are disproportionately undercounted among them.

where the weights are the Indian distribution of cases across the population.

India’s latest CFR numbers stand at around 2.2%, but as Figure 1 also reveals, India’s
CFR has been around 3% for much of the period since the start of the pandemic, hitting
3.4% on June 17 as an adjustment of past deaths was made in the database; then falling
slowly. Depending on the dates for counterfactual prediction — we use five — we have
different rates for India, which are described in Table 2. Countries that (age-adjusted
with Indian weights) predict a lower CFR — relative to India’s actual aggregate CFR
— are shown in blue. Note that some country-level observations are mixed over time.
The adjusted CFRs in Table 2 are quite remarkable, given that the actual CFRs for many
                                                                                                                9


of these countries far exceed those of India (Figure 1, Panel B). Countries such as the
Netherlands or Spain have a CFR well in excess of 10%. And yet, once adjusted for the
Indian case distribution, it becomes clear that India is no longer an outlier. While the
reader is invited to go through the individual comparisons, we single out South Korea
here, because age-unadjusted, the two CFRs are comparable. And yet, once we adjust
for differences in the demographic distribution, the South Korean rates translate into an
aggregate CFR of merely 0.74%, far lower than India’s current CFR of around 2.3%.

The over-predictors are the Philippines, Colombia and more recently China — and
Italy, which in the light of the European figures, comes as a bit of a (relative) surprise.8
Compared to these countries, India’s performance does not look as bad. We will revisit
these outliers when we study lagged fatalities in Section 4. On the whole, and given
the existing data limitations, it appears safe to label as exaggeration the assertion that
India’s “fatality rate is much less than most other countries."


3. Decomposing Inter-Country Differences in Case Fatality Rates

3.1. A Decomposition. For a meaningful comparison of CFRs across two countries, we
decompose the difference in CFRs into what may be called a fatality effect and an case-
incidence effect. Let I stand for India, our country of interest, and let C be any comparison
country. We “decomposing" this difference into two terms, as follows:
                 1 c                   1
        fc − fI =  ( f − f I) + ( f c − f I)

    8 The  Italian comparison exhibits some contrast to Mukhopadhyay’s analysis; see [15]. He undertakes
a similar exercise as in Table 2 using Italian data, and reports that: “[B]y multiplying Italy’s age-specific
CFR . . . to the age-specific number of cases in India, [we find that] [t]he estimated numbers of deaths that
should have occurred, if the age-specific death rates of Italy were to prevail in India, is 535. The official
number of deaths in India as of April 30 was actually twice that number, at 1074." We go some way towards
a resolution of this difference in Section 4, though the disparity is still puzzling.

where ∆w j = wcj − wIj , and ∆ f j = f jc − f jI . This decomposition is an instance of the
Shapley procedure described by Shorrocks [24], based on Shapley’s [23] formulation of his
celebrated “value" as a solution to allocation problems within a cooperative game. As
noted earlier, this decomposition also corresponds exactly — within our demographic
context — with the procedure advanced by Kitagawa [13], and applied to the case
fatality rate by Dudel et al [6]. Note that this is an exact decomposition procedure, that
is, the relative contributions of the factors driving the change under examination add up
to exactly one hundred per cent (without leaving behind any hard-to-interpret residual
effects, such as the so-called “interaction" effect in “standard" decompositions).

The first component in the decomposition (1) is what we might call the incidence effect. It
quantifies the difference in CFRs that would arise solely due to age-specific differences in
case incidence rates under the hypothetical scenario that the countries share the average
of their age-specific CFRs. This number will typically be positive if the comparison
country is older, because the older age groups are weighted by higher fatality rates, and
the comparison country will have more of such groups.The second component, which
we call the fatality effect, quantifies the difference in CFRs that would arise solely due to
differences in age-specific CFRs, in the hypothetical scenario that the countries share the
average of their age-specific infection rates. This number would be negative if India’s
age-based fatality rate is higher than the corresponding age-based fatality rate for the
comparison country, at most or all age groups.

The fatality effect is closely related to the analysis in Table 2, where we “predict" Indian
CFR using India’s case distribution. The fatality effect can be thought of as a similar
exercise, but in this case we use as weights the average of the case distribution for India
and the comparison country in question. Because the economically advanced countries
among the latter group are more likely to have an older population, this tempers the
prediction somewhat, and we expect milder effects compared to Table 2.




3.2. Decomposing India’s CFR. The use of the decomposition formula relies on more data
than in Section 2. Specifically, we also need deaths by age for India, a statistic that is
released sporadically by the Union Health Ministry and in age brackets that are both
coarse and frustratingly non-comparable with those used for our comparison countries.
The latest numbers are from a July 8 Press Release, with death incidence for six age
brackets. To maintain comparability, we’ve split these brackets into the narrow nine
                                                                                                  11


brackets used so far, drawing on additional data and using an interpolation procedure
fully described in Appendix 5.2. The results are reported in Table 3.


                                                 Age Group
                  0-9 10-19 20-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+
       Cases (%)  3.6   8.1 21.5 21.0 16.8 14.2       9.9   3.8 1.1
       Deaths (%) 0.8   0.9   2.4   5.5 13.5 24.0 30.4 15.7 6.7

  Table 3. Case and Death Distribution by Age for India. Sources. Case distribution from [7],
  identical to that in Table 1. Death distribution interpolated using Indian Ministry of Health
  Press Release, July 08, 2020 (details in Appendix 5.2).




Armed with the information here and invoking analogous data (see Table 7) for the
comparison countries, we can set equation (1) to work. The results are reported in Table
4. The table studies three dates over which the Indian CFR has progressively fallen
(and, in general, so have those of the comparison countries). For each of these dates and
each comparison country, we report the CFR of the country, which — barring a couple
of cases — significantly exceeds those of India. The decomposition exercise then breaks
up the difference between the Indian and comparison CFR into incidence and fatality
effects, as described in (1). The CFR difference is the sum (accounting for positive and
negative values) of the incidence and fatality effects.

Once again let’s single out South Korea, given that its CFR on July 30 (2.1%) is comparable
with that of India (2.2%). But this comparability is the coincidental cancelation of two
strongly opposing forces. The incidence effect is positive. As already discussed, this
comes from the fact that South Korea has an older population. So the fatality-weighted
distribution of cases generates a higher fatality for South Korea on that score. But the
fatality effect is negative — that is, the case-weighted distribution of fatalities generates
a larger number for India. The two effects cancel, leaving them with comparable CFRs
on the aggregate. The higher age-specific fatality rate, as indicated by the negative
fatality effect, is suggestive of a relatively lower level of robustness of health in India, or
a relatively lower level of robustness of treatment facilities, or both. The decomposition
of the difference in their CFRs confirms our assessment. If India and South Korea shared
their age-specific CFRs, their average, South Korea’s aggregate CFR would be higher
than India’s by close to one percentage point, a huge difference relative to their baseline

CFRs. Alternatively, with the same case distribution, South Korea’s CFR would be lower
by one percentage point, owing to its low age-specific CFRs.

The near-equivalence in the two CFRs is therefore manufactured by aggregation,
occurring despite a fatality effect that goes against a favorable welfare interpretation for
India, from which the country is rescued by its particular pattern of the age-distribution
of covid-19 incidence. The same pattern occurs for a number of comparison countries.

This decomposition analysis goes beyond our earlier comparisons in Table 2, in that it
also includes the counterfactual when the CFRs are the same but case incidence isn’t.
Here, India’s “advantage" of higher case incidence among the young is not by virtue of
its demographic characteristics alone. A quick recall of the population shares and case
shares in Table 1, along with Panel B of Figure 2, reminds us that the caseload for the
working-age population in India is higher than its population share. In contrast to most
other countries with the highest impact ratio reserved for the oldest age group, it is the
impact ratio for the middle-aged and older working population that is relatively high in
India. While this helps attenuate India’s CFR, this is certainly not desirable otherwise.
Why that population is disproportionately affected requires an evaluation of exposure,
                                                                                         13


prevalence of co-morbidities, or lifestyle choices such as smoking, which is beyond the
scope of the present exercise.

All in all, the recipe for a low aggregate CFR looks quite simple to implement: pick
either an endowment of low age-specific CFRs, or a case distribution skewed towards
low-CFR age groups. India’s demographic structure generates an abundant supply of
the second ingredient, amplified by its high impact ratios for working-age groups. (The
same is true of South Africa, another young country.) In contrast, India appears to be
lacking in the first ingredient: low age-specific CFRs.

Comparisons such as those between India and South Korea are not intended to verify
the easily accessed fact that India has fared poorly in relation to a country which is an
obvious outlier. Such comparisons would then add up to no more than an essentially
trite exercise. Rather, the objective, at a general level, is to drive home the point that
social indicators such as the aggregate CFR are essentially outcome-indicators, and that
in certain cases, similar outcomes (as for India and South Korea) can display widely
differing underlying processes that lead up to these outcomes. Similar observations
have been made by Anderson and Ray [1] and Jayaraj and Subramanian [11] about
the sex-ratio of a population, and by Mukherji and Kanbur [12] about poverty indices.
This general point reinforces the specific desirability of guarding against misplaced
complacence (or panic, as the case may be) that could arise from an exclusive concern
with the sheer external magnitude of a statistic such as the CFR.


4. Growing Epidemics and Lagged Case Fatality Rates

When a covid-19 infection ends in death, the mean duration from symptoms to death is
a bit more than two weeks; see, for instance, Verity et al [27], who report a mean duration
of around 18 days. It is unclear when such cases would be registered as “confirmed"
before the death occurs — that would depend on when testing occurs after the onset of
symptoms — but it is likely that the cumulative deaths at any date should be related to
cumulative cases at some anterior date, and not cumulative contemporaneous cases.

How anterior that date should be is obviously open to debate. Using case counts from
January 30, 2020 to May 14, 2020, Mohanty et al [14] find that the 14-day lagged CFR
(LCFR) for India is 8.01%, more than twice the contemporaneous CFR of 3.70% on May
14, 2020 [9]. The hike-up would be smaller if case discovery occurred a week after
symptoms — one would then use a 10-day lagged CFR. But it is no surprise, anyway,
14


to learn that in societies with growing incidence (or expansion of testing), LCFR would
significantly exceed CFR. That doesn’t require us to calculate anything.

A more interesting question emerges when we make comparisons across countries.
Every LCFR would exceed its contemporaneous counterpart. The question is: by how
much? It is easy to see that ceteris paribus, a country with a faster growth rate of
confirmed cases would exhibit a higher ratio of LCFR to CFR. A bit more formally, if
we denote the x-day growth rate of cases in country c by gc , where x is a number that
we would need to settle upon, then lagged fatality φc is connected to contemporaneous
fatality f c by the obvious identity:

                                      φc = f c [ 1 + gc ] .

4.1. The Prediction Exercise of Section 2 Revisited, with Lagged CFR. We revisit two exercises
with lagged case fatality rates. The first is the prediction exercise from Table 2. That
is, we use the same set of comparison countries to predict the case fatality rate for
India using India’s age distribution coupled with the age-specific fatality rates for those
countries. But we now do so using lagged fatality rates. The following qualifications
and remarks should be noted.

First, we’d like to use age-specific growth rates to achieve the correction, but this is data
we do not have, so we apply the same growth rate in cases to all age groups within
a country. Second, the growth rate — and consequently the predictions — will vary
with the lag. Therefore, while we report 14-day lags, we explore a 10-day alternative
in Appendix 5.4. Third, the choice of calendar date will matter, as it will affect not just
the values of India’s case fatality rate, but also the rate of growth of cases. Therefore we
conduct three exercises: for June 20, July 10 and July 30. As in Table 2, we hold fixed the
distribution of cases and deaths across ages. (We again refer the reader to Appendix 5.3
for the intertemporal stability of these distributions.) The age-specific lagged CFRs are
generated from aggregate fatality rates applied to these distributions, and then used to
make the Indian predictions. Finally, we reiterate that the specific values of the LCFRs,
while potentially of interest, are problematic to interpret. We know they will go up with
the lag, but their absolute magnitudes could reflect either changes in the progression of
the epidemic, or the intensity of testing. Rather, all we do is explore what this does to
the under- or over-prediction of India’s correspondingly lagged rate.

  Table 5. Predicted Indian Lagged CFRs. Numbers in the first row report Indian LCFR for
  different dates and lags (10, 14 day). Subsequent rows record predictions from comparison
  countries. Underpredicting countries in blue, overpredicting countries in red. Sources. The
  same data as in Table 2 were used to build age-specific information, and in addition Our
  World in Data was used to estimate growth in cases.



Table 5 reports the results. First, as expected, lagged CFRs are generally sizably larger
than contemporaneous CFRs. The 14-day growth in cases in India was between 60–80%,
which leads to higher (and probably more accurate) estimates of case fatalities; these are
recorded in the first row of the table, along with the unlagged CFRs for easy comparison.
The predicted rates from comparison countries are recorded in the rows below. For some
countries like South Korea, Spain and Switzerland, the resulting changes are minimal,
because there is a near-cessation of growth in new cases during this period. But more
generally, there is a significant increase in under-prediction once the differential case
growth is taken into account. For instance, Italy now switches from being an over-
predictor of India’s case fatality rate to being an under-predictor. The point is that
Italian cases have grown slower than Indian cases during this time period, so India’s
effective case fatality rate is significantly higher than the rates in Table 2. The same
switch occurs for China and the Philippines, the former comfortably so given that there

is no growth in the disease in recent months (at least on official paper), and the latter
despite fast epidemic growth because India’s epidemic has seen even faster growth.
The one country that appears to be doing distinctly worse is Colombia, which is also
experiencing rapid growth in cases, and — at the later dates — is an over-predictor in
both Tables 2 and 5.

4.2. The Decomposition Exercise of Section 3 Revisited, with Lagged CFR. Lagged CFRs can
also be taken to the decomposition exercise of Section 3. We do so in Table 6. The
structure is exactly the same as in Table 5. We study three dates — June 20, July 10
and July 30. This time we construct all case fatality rates using a fourteen day lag, the
idea being that deaths at day t are related to infection at day t − 18 or thereabouts, and
allowing for a “detection lag" of four days running the opposite way. (The findings are
robust to different lags; see Table 8 in the Appendix for an example using ten-day lags).

The first column of numbers in this table lists lagged CFR by country, and the second
column records the raw difference between the comparison country and India. Negative
numbers highlighted in blue indicate that the comparison country is “doing better" than
India, either in the CFR itself or in terms of the fatality effect (or both). Compared to
                                                                                             17


Table 5, India’s aggregate LCFR now edges closer to the comparison countries just on
account of the lag alone. This raw difference is broken up into an incidence and fatality
effect, just as in in Table 5. Now there is a larger set of fatality effects that are negative,
suggesting that once lagged fatalities are introduced, the average of age-specific fatalities
— with weights equal to the average incidence of cases across India and the comparison
country — is even less likely to be in India’s favor.




5. Summary & Discussion

India’s case fatality rates under covid-19 are very low, relative to the world average
and especially relative to those of other countries. While these low rates have been
cited as evidence for India’s infrastructural resistance to the disease, it is a widely-held
suspicion that India’s age distribution (skewed in favor of the young) has something to
do with it; see, for instance, Mukhopadhayay [15] and Ray and Subramanian [19]. This
paper provides precise quantitative confirmation of that suspicion by systematically
comparing India to a set of comparison countries from over the world.

The findings in this paper confirm a reservation expressed by many researchers into
covid mortality: that when we fail to account for age-specific dispersion in the
distribution of covid-19 cases and deaths (which is the case with the CFR), this does
make a difference to our assessment of how well or otherwise any given society has
confronted the pandemic. The proposition is not just a matter of academic interest: it
has implications for the assessment of both the intrinsic and comparative performance
of countries in addressing the phenomenon of covid mortality.

Our evaluation of India’s experience suggests that the country’s record is a good deal less
flattering than a reliance solely on a measure of central tendency such as the case fatality
rate would indicate. We’ve used age-specific fatality rates from comparison countries,
coupled with India’s distribution of covid-19 cases (which mirrors India’s demographic
structure) to “predict" what India’s CFR would be with those age-specific rates. In
most cases, those predictions are lower than India’s actual performance, suggesting that
India’s CFR is, if anything, too high rather than too low. The general point, then, is to
guard against misplaced complaisance (or panic, as the case may be) that could arise
from an exclusive concern with the overall CFR, because crude aggregates often hide
the fact that the news may be worse (or better, as the case may be) than it appears to be.
18


Our specific approach does not entirely rely on prediction. We supplement the prediction
exercises by the application of a decomposition technique developed by Shorrocks [24],
the outcome of which coincides with a factorization procedure advanced by Kitagawa
[13] for demographic contexts — one that has been employed to analyze differences in
case fatality rates by Dudel et al [6], and in the present paper. While this approach needs
access to more data that the prediction exercises do, it allows richer insights into cross-
country CFR differences by breaking them up into estimates of age-based incidence and
age-based fatality. In principle, this exercise could be applied not just across countries
but over time, as the disease wears on and we have access to more data.

The analysis presented here also attempts to account for a specific epidemiological
feature; namely, that there is a time lag between the occurrence of infection and the
occurrence of death. Therefore, rapid growth in the number of cases will tend to depress
the case-fatality rates if contemporaneous statistics of deaths and cases are employed
in computing those rates. That in itself comes as no surprise. The question is how this
affects cross-country comparisons. We return to both the prediction and decomposition
exercises, this time with lagged CFR, and it turns out that India’s relative performance
generally worsens. Indeed, the gap between lagged CFR and the CFR is so striking that
if we were to go by the conceptually more appropriate former measure, then there is no
longer a “low" Indian covid mortality rate asking to be decoded: it is, simply, large.

Whether for reasons of failure in accounting for age-distributions or time lags, India’s
covid-19 experience does not speak to its successful management from the points of
view of human development and capability achievement. At the very least, there is
reason to believe that an undiscriminating employment of the raw CFR as an indicator
of success deserves to be treated with some skepticism. It seems to be important to assert
this when both objective appraisal and fair accountability are threatened by summary
indicators of performance that are inadequate or misleading, and when such summary
measures are employed to their advantage by politicians and policy-makers.

Finally, our concern endorses the call for the timely release of data beyond case and
death counts. It is imperative that detailed data disaggregated by age and other relevant
demographic attributes be collected, released, and placed in the public domain. This
can only enable the scientific community at large to better assess the situation unfolding
before us in this unprecedented time, and to participate more meaningfully in the
formulation, implementation, and monitoring of informed policies aimed at mitigation
and containment.

5.2. Interpolation of India’s Distribution of Deaths Over 10-Year Age Groups. For the
decomposition exercises undertaken in Sections 3 and 4, we use distributions of cases
and deaths defined over 10-yr age brackets for the comparison countries. For India,
detailed age-specific information is hard to come by. To complement the available
distribution of cases in India (as of April 30, 2020) defined over the narrow 10-year age
brackets [7], we interpolate the density of deaths for 10-year brackets using the death
distribution over 15-year age brackets, made available by the Indian Government, as
described below.

Mohanty et al [14] actually report the distribution of cases and deaths as of 9 May, 2020
using five-year age brackets. Normally, this would suffice for our purposes. However,
this information is available for a total of just 7191 cases and 511 deaths recorded in a
crowd-sourced patient level database [9]. We are concerned about this distribution as it
appears to come from a non-random sample, the details of which are unclear to us. So
we do not use it. However, we sparingly use the relative death rates across neighboring
age groups in their data as a way of disaggregating the Ministry-issued data.

On July 08, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provided a press
release describing the distribution of covid-19 deaths over six 15-yr age brackets: 0-14:
1%, 15-29: 3%, 30-44: 11%, 45-59: 32 %, 60-74: 39% and 75+: 14%. If In is the set of
n-year age groups, call this Ministry distribution D1 : I15 → [0, 100], and the Mohanty et
al distribution D2 : I5 → [0, 100]. Use D2 to generate 10- and 15-year age distributions
by simple aggregation:                        X
                                  Dm2 ( i ) =      D2 (k)
                                           k ∈ I5 | k ⊂ i
for m ∈ {10, 15}. Now apportion the relative weights from these distribution to the
Ministry figures. Formally, define a matrix W of dimension |I10 | × |I15 | with a typical
element wij given by

                                        10

The interpolated density for 10-year age groups for the distribution of deaths based on
D1 is then given by D̃10
                      1
                         = WD1 . The distribution of deaths thus obtained is recorded in
Table 3.
                                                                                                     21


5.3. Stability of the Age Distribution of Cases and Deaths. Figures 3-6 plot the age
distributions of cases and deaths for select countries as obtained at different points
in time. These countries are distinguished by the fact that we were able to obtain
distributions of cases and deaths over 10-year age groups for several dates spanning a
few months. Panel (a) graphs the age distributions of cases and Panel (b) graphs the
age distributions of deaths. The graph depicted in boldface in each figure represents the
latest distribution used for our analysis and listed under Table 7, while the distributions
as of previous dates are depicted in grey.




                           (a)                                        (b)

  Figure 3. Italy. Panels (a) and (b) plot the age distribution of cases and deaths, respectively,
  for the dates 21 July, 30 June, 09 June, 20 May and 14 May 2020.

  Figure 4. Netherlands. Panels (a) and (b) plot the age distribution of cases and deaths,

     Figure 5. South Korea. Panels (a) and (b) plot the age distribution of cases and deaths,
     respectively, for the dates 02 August, 20 July, 10 July, 20 June and 20 May 2020.




                              (a)                                        (b)

     Figure 6. Spain. Panels (a) and (b) plot the age distribution of cases and deaths, respectively,
     for the dates 18 May, 30 April, 20 April, 10 April and 30 March 2020.


As is apparent from the uncannily coinciding curves, barring initial phases of the
pandemic, the distribution of cases and deaths have been largely stable over time.
(This assumes, of course, that the relevant dashboards have been fully updated and no
other procedure is being followed.)

We recognize that these four countries are neither representative of the developing
countries in our comparison pool nor of the countries with a younger demographic
structure, such as Argentina, Colombia, India and South Africa. However, they do
reflect a heterogeneous variety of covid-19 experiences. In addition to this, the dates
over which we have plotted the distributions span a considerably large period of the
epidemiological phase so far. While at one level, this stability is not surprising, that
                                                                                                  23


could change with qualitatively different testing regimes, differences in response to
mitigation strategies, exposure to risk stemming from a change in lockdown policy, and
so on.

5.4. Decomposition with 10-Day Lagged CFR. Table 8 repeats the decomposition exercise
of Section 3 using 10-day lagged CFRs. The 10-day LCFRs reported in the first column
are lower than the 14-day LCFRs reported in Table 6, for obvious reasons. For countries
such as India, Colombia and Argentina with higher growth rate of cases, the difference
between the 14-day and 10-day LCFR is sizable in contrast to countries such as South
Korea and Japan which have low case growth.

Despite this relative edge in depressed fatality ratios, India still fares poorly relative to
several countries in the matter of age-specific mortality, lending support to the inferences
made previously on the basis of Table 6.
