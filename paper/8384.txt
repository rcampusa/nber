I. INTRODUCTION

       1996 saw the enactment of sweeping welfare reform, with Temporary Assistance for

Needy Families replacing Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which had been the primary

federal safety net program since its inception in 1935.         In addition to imposing work

requirements and time limits, TANF replaced the federal match rate that had subsidized state

AFDC spending with a block grant, effectively increasing the marginal price of state welfare

spending from the previous range of .18 to .5 to a new level of 1. The effect of this leap in the

marginal cost of state spending is an open question that has fueled much recent research, in part

because previous estimates of the price and income elasticities of state spending had ranged so

widely as to make reasonably precise policy predictions difficult. This paper takes advantage of

data from a period in the history of AFDC when the structure of federal subsidies and legislative

changes allow us to estimate not only the price and income elasticities of federal grants using

more plausibly exogenous variation, but also how states react to subsidies along two different

margins: the intensive margin of spending per recipient, and the extensive margin of spending

on additional recipients. States have the ability to choose both the extent of welfare eligibility

and the intensity of benefits provided through the program, but for the last 35 years AFDC and

now TANF have provided the same marginal federal subsidy for both kinds of spending.

Previous estimates of state price elasticities using data from this recent period have necessarily

collapsed state behavior along these two dimensions. The model and data used in this paper,

however, provide separate precise estimates of the price elasticities of intensive and extensive

welfare spending, allowing us to analyze a much wider range of potentially untapped policy

instruments.




                                                1
       There is a significant body of research estimating state price and income elasticities with

respect to federal grants in general and to the AFDC program in particular, producing a wide

range of estimates. Chernick (1998) and Ribar and Wilhelm (1999) review and try to reconcile

some of these studies, but all suffer from a lack of clear empirical identification driven by their

use of post-1965 AFDC data. After 1965, the state AFDC match rate was based on relative state

income (using the same formula as Medicaid), and the formula determining the rate did not

change over time, which made it difficult to disentangle the relationship between income, the

match rate, and spending during this time period. Since the match rate (or “price” of AFDC) was

an exact function of state relative income, it was not possible to identify these effects without

making assumptions about functional form. Richer states systematically received lower federal

contributions, and may also have systematically differed in their AFDC spending. For example,

changes in the economic climate could drive both changes in per capita income (which

determines the price of AFDC spending), and changes in the underlying poverty rate (which

determines AFDC eligibility), and both of these may also change desired benefit levels.

Controlling for income and economic variables would mitigate this problem, but only if the

correct functional form were specified.

       Prior to 1965, however, there were significant legislative variations in the structure of the

program. From 1935 to 1958, all states faced a federal match schedule based on their spending

per recipient: the greater the recipient spending per month, the lower the federal contribution

became at the margin. This step function was amended 6 times between 1946 and 1958. In 1958

legislation was introduced that made the match rate for some ranges of state spending depend on

state per capita income relative to national per capita income. I use these changes to generate

instruments for the actual marginal prices and income effects of the federal grant in order to


                                                 2
produce estimates of price and income elasticities that are not biased by the endogenous

relationship between income, spending, and federal contributions.

       The usual match rate and income formulation masks another dimension of state

responsiveness to federal policy. I show that there are two margins along which states may

adjust their AFDC spending, and thus two relevant marginal prices. First, they can adjust the

benefits per month that each recipient receives, or the intensive generosity. The marginal price of

increasing this monthly benefit amount is the marginal state share determined by the step

function described above. Second, they can adjust the number of recipients through eligibility

requirements (and the strictness of enforcement of other criteria), or the extensive generosity.

The marginal price of expanding eligibility is the average state share of current benefits. While

states always have the choice of movement along both the intensive and extensive margins, after

1965 these two prices were the same, making disentanglement impossible. Furthermore, the

average share could easily be confounded with the income effect of federal AFDC funds.

Several previous studies interpret large income coefficients as evidence of a flypaper effect

(where federal grants “stick” within the budget they are allocated to without the expected

displacement of state funds) without analyzing adjustment along an alternate margin. One

previous explanation for observed flypaper phenomena is the confusion of marginal and average

costs when making decisions (see Hines and Thaler, 1995), but the two costs are

indistinguishable in the post-1965 period.

       Using state-year data from 1948 to 1963, I find that state benefits per recipient are very

sensitive to the marginal cost of benefits (with an elasticity of around -.4) and the number of

recipients per capita is sensitive to the marginal cost of recipients (with an elasticity around -.3),

and that cross-price elasticities are positive. The elasticity of total state spending is just the


                                                  3
product of these two margins, and when they are combined the observed effect of the price of

benefits is much smaller and the effect of the price of recipients is near zero. Observations of the

combined effect along the two margins masks significant responses to prices in opposite

directions.

       These separate price effects on benefits and recipients have strong implications for the

efficiency of different financial structures for welfare grants. With two policy instruments at its

disposal, the federal government can affect the mix of spending being done at the state level. If

there are different externalities (either within or between states) associated with increasingly

extensive eligibility or increasingly intensive benefit levels, the extent to which these activities

are subsidized across states ought to be different. Given state concern about interstate mobility

of welfare recipients based on program generosity and given the interconnectedness of eligibility

for federal and state programs such as AFDC and Medicaid, such externalities are likely to be

important and variable.

       I begin with a review of previous estimates of the price and income elasticities of state

AFDC spending and outline a theoretical framework for the analysis, and then give a brief

history of AFDC legislation and the jurisdictional issues raised by the joint nature of the

program. I describe the data used for this study, and present new estimates of the elasticities of

state spending, as well as the responsiveness of the generosity of benefits, eligibility standards,

and program features. I conclude with a discussion of the results.




II. THEORY AND PREVIOUS ESTIMATES

       Previous estimates of the responsiveness of state spending on AFDC to the level and

matching rate of federal contributions have been subject to biases generated by the nature of the


                                                 4
matching grant. Before 1965, by statute, states received a lower matching rate as their spending

per recipient increased, with a cap on total federal reimbursement per recipient. The introduction

of matching rates based on state per capita income in 1958 further complicated the endogenous

relationship between a state’s resources and its reimbursement rate, as states with lower per

capita income were eligible for higher matching funds. Regressing spending on the match rate

without accounting for this endogenous relationship could thus yield biased estimates of the

sensitivity of state spending to the federal match rate. In addition, after 1965 the “price” of

AFDC spending was also the price of Medicaid spending for most states, and eligibility across

programs was often linked, further complicating estimation of elasticities.

           A simple model of a state maximization function helps to clarify the relationship among

previous studies and outlines a framework for this estimation.1 Suppose that the state objective

(perhaps but not necessarily generated by a median voter) is to choose B, the benefit amount per

recipient, and R, the number of recipients, to maximize

                                                U i = u (ci , Bi , Ri ; X i )                   (1)

where c is individual consumption, subject to the budget constraint

                                                            Ri
                                                yi = ci +      P(Bi , yi )Bi                    (2)
                                                            Ni

where N is the number of taxpayers in the state, y is per capita income, and P(B,y) is the fraction

of benefits paid by the state (with the remainder subsidized by the federal government). This

model is more general than that of some previous analyses in that it allows the states to choose

not only the benefit amount but also the number of recipients, and it allows the federal match rate

to vary with the benefit amount and state income. States did indeed have a fair amount of


1
    I follow Ribar and Wilhelm’s notation to the extent possible.


                                                             5
freedom to determine eligibility standards throughout the program’s history, and even more so

during the early period, as discussed below. This being the case, the number of recipients should

appear in the utility function as well as in the budget constraint, given that if states did not value

recipients positively at least over some range they could set eligibility standards so as to have

none. The other generalization that I have added, a federal match rate that depends on benefit

levels, is consistent with the law in this period. We could make the number of recipients a

function of the benefit amount, as Chernick (1998) and many others do, but that would not

change the estimating equation derived below.

       This model does not directly incorporate the externalities that may be imposed by

increasing R or B. While any externalities imposed within a state (such as unpaid medical costs

or crime associated with poverty or increased take-up rates associated with higher benefits) ought

to be incorporated in the state’s objective function, externalities imposed between jurisdictions

(such as on other states or the federal government) might not be.

       If we make no assumptions about the form of the utility function (such as additive

separability of the number of recipients and the benefit amount), the first order condition is

                                        ∂u
                                        ∂R =       P (B, y )B                                     (3)
                                        ∂u                 ∂P 
                                             R P (B, y ) +   B
                                        ∂B                 ∂B 



or the marginal rate of substitution of recipients for benefits is just equal to the marginal cost of

adding one recipient (the numerator on the right) over the marginal cost of adding one dollar to

the benefit amount (the denominator on the right). The optimal B and R will thus be functions of

both the price function and its derivative, or




                                                   6
                                                                           ∂P         
                                            Ri* = f  y i , P (Bi , y i ),     ; Z i                              (4)
                                                                           ∂Bi        

                                                                           ∂P         
                                            Bi* = g  y i , P (Bi , y i ),     ; Z i                              (5)
                                                                           ∂Bi        

The cost of adding a recipient is the average state portion of benefits, while the cost of increasing

the benefit amount is the marginal state portion of benefits for each recipient. The amount of

money that a state receives from the federal government as part of this program, often included as

a covariate with an estimated coefficient interpreted as the income effect, is a function of P, or

RB(1-P(B,y)).

         Chernick (1998) and Ribar and Wilhelm (1999) review and try to reconcile some of the

numerous studies estimating the price and income effects of federal matching grants. In these

studies “price” is defined as one minus the federal match rate, which does not depend on R or B

in this period, but does depend on state income. Chernick’s review presents estimates of the

price elasticity of the federal match rate relying on different assumptions functional form or

exogeneity assumptions that range from -.96 to .58 and estimates of the income elasticity that

range from .15 to 2.3.2 He speculates that estimates may vary so widely because of sample

selection and the confounding of state income and the federal match formula.                               Ribar and

Wilhelm compile a data set that allows them to replicate several different specifications. They


2
  For example, Larry Orr (1976) estimates the price effect of the AFDC subsidy on benefit levels per recipient. He
includes lagged recipients/population as an exogenous covariate, and does not allow states to change the number of
recipients in response to changes in prices. He includes separate price and income effects, and finds only price
significant, estimating a price-elasticity of benefit levels of -.23, concluding that federal funds are almost completely
offset by state reductions. However, with no exogenous variation in the state share, his two-stage procedure relies
solely on non-linearities for identification, and does not disentangle the relationship between state income and the
state share. Robert Moffitt (1984) estimates a price elasticity using non-linearities in the post-1965 budget
constraint. He develops an econometric technique for estimating state location choice along a piecewise-linear
budget constraint and, using data from 1970, finds a significant and positive income effect, a smaller price effect than
Orr of -.15, and no flypaper effect (by letting the income effect of AFDC be different from the effect of other
income). Again, there is no exogenous variation in the price, so the estimation relies on functional form and
simulations for identification, and the endogeneity of prices may bias the estimates.


                                                                 7
examine the effect of price and income on AFDC generosity per recipient using data from 1969

to 1992, and find a weak price effect, with estimates bounded between -.14 and .02, and a small

but significant income elasticity bounded between .11 and .82. They conclude that differences in

methodology drove the disparities in previous results, and that once appropriate fixed effects are

included endogeneity does not produce significant biases. However, they must assume that the

variables they use to instrument for price (such as benefits in neighboring states and the female

unemployment rate) are not otherwise related to AFDC benefit levels, and the measure of income

that they use is just the state’s per capita income, which may have very different effects from the

federal welfare grant (because of flypaper effects, principal-agent problems between bureaucrats

and voters, etc.). Furthermore, the majority of the studies3 focus on the intensive margin, or the

benefit per recipient, alone, ignoring possible effects of the extensive margin of AFDC spending,

or the number of recipients. Thus, none of these studies has a convincing way to disentangle the

relationships among price, income, and spending that are generated by the AFDC formula that

has been in place since 1965.




III. BRIEF HISTORY OF AFDC

Funding and Benefits

           The program Aid to Dependent Children was created by the Social Security Act of 1935.4

Since the program’s inception, states had considerable freedom to determine eligibility, need

standards, and benefit amounts. It was jointly financed by the states and the federal government:

the federal government contributed some fraction of every dollar spent by the states. Figure 1

shows the step functions used to generate the federal share. Figure 2 shows a sample budget

constraint for a state with an endowment of $5000 and 100 recipients (since federal subsidies in

this period are per dollar per recipient, not per total dollars).                            Until 1958 the federal

reimbursement rate to states was a step function based solely on the amount that the states paid to

individual recipients. In 1935 the reimbursement schedule was 1/3 of the first $18 per month for

the first child plus 1/3 of the first $12 per month for each additional dependent child. These rates

were amended in 1939, 1946 (when additional steps were added), 1948, 1950 (when the

eligibility of one needy relative was allowed), 1952, and 1956. Throughout this period, the basic

structure of the matching schedule remained the same, and all states continued to face the same

schedule.

           In 1958 the schedule was amended to create a range of spending within which federal

reimbursement rates were based on state per capita income relative to national per capita income,

and all calculations became based on average payments. The federal match rate was 14/17 for

the first $17 per recipient, ranged from 50 percent to 65 percent for the next $13 per recipient,

and was 0 thereafter. The variable match rate for the middle segment was based on the formula
                                                                                        2

The federal matching rate decreased as state income relative to national income increased, and

was bounded between 50 percent and 65 percent, with matching rates for all states with above-

average per capita income capped at 50 percent. The state share was thus:

         In 1965 the Medicaid program was created, with its own income-based reimbursement

schedule. The Medicaid formula was similar to the matching portion of the AFDC formula, but

without the caps based on spending per recipient. The state share was, and continues to be, based

on formula (6), but with the .5 replaced by .45, and α bounded between .50 and .18, and does not

vary with the amount the state spends. Thus the marginal price and the average price are the

same across the range of state spending. States with approved Medicaid programs were free to

choose between the old AFDC schedule and the new Medicaid schedule to determine their

AFDC share. Because of the nominal kinks in the AFDC matching schedule, and the failure of

Congress to make any additional adjustments to those nominal rates, the Medicaid schedule soon

became more generous than the AFDC formula for almost all states. By 1978 all but 4 states

(Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) used the Medicaid formula.5



Jurisdiction and Discretion

         At its inception, the Aid to Dependent Children program (authorized under Title IV of the

Social Security Act) was grouped together with other non-contributory welfare programs, most of

which operated largely under state and local control (Gordon, 1994). While ADC dollars were

matched at the federal levels, states were not required to have such a program, and, if they chose

to have one, were permitted to exert as much or as little control over the administration of the

program as they saw fit, determining both eligibility and benefit amounts, and often allowing

localities to evaluate applicants with a kind of discriminatory criteria not typically seen in

federally-controlled contributory programs.



EPW (1982).

  Throughout this adjustment period several states failed to utilize the formula offering the higher return. See CRS
(1982) for documentation and potential explanations.


                                                          10
         The effect of this freedom was often to allow localities to determine eligibility in such a

way that white citizens were over-represented in the recipient pool.                          This discriminatory

determination of eligibility carried over to benefit amount determination as well. Black women

were expected to work in jobs that white women weren’t, and were expected to live on less; even

when state-wide standards dictated benefit amounts, localities used differential cost-of-living

adjustments to manipulate benefit levels (Gordon, 1994). Bell (1965) notes that “suitable home”

requirements (dictating that benefits could only be given when eligible children resided in a

suitable home), seasonal employment policies, and illegitimacy exclusions all tended

disproportionately to exclude non-whites in the south.6 I include an analysis of the effect of the

federal subsidy rate on the use of “suitable home” and work requirements below.



IV. DATA

         I use data on AFDC spending, the federal match rate available to each state, and other

economic and demographic covariates, all at the state-year level. All dollar amounts are in real

2000 dollars. Because the introduction of the Medicaid program along with the Medicaid

matching formula in 1965 considerably changed the resources and mechanisms states had at their

disposal, I limit my sample to the years 1948 to 1963. This period encompasses 5 changes in the

federal matching formula for AFDC.

         Data on state AFDC expenditures and total spending, per capita income, the number of

AFDC recipients, and births by race come from annual issues of the Statistical Abstract of the


6
 Bell (1965) documents the use of “suitable home” requirements to discriminate against potential non-white
recipients. A public outcry followed Louisiana’s use of such a provision to reduce its welfare rolls by 25 percent in
1960. (95 percent of the children removed were black, although they represented only 66 percent of the recipient
pool.) It was this crisis that led to the Flemming Ruling in 1961, which was the first step in limiting the
discriminatory use of suitable home provisions.

United States.   Data on the “covered” unemployment rate come from the Unemployment

Insurance Handbook, and refer to spells of unemployment covered by unemployment insurance.

Information on the AFDC matching formula comes from the Congressional Research Service

publication Analysis of Federal-State Cost-Sharing in the Aid to Families with Dependent

Children Program. This information is used both to impute the actual state share and to

construct the simulated state share using legislative changes.

       More detailed information on individual state program rules are available for the years

1952, 1955, 1957, and 1959 from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare publication

Characteristics of State Public Assistance Plans Under the Social Security Act. These volumes

contain information about program characteristics such as work requirements and benefit caps.

       As the summary statistics in Table 1 show, during this period AFDC spending accounted

for about 3 percent of total state spending, and almost 25 percent of state public welfare

spending. In these years, state shares mechanically increased as state spending increased. While

the average state share of AFDC spending was only 39 percent, states paid 74 percent on the

margin.




V. ESTIMATING PRICE AND INCOME ELASTICITIES

       This analysis offers two innovations: first, the use of data from a time period with

exogenous price variation, and second, the use of those structural differences in the program to

decompose state price elasticities along the intensive and extensive margins. In order to facilitate

comparisons to previous literature and to provide a benchmark for the decomposition, I begin




                                                12
with estimates of the usual (aggregate) price elasticity, and introduce the simulated price and

income instruments I will use in this context. These instruments are related to the actual prices

and federal contribution and are driven by changes in the federal match rate schedule rather than

state incomes and state spending. I then move on to estimate intensive and extensive spending

elasticities using these instruments, and compare the results of the new model with the more

traditional formulation, including analysis of the effect of prices and income on spending, benefit

amounts, and recipiency rates.



Aggregate Price and Income Elasticities

         In the post-1965 period, the price of spending a dollar by adding a recipient and the price

of spending a dollar by increasing benefits per recipient were the same (both infra- and inter-

marginally): every dollar spent was subsidized at the state’s federal match rate. In the period

before 1965 this match rate applied only to additional benefits, and varied over the range of

benefits, so it is not strictly comparable to that used by authors analyzing the later period.

Nevertheless, it is the closest comparison “price” during this period, so I begin with an analysis

of the effect of the marginal state share (or 1 minus the match rate) on spending.

         A first estimate of the sensitivity of state AFDC spending to the match rate can be made

by regressing state spending on the marginal state share of a one dollar transfer and the income

states receive from the federal government through AFDC. I run the OLS regression



ln (AFDC Spending )it = β i + δ t + X it γ + λ ln(marginal state share )it + θ ln ( federal AFDC contribution )it + ε it   (8)




                                                              13
where Xit includes the log of per capita personal income and the log of the covered

unemployment rate. The marginal state price is the fraction of additional spending (on benefits in

this period) that would have to be financed by the state. Since the number of recipients and the

total amount of spending is known for each state in each year, I calculate the marginal state share

using the concurrent federal legislation. The federal AFDC contribution is just the total real per

capita dollar amount contributed through the federal match for AFDC spending. Table 2 presents

results with and without this term to show the importance of its inclusion.

       These OLS results suggest a positive elasticity of state spending to the price of AFDC

transfers: the higher the state share, the more it will transfer. The results in column (1), which

exclude an income effect from federal funds, show a price elasticity of AFDC spending of .42,

implying that a 10 percent increase in the state share would increase state AFDC spending by 4.2

percent. This confounds the effect of the marginal cost of further state spending with the income

effect of the total federal contribution. Column (2) includes both. While the price effect

declines, it is still positive and statistically (and economically) significant. Including the income

generated by the federal grant here allows us to interpret the elasticity implied by the coefficient

on price as a Slutsky compensated price elasticity.

       These price results seem implausible, and are in fact likely driven by the mechanical

relationship between state spending and federal contributions during the sample time period. (In

fact, throughout the existence of the program the prices faced by a state were related to its

spending or its income.)     Since federal contributions decrease as a step function of state

spending, states that spend more on AFDC for any reason will automatically receive lower

federal reimbursement at the margin. This mechanical relationship would generate a positive

estimate of the state price elasticity even if there were no behavioral response to prices at all. In


                                                 14
addition to this mechanical relationship, state incomes are negatively correlated with state prices

after 1958. If richer states choose to transfer more through AFDC independently of the positive

effect of income on prices, that would also bias up estimates of the price sensitivity of AFDC

spending.

          In order to abstract from these relationships, as well as any other omitted variables such

as unobserved economic conditions, I construct “simulated” marginal prices and federal incomes,

based on the legislative changes outlined above. I use state AFDC spending in 1948, the initial

year of my sample, and concurrent federal legislation to project what each state’s marginal and

average share would be in each year if spending continued at the same real levels, assuming that

real benefits per recipient and the number of recipients as a fraction of the population remain

constant. (Simulations using alternate assumptions, such as that benefits grow at the same rate as

other spending produce very similar results.) In other words, if states did not change real benefits

or the recipiency rate, what marginal price would they face and what would the total federal

contribution be under the current legislation in each year? The summary statistics presented in

Table 1 show that the actual and simulated values are quite similar.

          I use the simulated price and contribution as instruments for the actual values. These

instruments rely on the variation in initial spending levels and on changes in the federal statutes,

and unlike the actual marginal price and federal contribution are uninfluenced by the spending

choices made by the states after the initial period. The first stages are thus:



ln(actual share)it = β 1i + β 1t + X it γ 1 + δ 1 ln(simulated share )it + φ1 ln(simulated fed AFDC income)it + ε 1it                  (9)

ln(actual fed AFDC income )it = β 2i + β 2 t + X it γ 2 + δ 2 ln(simulated share)it + φ 2 ln(simulated fed AFDC income )it + ε 2 it   (10)




                                                                    15
         The advantage of using this simulated instruments is that neither the mechanical

relationship between spending and federal matching funds nor omitted controls for economic

conditions should bias the estimates of state responsiveness. The simulated variables isolate

legislative conditions, and are not affected by local economic or political conditions, nor by

actual state spending in any given year.7 The joint F statistic for the instruments in equation (9)

is 13.33 (with a p-value of .0000) and in equation (10) is 13.56 (.0000).8

         Estimating state price and income elasticities using these instruments gives a very

different picture of state behavior than the OLS regressions did: the price elasticity is negative,

as we would expect, but is not significantly different from zero once the income effect of federal

funds is included as well. The 1958 legislation provides perhaps the most interesting policy

experiment. The introduction of the variable match rate meant that two states with identical

spending beforehand but different incomes saw different price changes. There were 13 states on

this segment of the budget constraint in 1958. We can estimate the equation:



      ln(AFDC spending )i 59 = α + X i 59 γ + η ln(AFDC spending )i 58 + κ New Var Match Indic i + ε i                (11)



to see if those states with a new, more generous, federal match rate changed their behavior more

than those whose match rate did not change. The estimate of η is .95 (with a robust standard

error of .08), while κ is .34 (with a robust standard error of .14), suggesting that those states

whose match rate jumped (whose marginal price was therefore lower and whose federal income

  The estimate of δ1 is .13 (.06), φ1 is .20 (.14), δ2 is .11 (.04), and φ2 is -.60 (.12). When I include a state specific
time trend of year fixed effects, the estimate of δ1 is .22 (.05) , φ1 is -.11 (.05), δ2 is -.26 (.04), and φ2 is .36 (.05).
The raw correlation between simulated and actual prices is .77 and between simulated and real federal contributions
is .50. Because much of the variation in the instruments comes from the discrete annual changes in the federal
statutes, the interpretation of the coefficients in the presence of year dummies is difficult.


                                                            16
was therefore higher) increased their spending relative to those whose price did not change.

Since only two states originally on that segment remained at the .5 cap, further decomposition is

difficult.

        These estimates abstract from the endogenous negative relationship between price and

spending in a way that is difficult to do in the absence of changes in legislation governing the

federal matching of state spending. We can compare the results in column (3) to Orr’s result of -

.23. Replicating his approach using this data yields very similar estimates, including a mean

elasticity of -.26. It is thus the methodology, not the different time period, that is responsible for

the difference in results.

        Table 3 decomposes the change in state AFDC spending into changes in the number of

recipients and changes in the spending per recipient. This decomposition allows us to examine

whether or not states respond differently along the intensive and extensive margins. Column (2)

shows that the price elasticity of benefit amounts, unlike that of total spending, is negative and

significant: a 10 percent increase in the marginal state share of benefits results in a 3 percent

decrease in the benefit amount. The income effect of the federal grant is not significant here, and

is also not significantly different from the effect of other income. In column (3), however, we

see that while federal grants have a significant income effect on recipiency rates, the cross-price

elasticity is insignificant: the marginal price of benefits does not seem to affect the number of

recipients. These results are consistent with some previous studies and are generated by a more

clearly identified source of variation, and suggest the importance of examining own- and cross-

price elasticities of both benefits and recipients.

        These results are consistent with the previous literature’s estimates of price and income

elasticities, and highlight the importance of using the instrumental variables approach to abstract


                                                      17
from the endogeneity of actual price and income. Having established this benchmark, I turn now

to the estimation of separate elasticities for state spending on benefits and on recipients that this

particular data allows.



Separate Intensive and Extensive Price Elasticities

            As suggested by the model, we would like to include separately the marginal cost of

increasing recipients and the marginal cost of increasing benefits on AFDC spending. What are

these costs? The cost of adding one recipient is just the benefit paid to that recipient times the

fraction of that benefit for which the state is responsible (or the average state share of benefits).

The cost of increasing benefits is the fraction of that benefit for which the state is responsible (or

the marginal share) times the number of recipients to whom that additional benefit must be paid.

Thus, the estimating equation is:



    ln (AFDC Spending )it = α i + β t + X it γ + λ ln(marginal state share * R )it + φ ln(average state share * B )it
                                                                                                                        (13)
                              + θ ln ( federal AFDC contribution )it it + ε it




λ estimates the elasticity of spending with respect to the marginal cost of additional benefits,

while φ estimates the elasticity of spending with respect to the marginal cost of additional

recipients. For the same reasons as above we would want to instrument for the two marginal

costs and the federal income using simulated values.9 Again, the instruments are jointly and

individually significant in all three first stage regressions. Table 4 shows these results, along

  Greater precision can be obtained by including the components of the simulated values (the match rate and kink
points for each segment in each state-year) as well. These results are reported, but are quite similar in magnitude to
results using just the simulated values.


                                                                 18
with a decomposition of total spending per capita into benefits per recipients and recipients per

capita.

          Column (1) shows the effect of the two marginal costs on total spending. The elasticity

of total spending with respect to the cost of adding benefits is -.25 (with a robust standard error

of .10), while the elasticity with respect to the cost of adding recipients is an insignificant -.02.

As above, a decomposition of total spending into its component parts (shown in columns (2) and

(3) yields much more information about the elasticities. Each of the own-price elasticities is

negative and significant: the elasticity of benefits with respect to the price of benefits is -.38,

while the elasticity of recipients with respect to the price of recipients is -.34. The cross-price

elasticities are both positive, although only one is significant. When the price of recipients goes

up by 10 percent, spending on benefits goes up by 3.2 percent (with a robust standard error of

.10), while when the price of benefits goes up by 10 percent, the number of recipients goes up by

an insignificant 1.3 percent. The magnitude of the own-price elasticities is consistent with

previous studies discussed above, but there is little previous evidence on cross-price elasticities

with which to compare these results. It is worth noting that in each case there is still a significant

positive federal AFDC income effect, greater than would be predicted by traditional economic

models, consistent with the flypaper effect literature. Again, the presence of this income control

allows us to interpret the prices coefficients as (Slutsky) compensated elasticities.

          Theoretically we could also use these instruments to estimate the causal effect of a change

in the AFDC spending of neighboring states on a state’s own AFDC spending, but because the

initial spending of neighboring states is correlated, the timing of the shocks is correlated across

states, and composite “neighbors” are only weakly correlated with the composite instruments,

precise estimation of this spillover is not possible in this framework.


                                                  19
       The primary insight to be gained from this analysis is that when separate incentives

existed for spending along the intensive and extensive margins, states responded in the way that

theory would predict.     The more expensive it was to spend on increased benefits, states

substituted away from benefits and towards additional recipients, and similarly when it was more

expensive to increase eligibility and add recipients, the less likely states were to do so. The

estimated price elasticities are statistically and economically significant, and imply that there are

two different margins along which the subsidies generated by federal grants can affect welfare

spending.



The Effect on Program Features

       As the history of state AFDC eligibility patterns suggests, states had both the freedom and

the desire to manipulate the eligibility along different population characteristics, such as race.

Unfortunately, more detailed information on recipient characteristics at the state level is not

available, so it is not possible to see how changes in price affected the characteristics of the

recipient pool. It is possible, however, to look more closely at some of the eligibility restrictions

imposed by the state. State programs vary along several dimensions, such as the presence of

residency requirements and work requirements, and whether or not local spending is subject to a

state-wide cap. Many of these provision are summarized in the publication Characteristics of

State Programs.10

       I use a linear probability model to see whether or not prices affect the likelihood of the

presence of two restrictive policies: the presence of “work” requirements, stipulating that the

head of the household may not refuse available work (often with the provision that suitable child




                                                 20
care also be available) and the imposition of “suitable home” requirements, discussed above.11

Both of these provisions were designed to affect eligibility and thus the number of recipients, not

the benefit amount per recipient. We would thus expect the likelihood of the imposition of such

benefits to go up with the price of recipients and to go down with the price of benefits, consistent

with the cross-price substitution effect seen in Table 4.

        The linear probability results shown in Table 5 are consistent with this behavior, although

many of the coefficients are insignificant. The results suggest that as the price of adding

recipients goes up, states are more likely to impose work or home requirements, but as the price

of adding benefits goes up states are less likely to impose such restrictions.




VI. CONCLUSIONS

        This paper explores state reactions to the form and size of federal welfare grants under a

regime where the marginal price of expanding eligibility and the marginal price of increasing

benefits per recipient differ, which allows separate estimation of elasticities along the extensive

and intensive margins of welfare generosity in a way that cannot be done using recent data. I am

able to abstract from the confounding effects of state income and spending choices by using

legislative changes in the AFDC program to estimate the causal effects of different federal match

rates along these dimensions on total state spending, benefits per recipient, and recipiency rates.

I find that the benefit amount responds significantly to the marginal price of benefits, with an

elasticity of -.38, and that the number of recipients responds significantly to the marginal price of

additional recipients, with an elasticity of -.34. Cross-price elasticities are positive, so that an

analysis that groups the two margins together masks informative behavioral responses to the

marginal subsidies. Results also suggest that during this period states reacted to the marginal

price of recipients in part by controlling eligibility through the imposition of potentially

discriminatory recipiency requirements.

       These estimates give us some insight into likely state responses to federal welfare reform.

There are some difficulties inherent in using data from a quite different era: the political climate,

institutions, regulations and legislation, and menu of programs available 30 to 40 years ago have

certainly changed (for example, with the advent of Medicaid). Looking at this period does,

however, offer substantial advantages:      while states have always been able to adjust their

behavior along different margins, in this period we can distinguish separate prices for two of

these margins, and federal rule changes allow the creation of simulated prices that are not

affected by economic and political conditions and the like.

       Applying the elasticities from that period to the current welfare reform yields some

illustrative benchmarks. States faced a marginal price (for both benefits and recipients) of

around 40 cents on the dollar on average in 1995. TANF increased the price of either kind of

spending to 1, keeping the size of the federal grant the same. This represented an increase in

both prices of 120 percent. Applying the elasticities of -.25 and -.02 from the first column of

Table 4 suggests that this would decrease total spending by about 37 percent. The estimates from

columns (2) and (3) tell us more than that, however: the reduction would come almost entirely

from decreasing recipients, not from decreasing benefits per recipient. The decrease in benefits

implied by column (2) is an insignificant 7 percent, while the decrease in recipients implied by


                                                 22
column (3) is 25 percent. In fact, caseloads fell by 40 percent from 1994 to 1998, without a

corresponding drop in benefits per recipient (Wallace and Blank, 1999). While there is much

debate about the degree to which this fall can be attributed to the implementation of TANF,

rather than underlying economic conditions, these results strongly suggest the importance of state

responses to federal incentives.

       This does not, however, answer the question of whether or not having equal (or zero)

subsidies along both dimensions is optimal. For example, if states expand eligibility in order to

enable residents to enroll in federal programs whose eligibility is tied to welfare receipt, the

federal government might want to subsidize additional recipients at a lower rate than additional

benefits per recipient. If states reduce eligibility to decrease cross-state immigration that imposes

an externality, more generous subsidy of recipients might be efficient. Knowing that states

respond to these subsidies significantly and differentially allows the design of optimal welfare

financing that incorporates such externalities.

APPENDIX: THE AFDC BUDGET CONSTRAINT


          The nature of the federal AFDC matching rate schedule during this sample period is such that

states face a kinked budget constraint: as their benefit amount increases, the marginal price of that

spending (1 - the federal match) increases discretely, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The budget constraint

in Figure 2 represents a fixed number of recipients; a change in the choice of the number of recipients

shifts the schedule.

          The 1948, 1950, 1952, and 1956 Amendments changed the kink points and match rates for the

segments. The 1958 Amendments made the match rate in the second segment depend on state income.

In every case, the budget set remained convex for each state. In no case were the kink points changed

without simultaneous price changes, nor were prices changed without simultaneous changes in the kink

points.

          I instrument for the actual marginal and average prices and federal income faced by states with

simulated prices and income, generated by making an assumption about state spending on AFDC (such as

that the recipient to population ratio and real benefits are held constant at 1948 levels) and projecting

what marginal price and federal income each state would face given current legislation. A problem

inherent in this estimation technique is that in response to legislative changes (or any other changes),

states may change their spending such that they are on a different segment of the budget constraint. This

is in fact the only circumstance in which the simulated price is different from the actual price. This

would be troubling if the budget constraint were not convex. In the case of non-convex constraints, we

might see the perverse result that a decrease in the federal subsidy for AFDC caused an increase in

spending on AFDC, if the location of the global maximum switched segments.12

  See Moffitt (1984) for a discussion of the theoretical issues and econometric techniques involved with this kind of
estimation. He estimates a structural demand model to determine states’ segment choice.

                 One way to investigate the importance of these kinks in state spending on AFDC is to see how

 many states choose to locate at the kink point. Figure A is a histogram of average state monthly spending

 per recipient by year.

                                              Average Monthly Payment per Recipient




                 In each year there are two kink points, corresponding to p1 and p2. These kinks are given in

 Figure 1. For example, in 1948, states received 2/3 of the first 9 dollars per recipient per month and 1/2

 of remainder up to 24 dollars. An added complication is that until 1959 the second kink point was higher

 for the first child than it was for subsequent children. (This point was 15 dollars in 1948, 18 from 1949

 to 1952, 21 from 1953 to 1956, and 23 in 1957 and 1958.) This means that the second kink point will be

 blurred on the histograms, based on the different family sizes across states (even assuming that family




                                                                           26
size is exogenous to state spending on AFDC). Despite these complications, there does not seem to be

much bunching of states at the kink points.

        A more rigorous measure of state location is to evaluate how many states would switch segments

for a given change in prices. Using the estimated match elasticity of state spending per recipient of -.3, a

one standard deviation change in the match rate would yield about a 3 dollar change in benefits per

recipient. 37 percent of state-years are located within 3 dollars of a kink point, but they are located quite

symmetrically above and below.13

  There are 139 observations within $3 below and 147 within $3 above, with each year represented above and
below, 31 states represented below, and 25 above. There are 105 observations within $2 below and 103 within $2
above, with each year represented above and below, 30 states represented below, and 22 above.
