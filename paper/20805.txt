Capital Controls or Macroprudential Regulation?

                                             ABSTRACT

We examine the effectiveness of capital controls versus macroprudential regulation in reducing financial
fragility in a small open economy model in which there is excessive borrowing because of externalities
associated with financial crises and contractionary exchange rate depreciations. We find that both
types of instruments play distinct roles: macroprudential regulation reduces the indebtedness of leveraged
borrowers whereas capital controls induce more precautionary behavior for the economy as a whole,
including for savers. This reduces crisis risk by shoring up aggregate net worth and mitigating the
transfer problem that occurs during crises. In advanced countries where the risk of large contractionary
depreciations is more limited, the role for capital controls subsides. However, macroprudential regulation
remains essential in our model to mitigate booms and busts in asset prices.

1      Introduction
In the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008/09 many emerging economies have ex-
perienced large capital in‡ows and have struggled to de…ne an optimal policy response. Pol-
icymakers have resorted to capital controls and macroprudential regulation to lean against
the risks created by capital in‡ows. Both types of …nancial market interventions place
restrictions on …nancial ‡ows between creditors and debtors, typically with the goal of
enhancing macroeconomic stability.1
    The de…ning feature of capital controls is that they apply exclusively to …nancial trans-
actions between residents and non-residents, i.e. they discriminate based on the residency
of the parties involved in a …nancial transaction.2 For example, controls on capital in‡ows
apply to transactions between foreign creditors and domestic debtors. Similarly, controls on
capital out‡ows apply to transactions between domestic savers and international borrowers.
Capital controls segment domestic and international …nancial markets, as illustrated in the
left panel of Figure 1. As a result of this segmentation, international lenders and domestic
agents face di¤erent e¤ective interest rates.
    Macroprudential policies, by contrast, restrict borrowing by domestic agents indepen-
dently of whether credit is provided by domestic or foreign creditors. They impose a seg-
mentation between borrowers and all types of lenders, as illustrated in the right panel of 1.
As a result, borrowers and lenders in the economy face di¤erent e¤ective interest rates.3

regulation. See also Ostry et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of the policy considerations involved in choosing
between capital controls and macroprudential regulation.

     More recently, the IMF (2012) has adopted the term capital ‡ow management measures (CFMs) for
capital controls, since the latter term has traditionally had a negative connotation. In this paper, we use
the term capital controls in accordance with the tradition in the academic literature.
   3
     In some instances, it is di¢ cult to distinguish between capital controls and macroprudential regulation
because regulators want to restrict borrowing in general (i.e. from both foreigners and domestic agents), but
the only instrument that they have to restrict the borrowing from foreigners is a restriction on the capital
account. Such a measure just places foreign and domestic creditors on equal footing and therefore does not
represent a capital control as we de…ned it in the preceding paragraph, although others may de…ne it as a
capital control. We assume away targeting problems in the current paper and assume that regulators have
both an e¤ective macroprudential instrument and an e¤ective capital controls at their disposal. For a more
detailed analysis of targeting problems see e.g. Ostry et al. (2014).



                                                        2
    Should countries use capital controls or macroprudential regulation when they experi-
ence large credit growth? Some have argued that capital controls should only be used as a
measure of last resort (see e.g. IMF, 2012). Others, by contrast, have argued that capital
controls are the more natural instrument when credit growth is mainly driven by capital
‡ows from abroad (see e.g. Ostry et al., 2011). Should the two policy instruments be
thought of as equivalent? Or alternatively, does each of the two have its own comparative
advantage depending on speci…c circumstances?
    We analyze these issues in a model of a small open economy with pecuniary externalities
arising from collateral constraints. The key departure from the existing literature is that
we explicitly account for the presence of both domestic and foreign creditors in order to
distinguish between capital controls and macroprudential measures. As can be easily seen
in Figure 1, capital controls and macroprudential regulations are equivalent in models that
feature only either domestic or foreign lenders. In our framework, the main di¤erence
between domestic and foreign lenders is that the latter do not consume domestic non-
traded goods; therefore a transfer of resources between domestic and foreign agents a¤ects
spending on domestic goods and the real exchange rate, giving rise to a transfer problem.4
    To introduce …nancial fragility and crises in our model, we assume a collateral constraint
that limits the borrowing capacity of domestic borrowers. Critically, this constraint depends
on the level of the exchange rate, re‡ecting that part of the collateral of domestic borrowers
is consists of non-tradable goods. As a result, the borrowing capacity of the economy is
lowest when domestic borrowers are poorest and would most like to borrow.
    We equate equilibria with binding …nancial constraints on borrowers with …nancial crises.
When …nancial constraints bind, the economy experiences the classic dynamics of sudden
stops and …nancial ampli…cation (see e.g. Korinek and Mendoza, 2014). Domestic demand
by constrained agents declines, leading to capital out‡ows and the depreciation of the ex-
change rate that further tightens borrowing constraints. This triggers the feedback loop
illustrated in Figure 2 which leads to a sharp reduction in domestic aggregate demand, a
large exchange rate depreciation, and a reversal in the current account.

sudden stop. Figure 3 shows that East Asian countries experienced a dramatic contrac-
tion in GDP, on average of about 10 percent.5 The fall in GDP was associated with a
sudden reversal of the current account that adjusted by more than 10 percentage points
of GDP within one year. Meanwhile the economy witnessed a sharp correction of the real
exchange rate that collapsed by about 25 percent This severely impaired the balance sheets
of borrowers and constrained their ability to raise new loans.




                    Figure 3: Sudden stop dynamics: the East Asian crisis of 1997.

    To understand the role of capital controls and macroprudential regulation, we compare
the decentralized equilibrium in the described model economy with the allocations of a so-
cial planner who determines the intertemporal allocations of domestic borrowers and savers.
We show that exchange rate depreciations in …nancially fragile emerging economies are asso-
ciated with pecuniary externalities: depreciations that tighten …nancial constraints lead to
an ine¢ cient reallocation of liquid wealth from constrained borrowers with a high marginal
valuation of wealth to lenders with a lower relative valuation of wealth. Since private agents
take prices as given, they take the tightness of constraints as given when choosing their op-
timal behavior. By contrast, the social planner recognizes that precautionary actions such
as reduced borrowing in the run-up to a …nancial crisis lead to a …rst-order welfare gain if a
…nancial crisis hits because they mitigate the transfer problem, the exchange rate decline,
and the tightness of binding constraints. At the same time, the envelope theorem implies
that these actions come only at a second-order cost during the run-up to a crisis because
they constitute deviations from optimal smoothing. As a result, a planner engages in more
precautionary actions than private agents. In short, the pecuniary externalities from ex-
change rate depreciations are welfare-relevant in …nancially fragile emerging economies; the
competitive equilibrium is constrained ine¢ cient and there is a case for policy intervention.
    In particular, the goal of a social planner is to contain the depreciation of the exchange
rate during crises by supporting domestic demand for non-traded goods. To this end, the
planner raises the net worth of both domestic borrowers and savers since they both have
a positive marginal propensity to consume. Both capital controls and macroprudential
measures are needed to implement constrained e¢ cient allocations. Capital controls are
needed because the planner wants to increase the domestic interest rate above the world
interest rate in order to shore up the net worth of all domestic agents including savers, i.e. she
  5
      East Asian countries include Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea and Thailand.

wants to both curb domestic borrowing and encourage domestic saving. Macroprudential
measures are needed because the planner wants to shore up the net worth of borrowers
even more than that of domestic savers since borrowers are constrained and therefore have
a higher marginal propensity to consume than domestic savers. Macroprudential measures
on top of capital controls allow the planner to implement this di¤erent policy treatment of
borrowers and savers.
    We show in a number of speci…c model settings that there are bene…ts to combining
capital controls and macroprudential regulation. For ease of exposition, we …rst model an
emerging economy that will su¤er a …nancial crisis with perfect foresight. In this setting,
we show that a policymaker would want to impose both measures to reduce borrowing and
increase saving. We then show that our results continue to hold if we introduce uncertainty
into the model: if domestic agents have access to state-contingent …nancial instruments, the
described externality induces private agents to take on excessive risk and insure too little.
A planner uses capital controls and macroprudential regulation to remedy this.
    In an extension, we introduce an economy in which …nancial constraints and pecuniary
externalities are not driven by the exchange rate but by asset prices. When borrowing
capacity is linked to asset prices and constrained borrowers have a more e¢ cient use for
assets than unconstrained savers, an economy can experience a vicious cycle in which …re
sales and asset price declines play a similar role to exchange rate depreciations in our earlier
model of emerging economies. The vicious cycle takes place because binding constraints
reduce borrowers’ demand for assets, which in turn leads to …re sales, lower prices, and
tightening borrowing constraints.
    In a model of asset price externalities, we show that a social planner would support
the demand for assets by shoring up the net worth of borrowers but not that of savers.
Since savers are unconstrained, Fisherian separation holds between their consumption and
investment decisions. Therefore, the demand for assets by savers is not a function of their
net worth, and the social planner only intervenes to shore up the net worth of borrowers.
Macroprudential regulation is thus su¢ cient to implement the planner’s allocation and
capital controls are no longer needed.
    This suggests that the optimal mix of capital controls and macroprudential regulation in
our model changes as an economy becomes more developed. Concerns about exchange rate
volatility are particularly acute in emerging markets, especially those that have signi…cant
debts in foreign currency. In advanced economies, by contrast, the exchange rate is typically
less relevant for …nancial stability, but asset price volatility and the associated pecuniary
externalities remain a threat to …nancial stability. In our model, the bene…ts to imposing
capital controls thus subside as an emerging economy becomes more advanced.

Literature There has been a growing academic literature both on macroprudential poli-
cies and on capital controls. For a survey of the emerging literature on capital controls see
for example Korinek (2011a). For a survey on macroprudential regulation see for example
Galati and Moessner (2013). This paper is the …rst to cover the intersection of the two
types of policies.
    An important strand of both branches of literature motivates macroprudential regula-
tion and capital controls based on the existence of pecuniary externalities in the spirit of
Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986) and Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986). For example,


                                               5
Korinek (2007, 2010), Bianchi (2011) and Benigno et al (2012) develop models of foreign
borrowing subject to collateral constraints and pecuniary externalities in the exchange rate
that make the case for taxes on borrowing. Jeanne and Korinek (2010ab) and Bianchi and
Mendoza (2013) analyze models in which borrowing is collateralized by assets and there-
fore vulnerable to pecuniary externalities in asset prices, making the case for restrictions
on borrowing. However, none of these papers have distinguished between macroprudential
regulation and capital controls: they analyze simple model structures in which there is a
single type of domestic borrowers and international lenders; therefore there is no di¤er-
ence between macroprudential policy or capital controls – both are simply restrictions on
borrowing.6 Our paper develops a framework in which there is a meaningful distinction
between the two. This allows us to investigate the comparative advantages of the two types
of prudential instruments and provide policy lessons for when it is optimal to use which
instrument.
    An alternative strand of literature motivates macroprudential regulation or capital con-
trols based on aggregate demand externalities in the presence of nominal frictions and
limitations on the use of monetary policy. Farhi and Werning (2013) present a general
treatment of such aggregate demand externalities. Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2012) show
that there is a case for macroprudential policy in a monetary union when there is downward
rigidity in prices. Korinek and Simsek (2014) analyze the case for macroprudential taxes
on leverage to mitigate liquidity traps that are driven by deleveraging. Farhi and Werning
(2012, 2014) investigate the role for capital controls when monetary policy is unable to
manage aggregate demand because of restrictions stemming from …xed exchange rates or
because of stickiness in both prices and wages.
    The empirical evaluation of capital controls and macroprudential policy measures is
complicated by endogeneity problems – countries often tighten controls during booms in
capital and credit ‡ows, but the resulting positive correlation does not imply that the booms
are caused by prudential measures. Magud et al. (2011) discuss the endogeneity problem
arising in the evaluation of capital controls and conduct a meta-analysis of 34 empirical
papers. They conclude that capital controls can make monetary policy more independent,
change the composition of in‡ows, and reduce exchange rate pressure under certain circum-
stances. Claessens et al. (2013) analyze what types of macroprudential policy instruments
are most e¤ective at curbing credit booms by looking at their e¤ects on the balance sheets
of …nancial institutions. Federico et al. (2013) evaluate the e¤ectiveness of cyclical macro-
prudential policies using a narrative approach to identify exogenous variation. Forbes et
al. (2013) evaluate the e¤ectiveness of capital controls and macroprudential measures and
address the endogeneity bias using a propensity-score matching technique. Alfaro et al.
(2014) analyze the e¤ects of capital controls on …rm investment and show how they interact
with …rm-level liquidity constraints.
   6
    Jeanne (2014) presents a framework of optimal macroprudential regulation in which capital controls are
by construction a second-best device and focuses on the implications for international policy cooperation.
He observes, however, that capital controls may be desirable in addition to macroprudential regulation if
credit ‡ows from foreigners impose greater externalities than purely domestic credit ‡ows, as is the case in
our framework.

2       Model
2.1     Setup
We consider a small open economy with three time periods t 2 f0; 1; 2g. There is a unit mass
of domestic borrowers B and a unit mass of domestic savers S in the economy. Furthermore,
there is a large set of foreigners F who trade bonds (i.e. lend or borrow) at an exogenous
interest rate of 1. The two types of domestic agents i 2 fB; Sg derive utility from the
consumption ciT of traded goods and ciN of non-traded goods. For simplicity, they consume
non-traded goods only in period 1 so that their overall utility is given by,

                                   U i = u(ciT;0 ) + u(ci1 ) + u(ciT;2 )                               (1)

where the period utility functions u(c) = ln c and where ci1 = (ciT;1 ) (ciN;1 )1 is a consump-
tion index of traded and non-traded goods with relative expenditure shares and 1               .
We omit non-traded goods in periods 0 and 2 to simplify our analysis.
    In period 0, domestic agents use an endowment of traded goods yT;0       i   to consume and
           i
purchase b1 units of bonds, where b < 0 corresponds to borrowing,

                                            ciT;0 + bi1 = yT;0

                                                                          i ; y i ). Agents
In period 1, agents receive endowments of traded and non-traded goods (yT;1    N;1

    We denote the relative price of non-traded to traded consumption goods by p and observe
that p also represents a measure of the country’s real exchange rate.7 The period 1 budget
constraint of an agent i 2 fB; Lg is

                                ciT;1 + pciN;1 + bi2 = yT;1

                                                            + pyN;1 + bi1                              (3)

where bi2 is the amount of bonds carried into the following period.
                                                                            i
   In period 2, agents …nance their consumption using the traded endowment yT;2 and the
bonds carried into the period,

                                            ciT;2 = yT;2
                                                     i
                                                         + bi2                                         (4)
   The endowments of domestic borrowers and savers are distributed such that in periods
0 and 1 borrowers …nd it optimal to borrow, bB
                                             t < 0, and savers …nd it optimal to save,
 S
bt > 0.

Financial constraint We introduce a …nancial constraint on borrowers as in Mendoza
(2006) that is motivated by the commitment problem described in Korinek (2010): After
borrowers have received their loans in period 1, we assume they have an opportunity to
divert their income and renege on their borrowing. However, lenders can take them to court
    7
    A country’s real exchange rate is commonly de…ned as the price of a basket of domestic consumption
goods in terms of a basket of international consumption goods. In accordance with our small open economy
assumption, we take the price of international consumption goods and traded domestic consumption goods
as exogenous. Therefore the price of a domestic consumption basket is a strictly increasing function of the
relative price of domestic non-traded goods.

    This type of …nancial constraint (5) is common in the literature on emerging market
crises. The relative price p that appear in the constraint generates both …nancial ampli…-
cation e¤ects and pecuniary externalities. As we will show below, …nancial ampli…cation
e¤ects occur because when the constraint is binding, borrowers need to reduce consump-
tion which leads to real exchange rate depreciations that tighten the constraint further.
Pecuniary externalities occur because individual agents do not take into account how their
decisions a¤ect the real exchange rate and the tightness of the constraint.
    The strength of …nancial ampli…cation depends crucially on the parameter . For = 0,
there will be no ampli…cation since the borrowing limit is constant. The higher , the greater
the ampli…cation e¤ects. To ensure that the economy in our model is well-behaved and that
…nancial ampli…cation e¤ects are bounded, we impose

Assumption 1          < ^.

    where the upper limit ^ is characterized in Appendix A.1. This is a common assumption
in all models of …nancial ampli…cation and imposes only mild restrictions (see e.g. the
detailed discussion in section 3.2 of Korinek and Mendoza, 2014).

2.2    Decentralized Equilibrium
An equilibrium in the described economy consists of a set of allocations and prices in which
each agent i 2 fB; Sg maximizes her utility (1) subject to the budget constraints (2), (3)
and (4) as well as the …nancial constraint (5) and in which markets for nontraded goods
clear                              X
                                        i       i
                                     (CN;1    YN;1 )=0                                   (6)
                                           i
In this de…nition, we follow the convention of denoting aggregate variables by upper-case
               i
letters, e.g. CN;1 is aggregate nontraded consumption and so forth. Market clearing for
traded goods is ensured by the domestic budget constraints together with the fact that
foreign agents can satisfy any amount of borrowing or lending by domestic agents.
    We solve for the equilibrium via backward induction. It proves useful to express the
period 1 welfare of domestic agents i 2 fB; Sg as a function of their period 1 liquid net
worth, de…ned as the period 1 endowment of traded goods plus bond holdings,

                                               mi = yT;1
                                                     i
                                                         + bi1

We observe that the aggregate state of the economy in period 1 is fully described by the
aggregate liquid net worth positions of the two sets of domestic agents (M B ; M S ). In
   8
    We could re…ne this constraint by assuming di¤erent degrees of pledgeability for traded and non-traded
goods but this is not essential to our analysis. We could also impose an equivalent constraint on period 0
borrowing bi1 but the model solution would be degenerate if this constraint is binding – all the interesting
decisions of borrowers are pre-determined by binding constraints. Without loss of generality, we focus on
equilibria in which the period 0 constraint is loose.

equilibrium, mi = M i will hold but private agents do not internalize their impact on
aggregate variables when making their optimal choices.

where we assigned the shadow prices i and i to the period 1 budget constraint (3) and
the borrowing constraint (5). The envelope condition implies that the marginal valuation
of liquid net worth of individual agents satis…es

                                              @V i
                                                   = uiT;1                                                        (8)
                                              @mi
where we denote by uiT;1 = @u ci1 =@ciT;1 the marginal utility of traded consumption in
period 1 and similarly for uiT;0 , uiN;1 and uiT;2 . The optimality conditions associated with
the optimization problem yield two Euler equations

                                      uiT;0 = uiT;1                                                               (9)
                                      uiT;1 = uiT;2 +                     i
                                                                                                                 (10)

and where i is the shadow price on the borrowing constraint of agent i. Since domestic
savers S are not borrowing, we know that S = 0.
    The optimality condition that relates period 1 traded and non-traded consumption de-
livers an expression for the exchange rate

                                            uiN;1           1           ciT;1
                                    p=               =
                                            uiT;1                       ciN;1

   Since this condition has to hold for both domestic agents, we observe that we can add
up the traded/non-traded consumption of both agents and combine the result with the
market-clearing condition (6) for non-traded goods to obtain
                                                        B + CS
                                                       CT;1
                                            1                T;1
                                    p=                                                                           (11)
                                                                YN;1
              B + Y S . In short, the real exchange rate is a strictly increasing function
where YN;1 = YN;1  N;1
                                B + CS
of aggregate tradable spending CT;1  T;1 .


2.2.1    Characterizing the Decentralized Equilibrium
Proceeding via backward induction, we …rst characterize the decentralized equilibrium in
periods 1 and 2 and then analyze the optimal period 0 decisions. We separately analyze

                                                        9
equilibrium when the …nancial constraint on borrowers is loose, corresponding to normal
times, and when the …nancial constraint is binding, corresponding to crisis times. We de…ne
the set of state variables M B ; M S for which the economy is unconstrained by Munc and
the set for which they are constrained by Mcon ; the two are mutually exclusive and are
de…ned in Appendix A.1.

Unconstrained equilibria For unconstrained equilibria, i.e. for M B ; M S 2 Munc ,
all agents smooth consumption according to their Euler equation so that uiT;1 = uiT;2 for
8i 2 fB; Sg. Period 1 traded consumption of agent i is given by

                               ciT;1 =       mi + pyN;1
                                                    i      i
                                                        + yT;2                         (12)
                                         2
since the agent spends half of her income in period 1 and a fraction thereof on traded
goods. The exchange rate can be written as a simple function of M B ; M S

                                         1     M B + M S + YT;2
                                                            B +YS
                                                                T;2
                       p M B; M S =
                                         1+              YN;1

This implies that an increase in the liquid net worth M i of either domestic agent pushes up
the real exchange rate by
                              @p     @p      1
                                  =      =             >0
                             @M B   @M S   YN;1 (1 + )
Notice that the e¤ects of borrowers and lenders’ net worth on the real exchange rate are
equal because the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is identical for both agents when
they are unconstrained. From equation (12), we can indeed derive
                                         h              i
                                       @ ciT;1 + pciN;1     1
                             M P Ci =            i
                                                          =
                                             @m             2
Therefore, an increase in either agent’s net worth equally stimulates aggregate domestic
demand and appreciates the real exchange rate.

Constrained equilibria For constrained equilibria, i.e. for M B ; M S 2 Mcon , the level
of traded consumption of borrowers is determined by the binding constraint (5) and is given
by
                         cB
                          T;1 =   mB + pyN;1
                                           B        B
                                              + (yT;1       B
                                                       + pyN;1 )                       (13)
In short, borrowers spend a fraction of their liquid net worth on traded goods. Spending
on traded goods by savers is still given by condition (12). We can use the two expressions
to express the real exchange rate in (11) as a linear function of M B ; M S that is given by
                                                                       !
                                                             M S +YS
                                     1                             T;2
                     p M B; M S =           M B + YT;1 B
                                                          +                             (14)
                                       D                         2

where D = YN;1    (1       B (1+ )+Y S =2] > 0 is strictly positive under our Assumption
                        )[YN;1      N;1
1, < ^ .

                                               10
    In the constrained region, an increase in either agent’s net worth raises the real exchange
rate. However, di¤erently from the unconstrained region, an increase in borrowers’net worth
has a twice as strong e¤ect as an increase in savers’net worth
                                @p    1             @p     1
                                  B
                                    =          >       S
                                                         =      >0
                               @M       D          @M        2D
The reason for the di¤erent impact of borrowers’and savers’net worth lies in the di¤erent
marginal propensity to consume. Facing a binding constraint, borrowers’MPC is now twice
as high as under the unconstrained solution. Using equation (13), we indeed observe that
                                                            1

    Figure 4 schematically depicts the response of the exchange rate p to varying the level of
MB   for two di¤erent levels of the net worth of savers M S . For each level of M S , there is a
threshold value of M B below which the equilibrium becomes constrained, indicated by the
vertical dashed lines. In the constrained region, i.e. to the left, the exchange rate responds
strongly to changes in M B since …nancial ampli…cation e¤ects are at play: additional net
worth allows borrowers to demand more non-traded goods, which pushes up their prices
and relaxes the …nancial constraint, leading to a virtuous cycle of rising prices and loosening
of the constraint.

Lemma 1 (i) The economy’s real exchange rate is an increasing function of period 1 spend-
ing on traded goods, which in turn is an increasing function of both net worth M B and M S .
    (ii) If the economy is unconstrained, then @p=@M B = @p=@M S > 0.
    (iii) If the economy is constrained, then @p=@M B > @p=@M S > 0

Proof. See discussion above.

Comparative statics of net worth M i . For our subsequent analysis, it proves useful
to analyze how the welfare of the two types of domestic agents is a¤ected by changes in

respect to the aggregate net worth M i of agent i we see that:

in the price of non-traded goods @p=@M j , i.e through pecuniary externalities. All other
variables are either exogenous or optimally chosen by private agents, which allows us to
apply the envelope theorem and omit any associated derivatives in expression (15).
    We distinguish the pecuniary externalities that arise from changes in M i into two parts:
The …rst part corresponds to the …rst term in equation (15), which we denote by Rij , and
re‡ects that price changes create redistributions between agents. Since non-traded goods
are only traded among domestic agents, the redistributions between domestic agents always
net out, i.e. Rii + Rij = 0. If agent j is a net seller of non-traded goods (yN;1
                                                                              j
                                                                                  > cjN;1 ) then
an increase in the price of the good bene…ts agent j and vice versa.
    The second part corresponds to the second term in equation (15), which we denote
with ji , and re‡ects that price changes a¤ect the tightness of collateral constraints in the
economy. An increase in the exchange rate relaxes collateral constraints which provides a
welfare bene…t j .
    For our model to be well-behaved, we impose the following assumption on the redistrib-
utive terms:
                  B
Assumption 2 1 + RB           RSB > 0.

   This rules out “immiserizing”transfers, i.e. it ensures that transferring one dollar from
savers to borrowers does not lead to price changes that reduce borrowers’wealth.

2.3   Constrained Planning Problem
A social planner in the described economy maximizes the weighted sum of welfare of domes-
tic agents in the economy, subject to the economy’s resource constraints. Since international
lenders are indi¤erent between lending or borrowing, their utility is una¤ected by the allo-
cations in the domestic economy, and they can be omitted from the planning problem. By
implication, any Pareto e¢ cient allocation in the domestic economy is also a Pareto e¢ cient
global allocation.
    We focus on a constrained planning problem in which the allocations of the planner are
subject to the same …nancial constraint (5) as the allocations of private agents. Following
the tradition of Stiglitz (1981) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1986), we assume that
the constrained planner can pick the …nancial allocations of domestic agents in period 0
and that she leaves the remaining allocations in periods 1 and 2 to be determined by de-
centralized agents. This implies that the planner takes it as given that the exchange rate
is determined in decentralized markets according to condition (11), capturing the notion




                                                    12
that it is commonplace for policymakers to impose …nancial regulation that restricts bor-
rowing/lending, but that it is di¢ cult for them to directly set the level of exchange rates in
…nancial markets without giving rise to massive arbitrage behavior.9
    The constrained planner chooses the optimal period 0 allocations while internalizing
how the aggregate period 1 state variables, i.e. the aggregate liquid net worth positions
(M B ; M S ) of domestic agents, a¤ect equilibrium and welfare in the economy in periods 1
and 2. Speci…cally, the constrained social planner maximizes the weighted sum of domestic
social welfare with weights i , i 2 fB; Sg, subject to the period 0 resource constraint of the
economy,

                                                   By varying the welfare weights, we can
trace the entire Pareto frontier of the economy. The continuation utility of private agents
of type i 2 fB; Sg from time 1 onwards is given by the value function V i mi ; M B ; M S
that we characterized in equation (7) in the decentralized equilibrium.

Characterizing the Planning Solution
Using the envelope condition @V i =@mi = uiT;1 , the planner’s optimality conditions are

                              uT;0    =       uT;0                                                                   (17)
                                                                            @V   i         @V  j

                                                                                 +                                   (18)

for j 6= i. The intra-temporal condition (17) equates the weighted marginal utility of
consumption across agents at time 0. In the Euler equation (18), the usual consumption
smoothing motive –captured by the marginal utilities uiT;t –is complemented by two addi-
tional terms that re‡ect the pecuniary externalities of agent i carrying wealth into period
1 on himself and the other agent.
    Using equation (15), the market clearing condition (6), and S = 0 since savers are by
construction not borrowing-constrained, we rewrite the planner’s Euler equation (18) as
                               2                                                 3

       smoothing consumption                      redistributing between agents                relaxing constraint

The …rst curly brackets capture the usual consumption smoothing considerations and coin-
cide with the Euler equation of private agents. In addition to this, the planner recognizes
   9
    The assumption that policymakers cannot directly set exchange rates can be relaxed as long as there is
a cost associated with doing so. See, for example, Benigno et al. (2013) for exchange rate intervention. Our
basic results continue to hold in these cases. Our assumption is also supported by the experience of many
emerging economies that were either forced to abandon nominal pegs or experienced strong real depreciations
under …xed nominal exchange rates during crises.


                                                                13
that her allocation of liquid wealth M i a¤ects the real exchange rate and leads to two further
e¤ects: a higher exchange rate redistributes from net buyers to net sellers of non-traded
goods, as captured by the second curly bracket; furthermore, a higher real exchange rate
relaxes the collateral constraint of borrowers, captured by the last term.
    Using the terms Rij and ji for the redistributions and collateral e¤ects of changes in
net worth, we can rewrite the equation more compactly as

                      i i          i i           i i         j j
                       uT;0   =     uT;1   +      uT;1        uT;1   Rii +     B B   B
                                                                                     i


    We characterize the solution to the constrained planning problem in the economy as
follows:

                                           = 1                                            (21)
                                  uST;0             uB
                                                     T;0 1 +
                                                                B
                                                               RB        RSB

    (ii) In allocations in which the …nancial constraint is loose, B = 0, the planner’s
optimality conditions coincide with those of decentralized agents.
    (iii) In allocations in which the …nancial constraint is binding, B > 0, the planner
introduces a wedge in the marginal rate of substitution and acts in a more precautionary
manner than private agents in period 0, i.e. uiT;0 > uiT;1 . Furthermore, the wedge is larger
for borrowers than for savers.

Proof. For (i), we obtain equations (20) and (21) by combining the planner’s Euler equation
(19) for both agents to
                                                             B B     B       B

                               uT;1         uT;1   =                B
                                                             1+    RB     RSB

The di¤erence between the weighted marginal utilities of borrowers and savers re‡ect the dif-
ference in how much borrower and saver net worth relax the constraint B  B
                                                                               B normalized
                                                                               S
by the redistributions created by moving one dollar from savers to borrowers. Substituting
this expression back into the Euler equation delivers the result.
    For (ii), we observe that the terms on the right-hand side of equations (20) and (21)
drops out.
    For (iii), notice that all parts of the wedge terms are positive. For B and uB   T;0 this
holds by de…nition; B   B  >    B > 0 holds because @p=@M B > @p=@M S > 0. Finally,
                                S
1 + RBB    RSB > 0 by Assumption 2

   Intuitively, when the collateral constraint on borrowers is loose, the only pecuniary
externalities that appear are the redistributions between borrowers and lenders Rij and
the associated allocation is Pareto e¢ cient. This result re‡ects the standard …nding that


                                                    14
pecuniary externalities cancel out when …nancial markets are complete, as implied by the
…rst welfare theorem –the gain of one type of agent is the loss of another.
    By contrast, when borrowers are constrained, the planner can relax the constraint by
shoring up the net worth of both borrowers and savers since both of them consume non-
traded goods. Higher net worth during crisis times means that they have more to spend
on nontraded goods, which pushes up the real exchange rate and mitigates the contrac-
tionary depreciations. The planner introduces a larger wedge in the optimality condition of
borrowers since they have a higher marginal propensity to spend.

2.3.1      Implementation
Policymakers can replicate any constrained optimal allocation through a combination of
taxes and subsidies on borrowers and savers combined with a lump sum transfer. Specif-
ically, assume that policymakers have the ability to impose a tax/subsidy i on the bond
purchases and can implement lump-sum transfers T i in period 0 for i 2 fB; Sg. The budget
constraint of individual agents in period 0 becomes
                                    ciT;0 + 1       i
                                                        bi1 + T i = yT;0
                                                                     i


Speci…cally, when bi1 > 0 so agent i is a saver, then i > 0 represents a subsidy to saving.
When bi1 < 0 so agent i is a borrower, then i > 0 constitutes a tax on borrowing. In
either case, a positive value for the policy instrument i induces agent i to carry more
liquid net worth into the following period. This modi…es the private optimization problem
of decentralized agents so their Euler equation becomes
                                                i
                                          1         uiT;0 = uiT;1
A policymaker can use these instruments to implement the constrained e¢ cient allocations
characterized in Proposition 2 as follows:

Corollary 3 (i) Any constrained e¢ cient equilibrium can be implemented by a pair of taxes
   B ; S with B > S together with lump-sum transfers that satisfy the government budget

Given these tax rates, the optimality conditions of private agents coincide with the planner’s
intertemporal optimality conditions (20) and (21).
    For (ii), note that if we assign S as the shadow price on the constraint U S          U S;DE
and set    B  = 1, then the described optimization problem coincides with the planner’s
optimization problem (16). In equilibrium, the constraint U S           U S;DE will hold with
equality and will guarantee that savers are equally well o¤. Since the initial allocation is
feasible for the planner but the planner does not choose it, borrower welfare is strictly higher
and the planner’s allocation constitutes a Pareto improvement. It can be implemented as
described in (i).
    How can the tax instruments B ; S be mapped into macroprudential regulation and
capital controls? As illustrated in Figure 1, capital controls impose a wedge between all do-
mestic agents and foreigners so as to segment domestic and international …nancial markets.
This implies that capital controls increase both B and S . By contrast, macroprudential
measures increase the rate at which domestic agents borrow but do not a¤ect the rate at
which savers lend. Therefore they increase B but do not a¤ect S . These considerations
imply the following mapping between B ; S and CC ; M P :
                                   S                 CC
                              1        =    1
                                   B                 CC       MP
                              1        =    1             1

Corollary 4 The regulated equilibrium described in Corollary 3 can also be implemented by
setting the economy’s level of capital controls to CC = S and setting the level of macropru-
dential regulation to …ll the gap between S and B so that 1     MP = 1         B = 1     S .




Proof. See discussion above.

2.4   Uncertainty
This section extends our earlier analysis to explicitly account for uncertainty. Our baseline
setup described the simplest framework possible to zero in on the imperfections created
by contractionary depreciations by assuming perfect foresight. However, it goes without
saying that the occurence of …nancial crises in practice involves a considerable amount of
uncertainty. In this section, we explicitly account for this.
    We assume there is a stochastic shock ! 2 that is realized at the beginning of period
1 and that a¤ects the period 1 traded income of both domestic    n agents,o which we hence
            i                                                       B
denote by yT;1 (!). We assume that the lowest realization min yT;1 (!) is su¢ ciently low
to make the …nancial constraint on borrowers binding.
    In the following, we focus …rst on the case of complete markets in period 0 in which
private agents can make their privately optimal insurance decisions against the stochastic
shock !. Next we will assume that the period 0 …nancial market is incomplete and domestic
agents can only borrow or save in uncontingent bonds.




                                                16
2.4.1     Complete Markets
We assume that private agents can borrow or save with foreigners in a complete market of
Arrow securities in period 0. We denote the contracted payo¤ that agent i receives in state
of nature ! by bi1 (!) and observe that foreigners are willing to sell this payo¤ at a price
of E bi1 (!) in period 0. We use our earlier de…nition of the reduced-form utility V i ( ) to
express the optimization problem of private agents as
                             i
                      max u yT;0        E bi1 (!)      + E V i mi (!) ; M B (!) ; M S (!)                (23)
                      bi1 (!)


where mi (!) = yT;1i (!) + bi (!) and M B (!) ; M S (!) are now stochastic and private
                              1
agents take the latter as given. Given mi (!) and M B (!) ; M S (!) , the utility of domestic
agents and the associated allocations in periods 1 and 2 are fully characterized by the
optimization problem V mi ; M B ; M S that we de…ned in section 2.2.
   Private agents choose their Arrow security holdings bi1 (!) according to the standard
Euler equation
                                       uiT;0 = uiT;1 (!)                                (24)
They …nd it optimal to perfectly smooth consumption between periods 0 and 1 and across
all states of nature in period 1, given the risk-neutrality of foreigners and the availability of
actuarially fair insurance. However, in states of nature in which the …nancial constraint is
binding, optimal consumption smoothing between periods 1 and 2 is inhibited.

   Let us contrast the decentralized equilibrium with the solution chosen by a constrained
planner under uncertainty. As before, a constrained social planner maximizes the weighted
sum of domestic welfare
                X
                       i      i
        max              u CT;0    + E V i mi (!) ; M B (!) ; M S (!)                 (25)
         i ;B i (!)

        s.t.              CT;0 + E B1i (!)            i
                                                     YT;0        0 ;   mi (!) = M i (!) = YT;1
                                                                                           i
                                                                                               (!) + B1i (!)
               i2fB;Lg

   The planner’s intra- and inter-temporal optimality conditions can be written as a state-
contingent version of equations (17) and (18) or (19). The resulting allocations mirror our
…ndings in Proposition 2:

Proposition 5 (Underinsurance) Any constrained e¢ cient allocation in the domestic
economy satis…es

                       uiT;1 (!)           B
                                               (!)               B
                                                                 i  (!)
                                   =1                                          for i 2 fB; Sg            (26)
                          uiT;0            uB
                                            T;0      1+      B
                                                            RB   (!) RSB (!)

Proof. The proof follows along the same lines as the Proof of Proposition 2.

   Equation (26) re‡ects that the planner does not deviate from the optimal smoothing
condition (24) of private agents as long as the …nancial constraint of borrowers is loose so
 B
   = 0 and the last term in the equation drops out. However, in states of nature in which

                                                             17
the …nancial constraint is binding, B > 0, the planner acts in a more precautionary manner
and introduces a wedge in the marginal rate of substitution of both sets of private agents in
period 0, i.e. uiT;0 > uiT;1 (!). As before, the wedge is larger for borrowers than for savers.
    Intuitively, the planner insures more against states of nature with binding constraints
than private agents. She carries greater net worth for both agents into constrained states of
nature in period 1 in order to push up the exchange rate and relax the …nancial constraint.
This creates a deviation from optimal smoothing between periods 0 and 1 in those states
but enables better smoothing between periods 1 and 2.
    Our result on underinsurance in the decentralized equilibrium underline that capital
controls and macroprudential policy measures need to be sensitive to the riskiness of …nan-
cial transactions. Uncontingent debt contracts that require repayments even in bad states
of nature impose large externalities and call for high levels of regulation, whereas contingent
…nancial instruments that provide insurance (e.g. equity) create much smaller externalities.
This mirrors the …ndings of Korinek (2010, 2011) on the desirability of risk-sensitive capital
controls and macroprudential regulations.

2.4.2        Incomplete Markets
In practice, emerging economies frequently have limited access to insurance instruments
against aggregate risk. We capture this in the current subsection by assuming that domestic
agents can only borrow or save in uncontingent bonds, even though their traded income
 i (!) in period 1 is stochastic.
yT;1
    The optimization problem of domestic agents is identical to problem (23) except that
the choice variable is now the uncontingent bond holdings bi1 instead of bi1 (!) so that
mi (!) = yT;1
           i (!) + bi and similarly for M i (!). Private agents choose their bond position
                      1
 i
b1 so as to smooth the expected marginal utility of traded consumption, according to the
standard Euler equation
                                    uiT;0 = E uiT;1 (!)
The problem of a planner can also be expressed analogously to problem (25) with the
uncontingent bond holdings bi1 replacing bi1 (!). The inter-temporal optimality condition of
the planner is
                         h                        i
   i i                                 j j
    uT;0 = i E uiT;1 + E      i i
                               uT;1     uT;1 Rii + B E B B     i

        i                          j j                            j j
  =         E uiT;1 + E    i i
                            uT;1    uT;1   E Rii + Cov    i i
                                                           uT;1    uT;1 ; Rii   +   B
                                                                                        E   B   B
                                                                                                i
                                                                                                (27)
As in our earlier analysis, saving one additional unit of net worth in period 0 in the uncon-
tingent bond has three e¤ects in period 1: it reduces the expected marginal utility of traded
consumption; it leads to a change in the exchange rate and an expected redistribution be-
tween the two agents; and it leads to an expected relaxation in the collateral constraint.
Notice that we can express the redistributive e¤ect as the sum of the expected redistribution
plus a covariance term. To sign the latter, recall that RiB = @p=@M i (yN;1 B     cB
                                                                                   N;1 ) where
        B
@p=@M > 0 is constant. Therefore
                   B B       S S      B
             Cov    uT;1      uT;1 ; RB   = @p=@M i Cov   B B

                                                                    uT;1 ; yN;1     cB
                                                                                     N;1


                                                18

     T;1                                  N;1 cN;1 are above average and vice versa. There-

     The following proposition characterizes how the planner will optimally intervene in an
economy with incomplete markets:

Proof. We combine the inter-temporal optimality conditions (27) for the two agents to

Plugging this expression back into (27) and simplifying terms by using RSB = RB
                                                                              B =2 and
 B = B =2 delivers the planner’s optimal wedges.
 S     B

    Since the covariance term is positive, the wedge imposed by the planner is greater
under incomplete markets than what is suggested by the expected tightness of constraints
E B B   B . Intuitively, the covariance term captures that shoring up the net worth of
domestic agents has the greatest redistributive e¤ects when borrowers are most constrained
since they cannot insure. This increases the incentive of the planner to shore up the net
worth of both agents.


3    Asset Price Externalities
Borrowing constraints that are linked to asset prices can give rise to vicious cycles and
pecuniary externalities similar to those that arise from exchange rate depreciations. We
have shown so far that externalities linked to contractionary exchange rate depreciations
call for both macroprudential regulation and capital controls. Although such contractionary
depreciations are relevant in emerging markets economies (especially those with signi…cant
foreign currency debts), they play less of a role in advanced economies. However, advanced
economies are nonetheless vulnerable to feedback loops triggered by falling asset prices,
tightening collateral constraints, and …re sales, as illustrated in Figure 5. These can also
give rise to pecuniary externalities.
    This section shows that macroprudential regulation alone is su¢ cient to address pecu-
niary externalities linked to …re sales in asset prices. This contrasts with our baseline model
in which pecuniary externalities are driven by exchange rate depreciations. The key insight
of the section is that …re sales and asset prices are determined solely by the net worth of
borrowers; therefore there is no economic rationale for shoring up the net worth of savers,
and capital controls are super‡uous.

           Figure 5: Feedback loop of …nancial crises with de‡ation of capital prices


    We drop non-traded goods from our baseline model and assume instead that agents
obtain an endowment k1i of capital goods that are traded domestically in period 1 and
produce output according to a production function F i k2i in period 2. In order to generate
the potential for …re sales, we assume that the production function of savers is inferior to that
of borrowers. Speci…cally, we assume F B k2B = Ak2B and F S0 (0) = A but F S00 k2S < 0,
where we use one and two prime symbols to denote the …rst and second derivative. In other
words, borrowers have a linear production and savers are equally productive in employing
the …rst marginal unit of asset but experience decreasing returns thereafter.

following optimization problem:

                     max U i    s.t.   ciT;0 + bi1 = yT;0
                                                      1

                                       ciT;1 + bi2 = yT;1

                                                          + q(k1i           k2i ) + bi1
                                               ciT;2 = yT;2

where q is the price at which capital goods trade in period 1 so that q(k1i k2i ) constitutes
the revenue derived from …re sales.
    We follow Jeanne and Korinek (2010ab) in assuming that borrowers can borrow up to
a fraction of the period 1 value of their capital asset holdings,

   The …rst order conditions of private agents include the standard Euler conditions

                                         uiT;1 = uiT;2 +         i


and the optimality condition for capital asset purchases, which pins down the price of capital
                                uiT;2 F i0 (k2i )                F i0 (k2i )
                      q=                              =                                     (28)

The price q equals the marginal product of capital discounted by the marginal rate of
substitution, where only a fraction (1 ) of the asset needs to be …nanced with period

                                                     20
1 funds and a fraction can be …nanced by borrowing from period 2. The asset price is
therefore inversely related to consumption growth between period 1 and 2, which re‡ects
the tightness of the borrowing constraint.

Characterizing the Decentralized Equilibrium
Since savers are unconstrained, it follows that S = 0 and uST;1 = uST;2 . This also implies
that savers simply set the marginal product of capital equal to the market price

                                        q = F S0 (k2S )

This is an implication of the Fisherian separation between consumption and investment
that applies to unconstrained agents. Therefore, changes in the net worth of savers M S
have no impact on asset prices
                                            @q
                                                 =0
                                           @M S
Similarly, changes in net worth of borrowers M B have no e¤ect on asset prices if the …nancial
constraint is loose. In this case, borrowers purchase the whole stock of capital since they
have a better production technology, and the unconstrained asset price is given by q = A.
    If instead borrowers are constrained, they face a trade-o¤ between consuming and pur-
chasing capital. Savers still set their marginal product of capital equal to q, but borrowers
reduce capital in proportion to the tightness of the constraint as in equation (28). This
generates a reallocation of capital from borrowers to savers which lowers asset prices below
their unconstrained level A.
    As shown in Appendix A.2, an increase in the net worth M B of constrained borrowers
leads under mild regularity conditions to higher capital prices,
                                           @q
                                               >0
                                          @M B
Higher net worth raises borrowers’ demand for capital that increases asset prices and in
turn relaxes borrowing constraints. We summarize the above considerations in the following
lemma:

Lemma 7 (i) The asset price q is independent of the liquid net worth M S of savers,
i.e. @q=@M S = 0.
    (ii) As long as borrowers are unconstrained, the asset price equals q = A and is inde-
pendent of the net worth of borrowers. If borrowers are constrained, the asset price is an
increasing function of the liquid net worth of borrowers,
                                           @q
                                               >0                                        (29)
                                          @M B
Proof. See discussion above.
    When borrowers are constrained, an increase in M B , by rising asset prices, triggers
redistributive e¤ects and relaxes the borrowing constraint. The redistributive e¤ect on
borrowers is captured by:
                                   B     @q
                                 RB  =        k B k2B
                                       @M B 1

                                              21
which is positive if borrowers are net sellers of capital and negative otherwise. Similarly to
the model with exchange rate externalities, we assume
                  B >0
Assumption 3 1 + RB
   This ensures that providing one extra dollar to borrowers does not immiserize them by
reducing their wealth through large negative redistributive e¤ects. The impact of higher
M B on the borrowing constraint is captured by
                                        B          @q
                                        B   =          kB > 0
                                                  @M B 2

Characterizing the Planner Solution
The setup of the planner’s problem is analogous to the one described in section 2.3. In
choosing the Pareto e¢ cient allocation, the planner takes into account that changes in M S
have no e¤ect on asset prices, and thus do not trigger redistributive e¤ects, RSB = 0, and do
not a¤ect borrowing constraints, B   S = 0. The planner has therefore no reason to distort
savers’ intertemporal decisions and the planner’s Euler equation for savers is identical to
the laissez-faire optimality condition:
                                                uST;0 = uST;1
    However, the planner still intervenes in the …nancial decisions of borrowers when the
constraint is binding. Greater liquidity M B increases borrowers’ demand for capital and
raises asset prices. The planner’s Euler equation for borrowers (20) is:
                                                                 B
                                  uB      B
                                   T;0 = uT;1 +
                                                          B      B
                                                                   B
                                                              1 + RB
Given Assumption 3 and B B                                              B    B
                                 B > 0, the planner’s wedge raises uT;0 =uT;1 which limits
borrowing at time 0.
    The social planner thus shores up the liquid net worth of borrowers so as to reduce
asset …re sales without distorting the inter-temporal decisions of lenders. Intuitively, this
is because an increase in the net worth of borrowers supports asset prices and relaxes
borrowing constraints, whereas the net worth of savers is inconsequential for asset prices.
The willingness of savers to purchase assets in period 1 depends on their production function
and on the interest rate at which they are able to fund asset purchases, which is determined
on world markets and does not depend on their net worth since savers are unconstrained.
Therefore there is no reason for the planner to distort their intertemporal allocation in
period 0.
Corollary 8 (Asset Price Externalities) In a model in which …nancial constraints are
linked to asset prices, a planner imposes macroprudential restrictions on borrowers,
                                                     B          B
                               MP           B                   B
                                    =           =                      > 0,
                                                    uB        B
                                                     T;0 1 + RB

but does not impose capital controls so         CC   =    S   = 0.

Proof. See discussion above and Corollary 4.

4    Conclusions
This paper analyzes the bene…ts and costs of capital controls versus macroprudential regula-
tion in reducing …nancial fragility. Our main …nding is that both instruments play distinct
roles. We develop a stylized model in which a planner …nds it optimal to impose both
capital controls and macroprudential regulation when we calibrate it to re‡ect the typical
conditions of emerging economies. By imposing capital controls, she raises the net worth
of both domestic borrowers and savers. By imposing macroprudential regulation, she raises
the net worth of borrowers even further, which is desirable because constrained borrowers
have a higher marginal propensity to consume than unconstrained savers.
    When our model is calibrated to re‡ect conditions in advanced economies, where ex-
change rate ‡uctuations are less destabilizing, we still …nd a role for policy intervention
in order to avoid boom and bust cycles in asset prices. To address these externalities, a
planner in our model …nds it optimal to increase the net worth of domestic borrowers, but
has no reason to intervene on domestic savers because the net worth of domestic savers has
no in‡uence on their demand for capital and thus on asset prices because of the Fisherian
separation between consumption and investment decisions. Macroprudential regulation is
thus su¢ cient to deal with externalities linked to asset prices.
    There are a number of issues that are beyond the scope of the current paper. First,
our paper distinguishes between capital controls and macroprudential regulation based on
one speci…c dimension along which borrowing from foreign and domestic lenders di¤ers –
the pecuniary externalities on exchange rates that they generate. Although contractionary
movements in exchange rates are of utmost importance during …nancial crises, there is a
range of additional dimension that are relevant. For example, borrowing from domestic and
foreign lenders likely leads to di¤erent bailout and risk-shifting probabilities and generates
di¤erent incentive e¤ects. They also lead to di¤erent aggregate demand e¤ects. Further-
more, when interacting with international lenders, considerations about market power that
are absent in domestic lending relationships may come into play. Finally, it may be desirable
to regulate borrowing from domestic or foreign lenders di¤erently when the residency of the
lender correlates with features that cannot be directly observed, such as the ‡ightiness of
funds, or that cannot be targeted directly because restrictions on regulatory instruments.
These considerations are analyzed in detail in Ostry et al. (2014).
    Secondly, there are additional policy measures that have sometimes been used in a
prudential manner. For example, reserve accumulation may be helpful to stem real ap-
preciation if international capital markets are su¢ ciently segmented to prevent arbitrage;
contractionary monetary policy may be able to prick bubbles; …scal consolidation may pre-
vent an economy from overheating. Ostry et al. (2010) and Blanchard et al. (2014) discuss
several of these options. However, following the principle that a distortion is best addressed
directly at its source, capital controls or macroprudential regulation may be better-suited
than other instruments to deal with the pecuniary externalities generated by …nancial crises.
For example, Korinek and Simsek (2014) show that monetary policy is not a well-suited
instrument to stem against excessive leverage.
    Thirdly, our paper focuses on prudential interventions to mitigate crisis risk, i.e. policy
measures that are taken in good times in order to reduce the risk and magnitude of crises
in response to bad shocks in the future. There is a complementary literature that focuses


                                              23
on ex-post policy measures (see e.g. Benigno et al., 2013; Jeanne and Korinek, 2013) that
are taken if a country experiences a …nancial crisis. This is particularly relevant for the
analysis of capital controls since many countries (including e.g. Iceland and Cyprus) have
used controls on out‡ows as a crisis management tool.

A.1    Model with Non-Traded Goods
The technical condition that characterizes the upper limit ^ on the pledgeability parameter
in the model with non-traded goods is
                                       h                       i

Given this de…nition, the assumption < ^ implies that the denominator D in expression
(14) is strictly positive so as to avoid degenerate equilibria.
   The unconstrained region, i.e. the set of M B ; M S 2 Munc , is determined by the fact
that the borrowing level that ensures full consumption smoothing is no greater than the
constrained limit:
                          1
                             M B + pYN;1

                          2
By substituting out the de…nition of the price level in the unconstrained region:
                                    1
                               p=          M B + MS + YT;2

A.2    Model with Capital Goods
To analyze how M B a¤ects the price of capital goods when borrowers are constrained,
consider that savers set their marginal product of capital equal to the price q. Using the
fact that K2S = K K2B , where K is the total stock of capital, we infer that

                                     @q                  @K2B
                                         =       F S00
                                    @M B                 @M B
Since F S00 < 0, we see that @q=@M B > 0 if and only if @K2B =@M B > 0. This latter
derivative can be analyzed by considering that the optimality condition (28) implies

                                              F B0
                               F S0 =
                                         + (1   )uB      B
                                                   T;1 =uT;2

where the consumption levels of constrained borrowers are given by:
                       B
                      CT;1 = M B + q(K1B          K2B ) +        B
                                                                YT;1 + qK2B
                       B
                      CT;2 = F B + YT;2
                                    B              B
                                                  YT;1 + qK2B

By using the implicit function theorem, we can show that

                                            @K2B
                                                 >0
                                            @M2B

under the following (su¢ cient but not necessary) conditions:
                    B
                  @CT;1
                          =     F S00 K1B    K2B + K2B         F S0 (1   )<0
                  @K2B
                    B
                  @CT;2
                          = A           F S00 K2B + F S0 > 0
                  @K2B

The …rst condition implies that an increase in K2B should come at the cost of a reduction
     B . This requires placing an upper bound on the collateral parameter
in CT;1                                                                         and ensuring
that the second derivative of the savers’production function is not too high in order to limit
the responsiveness of prices to the demand for capital. The second condition requires that
a marginal increase in K2B leads to greater net worth at time 2 and thus higher CT;2B . This

condition also places an upper bound on .
