                          SEARCHING FOR A BREAK IN GNP


                                      ABSTRACT


     It has been suggested that existing estimates of the long-run impact of
a surprise move in   income   may have a substantial upward bias due to the
presence   of a trend break in post war U.S. GNP data. This paper shows that

the statistical evidence does not warrant abandoning the no trend null

hypothesis. A key part of the argument is that conventionally computed

significance levels overstate the likelihood of the trend break alternative

hypothesis. This is because they do not take into account that, in practice,

the break date is chosen based on pre-test examination of the data.

I. Introduction


       There is considerable interest in measuring the long—run effects of a surprise
change in income. Estimates vary widely, from a very small effect implied by a
trend stationary representation for income (Deaton [1986]) to a very large effect
implied by a difference stationary representation for income (Campbell and Mankiw
[1988].) Ultimately, this interest stems from the view that substantive economic
questions depend on the magnitude of this effect. For example, Deaton (1986) has
argued that if the effect is large, then modern consumption theory is in trouble,
being unable to account for the observed smoothness of consumption. Nelson and
Plosser (1982) argue that the magnitude of the impact reveals the ultimate source of
disturbances to the economy. If the magnitude is small, then most disturbances are
to aggregate demand: for example, shocks to money, household preference, or
government spending. If the effects are large, on the other hand, then most
macroeconomic disturbances are supply side disturbances, such as the technology
shocks emphasized by Prescott (1986).
       Recently, it has been suggested that the magnitude of the impact of income
innovations may have been vastly overstated, because researchers have failed to
take into account that post war GNP has undergone a one—time break in trend
(Perron [1986], Rappoport and Reichlin [1987].) In brief, the argument is that the
change in trend is a one time innovation with permanent effect and those who
ignore it confound it with the quarterly innovations, making the latter seem more
long lasting than they are in fact. The trend break hypothesis has a degree of a
priori appeal, since there are a number of "big events" of the post—war period that
could have sparked a trend change. Examples are the 1964 tax cut, the oil shock of
the early 1970s and financial deregulation in the 1980s.



                                          2
 the statistical evidence warrants abandoning the no trend break null hypothesis. I
 show that there is in fact little statistical evidence against the hypothesis that no
 break has occurred at any time in the post war period. Two difficulties make this
 argument less than straightforward. By elaborating on these difficulties, I hope that
 the results of this paper may be of use to those searching for breaks in other data
 series.

           The first difficulty is that the standard critical values for testing the presence
 of a break are severely biased in favor of rejecting the no break null hypothesis. I
 overcome this problem by obtaining the correct small sample critical values by
 bootstrap methods. For example, the paper considers the case where an F statistic
 is used to test for a break in the intercept and slope of a trend against the null
 hypothesis that log GNP has a linear representation with an unbroken linear trend
 and two lags of log GNP. The conventional methodology in this context is to
 compare the computed F statistic against the 5 percent critical value of the relevant
 F distribution. In the application of the paper, this critical value is 3.1. I show
that if the true data generating mechanism is the maximum likelihood trend
stationary model with (unbroken) trend fit to post war log GNP (the TS
representation), then 8.1 is in fact the 20 percent critical value if the break being
tested lies in the middle of the sample. The correct 5 percent critical value is 5.5.
           The critical value discussed in the previous paragraph assumes, as does the
standard one, that the break date is chosen independent of any prior information
about the data being tested. This brings us to the second problem that must be
confronted when searching for breaks. This arises because in practice one never
selects a date to test for a break without prior information about the data. This
second problem, adjusting critical values to reflect pretest examination of the data,
is harder to solve than the first. The difficulty is that in practice it is hard to



                                              3
translate the factors that go into selecting a particular break date into a specific
algorithm that could, for example, be programmed on a computer. The paper
describes several simple algorithms for selecting break dates and shows that the
impact on critical values can be quite substantial, but that the impact depends
sensitively on the particular break date selection algorithm used. Given the
difficulty in practice of articulating precisely one's break date selection method, this
sensitivity is unfortunate and complicates inference. The paper explores several

options.
       Perhaps the most straightforward option is to use a set of very conservative
critical values which maximize the impact of pre—test data examination.
Conducting inference with these critical values leaves one immune to excessive
rejection of the null hypothesis of no trend break due to pre—test data examination.
Unfortunately, a byproduct of its conservative nature is that the method probably
has poor power characteristics. A set of critical values which is conservative in the
above sense is studied in the paper. It assumes the break date was selected by
choosing that break date that produces the largest F statistic for a trend break.
Assuming the data are generated by the TS model, the 5 percent critical value in
this case is 10.2. This is dramatically higher than the 3.1 critical value implied by
the relevant F distribution. It also exceeds by far the largest F statistic in the post
war GNP data, which is 6.14. In fact, the significance level of 6.14 is a little over 40
percent, relative to the TS model null hypothesis.' Clearly, relative to this set of
critical values, there is no evidence of a trend break in the post war period.
However, this set of critical values may be too conservative, entailing an

'For a statistic whose expected value is positive, I define its significance level as the
probability, under the null hypothesis, of getting a value larger than the realized
value. For a statistic with a negative expected value, I define its significance leval
as the probability, under the null hypothesis, of getting a value smaller than the
realized value.


                                            4
unacceptable loss of power. As a result other, less conservative, critical values were
computed. These also deliver no evidence to warrant rejecting the no trend break
null hypothesis.
       Following is an outline of the paper. The next section describes the no trend
break null hypothesis of the paper. Reflecting the lack of consensus in the literature
on time series models of post—war GNP, the null hypothesis is captured by two
models. One represents log GNP as stationary about a trend (the TS model
mentioned above) and the other represents it as first order autoregressive in first
differences. These models and their fitted disturbances are used to generate the
artificial data that form the basis for statistical inference in subsequent sections.
Section III demonstrates the poor small sample performance of the usual F test for a
trend break and supplies small sample critical values which are correct under the
assumption that the choice of break date is independent of the data being studied.
Section IV shows how sensitive critical values are to pre—test examination of the
data. That section tabulates critical values under several alternative pre—test break
date selection schemes. It shows that once pre—test and small sample distributional
considerations are taken into account, the F test reveals no evidence against the null
hypothesis of no trend break in post—war U.S. data. Section V considers a test for
trend breaks recently introduced by Perron (1987). I show there that, although that
test does not share the F test's small sample distributional problem, it is still the
case that once pre—test considerations are taken into account, one cannot reject the
no trend break null hypothesis. Section VI concludes the paper.

II. The No Break Null Hypothesis.


          Throughout this paper the null hypothesis is that there has been no trend
break in GNP. The bootstrap methodology I use requires that this null hypothesis
be embedded in a completely specified time series model. Doing so is complicated
by the fact that there is no professional agreement on how to model log GNP,
whether as stationary about a trend (see, eg., Blanchard [1981]), or as a stationary
process in first differences with no deterministic trend (Campbell and Mankiw
[1988].) I avoid taking a stand on this issue by allowing for the possibility that
either is correct. Accordingly, my bootstrap experiments are based on two data
generating mechanisms. Each was estimated using data on log GNP covering the
period 1948.1 to 1987.4. In each case, the first two quarters' observations were used
up by initial conditions, leaving 158 observations for the regression. The first
regression model, called the TS model, is consistently estimated under the
assumption of covariance stationarity about a linear trend. Following are the
results         log GNPt):


                                          TS Model

(11.1)              =   .36 + .00037t + '34t 1— — 38t—2 +         t' °   = .010.
                        (.14) (.00015) (.07)     (.07)


Standard errors appear in parentheses. The Q statistic at lag 36 computed from the

fitted residuals,       is 23, indicating very little evidence against the null hypothesis
that there is no serial correlation in the disturbances. The 's are plotted in Figure
1, together with the plus and minus one standard deviation lines. The evidence in
the data plot arouses no suspicion that the regression is misspecified. For example,
there are no obvious outliers and the variance seems reasonably constant.

repeatedly simulating equation (1) using the actual y's for the first two quarters of
1948 as initial conditions, and obtained disturbances by randomly (with
replacement) drawing from {E1,...,e158}. By randomly drawing from the fitted
disturbances in this way, I implicitly impose conditional homoscedasticity on the
disturbances.2 These 1,000 data sets are the basis for analysis of the TS model in
subsequent sections.
         I also estimated the following AR(1) representation for


                                         DS Model

(11.2)               =   .0050   + ."        + ut,     = .010.
                         (.0010) (.07)

The Q statistic at lag 36 for this equation is 24, also indicating little evidence
against the null hypothesis of no serial correlation in the disturbances. Note that,
to two significant digits, the standard deviation of the Ut's are the same as that of
the        In addition, the plot of the ui's is virtually identical to that of the
and so is omitted.
         I generated 1,000 data sets of ye's, each of length 158 in the same way as was
done for the TS model. In particular, the initial conditions for each simulation are
the actual ye's for the first two quarters of 1948. In addition, disturbances were
obtained by randomly drawing, without replacement, from the set {u1,...,u158}.
These data sets are the basis for the analysis of the DS model that follows.3

2Results in Hamilton (1987) indicate there may be some room to doubt this
assumption. It would be of interest to repeat the experiments in the paper with a
data generating mechanism that allows for empirically plausible conditional
heteroscedasticity in the disturbances.
3The TS and DS models are in some respects quite similar. For example, the roots
of the characteristic equation of the TS model are .91 and .38, after rounding. On
the other hand, the characteristic roots of the level representation for yt implied by
the DS model are 1 and .37. Because of the similarity of these roots, the effect of an

III. Critical Values That Ignore Pre—test Examination of the Data.


          As a first step in looking for breaks, I estimated the following T—4

regressions:


(111.1)          t=+++                         + it—i +                +


where,


(111.2)          d = 0 t = 1,2,...,i—1
                   =   1   t = i,i+1,...,T,


for i = 3,...,T—2. The estimation period is t =      1,... ,T,   with t = 0, —1 reserved for
initial conditions, and T =      158.   The periods t =   1,   T correspond to 1948.3 and
1987.4, respectively. The jth regression allows the slope and intercept to change at
date i. As such, it can accommodate both a discontinuous jump in the trend line or
a continuous trend with a kink at date t = i. It can achieve the latter by setting 0
= 'y(l—i). Let F denote the F statistic for testing the null hypothesis 0 =          = 0, ie.,
that there is no time trend break, in period t = i. The equations in (1) where used
to compute F3,... ,FT_2, which are plotted in Figure 2. There I have highlighted


innovation on the short—term (two or three quarters) forecast horizon is very similar
between the two models; however, they differ greatly in terms of the effects on the
longer term forecast horizon. For example, according to the TS model a unit
innovation in Yt induces the following revisions to the outlook for Ys, S =
t+1,t+2,t+3,t+4: 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.3. Thereafter the effect slowly tapers off to zero.
According to the DS model, on the other hand, a unit innovation to yt induces the
following revisions to the outlook for ys, s = t+1,t+2,t+3,t+4: 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.6,
where it remains forever. The economic consequences of these differences at long
horizons can be great. For a discussion in the context of consumption theory, see
Deaton (1986) or Christiano (1987).


                                                8
 five locally maximal F statistics. They occur on the dates 1950.1, 1965.1, 1973.2,
 1980.2, and 1981.2. These F statistics are reported in Table 1, together with their
 significance levels, computed in a variety of ways. The significance level in the
 third column is based on the F distribution with 2
 numerator and 152 denominator degrees of freedom.4 Since the significance levels of
 the locally maximal F statistics are below 5 percent, the conventional test procedure
results in a finding of a statistically significant break at each of the five dates. This
can also be seen in Figure 2, where the 5 percent critical value, 3.1, of the F(2,152)
distribution is plotted.
          Bootstrap critical values for the F statistics where obtained by computing F
statistics for dates i = 3,...,156 (=T—2) on each of the 1,000 artificial data sets
generated by the TS and DS models. To discuss this further I need some notation.
Denote the F statistics obtained for the th date on the rth artificial data set by
      where i = 3,...,156 and r =    1,. ..,l000.      Then, let

                       F3,1 F3,2      •
                                                F3,1000
                       F4,1 F4,2          •   • F4,1000
(111.3)         F=
                       :                  .


                       F156,1   F156,2 •       F156,1000



The rth column of the 154x 1000 matrix F contains the 154 F statistics computed in
the rth simulation. These were computed in the same way as the 154 empirical F
statistics plotted in Figure 2. Two F matrices where computed, one based on the
1,000 artificial data sets generated by the DS model and one using the data


4The numerator degrees of freedom is the number of restrictions being tested.
These are two: 0 = = 0. The denominator degrees of freedom are the number of
observation in the regression minus the number of parameters in the unrestricted
regression, which is 6.


                                                   9
generated by the TS model. I avoid making this dependence explicit in order to
prevent the notation from becoming too cumbersome. The x% bootstrap critical
value for F is the entry in row i of F with the property that x% of the entries in
that row exceed it. Critical values corresponding to each of the TS and DS models
were computed for each of i = 3,... ,156, and some of these are reported in Table 2.
For comparison, the bottom row of that table contains the 1, 5, 10, and 20 percent
critical values of the F distribution with 2 numerator and 152 denominator degrees
of freedom. Comparing the critical values of the F distribution with the bootstrap
critical values shows that, with the exception of observations at the beginning and
end of the data set, the bootstrap distribution is shifted to the right relative to the
F distribution. Moreover, the bootstrap critical values associated with the DS
model are shifted to the right of those associated with the TS model. These shifts
are also evident in Figure 2, which plots the 5 percent critical values implied by the
TS and DS model. The fact that the bootstrap distribution is shifted to the right
relative to the F(2,152) distribution implies that using the F distribution will result
in too many rejections of the null hypothesis of no trend break.
       The simulated F statistics allow me to compute bootstrap significance levels
for the empirical F statistics reported in Table 1. The columns marked TS and DS
report the significance levels assuming the data are generated by the TS and DS
models, respectively. Note that the F statistics corresponding to all dates after
1965.1 fail to be significant even at the 10 percent level relative to the bootstrap F
distributions. The 1965.1 break is not significant at the 5 percent level under either
distribution, and it is not significant even at the 20 percent level assuming the data
are stationary about trend. There is more evidence of a break in 1950.1. According
to the distribution of the F statistic implied by the TS model, the break is
significant in 1950.1 at even the one percent level. It is somewhat less significant if



                                          10
one assumes the data have a unit root, though one would still reject the null
hypothesis of no trend break at the 5 percent level. These observations can also be
made by inspecting Figure 2. Figure 3 plots the log GNP data used in the study
and also a time trend with break in 195O.l.
        In sum, this section documented that the critical values from the F
distribution are far too small for testing for a break in U.S. GNP data, even if one
ignores the fact that break points being tested were determined by pretest
examination of the data. The point is dramatized in Figure 2. It shows that the 5
percent bootstrap critical values lie far above that implied by the relevant F
distribution. The shift is sufficiently large that many trend breaks that look
statistically significant relative to the F distribution are, in fact, not. The only
break points that still look as though they may be statistically significant are those
occurring in the early 1950s.




5The trend line in Figure 3 was based on estimating (111.1) by ordinary least squares
with    ==0       and i corresponding to 1950.1.


                                          11
IV. Taking Account of Pre—Test Examination of the Data.


       Let B denote the date on which a trend break occurs under the alternative
hypothesis of a test. The sampling results in the previous section assumed that B
was determined independent of the data being tested. This section shows that
plausible ways of endogenizing the choice of B result in higher critical values for the
F test for a trend break. In particular, what little evidence remained in the previous
section that there is a trend break in GNP disappears completely once endogeneity
of B is taken into account.
       The first subsection formally defines six ways of endogenizing B. The fact
that these models of B are explicit mathematical functions of the data reflects the
requirements of my analysis. It does not reflect a view that investigators necessarily
use mathematical formulas to determine B in practice. The hope is that the
mathematical algorithms studied approximate reasonably well the more informal
process of selecting B that investigators actually use. In many cases, they choose B
based on a visual examination of the data, or of some related series, or based on the
suggestion of others who have done so.
       After presenting the break date selection algorithms, I report the size of the
F test for a structural break when B is in fact endogenous, but the critical values
discussed in the previous section—which ignore the endogeneity of B—are used to
conduct inference. There I show that if one applies conventional testing practice,
one can find a trend break in almost all realizations from the TS and DS models. In
the third subsection I report pre—test adjusted critical values for the F statistic.
There I report maximal critical values which have the property that if they indicate



8The size of a test is the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis.



                                            12
rejecting the null hypothesis of no trend break, then one can do so without fear of
that the probability of a false rejection is unduly high.


IV.a Six Break Date Selection Methods Defined


       The first three of the six algorithms for choosing B selects the maximal F
statistic from a subset of dates in the sample. Each is a special case of what I call
the F Max method. The first of these, called the F Maxuntr method, selects the
maximal F statistics from the untruncated set {F3,...,F156}. As is clear from
Figure 2, the empirical break date chosen by F Maxuntr is 1950.1. Inspection of
Figure 3 suggests that it is not at all implausible that an investigator examining the
post war GNP data might conjecture that a large jump in the economy's trend
might have occurred around that date. However, this is not the only plausible
mechanism for endogenizing the selection of the break date, since others have
investigated the hypothesis that a break occurred at other dates, such as 1973.2.
Evidently, F           does not approximate well the method used by these
investigators. Following are two simple algorithms that can account for the choice
of 1973.2 as a date to test for a trend break. The first captures a suspicion felt by
many that a trend break occurred in the early 1970's as a consequence of the first oil
shock. That algorithm, called F Max011, identifies the break date with the date °n
which max {F99,...,F122} occurs. This corresponds to the interval of time 1973.1 to
1978.4, inclusive. Another break date selection method, F Max19708, selects the date
on which max {F87,... ,F126} occurs. The dates t = 87 to 126 correspond to the
interval 1970.1 to 1979.4. The rationale for F Max19708 is that it reflects the sense
that there has been a "productivity slowdown" in the 1970's, whose exact date is
unknown. Evidently, both F Max011 and F Max19io choose 1973.2 as the empirical



                                          13
break date. An advantage of studying F Maxuntr, F Max0i, and F Max19708 is that
it permits judging the sensitivity of critical values to the width of the interval over
which one looks for a maximal F statistic.
       The three other break date selection algorithms are motivated by the
observation, evident in Figure 2, that under the null hypothesis of no trend break, F
statistics for different B's are realizations from different distributions. In particular,
the distribution of F's corresponding to B's in the middle of the data set are shifted
to the right relative to F's at the beginning and end. This suggests that a more
plausible break date selection algorithm is not to choose the date of the maximal F
statistic, but instead the date on which the F statistic with smallest significance
level occurs. Thus, if an F statistic early in the data set is smaller than one
somewhere in the middle, it might make more sense to select the former as the most
likely break date if its significance level under the null hypothesis of no break is
smaller. For example, according to Table 1 the F statistic for B 1973.2 exceeds
that for B =   1979.4,   although the significance level of the latter is less than that of
the former.
        Three minimum significance level techniques for selecting B where chosen by
analogy with the three discussed in the previous paragraph. In particular, the Mm
Siguntr method selects the date from the period 1949.1 to 1987.2 with the F statistic
having the smallest significance level. Similarly, Mm Sig0i limits the break date to
occurring in the period 1973.1 — 1978.4 and Mm Sigi9io limits it to the period
 1970.1 — 1979.4. Since the significance level is a function of the model of the null

hypothesis, there is a set of Mm Sig methods corresponding to the TS model and
one corresponding to the DS model.
        When the untruncated sample is considered, both the DS and TS versions of

 chooses 1978.3 as the most likely date of the break, while the TS version selects
 1973.2. Finally, both the DS and TS versions of Mm Sigi97o select 1979.4 as the
 most likely date of the break. I do not make the notation for Mm Sig explicitly
reflect whether it is based on the DS or TS model in order to avoid proliferating
symbols.


IV.b Impact on Size of Endogenizing the Choice of Break Date.


        Table 3 reports the size of F tests for trend breaks which ignore pre—test data
examination when in fact one of the six break date selection methods introduced in
the last section are used. There are three panels in Table 3, each of which
corresponds to a different subset of dates from which break dates were picked.
There are seven columns. Columns 2 — 5 pertain to the F Max method, whereas

columns 6 and 7 pertain to the Mm Sig method. Numbers in italics are results
based on the TS model, and the numbers in columns 2, 4, and 6 are based on the DS
model. Each number in columns 2 and 3 is the fraction of times out of 1,000 that
the F Max F statistic exceeds the critical value of indicated size from the F(2,152)
distribution. Results in columns 4 and 5 are the fraction of times that the bootstrap
critical values discussed in section III are exceeded. Columns 6 and 7 report the
fraction of times that the minimum significance level is below the corresponding
significance level in column 1.

       The most dramatic results appear in the first column of Panel A in Table 3.
This shows that when the data are generated by the TS model, the break date is
selected by the F          method, and the conventional practice of using critical
values from the F distribution is followed, then a test with nominal 5 percent size in
fact has size 98 percent. When the data are generated by the DS model, then the



                                         15
size of this test is 100 percent, after rounding. Of course, this enormous frequency
of rejections reflects in part the fact—demonstrated in section Ill—that the critical
values of the F distribution are far too small, even when B is exogenous. Once this
is taken into account, then the size of the F test falls, as is indicated in columns 4
and 5. Nevertheless, the size continues to be extremely large. For example the size
of the F test based on a break date selected by the F Maxuntr method, which uses
the pre—test unadjusted bootstrap critical values with 5 percent nominal size, in fact
has size 65 percent. Looking at panels B and C, we see that as the interval of dates
from which the break date is selected shrinks, the size of the pre—test unadjusted
test falls. However, even when only the six year period 1973.1 — 1978.4 is
considered, the size of the nominal 5 percent test is still around 20 percent. Of
course, in the limit as the interval of dates shrinks to unity, the size of the tests
based on the bootstrap critical values converge by construction to the nominal size
of the test. The size of the pre—test unadjusted F test when the Mm Sig method of
selecting break dates is used is roughly the same as the size of the F Max method.
Where the two differ, it is always the size of Mm Sig that is the larger, by
construction.


IV.c Critical Values of Pre—Test Adjusted Tests for Trend Break


         Critical values of the F test for trend break which reflect the several ways of
endogenizing B discussed in subsection IV.a are reported in Table 4. Not
surprisingly, it takes a much larger F statistic to reject the null hypothesis 0 =       =

0   when the break date has been selected as a function of the data than when it has
not. For example, when the break date is selected by the F Maxuntr method and
the null hypothesis is the TS model, then it takes an F statistic of 9.0 to reject the



                                            16
null hypothesis at the 10 percent level. This is to be compared with the 4.3 critical
value that applies if the break date is selected exogenously to be in the middle of the
sample. Alternatively, if the break date is selected by Mm Siguntr then the F
statistic has to have an unadjusted significance level of .2 percent to be significant
at the 10 percent level. The critical values in the Table can be used to assess the
significance of the empirical F statistics reported in Table 1.
          Consider first the possibility of a break in 1950.1. This date was chosen as
the most likely break date by both F Maxuntr and Mm Siguntr. Relative to the DS
model, a maximal F statistic of 6.14 is actually quite small, having a significance
level around 70 percent (see panel A, Table 4.) This contrasts sharply with the 1.1
percent significance level implied by the pre—test unadjusted bootstrap critical value
and the .3 percent significance level implied by the F distribution (see Table 1.)
Similarly a maximal F statistic of 6.14 has a significance level in excess of 40
percent relative to the TS distribution. Thus, in fact there is no basis for rejecting
the null hypothesis of a trend break in 1950.1. This stands in striking contrast with
the implications of the conventional testing methodology, which would result in a
finding that the evidence of a trend break is considerable. This result is dramatized
in Figure 2, which shows how much the pre—test adjusted 5 percent critical values
exceed all the empirical F statistics.
          There is also no basis for rejecting the null hypothesis of a break at any of
the other dates listed in Table 1 at the conventional 5 percent level. This is true
even before taking pre—test data examination into account. When this is done, the
significance levels of the test statistic rise, making it only harder to reject the null
hypothesis. It is, nevertheless, instructive to investigate the case for a break in
1973.2.

          The evidence pertaining to the possibility of a trend break having occurred in



                                             17
1973.2 is collected in Table 5. That table illustrates the central points of this paper.
The first three columns are taken from Table 1 for ease of comparison. As noted
previously, they illustrate how much the F distribution understates the significance
level of a trend break. The right four columns show how failure to take pre—test
examination of the data into account also results in understating the significance
levels. If the 1973.2 break date had been selected from the oil shock period, then
the significance level is between 40 and 60 percent, depending on whether one
interprets the F statistic relative to the TS or the DS model. If instead the 1973.2
break date was selected after inspecting all dates in the 1970s, then the significance
level jumps even further, to the 60 to 75 percent range. Besides showing that there
is absolutely no statistical evidence against the null hypothesis 0 = = 0 in 1973.2,
the results illustrate the difficulty of assigning a precise pre—test adjusted
significance to an F statistic. A researcher may report that he/she selected the
1973.2 date by examining a very limited set of dates only, however there might still
be room to wonder whether the researcher's choice was influenced by the advice of
someone else who suggested looking for a break in 1973 based on examining all the
data in the 1970s, or even more data. As Table 5 shows, whether or not the latter is
true has a quantitatively large impact on the significance level of the F statistic.
Although in the present case this impact does not affect the outcome—that there is
no evidence of a break—one can imagine other cases where it does. This problem is
avoided if the investigator were required to present a break date selection algorithm
which selects his/her break date as a function of all the observations (eg., F
Maxuntr), and perhaps observations on some other data series as well. In the
present case, those who argue for a single trend break in 1973.2 would have to argue
why that is the most likely date for a break and not, for example, 1950.1 or 1965.1.
The researcher's break date selection algorithm could then be used to compute the



                                           18
significance level of the test statistic for a break.

V. Perron's Modified Dickey—Fuller Test For a Trend Break.


        Perron (1987) and Rappoport and Reichlin (1987) argue that the failure of
the Dickey—Fuller test to reject the unit root hypothesis reflects not the presence of
the unit root, but instead that the data are trend stationary about a broken trend.
Perron (1987) proposes a modification to the Dickey—Fuller test which permits,
under the alternative to the unit root null hypothesis, that the data are stationary
about a broken trend. He tabulates a set of critical values for his test statistic
which assume that the break date is picked exogenously. When these critical values
are used to interpret his test statistic computed using post war U.S. GNP data, the
unit root hypothesis is rejected against the broken trend alternative at the 10
percent level. This section shows that when the critical values are pre—test
adjusted, then the unit root hypothesis can be rejected at only the 15 to 30 percent
level, depending on the exact break date selection algorithm used. Thus, like the F
test of the previous sections, the Perron statistic offers no evidence of a trend break
in post war GNP.
        In the context of postwar, quarterly U.S. GNP, Perron proposes estimating
the following augmented Dickey—Fuller regression:


(V.1)              = + Od + /3t + 7dxt +              + c1y_1 + c2y_2,

where d is defined in (II.2).8 Under the null hypothesis of Perron's modified


7Perron applies his test to many other data series, and reports evidence of trend
breaks. It may well be that those results are robust to date break selection
considerations. It would be of interest to investigate this.
81n some contexts, Perron advises imposing the restriction 0 = y(1—i). In this case,
the alternative hypothesis is a model with continuous trend, but a possible change
in slope at date i.


                                          20
Dickey—Fuller test, 9 =    = a = fi = 0. In this case, (1) is a difference stationary
model which, when c2 = 0, reduces to the DS model of this paper. Perron
recommends comparing the t statistic on a, ta with the critical values tabulated in
his paper. In the light of the analysis of the F test in section II, it is not surprising
that those critical values depend on the date, B, on which the trend break is
permitted to occur under the alternative hypothesis. Asymptotic critical values for
ta relevant when the break date is exogenously set at 1973.2 are reported in the first
row of Table 6. These are taken from Perron. The second row of Table 6 reports
bootstrap critical values for ta computed using the 1,000 data sets generated by the
DS model described in section II. Note the similarity of these two sets of critical
values. Thus, unlike the F statistic, the Perron statistic has roughly the same
sampling distribution in a sample the length of post war quarterly data as it does
asymptotically. Subsequent rows in Table 6 provide pre—test adjusted critical
values for a variety of break date selection algorithms. The first three are the three
F Max algorithms discussed in the previous section. Results for the Mm Sig
algorithm are not reported since they are roughly the same as those for the F Max
method. The last three rows in Table 6 report results based on the Mm ta break
date selection method. It selects break dates to minimize ta over the indicated set
of dates.
       Table 6 indicates that the effect of selecting the break date as a function of
the data being tested is to increase the likelihood that Perron's version of the
Dickey—Fuller regression will spuriously reject the unit root specification in favor of
the broken trend alternative. This is because the pre—test adjusted critical values
exceed the unadjusted critical values.9 Note that the critical values implied by the

9The pre—test unadjusted critical values in Table 6 assume a break date near the
middle of the sample. These critical values are larger than those closer to the
beginning or the end of the sample (see Table 5B in Perron). Consequently, the


                                            21
Mm t break date selection procedure are roughly the same as those implied by F
Max. Where there is a difference, the Mm t critical values are larger, by
construction.
         The column marked ta Table 7 reports empirical values of t and associated
significance levels, under alternative break date selection mechanisms. The numbers
in braces in that column report the expected value of t. Expected values and
significance levels were computed using the 1,000 data sets generated by the DS
model. The break date preferred by Perron is 1973.2. The first row of Table 7
reports that t for that date is —3.94, and that the probability is only 8 percent of
getting a value of t smaller than —3.94 in the 100th date (1973.2) of a sample
generated by the DS model. The expected value of ta is —2.81, and this evidently is
quite far from the empirical value of —3.94. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected at
the 9 percent significance level, assuming 1973.2 is picked exogenously.
         Subsequent rows in Table 7 report pre—test adjusted results. Consider first
the results corresponding to F Max197o and F Max01. As noted before, these two
break date selection procedures rationalize picking 1973.2 as a break date. However
they assign very difference significance levels to the empirical estimate of t =
—3.94.   For example, F Ma.x19io assigns it a significance level of 23 percent. If we
evaluate t = —3.94 relative to this break date selection procedure, then the null
hypothesis cannot be rejected at even the 20 percent significance level. Not
surprisingly, the significance level drops if ta = —3.94 is evaluated relative to F
Max01. In that case one can reject the null hypothesis at the 20 percent level,
although not at the 15 percent level. The two untruncated break date selection
algorithms pick different dates. According to Mm tufltr the most likely break date


pre—test adjusted critical values in Table 6 exceed these other unadjusted critical
values by even more.


                                           22
is 1965.1, whereas F Maxuntr identifies 1950.1 as the most like break date. The
associated significance levels are 18 and 34 percent. Here too, there is no evidence
of a statistically significant break.
       The last column in Table 7 reports the results of a chi—square test of the null
hypothesis 9 =     = = a = 0.      The chi square statistic is 16.99 when B is set to
1973.2. The first row reports that the significance level of 16.99 is 11 percent when
the break date is treated as though it had been selected exogenously. When instead
it is interpreted relative to the F Max selection procedure, 16.99 has a significance
level of 27 or 39 percent. In fact, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at even the
20 percent level relative to any of the break date procedures. Evidently, this test
also delivers no evidence of a trend break in post war U.S. GNP.

 VI. Conclusion


        This paper has tested the null hypothesis that the parameters of the time
series model for GNP have been stable during the post war period against the
alternative that there has been a one time break in trend. A variety of test
statistics were presented and none can reject the null hypothesis at even the 15
percent level. In reaching this conclusion a pitfall that confronts tests for structura
break was identified, and a bootstrap simulation methodology for overcoming it
applied. The problem arises because the standard sampling theory used to interpre
tests for structural break assumes, implausibly, that the date of the break is chosen
independent of prior information about the data, or some related series. In practic€
researchers use a combination of visual examination of data plots, consultation witl
colleagues, and formal techniques to select a break date which is then tested for
statistical significance. I showed that whether or not the computed statistical
significance level takes into account pre—test examination of the data can make a
drastic difference. For example, the F statistic of the null hypothesis that a trend
break occurred in 1950.1 is 6.14. This statistic has significance level .5 percent
under the null hypothesis that post—war log GNP data are stationary about an
unbroken linear trend and assuming that the date 1950.1 was chosen exogenously.
With such a low significance level one would ordinarily reject the no break null
hypothesis easily. However, a critical assumption underlying such an inference fails
The date 1950.1 was not picked at random. Instead it was chosen because it is the
date in the sample which produces the largest F statistic testing for a break. When
this is properly taken into account, the significance level of the 6.14 F statistic
jumps from .5 percent to over 40 percent.

2Size of critical value used to assess the presence of a break. This size ignores that
the break date itself was chosen as a function of the data prior to executing the

3Presence of a break is tested by comparing F Max with the critical values of the
F(2,152) distribution, which are reported in the bottom row of Table 1.
4 Max is compared with the bootstrap critical values for the F statistic discussed
in section III, and reported for selected dates in Table 1.

Ix is a y% critical value if the probability (here defined as frequency, out of 1000
trials) of exceeding x is y%, under the null hypothesis. In panel A the null
hypothesis is the DS model, and in panel B it is the TS model.
2The critical values for F Max were obtained as follows. First in each of the DS and
TS cases, the 1000 simulated F Max statistics were ranked, with the smallest one
ranked 1 and the largest ranked 1000. The F Max statistic with rank 990 is the 1%
critical value, the one with rank 950 is the 5% critical value, and so on.
3The critical values for Mm Sig were obtained in the same way as for the F Max
critical values. That is, in each of the DS and TS cases the 1000 simulated Mm Sig
statistics were ranked, with the smallest one ranked 1 and the largest ranked 1000.
The Mm Sig statistic with rank 990 is the 1% critical value.

IWith the exception of the results in the first row, the data generating mechanism
underlying the results in this table is the DS model. Critical values are for the t
statistic on a in (V.1) with k = 2.
2Computed by interpolating the relevant entries in the A = 0.6 and A = 0.7 columns
in Perron (1987,Table 5B). Weights of .7 and .3 were assigned to the A = 0.6 and A
= 0.7 columns, reflecting that 1973.2 roughly corresponds to a value of A = 0.63.
Here, A is the ratio of the break date to the number of observations in the sample.
