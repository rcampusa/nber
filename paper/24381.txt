                                        ABSTRACT

Ban-the-box (BTB) laws, which prevent employers from asking prospective employees about
their criminal histories at initial job screenings, are intended to increase employment
opportunities and reduce economic incentives for crime. This study is the first to explore the
relationship between BTB laws and crime. Using agency-by-month data from the National
Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), we find that BTB laws are associated with a 10
percent increase in criminal incidents involving Hispanic male arrestees. This finding is
supported by parallel analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997
(NLSY97) and is consistent with BTB law-induced job loss due to employer-based statistical
discrimination. We find no evidence that BTB laws increase property crime among African
American men despite their also facing statistical discrimination. Supplemental analyses from
the American Community Survey (ACS) suggest that barriers to welfare participation among
Hispanic men may explain this result. Our estimates suggest that BTB laws generate $401
million in annual crime costs.

                                                 1. Introduction

        More than 2.2 million Americans are incarcerated (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2016),

representing 24 percent of the world’s prison population (World Prison Brief 2017). Between

2000 and 2015, the male incarceration rate rose from 904 to 1,600 inmates per 100,000

population, with African Americans and Hispanics consistently representing a disproportionate

share of inmates (Bureau of Justice Statistics 2016, 2001). 1 Real public spending on

incarceration reached over $80 billion in 2013, with the total costs of the criminal justice system

reaching over $250 billion (Executive Office of President of the United States 2016).

        The recidivism rate among ex-offenders is quite high. Over three-quarters (77 percent) of

released prisoners are rearrested within five years (National Institute of Justice 2014). The lack

of labor market opportunities for those with criminal records has been posited as one rationale

for high recidivism rates (Executive Office of President of the United States 2016).

Observational studies show that those with criminal records are less likely to be employed

(Grogger 1995; Pager 2003; Pager et al. 2009) and earn less (Nagin and Waldfogel 1998; Geller

et al. 2006) than their non-incarcerated counterparts. While this relationship can be explained, at

least in part, by difficult-to-measure personal characteristics (Grogger 1995), recent audit

experiments suggest a causal link (Pager et al. 2009).

        With the goal of improving labor market opportunities of ex-offenders, 33 states and the

District of Columbia — along with over 150 cities and counties — have implemented “ban-the-

box” (BTB) laws, which require employers to remove questions regarding the prospective

employee’s criminal history from job applications (National Employment Law Project 2017).

Proponents argue that by withholding information about criminal histories from initial job


1
 African Americans and Hispanics represent over 50 percent of the U.S. prison population despite representing just
12 percent and approximately 20 percent, respectively, of the U.S. population (Raphael and Stoll 2013).

                                                        1
application screenings, employers may be more willing to hire those with criminal records

because their perceptions of a criminal record may be changed by social engagement with the

applicant (Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming; National Employment Law Project 2017). On the

other hand, employers may react to less information on an applicant’s criminal history by

engaging in statistical discrimination against demographic groups with (perceived) higher rates

of criminal arrests. 2

         There are a number of channels through which BTB laws may affect crime. If BTB laws

are effective in increasing employment among those with criminal records, this could reduce the

gains to criminal activity, resulting in less crime, particularly for economically motivated crimes.

On the other hand, if BTB laws induce statistical discrimination against racial or ethnic

minorities with higher perceived risks of criminal activity, BTB laws could have the unintended

consequence of increasing crime rates among low-skilled minorities who have fewer job options.

BTB laws may also affect criminal behavior of those who are less likely to have criminal records

(e.g. older or more highly educated individuals) if firms engage in labor-labor substitution

toward such individuals. Finally, BTB laws could also generate moral hazard if such laws lower

the future cost of crime commission by reducing the likelihood that criminal histories will

become known to prospective employers. 3

         Despite policymakers’ hope that BTB laws would reduce economic incentives for crime,

next to nothing is known about the impact of BTB laws on criminal activity. To our knowledge,

this study is the first to explore this question. Using data from the National Incident Based



2
  In addition, the higher administrative costs imposed on firms could result in firms choosing to hire fewer
employees of all race/ethnicities or differentially fewer racial minorities, to whom it might devote disproportionately
larger shares of resources for additional background checks.
3
 However, if individuals are forward looking and anticipate statistical discrimination as a response to BTB laws,
then this belief may induce more current crime commission.

                                                          2
Reporting System (NIBRS) from 2004 to 2014, we find that BTB laws are associated with a 10

percent increase in property crime offenses committed by working age Hispanic men. This

result is also observed in parallel analysis using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth (1997). This finding is consistent with BTB law-induced statistical discrimination

reducing employment for low-skilled Hispanic men. However, we find no evidence that BTB

laws increased property crime among working age African American men, a population that also

faces job loss due to statistical discrimination. Supplemental analysis using the American

Community Survey (ACS) suggests two possible explanations for this race/ethnicity-specific

difference in crime response. First, we observe differential take-up of means-tested public

assistance programs in response to BTB-induced employment reductions. While low-skilled

African American men are more likely to participate in welfare programs, principally the

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), following BTB enactment, low-skilled

Hispanic men are not. This may be due to differential barriers to participation such as language

difficulties, immigration status fears, or cultural/family factors. Second, we uncover some

suggestive evidence that BTB law-induced statistical discrimination may induce outmigration of

likely undocumented immigrants, who may be less prone to criminal activity than their native

counterparts. Together, the findings from this study add to growing evidence on the unintended

consequences of BTB laws. Our estimates suggest that BTB laws induce approximately 70,000

additional property crimes, generating $401 million (in 2018 dollars) in social costs (McCollister

et al. 2010).



                                  2. Background and Literature

2.1 Background



                                                3
        Approximately one-third of all U.S. adults have some type of criminal record (Bureau of

Justice Statistics 2014). A 2012 survey by the Society of Human Resources Management found

that 69 percent of employers used criminal background checks for some or all of their hiring

decisions, representing a large increase over the last two decades (Holzer, Raphael and Stoll,

2006; Society for Human Resources Management 2012).

        Following release, ex-offenders may face difficulties finding employment for a variety of

reasons (Holzer, Raphael and Stoll 2003). Time spent incarcerated prevents individuals from

gaining work experience, may depreciate previously accumulated labor market skills, and may

interrupt schooling investments (Western, Kling and Weiman 2001). In addition, imprisonment

may also lead to an erosion of social capital, reducing the likelihood of finding future

employment (Sampson and Laub 1993). Moreover, employers may use a prospective worker’s

prior criminal conviction as an observable indicator of lower average productivity or higher

expected liability costs from reoffending (Raphael 2011a; Freeman 2008; Blumstein and

Nakamura 2009). 4,5 A widely cited 2003 survey of California employers found that 71 percent

of respondents said that they would “probably not” or “definitely not” hire an applicant with a

criminal background (Raphael 2011b).

        While some of the adverse labor market effects of incarceration may be partly offset by

in-prison schooling and job training programs (Kling 2006; Landersø 2015), ex-offenders still

have worse labor market outcomes than their non-incarcerated counterparts (Grogger 1995;

Pager 2003; Pager et al. 2009; Geller et al. 2006). An audit study by Pager et al. (2009) finds




4
 Several studies show that employers may overestimate the magnitudes of these associations (Roberts et al. 2007;
Blumstein and Nakamura 2009).
5
 Insuring against employee misconduct and malfeasance through “fidelity bonds” is often not possible if the
employee has a criminal record (Stafford 2006).

                                                        4
that randomly assigning a criminal record to otherwise identical job applications is associated

with a 50 percent lower likelihood of an interview request or job offer. Observational studies

estimate earnings differentials between those with and without incarceration records to be 10 to

40 percent (Geller et al. 2006; The Pew Charitable Trusts 2010). These differentials appear

largest for those over age 30 and grow over time (Nagin and Waldfogel 1998). Among

offenders, longer prison sentences are negatively related to labor market outcomes. Mueller-

Smith (2014) exploits randomized judge assignments in Harris County, Texas and finds that

longer sentences are associated with reductions in both employment and earnings.

       Criminal behavior may also respond to economic conditions (Becker 1968). Local labor

market opportunities, including employment (Bushway, Cook, and Phillips 2010; Levitt 2004;

Lin 2008; Machin and Meghir 2004; Öster and Agell 2007; Raphael and Winter-Ebmer 2001;

Schnepel 2018) and wages (Agan and Makowsky 2018; Fone, Sabia and Cesur 2019; Gould et

al. 2002; Yang 2017) have been found to be negatively related to crime to crime.

       Studies specifically examining the effect of labor market opportunities on recidivism

have reached a similar conclusion. Using data on 1.7 million offenders released from California

prisons from 1993 to 2008, Schnepel (2018) finds that construction and manufacturing job

availability is negatively related to recidivism rates. Similarly, Yang (2017) utilizes

administrative data on more than 4 million ex-offenders in 43 states between 2000 and 2013 and

finds that offenders released to counties with higher low-skilled wages are less likely to

recidivate. Finally, Wang et al. (2010) pool data on more than 40,000 male offenders released

from Florida prisons from 2000 to 2001 and find that African American ex-offenders are more

likely to engage in subsequent violent crime in response to higher African American

unemployment rates, while white ex-offenders are more likely to reoffend in property crime in



                                                  5
response to rising unemployment. The authors interpret this finding as evidence that African

American ex-offenders may face elevated prejudice-driven frustration that manifests itself in

“expressive criminal behavior” such as violent crime.



2.2 Prior Literature on BTB Laws

        In response to difficulties ex-offenders face in securing gainful employment and the

increase in recidivism that could result, 33 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have adopted

“ban the box” laws, which seek to strategically withhold information on job applicants’ criminal

histories from prospective employers at first interview. 6 The first BTB law, adopted by Hawaii

in 1998, applied to both public and private firms hiring new employees. Under the Hawaii

statute, employers are not permitted to inquire into any job applicant’s criminal history until a

“conditional offer of employment” was made (National Employment Law Project 2017).

Moreover, if a criminal conviction occurred within the previous decade (or if incarceration

occurred at any point), the conditional employment offer can only be rescinded if it can be

shown that the conviction bears a “rational relationship” to the duties and responsibilities of the

position.

        Following the adoption of the Hawaii statute, 32 additional states and the District of

Columbia — along with over 150 cities and counties — adopted a BTB law. Estimates suggest

that approximately 211 million Americans, roughly two-third the U.S. population, live in a

jurisdiction covered by a BTB law (National Employment Law Project 2017). 7


6
 Other initiatives include reducing the breadth of crimes for which incarceration is a prescribed punishment,
increasing human capital acquisition among those who are incarcerated (see, for example, Hall et al. 2016),
improving employer contacts with inmates (Center for the Study of Social Policy 2012), reducing the number of
jobs for which licensure is required (Hall et al. 2016), and juvenile justice reform.
7
 Eleven states, the District of Columbia, and 17 localities have adopted BTB laws that apply to both private and
public employers. Twenty-two (22) states have adopted BTB laws that apply only to public employers or to private

                                                        6
           Several studies in the economics literature have examined the labor market effects of ban

the box laws. 8 There is both experimental and quasi-experimental evidence that BTB laws

reduce employment among male racial/ethnic minorities, a consequence of statistical

discrimination by employers. Agan and Starr (2018) carry out a large-scale experiment in which

they randomly assign a criminal record to otherwise identical fictitious online job applications

and send them to two sets of employers — those who previously included a box on their

applications for criminal histories and those who did not — before and after BTB laws were

enacted. Prior to the implementation of BTB laws, the authors find that whites who applied to

affected employers in New York City and New Jersey were 7 percent more likely to receive

callbacks for employment than African Americans. After the passage of BTB laws, the African

American-white callback gap increased over six fold to 43 percent. This suggests that BTB laws

induce employers without information on applicants’ criminal histories to statistically

discriminate against demographic groups with a higher perceived probabilities of having

criminal records. 9 Not

           Doleac and Hansen (forthcoming) reach a similar conclusion using quasi-experimental

methods. Drawing CPS data from 2004 to 2014 and exploiting temporal variation in BTB

enactment across jurisdictions, the authors find that BTB laws decrease the employment of less-




employers with government contracts. However, as discussed below, public BTB laws may have important effects
in the private sector (see footnote 19). Still other BTB laws include broader “fair-chance” employment provisions
(including Hawaii) that require employers to consider the job-relatedness of a conviction, mitigating circumstances,
and evidence of rehabilitation (National Employment Law Project 2017).
8
    See also Mungan (2017) for a theoretical discussion.
9
  This finding is also consistent with prior work that found that increased availability of criminal records information
is positively related to employment opportunities for low-skilled African American males (Holzer et al. 2006;
Finlay, 2009; Stoll, 2009)

                                                           7
educated (no college degree) Hispanic men ages 25-to-64 by approximately 3 to 4 percent and

African American men ages 15-to-34 by 5 percent.

        On the other hand, using data from the 2007 to 2014 American Community Survey

(ACS) and Origin-Destination Employment Statistics from the Longitudinal Employer-

Household Dynamics series, Shoag and Vueger (2017) find that BTB laws are associated with a

4 percent increase in employment among African American men living in census tracts with high

crime rates. They interpret this finding as evidence that BTB laws are effective in increasing

employment opportunities for vulnerable individuals. Shoag and Vueger (2017) also find

evidence of upskilling by African American men, as well as negative employment spillovers to

African American women, who are much less likely to have criminal records than men.

        Finally, three studies explore the effect of BTB laws on employment of those with

criminal records. Craigie (2017) uses individual-level self-reported data from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to estimate the relationship between public sector BTB laws

and public sector employment among those with criminal convictions. Craigie (2017) finds that

public BTB laws are associated with an increase in public sector employment among convicts.

However, pre-treatment employment trends do not appear to be parallel between BTB and non-

BTB jurisdictions (see Figures 2 and 3, pp. 28-29); thus it is not clear whether the estimated

policy impact should be causally interpreted. 10

        Two other studies use administrative data to overcome concerns with measurement error

in self-reported crime data. Rose (2018) examines a Seattle BTB law and, using other cities in

Washington as a counterfactual, finds that employment among those with criminal records did

not change after the policy was enacted. Jackson and Zhao (2017) study a BTB reform in


10
  In addition, public sector BTB laws may affect private sector employment (see Doleac and Hansen, Forthcoming
and footnote 19), as well as criminal behavior.

                                                       8
Massachusetts, and find that BTB reduced employment for those who were ex-offenders prior to

the reform relative to those who offended later.

       Only one study of which we are aware has specifically examined the impact of BTB laws

on crime. D’Alessio et al. (2015) study the 1998 Hawaii BTB legislation and find that following

the passage of the law, the percent of all prosecuted defendants in Hawaii who were repeat

offenders fell by 57 percent. However, because this study relies on a before-after estimator, it is

unclear whether this estimate may be contaminated by time-varying factors.



                                               3. Data

       Our analyses use both administrative and survey data from two main sources — the

National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth 1997 (NLSY97) — to estimate the relationship between BTB laws and crime. Each of

these datasets, which we briefly discuss below, offers distinct advantages designed to

complement the others, and we draw conclusions from the weight of the evidence across the

separate analyses.

       Our primary data source is the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). We

draw agency-by-month data from the NIBRS between 2004 and 2014. Local, state, and federal

agencies generate and report information for the NIBRS to the FBI, based on administrative

records of criminal incidents reported to these agencies. To ensure data quality, our main

analysis sample consists of a balanced panel of agencies and months, though broader definitions

of sample selection (such as agencies that reported in at least half the years covering sample

period or agencies serving counties of at least 20,000 population) produced a similar pattern of




                                                   9
results. We generate counts of criminal incidents committed by male arrestees by age and

race/ethnicity. 11

         An important advantage of the NIBRS data is that we are able to measure crimes

committed by demographic subgroups disaggregated by age, including working-age African

American and Hispanic men. The most notable drawback of the NIBRS is its limited coverage

across the United States. As of 2014, 37 states and the District of Columbia participated in the

NIBRS, representing a coverage of roughly 93 million U.S. residents (FBI National Press Office

2015). However, by 2012, just 15 states report all of their crime data through the NIBRS (FBI

2012). Additionally, while the NIBRS data do include detailed information on criminal incidents

(including characteristics of both the victim and arrestee), there are no data on education levels,

which prevents an examination of racial minorities of lower skill levels. Moreover, there are no

data on prior arrests, which do not allow us to disaggregate the impacts of BTB laws on

recidivism versus first-time crime commission. However, examining the effect of BTB laws on

net crime seems a more relevant policy parameter given that crime committed by first-time

offenders may be affected via statistical discrimination-induced employment reductions.

        Table 1A shows means of agency-by-month criminal incidents involving male arrestees,

by age and race/ethnicity. While average incident counts are higher for non-Hispanic white

males relative to African American and Hispanic males, when these counts are adjusted for the

respective sizes of age- and race/ethnicity-specific subpopulations, crime rates are 1.3 to 3.4




11
  We also experiment with collecting information on offenders involved in incidents for which they are not arrested.
The results are qualitatively similar.

                                                        10
times higher for Hispanic and African Americans relative to non-Hispanic whites. 12 Across

race/ethnicity crime rates are also higher for younger as compared to older individuals.

        We supplement our administrative crime data with self-reported individual-level

longitudinal data drawn from the NLSY97. The NLSY97, sponsored by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS), consists of a national sample of youths who were 12-to-16 years of age as of

December 31, 1996. We focus on young working-age adults over the period between 2004 and

2014, drawn from Rounds 7-16 of the NLSY97.

        These data offer a number of distinct advantages. First, the data are nationally

representative and allow us to measure not only criminal arrests, but also self-reported criminal

behavior undetected by law enforcement. Second, the use of longitudinal data permits us to

control for individual-level heterogeneity via estimation of individual fixed effects models.

Third, the data contain information on the respondent’s educational attainment, which allows us

to assess whether any potential effects are concentrated among the least educated minorities,

whose employment prospects may be most adversely impacted through statistical discrimination.

        The NLSY97 also has some important disadvantages, including a limited sample of about

9,000 youth. Hence, there are relatively few Hispanic and African American men by county and

survey wave, which is likely to lead to less precise estimates of policy impacts and also reduces

statistical power among finer cuts of the sample. Furthermore, while survey data may pick up

criminal behaviors not captured administratively, measurement error from self-reported criminal

histories (i) may contribute to imprecision in estimates, and (ii) capture changes social stigma for

criminal behavior, which could be affected by BTB laws (Doleac 2017). In addition, there is


12
  Given that NIBRS estimates are not representative of the US population (or any specific state), we present
unweighted estimates. Weighting the regressions by county-specific population or agency-specific population
served produces a similar pattern of results.


                                                       11
evidence that measurement error in crime in the NLSY is related to race/ethnicity (Kirk and

Wakefield 2018).

        Additionally, owing to the longitudinal cohort design, the age range in the NLSY97 does

not perfectly coincide with the NIBRS analyses. During the analysis period from 2004 to 2014,

NLSY respondents are between the ages of 19 and 34. Nevertheless, this age range is salient for

analyzing the effects of BTB laws given that criminal activity typically peaks during the late

teens to early 20s (Loeber and Farrington 2014) and young adults are also forming or have

formed strong labor force attachment. One limitation of this cohort design is that restricting the

age range by definition also restricts the analysis period; hence, differential effects across the age

distribution may also reflect heterogeneity over time and/or differences due to the identifying

policy variation.

        Each of our NLSY-based crime outcomes is dichotomous in nature: (i) Arrest, set equal

to 1 if the respondent reported being arrested since their prior interview, and set equal to 0

otherwise 13, (ii) Minor Theft, set equal to 1 if the respondent stole something worth less than $50

and 0 otherwise, (iii) Major Theft, set equal to 1 if the respondent stole something worth $50 or

more and 0 otherwise, (iv) Other Property Crime, set equal to 1 if the respondent had fenced,

possessed, received or sold stolen property, and 0 otherwise, (v) Destroy Property, set equal to 1

if the respondent “purposely damaged or destroyed property not belonging to [him/her]” and 0

otherwise, and (vi) Assault, set equal to 1 if the respondent had attacked or assaulted someone.




13
  Respondents also provide data on the year and month of the arrest, though these are not always available for all
respondents. The BLS makes available event history files for each respondent containing information on the
number of arrests by year/month. Following Round 7, arrest dates are imputed based on the midpoint of the
reference period since the date of the last interview (see www.nlsinfo.org). In alternate analyses, we utilized data
from the arrest event history files to match the BTB policy data based on month/year of arrest. Our estimates remain
robust. Since the remainder of the criminal activity measures are available only based on date of last interview, we
present analyses for arrests using the same reference period for consistency and ease of comparison across models.

                                                        12
We also construct a composite measure of Any Property Crime, capturing criminal activities (ii)

through (iv). 14

           In Table 1B, we present weighted means for the variables from the NLSY97 for our

analysis sample. Consistent with the patterns found in the NIBRS, we find that arrest rates are

consistently highest among African American males, followed by Hispanic males and then non-

Hispanic white males. Furthermore, crime declines with age, with both arrests and participation

in various criminal activities significantly higher among adults ages 19-to-26 compared with

older adults ages 27-to-34. This is consistent with the age distribution of crime, such that

criminal activity typically peaks between late adolescence into early adulthood and then declines

(Loeber and Farrington 2014; Farrington 1986). Arrests and criminal engagement are also

substantially lower for females. 15,16

           Finally, to explore mechanisms through which BTB laws may affect crime, we draw data

on less-skilled working age males with a high school diploma or less using repeated cross-

sections of the American Community Survey (ACS) between 2005 and 2015 (corresponding to

calendar years 2004 to 2014). 17 The ACS data, administered by the U.S. Census Bureau, are

designed to provide estimates for smaller geographic units than states, including counties and


14
  Beginning in Round 8, questions regarding criminal behaviors (property crime, assault, etc.) were no longer asked
of all respondents, but rather only those who had ever reported being arrested and a control group of approximately
10% of respondents (see: www.nlsyinfo.org). Wave fixed effects, included in all models, capture this change in the
sampling frame, though our estimates remain robust to restricting the analyses to Round 8 onwards.
15
  The mean prevalence of being arrested among females in the NLSY97 ranged from 1.9 percent (Hispanics ages
19-34) to 2.1 percent (both non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans). In comparison (see Table 1B), arrest
rates among males ages 19-34 were three to five times higher, ranging from 6.1 percent (non-Hispanic Whites) to
6.4 percent (Hispanics) to 10.1 percent (non-Hispanic African Americans).
16
  Note that arrest rates derived from the NLSY97 are an order of magnitude lower than those derived from the
FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports. This may reflect underreporting and measurement error as well as the NLSY sample
being representative of the non-institutionalized population, excluding those who are under detention or
incarcerated.
17
     We use the ACS data from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (http://usa.ipums.org/usa/).

                                                          13
census tracts. These data include information on several channels of interest, including

employment and means-tested public program participation. Specifically, we measure whether

the respondent was employed year round in the prior year (Year-Round Employ), weeks of

employment in the prior year (Weeks), and, conditional on employment, the natural log of annual

hours worked (Annual Hours). We also measure whether the respondent participated in means-

tested public assistance programs (Supplemental Security Income, General Assistance,

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families/Aid to

Families with Dependent Children), with particular attention to the Supplemental Nutrition

Assistance Program (SNAP) program. 18 Finally, we explore selective outmigration of Hispanic

immigrants in response to BTB laws, using county-by-year data on the number of male Hispanic

immigrants (from Mexico or Central America) with a high school diploma or less per 1,000

working-age population. The means of each of these potential channels are shown in Table 1C.



IV. Methods




18
   Year-Round Employment is a dichotomous variable set equal to 1 if the respondent worked for at least 50 weeks in
the previous year and 0 otherwise. Weeks measures the total number of weeks the respondent worked in the previous
year. Starting in 2008, the ACS reports weeks worked in intervals of 0 week, 1-13 weeks, 14-26 weeks, 27-39
weeks, 40-47 weeks, 48-49 weeks, and 50-52 weeks. For consistency, we assign the interval means for all the
respondents. Ln(Annual Hours) is the natural log of the product of weeks worked in the previous year and usual
weekly hours of work. Public Program is a dichotomous indicator set equal to 1 if (i) the respondent received
income from Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or General
Assistance (GA) or (ii) any member of the respondent’s household received benefits from Food Stamp or
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the past year, and 0 otherwise. (Medicaid receipt is only
available in the ACS data beginning in 2008. In alternate analyses over the period from 2008 through 2014, we find
a pattern of results similar to that reported here.) In our sample, the average program participation rates are 26.7,
18.6 and 11.7 percent for working age African American men, Hispanic men and white men, respectively (Table
1C). We also focus on SNAP, set equal to 1 if the respondent or any member of his household received SNAP in the
previous year, and 0 otherwise.

                                                         14
         We begin by using agency-level month-specific crime data from the NIBRS from 2004 to

2014, focus on criminal incidents involving Hispanic or African American male arrestees, and

estimate a Poisson model of the following form 19:



                  Cjcst =Ejcst [exp(β0 + β1BTBcst + Xcst β2 + Zst β3 + αj + τt + εjcst)]                    (1)


where Cjcst is the crime count among males in agency j located in county c in state s at month-by-

year t (in months from 1 to 132). Exposure for each unit is represented by Ejcst, which can be

proxied by the estimated population served by the reporting agency. BTBcst is an indicator set

equal to 1 if there is a BTB law in effect in county c at time t due to a state law, a county law, or

a city BTB law. 20 The vector Xcst includes county-level controls, including the share of

population that was African American and Hispanic, the average age of the population, and the

natural log of personal per capita income; the vector Zst is a vector of state-level observables,


19
  The Poisson model accommodates fixed effects well and does not suffer from the incidental parameters, in
contrast to the negative binomial model. If, in equation (1), exp(εjcst) follows a gamma distribution with mean of 1
and variance σ, then (1) represents a negative binomial model; if σ is assumed to equal 0, then the negative binomial
becomes a Poisson regression model (Grootendorst 2002). We have experimented with a negative binomial
regression, with a similar pattern of results.
20
  If the law were enacted mid-month, BTBcst is set equal to 0 for that month and 1 thereafter. The results using the
value of the share of month t that the law was in effect in county c are highly similar. Our primary measure of a
BTB law is whether any law was enacted, whether applying to the public or private sectors. As Doleac and Hansen
(forthcoming, pp. 11-12) note:

         “Public BTB laws can aﬀect both public and private sector employment. These policies were typically
         implemented due to public campaigns aimed at convincing employers to give ex-oﬀenders a second
         chance. Public BTB policies were intended in part to model the best practice in hiring, and there is
         anecdotal evidence that this model – in combination with public pressure – pushed private ﬁrms to adopt
         BTB even before they were legally required to. Several national private ﬁrms such as Wal-Mart, Target,
         and Koch Industries, voluntarily "banned the box" on their employment applications during this period, in
         response to the BTB social movement….Public BTB laws might also aﬀect private sector employment
         because workers are mobile between the two sectors, and likely sort themselves based on where they feel
         most welcome.”

Twenty (20) of 111 BTB laws enacted between 2004 and 2014 bind for both public and private employers while the
vast majority only bind for public employers. Results that separate out effects of each type of law are discussed
below.


                                                         15
including the percent of the population ages 25 and over with a Bachelor degree, the natural log

of per-capita police expenditures, the natural log of per capita police employees, right-to-carry

laws, the minimum wage, the state EITC refundable credit rate, an indicator for Supplemental

Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) all vehicle exemption, and a set of immigration policies

(E-Verify mandates, 287(g) agreements, Secure Communities). 21 Finally, αj is a vector of

agency fixed effects and τt is a set of month-by-year fixed effects. The marginal effect, [exp(β1)-

1] x 100 can be interpreted as the percent change in E(Cjcst) associated with a one-unit change in

the ban-the-box law.

        Next, we turn to self-reported longitudinal data from the NLSY97, and in our most

saturated specification, estimate an individual fixed effects model of the following form:



                 Cicst = β0 + β1BTBcst + Xicst β2 + Pst β3 + αc + νi + τt + εist                  (2)



where Cicst measures the criminal activity of individual i residing in county c in state s in year t,

BTBcst is an indicator for whether there is a BTB law in effect in the respondent’s county, and

Xicst is a set of individual observables comparable to those described above. While we estimate

these models with fixed effects at the level of the policy variation (county of residence; αc) for

comparison with the NIBRS analysis, in extended specifications, we also fully exploit the

longitudinal nature of the data and alternately include person fixed effects, νi. This captures all



21
  Means of the independent variables are presented in Appendix Table 1. County-level demographic controls are
generated using population data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results
(SEER) Program. The county-level personal per capita income data are collected from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis. The share of the state population ages 25 and over with a Bachelor degree is generated using data from the
Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Groups; the state per-capita police expenditures and per capita police
employees are collected from the Bureau of Justice Statistics; the concealed carry permit laws are collected from
www.usacarry.com and the state minimum wages are collected from the Department of Labor. The personal per
capita income, per-capita police expenditures and minimum wages are in current dollars.

                                                        16
observed and unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity across individuals, including joint fixed

determinants of criminal and labor market activities. 22 As discussed above, the use of individual

data will allow us to explore heterogeneity in crime effects of BTB laws by race and other

factors.

           Identification of β1 in equations (1) through (3) comes from state, city, and county-

specific changes in BTB laws. Over the period from 2004 to 2014, 12 states, 78 cities, and 21

counties enacted BTB laws. Figure 1 shows the counties in which a BTB law was enacted

(either at the state, city, or county-level) from 2004 to 2014. Effective dates for these laws as

well as the sources of identifying variation across each of our datasets is available in Appendix

Table 2. In our NIBRS analysis sample, 69 counties contribute identifying variation; in the ACS,

157 counties contribute to identifying variation; and in the NLSY97, 74 counties do so.

           The credibility of our identification strategy rests on the parallel trends assumption. We

take a number of tacks to test the credibility of this assumption. First, we conduct an event study

analysis where we examine if crime was trending differently in treatment versus comparison

jurisdictions prior to the enactment of BTB laws:



                                                           𝑗𝑗
           Cjcst =Ejcst [exp(γ0 + ∑3𝑗𝑗=−4,𝑗𝑗≠−1 γ BTBcst + Xcst γ4 + Zst γ5 + αj + τt + εjcst)]                  (3)
                                                    𝑗𝑗




                𝑗𝑗
where BTBcst is a set of mutually exclusive indicators set equal to 1 if county c implemented a

                                −4
BTB law j years from year t. BTBcst is an indicator for four or more years prior to BTB
                  3
enactment, and BTBcst analogously accounts for three or more years following enactment.




22
     The person fixed effects can also account for any (stable) reporting errors or biases across individuals.

                                                                17
       Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates of β1 to the inclusion of controls for county-

specific quadratic time trends to disentangle the effects of BTB laws from unobservables

trending at the county level:



       Cjcst =Ejcst [exp(β0 + β1BTBcst + Xcstβ2 + Zstβ3 + αj + τt + ηc*t + ηc*t2 + εjcst)]   (4)



       Finally, we estimate placebo-type tests by focusing on populations whose criminal

behavior should be less, or at least differently, affected by BTB laws: non-Hispanic white males

and females. While these demographic groups might be affected by BTB laws through labor-

labor substitution by employers, and could be impacted through moral hazard-related channels,

the effects of BTB laws on crime for these groups are second-order, and hence should be smaller

or of the opposite sign.



IV. Results

       Tables 2 through 8 show our main results. We focus on estimates of β1 in these tables.

Parameter estimates on the control variables are available upon request. In all regressions,

standard errors are clustered at the state-level (Bertrand et al. 2004; Doleac and Hansen,

forthcoming).



4.1 Main Results

       Table 2 shows findings from our fixed effects Poisson regression. Panel I shows

estimates of β1 including only agency fixed effects, month-by-year fixed effects and county

demographic characteristics as controls; Panel II adds county- and state-specific economic and



                                                   18
crime policy variables to the right hand side of the regression; and Panel III adds county- and

state-specific social welfare and immigration policy controls. Across each of the panels, we find

that the magnitudes of estimates of β1 are similar, supportive of the validity of the research

design and providing suggestive evidence that BTB laws are enacted exogenously to male

criminal arrests.

       Focusing on our preferred specification in Panel III, we find that BTB laws are associated

with an 8.1 percent [e(0.078) – 1] increase in the total number of criminal incidents (property plus

violent crimes) involving Hispanic male arrestees (column 1, row 1). This effect is driven by

property crimes (row 2), where we find a 12.0 percent increase in such incidents. An

examination of the age distribution of Hispanic male arrestees reflects that the property crime

increases are largest for working age individuals over the age of 25, those who have been found

to suffer employment loss in response to BTB laws (Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming). We find

that the enactment of a BTB law is associated with a 15.0 percent increase in property crimes for

those ages 25-to-34 (Panel III, column 3) and a 15.8 percent increase in property crimes for those

ages 35-to-64 (Panel III, column 4). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that BTB

laws induce statistical discrimination by potential employers that reduce employment among

low-skilled racial and ethnic minorities (Agan and Starr 2018; Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming).

       These findings could also conceivably reflect moral hazard by reducing the expected

future costs of current criminal engagement. For instance, Bamberger and Donohue (1999) find

that workplace discipline practices involving “last chance agreements,” which govern discharged

employees’ reinstatement and reduce their costs of wrongdoing, can, via moral hazard, lead to

more wrongdoing and discharges. Moreover, empirical evidence in other contexts, including

workers’ compensation (Fortin and Lanoie 2000), health insurance (Dave and Kaestner 2009;



                                                 19
Dave et al. 2019) and automobile insurance (Cohen and Dehejia 2004), is generally supportive of

moral hazard effects.

       In contrast to our finding that BTB laws are associated with an increase in property crime

for Hispanic men, we find little evidence that BTB laws affect violent criminal incidents, where

effects are uniformly smaller. This result suggests that economically motivated crimes are most

affected by BTB laws, consistent with an employment related channel.

       The absence of property (and violent) crime effects for non-Hispanic white males

(columns 9 through 12), a population that does not suffer adverse employment effects from BTB

laws (Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming), suggests that the crime effects we observe for Hispanic

males are not simply capturing jurisdiction-specific time-varying unobservables.

       Interestingly, however, when we examine African American men (columns 5 through 8),

we find no evidence that BTB laws affect property or violent crime. This finding persists even

among those ages 25-to-34, a population for whom Doleac and Hansen (forthcoming) found

evidence of statistical discrimination-induced employment declines. This raises an important

question: Why might there be differential criminal responses to BTB laws for Hispanic as

compared to African American men?

       One explanation may be that less educated Hispanics denied job opportunities due to

BTB laws are more likely to be on the margin of crime commission than are similarly situated

African American men. This could be due to differences in familial or personal circumstances

that affect the need for economic resources. For example, according to the 2015 American

Community Survey, the average household size for less educated (high school diploma or less)

Hispanic men ages 25 and older is 4.0 compared to 2.5 for similarly aged and educated African

American men. Moreover, there are twice as many children under age 18 residing in households



                                               20
with less-skilled Hispanic men as compared to less-skilled African American men (1.1 versus

0.5). On the other hand, the poverty rate among less-educated Hispanic men is substantially

lower than for less-educated African American men (18 versus 25 percent).

           In addition, barriers to participation in means-tested public assistance programs may

deepen the negative economic effects of BTB laws. For instance, there is evidence that language

barriers may be an important deterrent to take-up of means-tested public assistance programs

among Hispanics (Dillender 2017). Federal law requires that individuals must be US citizens or

lawful permanent residents to qualify for public assistance programs such as the Supplemental

Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary

Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid (Siskin 2016). 23 In addition, eligible

immigrant families may be deterred from benefits due to fears of disqualification for citizenship

or deportation (Kaushal et al. 2014, Perreira et al. 2012). For instance, Kaushal et al. (2014)

document higher prevalence of food insecurity and lower rates of SNAP participation among

eligible mixed-status Mexican families with both citizen and non-citizen members than eligible

Mexican families with all noncitizen members, a result consistent with the hypothesis of

immigration fears. 24

           In Table 3, we use the ACS to examine the impact of BTB laws on employment and

means-tested public assistance receipt. In the first three panels, we confirm the CPS-based

findings of Doleac and Hansen (forthcoming) using the ACS. We find that BTB laws are

associated with a 2 to 6 percent reduction in the probability of prior year full-year employment,




23
     An exception to this immigration status rule is emergency medical service for unauthorized aliens.
24
  In addition, Kaushal et al. (2014) find that the 2004 U.S. Department of Agriculture outreach to inform Mexican
immigrants of their SNAP eligibility and benefit expansion under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
improve SNAP enrollment among mixed-status Mexican families.

                                                           21
annual weeks of work, and annual work hours among less educated Hispanic men ages 25 and

older and less educated African Americans ages 25-to-34.

         Reintegration after leaving prison is difficult for many reasons, notably low income

levels, greater material hardship, and lower levels of physical and mental health immediately

following incarceration. Studies have highlighted the important role played by SNAP benefits

(and other safety net programs) in reducing material hardship and supporting reentry among

formerly incarcerated individuals. 25 Our estimates in Table 3 indicate that while less educated

African American males are more likely to participate in means-tested public assistance

programs, primarily the SNAP program, following the enactment of BTB laws, less educated

Hispanic men are not. These findings could suggest that barriers to program participation,

including language differences and immigration fears, deepen the negative economic

consequences of BTB laws, leading to more property crime among Hispanic relative to African

American men.

         Another possible explanation for BTB-induced increases in crime among Hispanic males

is that BTB laws cause compositional changes in the Hispanic male population that result in a net

increase in crime. Prior research finds that likely undocumented Hispanic immigrants’ mobility

decisions are more elastic with respect to local labor market conditions than are mobility

decisions of low-skilled natives (Cadena and Kovak 2016), and that likely undocumented

immigrants are less likely to commit crime than natives (Ewing et al. 2015). Thus, if BTB laws

induce outmigration of likely undocumented Hispanic male immigrants, this could explain an

increase in Hispanic crime in BTB jurisdictions.

       In the final row of Table 3, we examine the impact of BTB laws on the share of the

working age population that are less-educated Hispanic males (columns 1 through 4), less-

educated male Hispanic immigrants (columns 5 through 8), and less-educated male Hispanic

immigrants from Mexico and Central America (columns 9 through 12). First, consistent with

Doleac and Hansen’s (2017) findings on African American men, we find no evidence that BTB

laws affect the share of the county population that are Hispanic males. However, when we turn

to male Hispanic immigrants (columns 5 through 12), we find some suggestive evidence that

BTB laws are associated with a reduction in the share of the population that are Hispanic

immigrants. While imprecisely estimated (and not statistically distinguishable from zero at

conventional levels), we find that BTB laws are associated with a 4 to 10 percent reduction in the

share of the working age population comprised of low-skilled Hispanic immigrant men ages 34

and younger. This result is driven by less-skilled Mexican and Central American immigrants, a

population who are more likely to be unauthorized immigrants who enter the U.S. for

employment opportunities (Orrenius and Zavodny 2016). Thus, selective migration of less-

skilled Hispanic immigrants, a population with a lower propensity to engage in criminal activity

than natives (Chaflin 2015; Butcher and Piehl 2008) in response to BTB laws may be another

channel at work.



4.2 Event Study Analyses

       Next, we explore whether the crime effects of BTB laws are masking heterogeneous

short- and longer-run effects. In Table 4, we present coefficients on the year of BTB enactment,

each of the two years following the law’s enactment, and three or more years following the law’s

enactment. For Hispanic men ages 25 and older, we find that property crimes increase starting



                                               23
one year after the adoption of a BTB law, with larger magnitudes in the shorter-run (one and two

years after the law change). Note, however, that because different jurisdictions identify long-run

and short-run coefficients, these differences could also be explained by heterogeneous treatment

effects. For African American and non-Hispanic white males, there is little evidence that BTB

laws are associated with increases in property or violent crimes in both the short- and long-run.

         In Figure 2, we present event study analysis of the effect of BTB laws on property crime

for Hispanic men and non-Hispanic white men, with one year prior to the enactment of the BTB

law as the reference period. We focus on criminal incidents involving male arrestees ages 25

and older, the age group for whom we find evidence of BTB-induced increases in property

crime. 26 Our findings in Figure 2 show no evidence that property or violent crimes among

Hispanic and non-Hispanic white males were trending differently in treatment and comparison

jurisdictions prior to the enactment of BTB laws. Consistent with the findings in Table 4, the

event study in Panel A shows that BTB laws are associated with increases in property crimes for

Hispanic males following the law’s enactment, a pattern of findings consistent with a causal

impact of BTB laws. For Non-Hispanic white men (Figure 2, Panel B), our results suggest no

evidence of an increase in property crime following the implementation of BTB laws.

         In Panel C of Figure 2, we present an event study analysis from a difference-in-

difference-in-differences-type model that examines the effect of BTB laws on property crimes

committed by Hispanic males relative to non-Hispanic white males. This approach will control

for unmeasured jurisdiction-level heterogeneity common across race/ethnicity groups. The event

study in Panel C continues to show increases in property crime following the enactment of BTB

laws for Hispanic males ages 25 and older relative to similarly aged non-Hispanic white men.


26
  Separate event studies for 25-to-34 and 35-to-64 year-olds show a similar pattern of results and are available upon
request.

       In Figure 3, we show comparable event studies for violent crime. We continue to find

little evidence that violent crimes were trending differently in treatment and comparison

jurisdictions prior to the adoption of BTB laws. We find no evidence that violent criminal

incidents involving Hispanic or non-Hispanic white males changed following the enactment of

BTB laws. Finally, in Figure 4, we present event studies for African American men. Consistent

with our results in Table 4, we find little evidence of significant changes in property crime or

violent crime involving African American male arrestees following the enactment of BTB laws,

though the effects are imprecisely estimated, especially in the longer-run.



4.3 Sensitivity Tests

       In Table 5, we conduct a number of robustness checks of the above findings. In Panel I,

we use a larger sample of agencies that report crime data for more than five years during the

sample period between 2004 to 2014. Consistent with our findings in Table 2, our estimates

suggest BTB laws are associated with a 12 to 14 percent increase in crime among Hispanic men

ages 25 and older, driven by property crimes.

       In Panel II of Table 5, we restrict the sample to those agencies reporting at least one

crime per period, effectively focusing on locales with relatively higher shares of each

demographic group. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) models with the dependent variable

redefined as the natural log of the crime rate per 1,000 population, we find a qualitatively similar

pattern of results to those presented above. In Panel III of Table 5, we explore the sensitivity of

our estimates to aggregating our balanced panel to the agency-by-year level. Unsurprisingly, the

results are very similar to those using monthly agency-level crime data in Table 2.




                                                 25
         In the final panel of Table 5 (Panel IV) we explore the robustness of our findings to the

inclusion of controls for county-specific time trends in our two-way fixed effects specification.

The results continue to point to evidence that BTB laws are associated with an increase in

property crime among Hispanic men ages 25 and older. Event study analyses based on this more

saturated specification, shown in Figure 5, are consistent with a causal interpretation of results.

         Next, we explore whether the property crime effects of BTB laws extend to females, a

population for whom there is less evidence of statistical discrimination (Doleac and Hansen,

forthcoming), but for whom moral hazard or labor-labor substitution is still possible. In Figure

6, we present event study analyses for females. The results from these event studies show no

evidence that BTB laws are associated with changes in property crime for Hispanic, African

American, or non-Hispanic white females. 27

         Together, the NIBRS-based results show that BTB laws have the unintended

consequences of increasing property crimes committed by Hispanic males ages 25 and older.

Table 6 examines the specific crimes driving this result. We find BTB laws are associated with a

15 to 18 percent increase in larcenies among working age individuals ages 25 and older, and a 22

percent increase in burglaries for those ages 25 to 34. Only for Hispanic men under age 25 is

there evidence of BTB-induced increases in motor vehicle theft. For African American and non-




27
  Event study analyses for violent crime, available upon request, show little evidence that BTB laws significantly
affected female violent crime.

Hispanic white males, we find little evidence of changes in specific crimes in response to BTB

laws. 28, 29



4.3 NLSY97 Results

         In our final section, we explore the effects of BTB laws on crime using individual-level

data from the NLSY97. In Table 7, we examine the impact of BTB laws on self-reported arrests,

with odd-numbered columns showing results from individual fixed effects models and even-

numbered columns showing results from models that include both individual and county fixed

effects. 30 We find that BTB laws are associated with an increase in the probability of being

arrested, on the order of about one to two percentage points, though these estimates are very

imprecise for the broader age group of 19-to-34. In the main, our findings are largely consistent

with our NIBRS-based findings and suggest that BTB laws have unintended consequences that

increase criminal activity among working age Hispanic males.

         In Panel II, we restrict our attention to those aged 19-to-26, an age group for which the

prevalence of criminal behaviors is relatively high. For the NLSY97 cohort, the prevalence of


28
   In results available upon request, we also examine whether the crime effects of BTB laws differ by the breadth of
their statutory coverage. During our sample period, the vast majority of enacted BTB laws applied only to public
employers. However, these laws may also affect private firms by causing them to voluntarily “ban the box” or
through worker mobility between public and private sectors (Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming). Consistent with
their results, we find that the property crime effect for Hispanic men is driven by BTB laws applying to public
employers.
29
   Because of the limited coverage of the NIBRS across the United States, we also explored data from the Uniform
Crime Reports (UCR) over the period from 2004 to 2014. In contrast to the NIBRS, county-level UCR data cover
roughly 98 percent of the US population in all 50 states and the District of Columbia (FBI 2015) and, when
weighted, are representative of the U.S. population. While the UCR would permit greater policy variation for
identification, the chief disadvantage of the UCR is that these data do not allow for disaggregation of adult crimes
by age, gender and race/ethnicity. Because the impacts of BTB laws differ across these dimensions (Doleac and
Hansen, forthcoming) and do not measure ethnicity (e.g. Hispanic identification) of arrestees, we relegate this
analysis to Appendix Table 3.

30
  The latter controls account for both spatial and individual (time-invariant) heterogeneity, including any fixed
factors that affect locational choices and sorting.

                                                         27
arrest for 19-to-26 year olds is significantly higher relative to older males 27-to-34 years of age

(7.3% vs. 4.5% for Hispanics; 11.3% vs. 7.7% for African Americans; and 6.9% vs. 4.3% for

whites). While models in Panel II of Table 7 show a consistent and significant increase in the

probability of an arrest for Hispanic males under age 27, there is little effect for those ages 27

and older (Panel III). Estimates are fairly robust across both specifications. Again, we do not

find any significant effects for younger African American men. Importantly, estimates for

younger white males are close to zero and do not suggest any meaningful shifts in arrests

associated with the BTB laws, suggesting that statistical discrimination in employment may be

an important mechanism for Hispanic males.

        To further probe whether BTB laws are affecting certain types of crime, in Table 8, we

estimate the effects of these laws on active criminal participation based on reported engagement

in various criminal behaviors. We specifically consider effects on economically motivated

criminal engagement, a broad measure of “property crime”, and then consider specific

components (minor theft, major theft, other property crime, destroy property) underlying this

measure available in the NLSY97. We qualify our discussion by noting that these estimates are

highly imprecise due to the drop in sample size by more than half compared with the analyses for

arrests. 31 Among Hispanic males, there is a suggestive increase in property crime on the order of

about 0.6 (ages 19-to-34) to 1.8 (ages 19-to-26) percentage points, an approximately 18 percent

increase relative to the sample mean.

        This overall increase masks some heterogeneity across specific types of property crime.

Most notably, we find that BTB laws may have reduced minor theft, especially among younger

Hispanic males (by about 1.1 percentage-points), but increased major theft (defined in the


31
  As noted above, this is due to the change beginning in Round 8 in the universe of respondents who report on their
criminal behaviors.

                                                        28
NLSY97 as stealing anything valued at $50 or greater) and other property crime (receiving and

selling stolen merchandise, for instance), thus shifting criminal behaviors to more intense

property crime. Effects on destroying property are close to zero in magnitude. Hence, the net

increase in property crime for Hispanic males is reflective of a strong increase in major theft and

in other forms of property crime, which more than compensate for any decline in minor theft.

We do not find any consistent or significant patterns for African American males. 32

         Given that BTB laws affect the labor market prospects of individuals with a propensity to

commit crime, we would expect first-order effects, if any, on crimes with an economic

motivation. However, for reasons noted earlier, there may also be spillover or second-order

effects on violent crime. When we turn to assaults, we find no evidence that BTB is associated

with an increase in the probability of attacking or assaulting someone for younger Hispanic

males.

         There is less evidence of statistical discrimination among female minorities in the

literature (Doleac and Hansen, forthcoming), consistent with gender-based crime patterns.

Females are far less likely to commit crimes, and racial/ethnic differences in criminal behavior is

substantially lower among females. It is validating that estimates reported in Appendix Table 5

generally confirm this prediction across all measures of criminal behavior from the NLSY97.

         Finally, owing to the cohort design of the NLSY97, most of the sample is low-educated

and many have not completed their education. For instance, among Hispanic males ages 19-to-

34, only eight (8) percent of the analysis sample have attained at least some college education,

and over 22 percent have less than a high school education. In unreported results available upon


32
  In Appendix Table 4, we present results with controls for county fixed effects at the level of the policy variation
(county of residence). These models conserve degrees of freedom, and are very similar in terms of both patterns and
magnitudes, and in some cases a bit more precise over the main models that control for both person and county fixed
effects.

                                                         29
request, we assessed whether effects of the BTB laws are higher among the least-educated males

by including an interaction between the law and an indicator for less than a high school

education. 33 One might expect larger crime effects for less educated individuals for whom

Doleac and Hansen (forthcoming) found BTB law-induced adverse employment effects were

concentrated.

         For arrests, the broader measure of property crime, as well as minor and major theft, we

find significantly larger and positive effects for low-educated Hispanic males. In fact, for

property crime, it appears that all of the effect is driven by less-than-high school educated males,

consistent with the hypothesis that statistical discrimination may be an important mechanism at

work. 34,35



V. Conclusions

         Advocates for BTB laws argue that such laws may serve to increase labor market

opportunities for ex-offenders and reduce incentives for criminal activity. However, recent



33
  We use a very strict definition of low-educated, having attained less than a high school degree, since the sample is
ages 19 and above. Hence, virtually all individuals in this age range should have completed high school.
34
   We test for differential effects across educational attainment through an interaction term and by alternately
stratifying the sample based on high school completion. These specifications suggest that BTB laws are associated
with a statistically significant 4 percentage points increase in arrests among Hispanic males (ages 19-34) with less
than a high school education; for higher educated Hispanic males, the effect is insignificant and essentially nil
(coefficient of -0.007). Among younger Hispanics (ages 18-26), less-than-high school educated males are about 2 to
9 percentage points more likely to be arrested relative to higher educated males, as a result of the BTB laws. The
effects of BTB laws on property crime, minor theft, and major theft produce a qualitatively similar pattern of results.
35
  We also conducted analyses on employment outcomes from the NLSY97. For younger African American males,
we find that the BTB laws are associated with about a 6 pct. points decline in private sector employment (p-value =
0.19) but no decline in any employment, suggestive of a shift in the composition of jobs. Some estimates are also
suggestive of an increase in the number of jobs worked, possibly reflecting (in conjunction with the decline in
private sector employment) a shift from the formal to the informal sector. For younger Hispanic males, there are no
significant or strong effects on employment at the extensive margin, though estimates are suggestive of about a 6-
7% decrease in the number of weeks worked [p=value = 0.24] among those employed. For whites we do not find
any strong effects on employment at the extensive margin but a significant 11% increase in weeks worked at the
intensive margin.

                                                          30
studies suggest that these laws may have important unintended consequences, chiefly, statistical

discrimination in employment against male racial minorities. This study is the first to examine

the effect of BTB laws on crime.

         Using data drawn from the National Incident-Based Reporting System, we find that BTB

laws are associated with a 10 percent increase in criminal incidents involving working-age

Hispanic men, driven by property crimes. This result is consistent with economically motivated

crimes due to statistical discrimination-driven diminished employment opportunities and,

perhaps, moral hazard. However, we find no evidence of BTB-induced increases in property

crime involving working age African American men, a population that also faces diminished job

opportunities due to statistical discrimination. Supplemental analysis using the American

Community Survey (ACS) suggests two possible explanations for this race/ethnicity-specific

difference in crime response: barriers to public assistance receipt among Hispanic men and,

perhaps, outmigration of less criminally prone Hispanic immigrants.

         The magnitudes of our effects suggest that BTB laws are associated with an important

unintended consequence that may generate important social costs. Using per-offense social cost

of property crime from McCollister et al. (2010), we obtain back-of-the-envelope additional

costs of $401 million (2018 dollars) for property crime involving Hispanic men ages 25 and

older. 36 The findings from this study add to some emerging evidence that BTB laws, while well-


36
   Data on property crimes committed over the 2004-2014 period are obtained using the FBI’s Crime in the United
States reports (available from: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/topic-
pages/tables/table-1). We then use the 2004-2014 UCR’s Arrests by Age, Sex, and Race files to calculate the share
of property crime arrests involving men ages 25-to-64. To generate an estimate of the number of crimes committed
by men ages 25-to-64, we multiply the crime counts in the 2004-2014 period from the FBI’s Crime in the United
States report with the share of property crime arrests involving men ages 25-to-64 from the UCR’s Arrests by Age,
Sex, and Race files. Next, we estimate the number of crimes committed by Hispanic men ages 25-to-64 by
multiplying the estimated crimes committed by men ages 25-to-64 with the percent of arrests involving Hispanic
male adults (available at https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/table-43). Using our
findings from Table 2 (Panel III, columns 3 and 4) where we find BTB is associated with a 15.0 to 15.8 percent
increase in property crimes among Hispanic males ages 25-to-64, we estimate 69,790 additional property crimes

perpetuating the cycle of criminality.




following the enactment of BTB laws. Finally, we use the per crime cost of a property offense of $5,739 (in 2018
dollars) from McCollister et al. (2010) to obtain the total BTB-induced property crime cost of $401 million.

Notes: Poisson estimates are generated using agency-level data drawn from the 2004 to 2014 National Incident-Based Reporting System. Each regression has controls for agency fixed
effects, time fixed effects. Demographic controls include the percentage of county population that are male, African American, Hispanic, county-level average age, and share of state
population ages 25+ with a bachelor degree. Economic controls include the log of state personal per capita income, minimum wages, and refundable EITC rates. Crime policy controls include
logs of nominal police expenditure per capita, police employment per capita, and shall issue laws. Social welfare & immigration policy controls include SNAP vehicle exemption, E-verify,
287(g) program, and Secure Communities. Standards errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: Poisson estimates are generated using agency-level data drawn from the 2004 to 2014 National Incident-Based Reporting System. Each regression has controls for agency fixed
effects, time fixed effects, a set of state-level controls (including share of state population ages 25+ with a bachelor degree, nominal minimum wages, refundable EITC rates, nominal police
expenditure per capita, police employment per capita, Shall issue laws, SNAP vehicle exemption, and E-verify), and county-level controls (the percentage of the population that are male,
African American, Hispanic, average age, nominal personal per capita income, 287(g) program, and Secure Communities). Standards errors are clustered at the state level. Means of

Notes: Poisson estimates are generated using a balanced panel of agencies and months in jurisdictions with
population exceeding 25,000 from the 2004-2014 Uniform Crime Reports (Anderson 2014). Each regression has
controls for agency fixed effects, time fixed effects, county-specific quadratic time trends, and a set of state-level
controls (including share of state population ages 25+ with a bachelor degree, nominal minimum wages, refundable
EITC rates, nominal police expenditure per capita, police employment per capita, Shall issue laws, SNAP vehicle
exemption, and E-verify), and county-level controls (the number of reporting agencies, the percentage of the
population that are male, African American, Hispanic, average age, nominal personal per capita income, 287(g)
program, and Secure Communities). Standards errors are clustered at the state level. Means of the dependent
variable are in brackets.
