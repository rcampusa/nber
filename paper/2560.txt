             Labor Market Institutions, Constraints,   arid   Performance


                                     ABSTRACT


    This study examines the changes in labor market institutions and outcomes

across (ECD countries in the past two decades and relates indicators of the

institutions to outcomes.   It has four findings.   First, there has been an

increased divergence in labor market institutions, with unionisation growing or

remaining at high levels of density in some countries while declining in

others.   Second, changes in the two major outcomes on which analysts and policy-

makers focus -- employment and real wages -- are substantially negatively

correlated across countries, conditional on growth of GDP.       Countries that had

rapid growth of employment in the l9]Os or 1980s, and high employment to

                                                          had relatively slow
working age population rates, such as the U.S. or Sweden,
                                                  with relatively slow growth
Crowth of real wages; while by contrast countries

of employment, such as Spain, had rapid growth of real wages, indicative of a

labor demand type constraint on outcomes,   Third, there is a moderate nonlinear

relation between labor market outcomes and institutions: countries with either

relatively centralized wage-setting (as evidenced by little inter-industry
                                                                      with
dispersion of wages) such as the Scandinavian countries and countries

decentralized wage-setting (as indicated by high inter-industry dispersion of

                                                  countries with intermediate
wages) had better performances in employment than
                                                           even among countries
types of labor market structures and institutions. Fourth,

with comparable institutions, there is a considerable diversity of performance.

        Labor Market Institutions, Constraints, and Economic Performance




     The labor market experiences of advanced economies diverged sharply in the

1970s and l980s: employment increased in North America, Australia, and Japan

while stagnating in many western European countries; real wages grew rapidly in

most OECD countries but not in the United States, then generally stabilized or

declined but not in the United Kingdom.      Many analysts (largely European) blame

                                               and government labor regulations
Europe's stagnant employment on union policies

that reduce wage and employment flexibility and extol the US as the paragon of

a flexible efficient market.     Other observers (largely American) bemoan the

slow growth of productivity and shift of jobs to low wage industries in the US

and view Japan as the exemplar economy.      Still other analysts blame high

unemployment on decentralized wage-setting that permits real wage growth

despite joblessness and see a solution in Swedish-style          'corporatism'

     Do labor market institutions in OECD countries differ sufficiently to have

caused the observed differences in economic performances of the 1970s-l980s?

Do claims that labor market flexibility, unionism, centralised or decentralized

wage-setting   affect outcomes stand up to critical investigation?

     To answer these questions    I   analyse data on changes in wages and

                                   and industries and relate these changes to
employment pooled across countries

indicators of the institutional structures of labor markets.           In the first

section I compare two indicators of labor market arrangements
                                                                        -   - union density

and dispersion of wages among industries      -   - and find   large differences and

                                                                have moved to
increasing polarization among OECD countries, as some countries

near universal unionisation/collective      bargaining coverage and narrow wage

differentials while others have moved to weak unionism and wider differentials.

In the second section I document the existence of a substantial tradeoff

between growth of employment and real wages across countries and industries.
                                                   2


in the third section    I   relate measures of performance to labor market structure

and find that economios at the extremes            -   - with   highly centralized or highly

decentralised    labor msrket arrangements         -   - had better   employment records than

economies    'betwixt and between'   .     While   this is consistent with theories that

decentralized    and highly structured labor markets may produce similar outcomes

(Olson,1982; Calmfors and Driffill),            there is sufficient diversity      in outcomes

among countries to indicate thst specific institutional arrangements are

neither necessary nor sufficient for adoption of employment-creating                 policies.

I. Differences   in Labor Markets: Union Density and Wage Structures

     Labor market institutions, wage-setting systems, and the wage structures

that reflect those systems changed in different wsys in developed countries in

the lPiOs and lPSOs.    The proportion of workers represented by unions fell in

the US, Japan, and, after a period of growth, in the UK and Netherlands while

increasing or stabilizing in most OECD countries.                 Wage differentials by

industry and skill, which historically narrow with develop-ment, rose in some

countries but not in those with centralized wage setting.

Union density/collective bargaining representation

     Table 1 records figures on the proportion of nonagricultural wage and

salary workers in the traditionally most important labor market institution in

capitalism -- trade unions.      As unionism has different meanings across settings

(it reflects representation     at the company level and the Shunto offensive in

Japan; collective bargaining to a written agreement in the US; national wage-

                                                               the figures
aerting in Scandinavia, etc.) and is measured differently (1),

mhould be viewed as crude indicators of patterns and changes.                 The question

marks next to France and Italy reflect the particularly weak measures of

unionisation in those countries          (2),   though data for other countries are also

imperfect.    In Australia the arbitration wage-setting system places unions at

the center of wage determination despite moderate density.                  In the UK the drop

 Organizations's Yearbook of Labor Statistics; and the US Bureau of Labor

 Statistic's International Comparisons of Hourly Compensation Costs for

 Production Workers in Manufacturing.   The data differs in several ways: UN and

EEC figures are wage and salary bills divided by total employment; the ILO and

Eurostat data are hourly earnings; while the BLS measures hourly compensation.

The number of industries varies by data set and in some instances by country

within a data Set (5). Service industries are under-represented.       As usual with

international comparative data, moreover, the data trade-off comparability

among countries for accuracy about any particular country.    The purpose of

examining   several data sets is to enable me to differentiate patterns that are

robust across sources and thus more likely to be valid from patterns that

result from peculiarities in a particular data set.

     Table 2 summarizes the results of my calculations, with countries grouped

by the level and change in dispersion in the l97Os-early l9BOs and with the
variances multiplied by 100 for ease of presentation.    Despite differences

among data, the table reveals abroad similarity in dispersion that

differentiates   between countries where pay is centrally determined    (i.e.   the

Scandinavian countries) and countries with decentralized wage-setting      (US,


Japan, etc.).    The table also shows that dispersion increased in the US, Japan,

Canada, New Zealand, Australia,   and possibly Norway; decreased markedly in

Italy; but did not change in most other countries.    As the historic pattern is

for wage differentials to narrow or at least not increase, the rise has

attracted   attention (see Bell and Freeman,l985; Lawrence and Lawrence,1986).

The most aberrant figures are from the EEC file, whose calculated dispersions

for Italy and France are out of line with those from other sources, though

showing similar changes over time, and those for Norway, which is rated high in

dispersion in the UN data but low in ILO data.
other wage differentials

     As a check on the extent to which industry wage dispersion reflects the

overall wage-setting system in a country     I   have   also examined   pay differentials

by skill,   sex,   and age, and find that they   follow patterns   similar to industry

differentials.      Consider, for example, the patterns of change in skill premia.

During the 1970s premia by years of schooling or occupation narrowed in moat

developed countries, often substantially, as the influx of young educated

workers created by the baby boom and post-world war II expansion of higher

education reduced the pay of the more educated (Freeman,198l).           The 1980s

experience has been more varied: education and white collar/manual pay ratios

widened sharply in the U.S. and U.K. to     pre-l970s levels    while maintaining

levels much narrower than in the early l970s in many other OECD countries

(Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Australia, Finland, and Japan, according to

OECD, 1987b).      As for differentials by sex, the ratio of female to male pay is

higher and increased more in economies with centralized wage-setting such as
Sweden or with special centralized features such as Australia than in

decentralized economies such as the U.S. (Gregory and Ho,l985; OECD,1985).

Finally, differentials by age also changed across countries, steepening in the

U.S. and some other countries with baby-boom induced increases in the supply of

                                         had a shortfall of youth, while
young workers, narrowing in Japan, which
                                                                   and Freeman,
remaining stable in countries with centralized wage-setting (Bloom

1986; OECD,l984; Leroy,1987).      In short, the pattern of wage differentials

                                                      is sufficiently similar
along dimensions other than industry across countries

to that in industry differentials to make industry dispersion a reasonable

indicator of differences in overall wage-setting systems.

     When one contrasts specific countries with less pronounced- institutional

differences, however, these broad-based measures can be misleading.            Consider,

for instance,-relative wage flexibility by geographic area in the US, which
                                                   6


ranks low in unionism    arid   high in dispersion in Tables 1 and        2   and   is generally


viewed as the archetypal flexible labor market and in the UK, which ranks in

the middle of the unionism category and has a modestly narrower industry wage

structure,   As can be seen in Table 3, in the US wages are high in areas of

high unemployment and show little response to increases in unemployment whereas
in the UK wages declined in the 1980s in high unemployment areas,                   These

patterns imply greater rather than smaller responsiveness of pay to area

unemployment in the UK.      Relative pay by skill and age also appear to have been

no less flexible in the UK than in the US in the            1980s,   with premium rising in

both countries, as noted earlier.             The implication is that while dispersion,

union density, and other broad indicators of labor market institutions may

accurately reflect gross differences between centralized and decentralized

labor markets, they may not depict accurately differences in the operation of

markets between specific countries,            Caveat esptor.

comparing measures of labor market_structure

     This said, how closely linked are union density and industry dispersion to

one another and to widely used indices of corporatism or other categorizations

of labor market institutions?

    As a first step     to answering these questions I calculated correlation

coefficients between the union densities in table 1 and industry wage

dispersions in Table 2, obtaining values ranging from            -030   to -056, and

calculated correlations between 1970-1980 changes in density and in 1973-84

changes in dispersion, obtaining a coefficient of 0.36.              The correlations show

that wage dispersion contains information beyond that captured by union

density   and conversely.       Second,   I   compared dispersion and union density

across countries according to widely used corporatist indices.                Most countries

classified by   Cohn   Crouch (1985) as corporatist and, ipso facto, by Bruno and

Sachs (1986), who rely on Crouch's work, have high union density and low wage

dispersion, producing a sizeable positive correlation between a corporatist

dummy   variable   and density (rโ 0.45) and a negative correlation between it and

dispersion (rโ -0.47).      Still, the relations are far   from   perfect: Relgium and

Australia, rated low in corporatism, are high in unionism while 'corporatist'

Austria has high wage dispersion.     Third, I correlated union density in 1980

and industry dispersion in 1984/5 with Calmfors and Driffills' ranking of

countries by centralization of wage-setting and found that those at the top of

their list (with low ratings) were more unionised (r โ       -0.71)   and had lower

wage dispersion (r โ    0.37).   The relatively small correlation between wage

dispersion and centralization is due to Austria, which they rank as number one

in centralization while it has, as noted, high wage dispersion. (6)

     The union density and dispersion of industry wage indicators of labor

market structures have three advantages over judgmental categorisations: they

are based on   hard' statistics; they vary over time in a natural way: and they

lead one to look in close at actual wage outcomes and union representation.

The disadvantage is that they are a step removed from the corporatist/central-

ized wage setting and flexible market concepts that underlie the debate over

alternative labor market arrangements.     As they have both advantages and

disadvantages, in ensuing analyses I use them and judgmental categorisations of

institutions to indicate the nature of the labor market structures that may

affect outcomes,     First, however, it is necessary to delineate country

differences in outcomes and examine the labor demand relation that constrains

employment and wage outcomes,

II. Outcomes and Constraints

    As the divergent views of American/European economic success given at the

outset indicates, choice of Outcomes tS    critical   in comparing performance.       One

can get different pictures of economic performance by focusing on growth as

opposed to levels of outcomes; selecting one indicator rather than another;

 comparing changes over one period rather than another, and so on (e.g. "manu-

 facturing productivity is rising rapidly in the U.K." versus "employment is

 below 1979 levels").   To deal with this problem I present in Table 4 data on

 levels and changes in several outcomes,    Columns 1-4 show the divergence in

 employment/working age population and unemployment rates among OECD countries

 that has attracted most attention.    The unemployment figures document the shift

of the U.S. from relatively high to relatively low unemployment while the

employment/population ratios show the growth of employment in the US, Sweden

and some other countries compared to the drop in the France, UK, Germany, among

others.    The column 5 evidence shows that despite differences in labor

utilization, GD? did not increase that differently across countries.       The

'reason' is indicated in column 6's change in labor productivity (GDP per

employee) and column 7's change in real wages, which are inversely related

across countries to growth of employment (compare US and Sweden with Belgium

and UK).    If one adjusts the productivity growth figures for the 1975-1986 4-9%

decline in annual hours worked in Europe compared to the US (OECD 1987),

moreover, the difference in productivity growth between the US and OECD Europe

becomes even more pronounced,    One uncommon interpretation of the US-Europe

experience in the 1970s-],980s   is that Americans   had to work more to obtain

similar increases in living standard, and thus that high employment America did

not perform as well as low employment Europe, save for workaholics.

     Columns 8 and 9 turn to levels of performance.       They contrast GD? per

capita and GD? per worker across countries in OECD purchasing power parity

units.    These figures show greater similarity in GD? per worker than in GD? per

capita, due to the fact that countries with low employment/population rates

have correspondingly higher productivity.       This presumably reflects increases

in measured productivity as employment falls along production functions.         Note

also that, concern about Japanese productivity notwithstanding, GDP per worker
                                                    9


is lower in Japan than in Europe and the US.                As Americans (and Japanese) work

more hours than Europeans          (7).    moreover, Europe looks even   better   in output per

hour: British hourly output, for example                exceeded Japanese by 8% while French

and German hourly outputs were virtually the same as American.

     From the perspective of labor market analysis it is the relations between

employment/unemployment performance and productivity/real wages in Table 4 that

are most intriguing.          In a period in which GDP growth did not differ greatly

among countries (could not differ much because of economic and technological

interdependence?) the differing performance of countries along these two

dimensions raises the possibility that their economies faced similar wage/

employment trade-off schedules, of the sort often modelled by labor demand,

though also explicable in other ways (Solow 1986)                and thus that thfferences in

employment reflect in part the position of countries along that schedule.

wage employment trade-off: aggregate evidence

     The standard method for analysing the impact of wages on employment across

countries is to estimate          time    series demand relations for individual countries,

and to use differences in estimated response parameters to account for

differences in performances (e.g. the 1986 Unemployment Economica Supplement).

My approach in this section is different.               I   take changes in wages and

employment across countries (industries) over the same period rather than time

series changes within a country as units of observation.                 I use the same

equation for all countries, and thus attribute differing Outcomes among

countries to different changes in explanatory variables rather than to

differing response parameters.             To finesse issues of dynamic adjustments,

moreover, I take changes over long periods.

     Formally, my analysis can be represented by the following employment

(demand) equation:

     dlnEc โ   a   dln%Jc +   b   dlnXc + uc,                                               (1)
                                                 10


 where din is the log change operator; E is employment; Wc are wages; X is a

 demand-shift variable; u is a residual; the subscript c indexes country.

      If one assumes that each country has its own              response   parameters, a + ac

and b + bc, where a and b are the mean responses and ac and bc are the country-

specific components, then the latter are subsumed into the residual:

     dinEc โ    (a + ac) dlnWc + (b + bo) dlnXc # uc โ                                      (2)
                 a DlnWc +    b   DlnXc +   at   DlnWc +   bc   DlnXc +uc,

where a and b are average response parameters.

     In   (2) heterogeneity   in responses creates heteroskedastic errors but does

not bias estimates of parameters as long as the country components are

independent of the other variables in the equation.               Material and related

prices that are determined on world markets and whose changes are likely to be

similar across countries are subsumed in the constant term.

results

     Table 5 presents the results of estimating relations between changes in

employment, real wages, and output for the entire economy in 19 OECD countries

and for manufacturing in 12 countries over different time periods.                 In panels A

and & the dependent variable is total employment, output is real GD?, and wages

are manufacturing earnings (A) or compensation of employees from national

product accounts per employee deflated by the GDP deflator (E); and changes are

measured as in changes over the entire period.             In Panel C the dependent

variable is total hours worked in manufacturing, output is value added in

manufacturing, and wages are total compensation for manufacturing production

workers deflated by GDP deflator; because the BLS publishes the data as

compound annual changes, changes are measured in those units.

     All three Sets of calculations show that, conditional on the growth of

output, changes in wages and employment were significantly inversely related,

The US and Sweden, for example, with below-average real wage growth had above-

 average growth of employment.       Eecause rates of growth of GDF vary less than

 rates of growth of real wages, moreover, the wage-employment trade-off tells a

 greater part of the story of variation in employment performance across

countries than do differences in rates of GDP growth
                                                     although the latter are

critical in explaining differences, as well.

      8y directly linking changes in employment and wages across countries, the

calculations in Table S provide a potentially firmer basis for
                                                               attributing
differences in employment growth to differences in wage-settlements than time-

series regressions that rely on differences in estimated response parameters of

questionable robustness.        Still, one must take care in interpreting the

results.     With output fixed, the estimates neglect the 'scale' effect of wages

on output and employment and thus may understate the employment consequences of

wages.     To gage the importance of this I correlated changes in real wages and

GD? across countries, obtaining positive coefficients inconsistent with the

notion that wage-induced output expansion is a major determinant of different

country experiences.        A second potential error arises because labor costs are a

major share of value added, possibly producing a spurious negative employment.

wage tradeoff    (8).     As regressions using industry data with gross output (where

labor's share is small) or value added minus labor costs as the measure of

production yield results similar to those in the table, I also doubt that this

is a major problem.        Finally, as Solow (1986) has stressed, there are other

ways to   interpret     the observed wage-employment trade-off beyond wage-induced

movements along demand curves.       One such interpretation is in terms of the

joint determination of wages and employment on an aggregate production function

due to changes in GD?.       As this implies a negative correlation between changes

in GDP and wages, contrary to fact,      I   reject it as the primary explanation of

the observed relations.       Another possibility is that the trade-off reflects the

impact of exogenous changes in productivity on real wages or on money wages and

prices through both labor aod product market behavior.        While   I   believe

observed cross-country differecces in growth of output per worker are roo large

to represeot longrun differences fn technology among rhe countries, the problem

of endogeneity of wages remains, for factors that influence wages (and the

markup of prices over wages) are unlikely to be independent of growth of GD?

and employment and unemployment.       In sum, although none of the criticisms

gainseys the empirical 'trade-off', they raise questions about its

interpretation and meaning.     To probe these issues   I   examine wage and


employment changes with more disaggregate data.

induendence
     There are three advantages to studying changes in wages and employment

across disaggregated industries,      First, it allows us to analyse employment and

wages among fndustries within countriea and thus to probe rhe postulated

similarity of demand behavior that underlies equation I,         Second, it offers

                                             of output and prices by exploiting
ways to deal with the problem of endogeneiry

developments in foreign countries.      Third, it makes the interpretation of the

tradeoff as joint wage and employment determination along a production function

less plausible, given the differing situations of specific industries.

Accordingly,   I   obtained data on wages, employment, value added, and production

for 10 countries and up to 37 industries from an EEC file (9); and on

                                                                    for up to
employment, wages, value added and gross output in producers prices

35 industries in 17 countries from the UN Yearbook of Industrial Statistics.

The UN   ssisple consists primarily   of manufacturing industries, while the EEC

data includes some other sectors.      As in the country comparisons,       I   examine


changes over long periods.

alternative models

     I use the following three equation model of price, output, and employment

determination to analyse the industry data:
                                                           13


      Wage-Price Relation:

                             dinPic โ      dinPiw;                                                (3A)

                             dinPic โ      vicdl,nWic-dlnTic,                                     (33)

where P Is price; v is labor's cost share; T represents neutral technological

progress;    i   indexes industry; c indexes country; and w indexes the world.

      In   (3A) the price        in industry      I   in    country   c depends on world market

prices and is thus exogenous to             the       labor market.

     In    (38),   by contrast, the price in an Industry responds to wages according
to labor's share in value added.

     Which assumption Is more plausible?                        For some industries and countries,

prices are presumably largely exogeneous to the labor market because of inter-

national competition (or other reasons); for others, the opposite may be true.

In the absence of a detailed pricing model, prudence dictates analysis of both.

     Demand for Output:               dinQic โ         -y   dinPic +   dlnXic,                    (4)

where y is the elasticity of product demand; and X is a shift in demand for

output in Industry 1 in country c taken as exogenous.

     SubstitutIng 33 into 4          yields    a relation between wages and output: dlnQic

  -yvdlnWic +      ydlnlic   +   dlnXic.    In 3A wages have no impact on output.

     Demand for Labor:                dlnEic โ -hdlnWic+              dlnXic + cdlnTic,              (5)

where the elasticity h embodies substitution and scale effects; X is an

exogeneous shift due to shifts in product demand; T reflects technology.

     The major problem with models of this type is the absence of measures of

shifts in demand, which forces researchers to use actual output or instruments

to proxy shifts.      This creates problems due                  to the endogeneity   of output

through the production function and the uncertain quality of instruments,

Cross-country data on the same industries allows us to treat the problem by

decomposing the shift component into country-specific, industry-specific, and

residual interaction effects:
                                                   14


     dinTic โ     dlnTc + dlnTi   +   vie;    dlnxic โ   dlnxc +   dlnxi   +   eic            (6)


     Then, pooling industry snd country data, one can use industry dummy

variables   to identify industry shifts (dlnTi and dlnxi) and country dummies to

identify country shifts (dlnTc and dlnXc), eliminating endogenous output:

     dlnEic       -hdlnWic + D' +     C'+    residual,                                        (7)

where D' is a vector of industry dummies, C' is a vector of country dummies and

the ic subscripts relate to industry and country respectively.

     With two countries this is equivalent to comparing differences in changes

in employment and differences in changes in wages.                 If labor demand behavior

dominates the data, the country whose industry has a greater increase in wsges

will have a smaller increase in employment.

     Alternatively, the change in industry production in all countries can be

used to proxy shifts in demand in an industry, yielding:

      dlnEic โ    -hdlnWic + edlnQi'+        C',                                              (8)

where Qi' is the sum of production in industry i in the countries under study.

This equation asks "what is the impact of changes in wages on employment given

world expansion of the industry, and employment trends in the country?"

results

     Analysis of thE relation between chsnges in employment and wages by

industry in the EEC and UN data sets confirms the existence of a significant

wage-employment    tradeoff across and within countries.              Specifically:

     (1) Regressions of changes in employment on changes in wages and output by

industry within countries, auzsissrized in appendix tables Al and A2, yield

negative coefficients on wages of similar magnitudes among countries in both

the EEC and UN data sets.     The similarity justifies pooling the dats into s

single cross-country industry file in ensuing analysis.                As wage-setting

institutions are more likely to differ across countries than labor demand
                                             15


behavior   moreover,   I    interpret the results as reflecting similar demand

elasticities rather than some other similarity in behavior.

     (2) Whether one assumes that industry prices are exogeneously set            on world

markets or depend on industry wages in a country does not affect the inverse

employment/wage relation.       This is shown in the EEC regressions in table Al,

where the regressions on the left hand side use wages and value added deflated

by sector prices as explanatory variables (on the assumption that prices are
determined on world markets> while the regressions on the right hand side use

wages and value added in current values as explanatory variables (on the

assumption that prices depend on wages).          Both regressions yield compatable

negative coefficients on wages.

     (3) Regression estimates      of the impact of relative wages on      eniployrnent


using pooled country-industry data yield a significant inverse employment/wage

relation when output is replaced by industry and country dummy variables or by

'world' output and country dummy variables.         This   is documented   in Table 6 for

the EEC (lines 1-4> and UN (lines 5-8> data sets,          Lines I and S give

baseline' estimates from regression of changes in employment on changes in

wages and output.    Lines 2 and 6 give results when country and industry dummy

variables have been added to allow for differences across countries and

industries.    Lines 3 and 7 show the results whenindustry output is excluded as

endogenous.    Here, the estimated elasticity falls rather than rises, possibly

because industry-country specific technological or demand shifts lead to

expanded production and higher wages as workers share in industry prosperity,

Finally, lines 4 and    8   replace industry dummy variables with changes in output

in the countries in the sample, with little effect on the estimates,

     In sum,   regardless of    whether one uses domestic output, industry and

                                                                   the data

type trade-off.    Countries like the U.S. or Sweden where real wages increased

slowly had more rapid growth of employment and higher employment-population

rates than countries with rapid growth of real wages.         While it is possible to

interpret this finding in ways other than that suggested here, the trade-off

represents the basic fact that any explanation of the divergence in outcomes

must address.

III.   Institutional Differences and Outcomes

       The question that arises next is whether the differences in outcomes

across countries examined in section II are related to the labor market

institutions examined in section I?         Do countries with one set of institutions

perform differently than countries with other institutions?

       Extant empirical analyses offer, as noted, conflicting answers.       Some

studies interpret the post oil-shock economic record as showing the success of

'corporatist' economies    (Crouch,1985; Bruno and Sachs 1986; Tarantelli 1986;

Bean, Layard, and Nickell,1986; Newell and Symons 1986).         Others see better

economic performances among countries with decentralized flexibility or with

particular kinds of flexible labor market arrangements (Klau and Mittelstadt

1986; Freeman and Weitzman,l986; Bruno and Sachs,1986 with respect to nominal

wage responsiveness).     The failure of several follow-up analyses to confirm

initial claims about the effect of institutions, seemingly because of modest

differences in performance measures and periods covered (Van Poeck,l987;

Summers and Wadwhani,1987;    my calculations (11)), suggest the danger of

generalizing from results based on a particular model and data set,

Accordingly,   in this section    I   eschew estimating structural models of behavior

under constraints in favor of 'reduced form' regressions designed simply to

identify the links between indicators of labor market institutions and

employment and wage outcomes.         My analysis suggests that one reason for

conflicting interpretations      of the 1970s-1980s experience is that there     is   an

countries with the most highly sttuctured labor markets and those with the most

decentralized Isbor markets turned in better employment performances thsn

others.      My analysis also reveals, however, a wide range of experience among

countries with 'similar' institutiona thst suggests that even statistically

significant and robust findings be interpreted with caution.

empirical finding

     Table 8 presents the results of regression estimates of the relation

between labor market arrangements and employment and real wage outcomes in the

l9SOs.    Lines 1-3 are based on the OECD country data whilie lines 4 and 5 are

based on the BLS data used in Table      5.   In each calculation I relate outcome

variables    to:   industry wage dispersion figures from Table   2   and the aquare of

those figures, the 1979 percentage unioniaed from Table 1, a 0-I corporatist

dummy variable and the In change in output in the country.           The key

coefficients are those on dispersion, as they are designed to reflect the

impact of both highly centralized (low dispersion) and decentralized (high

dispersion) labor market arrangements on outcomes.       If the two labor market

structures produce similar outcomes, the equation will have a parabolic form,

with linear and squared terms obtaining opposite signs in the regressions.

     The regressions for employment/population in line 1 show that in fact this

is the case for overall labor utilisation: the level of dispersion has a

negative impact on employment while its square has a positive impact,

indicating that increases in dispersion are first associated with falling then

with rising employment/population rates, and thus that both countries with

centralized and those with decentralized labor markets generated more

employment    than others.   The unemployment regression in line     2   shows the same

pattern with oppositely signed coefficients, as one would expect, though the

parabolic form has less statistical significance.       That the cross-section

with falling real wage, as one would expect if the lahoc market institutions

affect employment along the employment-real wage trade-off schedule.     As    I


could find no such pattern in the hourly pay figures in the OECD data, I am

unwilling to make much of this result.     Even the ELS data show, moreover,

greater divergence in changes in real wages than in employment across countries

with 'similar' labor market inatitutions, suggesting that the existence of

country differences in the teal wage-employment trade-off that are subsumed in

error terms in our regreasions.

IV Summary

     This paper has four messages regarding labor market institutions,

constraints, and outcomes in DECO countries in the l970s and lYEOs:

     1) Labor   market institutions diverged markedly in the period under study:

union density increased in many countries but declined sharply in the US and

moderately   in some others; industrial wage dispersion rose in several less

unionised countries, including the US, fell in Italy, while holding steady in

several highly unionised countries.

     2) The level and change in employment-to-population   rates and change in

real wages differed among countries and among industries within countries along

a trade-off schedule that suggests that movements along demand curves were an

important factor in the divergence in outcomes in the period.

     3) Labor market institutions were related to outcomes in a nonlinear way,

with countries having centralized institutions/low wage dispersion and

countries having decentralized institutions/high wage dispersion doing better

in limiting unemployment and maintaining employment than countries with

intermediate labor market institutions.

    4) There is sufficient diversity among countries with 'comparable'

inatitutiona to indicate that desireable, or undesireable, outcomes are not the

exclusive property of any single labor market arrangement, possibly because all
                                              21


have the potential for adopting the 'right' or 'wrong' policies to attain

feasible outcomes.

        Finally, it   is   important to recognize that the cross-country analysis in

this and other studies leaves open the issue of          exportability' of institutions

-   - the   extent to which labor market arrangments developed in one country can be

transferred to others.        Centralized corporatist labor markets are found

primarily      in small countries.   Decentralized markets characterize larger

economies,       Perhaps   whatever its virtue,    'corporatist' wage-setting could not

flourish in economies like the US or the UK as it does in Sweden and Denmark;

and conversely for ducentralized systems in smaller economic settings. If this

is the case, the issue to be addressed in the future ought not to be which

broad set of labor market arrangements 'work better' but rather which specific

policies and programs work and can be transfered to other countries.

I) There   are several sources of data on unionisation: union reports of

membership, enterpise reports on collective bargaining; household surveys; and

union financial records.    Among the problems with these different data are: the

tendency for unions to exaggerate membership in some periods (recognized as a

problem with U.K. statistics in the 1980s); lack of knowledge of collective

bargaining   status (by household recipients reporting on other recipients);

unwillingness    to make data public (in countries where dual unions compete)   .   In
the U.S. the Department of Labor terminated its survey of unions and now

reports figures from household data.

2) Tn the caee of France, figures on the proportion of workers covered by

industry-level    agreements suggest much higher union influence, while those on

the proportion covered by plant-level agreements are consistent with the low

density shown in the table. aee Ministere du Travail 1986.

3) For example,    the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey reports that the

proportion of private manufacturing establishments with no recognized union

rose from 35% to 44% between 1980 and 1984 (Millward and Stevens, 1986 p. 62)

while the New Earnings Survey shows a fall in the percentage of male workers

covered by collective bargaining from 74% in 1973 to 64% in 1984.

4) Several points of caution here.     First, it is possible for wage structures

to change while wage dispersion remains fixed-- if for instance, high and low

wage industries simply change position.    As wage structures show persistence of

rank order, however, this is not a serious problem.     Second, wage dispersion

could be high but all wages change in concert.     This would show up in different

orderings of countries by dispersion and dispersion of changes.

5) Calculations   in which I sued the same number of industries for all countries

did not alter any of the findings in the table.
                                          23



6) The calculations are based on relating the dispersion figures from the UN

data to the union densities from table    1.   I   made one slight modification   in

the Chalafors and Driffill's ranking, giving Ireland the same ranking as the

UK, while they left out Ireland.

7) Annual hours worked: 2043 in Japan; 1888 in      US.;   1723 in the U.K.; 1678 in

Germany and 1630 in France, according to the OEGD, 1986

8) If labor costs were all of value added, then ln employment would be

perfectly negatively related to in wages, holding ln value added fixed, with a

coefficient   of one.

9) This data set was provided to me by Ms. Dewatripont of the University of

Bruxelles, whose work with V. Ginsberg and Dewatripont reveals a significant

wage-employment    tradeoff in time series analyses of these data for several

European countries, (Ginsberg and Dewatripont, 1987)

10) It is appropriate in cross-country analysis to measure exchange rates and

wages in nominal units as we are comparing changes in rates in one country

relative to those in other countries.

11) 1 find no relation between indices of corporatism or nominal wage

responsiveness    and the outcome measures Crouch and Bruno and Sachs use in their

analyses in the 1979-84 period.
