1     Introduction

The Perry Preschool Program was an early childhood education program conducted at the
Perry Elementary School in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the early 1960s. The evidence from
it is widely cited to support the economic argument for investing in early childhood programs.
    Only disadvantaged children living in adverse circumstances who had low IQ scores and
a low index of family socioeconomic status were eligible to participate in the Perry pro-
gram. Actual participation was determined by a toss of a coin. Beginning at age 3 and
lasting 2 years, treatment consisted of a 2.5-hour preschool program on weekdays during the
school year, supplemented by weekly home visits by teachers. The curriculum was based on
supporting children’s cognitive and socio-emotional development through active learning in
which both teachers and children had major roles in shaping children’s learning. Children
were encouraged to plan, carry out, and reflect on their own activities through a plan-do-
review process. Follow-up interviews were conducted when participants were approximately
15, 19, 27, and 40 years old. At these interviews, participants provided detailed information
about their life-cycle trajectories including schooling, economic activity, marital life, child
rearing, and incarceration. In addition, Perry researchers collected administrative data in
the form of school records, police and court records, and records on welfare participation.
Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfield, and Nores (2005) describe the program and
the available data.
    As the oldest and most cited early childhood intervention, the Perry study serves as a flag-
ship for policy makers advocating public support for early childhood programs. Schweinhart,
Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfield, and Nores (2005) and Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev,
and Yavitz (2010a) describe the program and its outcomes in detail and report substantial
short-term and long-term treatment effects. They report crime reduction as a major benefit.
    However, critics of the Perry program point to the small sample size of the study, the
lack of a substantial long-term effect of the program on IQ, and the absence of statistical



                                               2
significance for many estimated treatment effects.1 Anderson (2008) claims that the program
does not work for boys, although he examines only a subset of its outcomes using arbitrarily
constructed indices of diverse outcomes, and he does not perform a cost-benefit analysis
overall or by gender.2 The existing cost-benefit analyses of the program do little to assuage
these concerns, presenting estimates of rates of returns without standard errors, leaving
readers uncertain as to whether the estimates are statistically significantly different from
zero.3 In response, Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b) present the first
rigorous cost-benefit study of the Perry program that addresses four major challenges: (a) the
compromise inherent in the randomization protocol (see Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev,
and Yavitz, 2010a); (b) the lack of program data past age 40 and the need to extrapolate
out-of-sample to obtain earnings profiles past that age to estimate lifetime impacts of the
program; (c) missing data for participants before to age 40; and (d) the difficulty in assigning
reliable values to nonmarket outcomes, such as crime. The last point is especially relevant
for any analysis of the Perry program because crime reduction is touted as one of its major
benefits. This paper summarizes the main findings from our study. For more detailed
discussion of the results summarized here, see Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz
(2010b).
       Table 1 presents the range of estimates from our preferred methodology, defended in
Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b). It supports separate rates of return
for benefits accruing to individuals versus those that accrue to society at large. Our estimate
of the overall social rate of return to the Perry program is in the range of 7% to 10%. We
report a range of estimates because of uncertainty about some components of benefits and
costs that cannot be quantified by standard errors alone. These estimates are above the
historical return to equity,4 but generally below estimates reported in previous studies.

2     Program Costs and Benefits

We confine our evaluation to the costs and benefits of education, earnings, criminal behavior,
tax payments, and participation in public welfare programs. There are no reliable data on
health outcomes, marital and parental outcomes, the quality of social life, and the like. Our
estimated rate of return likely understates the true rate of return, although we have no direct
evidence on this issue.


Initial Program Cost We use the estimates of initial program costs presented in Bar-
nett (1996), which include both operating costs (teacher salaries and administrative costs)
and capital costs (classrooms and facilities). In undiscounted year-2006 dollars, cost of the
program per child is $17,759.


Education Perry promoted educational attainment through two avenues: total years of
education attained and rates of progression to a given level of education. We estimate
tuition and other pecuniary education costs paid by individuals, as well as additional social
costs incurred by society to educate them. The amount of educational expenditure that the
general public spends will be larger if participants attain more schooling or if they progress
through school less efficiently. We estimate the cost of regular K-12 education, GED, special
education, higher education, and vocational training. Table 2 summarizes the components of
our estimated educational costs. Treated females received less special education, progressed
more quickly through grades, earned higher GPAs, and attained higher levels of education
than their control group counterparts. (For males, however, the impact of the program on
schooling attainment was weak at best.) As a result, society spent comparable amounts of
resources on individuals during their K-12 years regardless of their treatment experience,
albeit for different reasons.


Employment and Earnings To construct lifetime earnings profiles, Heckman, Moon,
Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b) solve two practical problems. First, in the original

                                              4
survey, job histories were determined retrospectively only for a fixed number of previous
job spells. Thus, data on missing spells had to be imputed by econometric techniques.
Second, because the Perry data were not collected after the age-40 interview, it is necessary
to predict earnings profiles beyond this age or else to estimate rates of return through age
40. To impute missing values for ages before the age-40 interview, we use four different
imputation procedures:

   1. We use simple piecewise linear interpolation, based on weighted averages of the nearest
       observed data points around missing values.

   2. We impute missing values using estimated Mincerian earnings functions fit on the
       1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) “low-ability” African American
       subsample born in the same years as the Perry subjects.5

   3. We use a kernel matching method that sorts each Perry subject to similar observations
       in the NLSY79 sample. We match each Perry subject to all observations in the NLSY79
       comparison group sample, but with different weights that depend on the estimated
       kernel function.

   4. We estimate dynamic earnings functions using the method of Hause (1980).

Given the absence of earnings data after age 40, we employ three extrapolation schemes to
extend sample earnings profiles to later ages:

   1. We use March 2002 Current Population Survey (CPS) data to obtain earnings growth
       rates up to age 65. Because it is not possible to extract “low ability” subsamples
       from the CPS that are comparable to the Perry control group, we use CPS age-by-age
       growth rates (rather than levels of earnings) of 3-year moving averages of earnings by
       gender and educational attainment.
   5
    This “low-ability” subsample is selected by initial background characteristics that mimic the eligibility
rules used in the Perry program. NLSY79 is a nationally representative longitudinal survey, whose respon-
dents are almost the same age (birth years 1956–1964) as the Perry sample (birth years 1957–1962). See
Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b).

                                                     5
   2. We use a “low ability” subsample of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). We
         first estimate a random effects model of earnings on the PSID and then use the fitted
         model to extrapolate earnings in Perry data after age 40.

   3. We also use individual parameters from an estimated version of the Hause (1980).

All methods are conservative in that they impose the same earnings structure on the missing
data for treatment and controls.6 The earnings include all types of fringe benefits listed
in Employer Costs for Employee Compensation, a Bureau of Labor Statistics compensation
measure. Table 2 presents the estimated gross earnings for a selected combination of impu-
tation and extrapolation methods. SeeHeckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b)
for further details.


2.1       Criminal Activity

Crime reduction is a major benefit of the Perry program.7 Valuing the effect of this reduction
in terms of costs and benefits is not a trivial issue, given the difficulty of assigning reliable
monetary values to nonmarket outcomes. Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz
(2010b) improve on previous studies (e.g., Belfield, Nores, Barnett, and Schweinhart, 2006)
by exploring the impact of using a variety of assumptions to obtain the benefit-cost ratios.
For each subject, the Perry data provide a full record of arrests, convictions, charges, and
incarcerations for most of adolescence and adulthood obtained from administrative data
sources.8
       The total social cost of a crime can be calculated as a product of the social cost per
unit of crime and the incidence. The empirical challenges of evaluating the cost of crime
are twofold: obtaining a complete lifetime profile of criminal activities for each person and
   6
     All profiles used here incorporate survival rates by age, gender, and education, which are obtained from
National Vital Statistics Reports (National Center for Health Statistics, 2004).
   7
     See, for example, Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang, Barnett, Belfield, and Nores (2005) and Heckman, Moon,
Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010a).
   8
     The earliest records cover ages 8–39 and that of the oldest covers ages 13–44.



                                                     6
assigning relevant monetary value to each type of criminal activity. It is difficult to obtain
complete lifetime crime profiles because we do not directly observe each person’s participation
in criminal activity. Instead, we only observe arrests from police records. To fill the gap
between the actual level of crime and arrests, we combine three data sets: (a) the Uniform
Crime Report (UCR), which provides arrest rates by gender, race, and age for each year;
(b) the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which is a nationally representative
household-level data set on criminal victimization that provides information on unreported
crime levels across the United States; and (c) Perry crime records. From the first two
data sources, we can compute the ratio of the true incidence level to the total arrests for
each type of crime; by multiplying this ratio by the number of arrests of each subject in
the Perry data and summing them over crime types and subjects, we compute the true
incidence level. To assign relevant monetary values to criminal activities, we compute the
unit cost of each type of crime, which is broken down into two components — victimization
costs and criminal justice system costs — using estimates in existing literatures as well as
various data sources such as Expenditure and Employment data for the Criminal Justice
System (CJEE).9 Different types of crime are associated with different unit costs. Table 2
summarizes our estimated social costs of crime.
      Our approach differs from that used by Belfield, Nores, Barnett, and Schweinhart (2006)
in several respects. First, in estimating victimization-to-arrest ratios, police and court costs,
and correctional costs, we use local data rather than national figures. Second, we use two
different values of the victim cost of murder: an estimate of “the statistical value of life”
($4.1 million) and an estimate of assault victim cost ($13,000). We report separate rates
of return for each estimate. Third, we assume that there are no victim costs associated
with “driving misdemeanors” and “drug-related crimes.” Whereas previous studies have
assigned nontrivial victim costs to these types of crimes, we consider them to be “victimless.”
However, because such crimes could be the proximal causes of victimizations, we separately
  9
      See Anderson (1999) and Cohen (2005).



                                               7
account for any crimes with victims that result from initially victimless crimes. Our approach
results in a substantial decrease of crime cost compared to the cost of crime used in previous
studies because victimless crimes account for more than 30% of all crime reported in the
Perry study.


2.2       Tax Payments and Welfare Dependence

Taxes are transfers from the taxpayer to the rest of society and represent benefits to recipients
that reduce the welfare of the taxed unless services are received in return. Conversely, higher
earnings translate into higher absolute amounts of income tax payments (and consumption
tax payments) that are beneficial to the general public, excluding program participants.
Although there have been changes in U.S. income tax rates over the period covered by this
evaluation, in our work we simplify the calculation by applying a 15% individual tax rate
and 7.5% FICA tax rate to each subject’s taxable earnings for each year. Belfield, Nores,
Barnett, and Schweinhart (2006) use the employer’s share of FICA tax in addition to these
two components in computing the benefit to the general public, but we do not because a
recent consensus among economists is that “the employer’s share of payroll taxes is passed
on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid.”10 (Congressional
Budget Office, 2007, p. 3).
       Differentials in the use of welfare are another important source of benefits from the Perry
program. We distinguish transfers, which benefit one group in the society at the expense of
another, from the costs associated with making such transfers. Only the latter should be
counted in computing gains to society as a whole. Because of data limitations, we adopt
the following method to estimate full lifetime profiles of welfare receipt.11 First, we use
the NLSY79 and PSID comparison samples to impute the amount received from various
cash assistance and food stamp programs in a fashion similar to our method for earnings
  10
     The Perry data do not provide enough information about receipt of various in-kind transfer programs.
Even for cash assistance programs, we do not have complete lifetime profiles of cash transfers for each
individual.
  11
     See Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b) for further discussion.

                                                   8
imputation and extrapolation. Second, to account for in-kind transfers, we employ the Survey
of Income and Program Participation data to calculate the probability of participating in
specific in-kind transfer programs for a “less-educated” Black population and then convert
it to monetary values using the estimates of Moffitt (2003) for real public expenditures on
welfare programs. Table 2 summarizes our estimated profiles of welfare use. For society, each
dollar of welfare involves administrative costs. Based on Michigan state data, Belfield, Nores,
Barnett, and Schweinhart (2006) estimate a cost to society of 38 cents for every dollar of
welfare disbursed. We use this estimate to calculate the cost of welfare programs to society.



3     Internal Rates of Return and Benefit-to-Cost Ratios

We calculate internal rates of return and benefit-to-cost ratios for the Perry program under
various assumptions and estimation methods. We compute the associated standard errors
in three steps. In the first step, we use the bootstrap to simultaneously draw samples
from Perry and other nonexperimental comparison data sets (such as the NLSY79 and the
PSID). For each replication, we reestimate all parameters used to impute missing value and
recompute all components used in the construction of lifetime profiles. In this process, all
components of earnings whose computations do not depend on the comparison group data
are also recomputed (e.g., social cost of crime, educational expenditure, etc.) because the
replicated sample consists of randomly drawn Perry participants. In the second step, we
adjust all imputed values for prediction errors by plugging in an error term that is randomly
drawn from comparison group data in a Monte Carlo resampling procedure. Combining these
two steps allows us to account for both estimation errors and prediction errors. Finally, we
compute point estimates of internal rates of return (IRRs) and benefit-to-cost ratios for each
replication to obtain bootstrapped standard errors.
    Tables 1 and 3 show estimated IRRs and associated standard errors computed using
various methods for estimating earnings profiles and crime costs under various assumptions



                                              9
about the deadweight cost of taxation. We first set the victim cost associated with a murder
at $4.1 million, which includes the statistical value of life (column labeled “High”), and then
at $13,000, which is set to the victim cost of assault to avoid the problem that a single
murder might dominate the evaluation (columns labeled “Low”). To gauge the sensitivity of
estimated returns to the way crimes are categorized, we compare results from two aggregation
schemes: “Separated” and “Property versus Violent Crimes.”12 The estimates reported in
these tables account for the deadweight costs of taxation: dollars of welfare loss per tax
dollar. For comparison purposes, we select the the kernel matching imputation and PSID
projection of missing earnings in Table 1. Our estimates are robust to the choice of alternative
extrapolation/interpolation procedures. Because, as documented by Heckman, Moon, Pinto,
Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010a), the randomization protocol implemented in the Perry program
is somewhat problematic, we adjust all lifetime cost and benefit streams for the compromise
in randomization by conditioning them on relevant pre-program variables. This is a form of
matching.
      The estimated rates of return reported in Table 3 are comparable for all of the imputation
and extrapolation schemes. Alternative assumptions about the victim cost of murder affect
the estimated rates of return in a counterintuitive fashion. Assigning a high number to the
value of a life lowers the estimated rate of return because the one murder committed by a
treatment group male occurs earlier than the two committed by males in the control group.
The rates of return are not very sensitive to the crime categorization method, as shown by
comparison of the last two sets of columns. Adjusting for deadweight losses of taxes lowers
the rate of return to the program. Our estimates of the overall rate of return hover in the
range of 7% to 10%, and they are statistically significantly different from zero in most cases.
      The estimated benefit-to-cost ratios under different discount rates presented in Tables
1 and 4 generally support the rate of return analysis and are substantial for discount rates
commonly used in the literature (3% to 5%).13 Further, as shown in Table 4, a considerable
 12
      See Heckman, Moon, Pinto, Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b) for further discussion.
 13
      Note, however, that the higher the assumed value of victim life, the higher the benefit-cost ratio. This


                                                      10
portion of benefits is due to crime reduction. Sensitivity analysis establishes that (a) ex-
cluding some outliers whose educational attainments are exceptionally high has only modest
effects on the estimated IRRs, (b) excluding “hard-core” criminal offenders increases the
estimated social IRRs obtained from the pooled sample and strengthens the precision of the
estimates, and (c) accounting for local costs instead of relying on national figures increases
estimated IRRs, given that criminal justice system costs for Michigan are higher than the
corresponding national estimates. When we evaluate the Perry program only through age 40
to avoid uncertainty associated with extrapolation, rates of return and benefit-to-cost ratios
fall somewhat, but still remain substantially above the historical rate of return to equity and
are precisely determined (Heckman et al., 2010b). A complete analysis of the rate of return
to the Perry program under various assumptions can be found in our source paper.



4     Conclusion

This paper summarizes the main results from our previous work on estimating the rate of
return to the Perry Preschool Program (Heckman et al., 2010b). We account for locally de-
termined costs, missing data, the deadweight costs of taxation, and the value of nonmarket
benefits and costs. Our analysis improves on previous estimates by accounting for compro-
mise in the randomization protocol, by developing standard errors for the estimates, and
by exploring the sensitivity of estimates to alternative assumptions about missing data and
the value of nonmarket benefits. Our estimates are also robust to a variety of alternative
assumptions about interpolation, extrapolation, and deadweight losses. In most cases, they
are statistically significantly different from zero. This is true for both males and females.
In general, the estimated rates of return are above the historical return to equity of about
5.8% but well below previous estimates reported in the literature. Our benefit-to-cost ratio
estimates support the rate of return analysis. Benefits from improvements in health and
occurs because the discount rates in the benefit-to-cost analyses are lower than the discount rates produced
by the IRR analysis. Timing of crime matters less in the benefit-cost analysis. See Heckman, Moon, Pinto,
Savelyev, and Yavitz (2010b).

the well-being of future generations are not estimated due to data limitations. Our analysis
likely provides a lower-bound on the true rate of return to the Perry Preschool Program.

Notes: Kernel matching is used to impute missing values for earnings before age‐40, and PSID projection for extrapolation of later earnings. In calculating benefit‐to‐
cost ratios, the deadweight loss of taxation is assumed to be 50%. Nine separated types of crime are used to estimate the social cost of crime. Standard errors in
parentheses are calculated by Monte Carlo resampling of prediction errors and bootstrapping. Lifetime net benefit streams are adjusted for compromised
randomization. (a) “High” murder cost accounts for statistical value of life, while “Low” does not; (b) Deadweight cost is dollars of welfare loss per tax dollar; (c) The
sum of returns to program participants and the general public; (d) “All” is computed from an average of the profiles of the pooled sample, and may be lower or higher
than the profiles for each gender group.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses are calculated by Monte Carlo resampling of prediction errors and bootstrapping. All estimates are adjusted
for compromised randomization. All available local data and the full sample are used unless otherwise noted. (a) A ratio of victimization rate (from
the NCVS) to arrest rate (from the UCR), where “Property vs. Violent"                        uses common ratios based on a crime being either violent or property and
“Separated" does not; (b) “High" murder cos t valuation accounts for statistical value of life, while “Low" does not; (c) The “All" IRR represents an
average of the profiles of a pooled sample of males and females, and may be lower or higher than the profiles for each gender group; (d) Piecewise
linear interpolation between each pair reported; (e) Cross‐sectional regression imputation using a cross‐sectional earnings estimation from the
NLSY79 black low‐ability subsample. (f) Kernel‐matching imputation matches each Perry subject to the NLSY79 sample based on earnings, job spell
durations, and background variables; (g) Based on the Hause (1980) earnings model.

Notes: The categories "Crime" and "Other Outcomes" sum up to the "All. Standard errors in parentheses are calculated by Monte Carlo resampling of prediction

errors and bootstrapping. The percentages reported are the contributions of each component. Kernel matching is used to impute missing values in earnings before

age‐40, and PSID projection for extrapolation of later earnings. In calculating benefit‐to‐cost ratios, deadweight loss of taxation is assumed at 50%. Lifetime net

benefit streams are adjusted for corrupted randomization by being conditioned on unbalanced pre‐program variables.
