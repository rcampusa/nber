The Nexus of Social Security Benefits, Health, and Wealth at Death

                                              ABSTRACT

Social Security benefits are the most important component of the income of a large fraction of older
Americans. A significant fraction of persons approach the end of life with few financial assets and
no home equity, relying almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support. Whether persons reach
late-life with positive non-annuity wealth depends importantly on health, which is quite persistent
over the life-time. Persons in poor health in old age have a higher-than-average probability of having
experienced low earnings while in the labor force, which puts them at greater risk of having low Social
Security benefits in retirement. While the progressivity of the Social Security benefit formula provides
a safety net to support low-wage workers in retirement, a noticeable fraction of persons, especially
those in single-person households, still have income below the poverty level in their last years of life.
Many of these individuals have few assets to draw on to supplement their income, and are in poor
health. In general, low assets and low income in old age are strongly related to poor health. We explore
this nexus and describe the relationship between Social Security benefits and the exhaustion of non-annuity
assets near the end of life. We examine the relationship between the drawdown of assets between
the first year an individual is observed in the AHEAD data (1995) and the last year that individualis
observed before death, and that individual's health, Social Security benefits, and other annuity benefits.
We conclude that Social Security and defined benefit pension benefits are strongly “protective” of
non-annuity assets, with a negative relationship between these income flows and the likelihood of
exhausting non-annuity assets. We note that this result may in part reflect population heterogeneity
in saving propensities. We also find that poor health is an important determinant of the drawdown
of non-annuity wealth.

       The three legged stool representing employer-provided pensions, private
saving, and Social Security benefits is commonly used to describe support in
retirement. However, a large fraction of retirees balance on only one leg, Social
Security, and those balancing on this single leg are also in the poorest health.
Poterba, Venti, and Wise (hereafter PVW) (2012a) find that 40 percent of all
persons approach their last year of life with less than $20,000 in annuity income
and less than $10,000 in financial assets. Individuals in this group rely primarily
on Social Security; for some, this income is supplemented by defined benefit
pension benefits. Sixty-eight percent of those in this group also have no housing
wealth, and they are also on average in much poorer health that persons with
higher levels of income and liquid assets. This raises the concern that adverse
health events in old age may lead individuals to exhaust their assets.
       We estimate how the drawdown of non-annuity wealth in the years
preceding death is related to the receipt of Social Security benefits, defined
pension benefits, and the level and change in health in the last years of life. In
particular, we want to know whether Social Security income is protective of non-
annuity assets. Are persons with more Social Security income able to cover
health and other expenses with less need to drawdown savings? Our analysis is
based on the drawdown of the non-annuity assets of persons in the Asset and
Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) cohort of the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS). We observe these persons from 1995 until their death.
A large proportion of this cohort died between 1995 and the latest available
survey wave in 2010.

       The analysis of the post-retirement evolution of non-annuity wealth also
helps to fill a gap in what we know about income that older Americans draw from
accumulated assets. Using the three legged stool metaphor again, households
may draw support in retirement from Social Security benefits, employer-provided
pensions, income from accumulated assets, and by drawing down their asset
holdings. Income from Social Security benefits and annuity income from the
second leg—principally defined benefit (DB) pensions—are accurately measured
in surveys such as the HRS. Some income flows from assets, such as interest
and dividends, are well-measured, but the accruing value of capital gains is likely
to be measured with substantial error. Moreover, it is often difficult to measure
the drawdown of assets that households use to supplement their other sources of
support. This includes withdrawals from tax-deferred personal retirement
accounts (PRAs) such as IRAs and 401(k)s, which are becoming increasingly
important for recent retirees. Fisher (2007) and Anguelov, Iams and Purcell
(2012) provide summary information on these withdrawals. Households may
draw on these asset reserves to bridge the gap whenever expenditures—
particularly unanticipated expenditures—exceed annuity income.

       In this paper, we examine how the rate of asset spend-down is related to
health and on the presence of other sources of income. By considering income
from Social Security and DB pensions jointly with changes in asset stocks, we
hope to develop a more complete picture of the financial resources available to


                                         2
the elderly. We are also interested in the association between health status and
these other variables.

        The analysis is based on wave-to-wave changes in the assets of AHEAD
households. For persons with the same level of assets in a particular wave, we
ask how the level of assets in the next wave depends on the initial level of health,
the change in health between the waves and the receipt of annuity income. We
estimate how the level of assets in each wave is related to annuity income and
health, given the level of assets in the prior wave. The links between health
events and asset drawdown have been explored in a number of earlier studies.
Smith(1999, 2004, 2005) and Coile and Milligan (2009) are notable contributions.
In PVW (2010), we estimated the total cost of poor health by examining the
association between poor health and the rate of change of wealth in retirement.
In this paper, we examine how annuitized income streams from Social Secuirty
and DB pensions affect this association.

       The paper is divided into four sections. Section 1 describes the data that
underlies the empirical analysis and explains briefly the health index that is a key
component of the analysis. Section 2 presents descriptive data on the trajectory
of assets during the retirement years. Section 3 reports our empirical results.
Section 4 concludes and suggests several directions for further work.

Section 1. The Data and Health Index

        The AHEAD Survey: The analysis is based on data from the Asset and
Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) survey of households that
contained a person age 70 or older in 1993. These households were resurveyed
again in 1995 and in every other year beginning in 1998 through 2010. In 1995
the AHEAD sample became one of several cohorts in the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). The AHEAD collects detailed information on household structure,
sources of income, and assets. Because these households were at an advanced
age when first surveyed in 1993, a large number of original respondents had died
by 2010. This analysis focuses primarily on assets and income in the last survey
wave prior to the wave in which a respondent is known to be deceased. We refer
to this wave as the “last year observed” (LYO). Given the two-year spacing of
waves (after 1998) in the AHEAD, the LYO will be within two years of the date of
death. Persons who leave the sample, but are not known to have died, are
excluded from the analysis.

       The AHEAD respondents were first interviewed in 1993. However the
data for 1993 are excluded from this analysis for two reasons. First, as
Rohwedder, Haider and Hurd (2006) explain, financial assets were under-
reported in 1993. Second, several of the key variables that we use to construct a
health index were not included in the 1993 survey instrument. Our analysis
therefore uses data for 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. All
asset and income amounts are converted to 2010 dollars using the CPI-U.



                                         3
         The unit of observation is the person. All income and asset amounts
associated with the person are for the household. To structure the analysis we
will first divide the AHEAD respondents into three groups defined by family status
when first observed in 1993 and family status in the last year observed before
death. These family "pathway" groups are: (1) persons in one-person
households in 1993 that remain one-person households until last observed, (2)
persons in two-person households in 1993 whose spouse is deceased in the last
year observed before the person’s death, and (3) persons in two-person
households in 1993 whose spouse is alive when the person is last observed.1
We often refer to the second group as “two-to-one” households (the number of
persons in the household in 1995 and the number in the LYO) and to the third
group as “two-to-two” households. Most analyses are performed separately for
each of these family “pathway” groups.

        The Health Index: We use an index of health based on the first principal
component of responses to 27 health-related questions contained in the AHEAD.
These questions asked about functional limitations, the presence of health
conditions and other indicators of overall health. The list of questions used to
construct the index and a discussion of the general properties of earlier versions
of the index are reported in PVW (2010, 2012b). The index used here is based
on all respondents in all cohorts in the HRS between 1992 and 2010 with the
exception of the 1993 AHEAD cohort. Initial analysis revealed that principal
component loadings were stable over time and similar for men and women, so
we have pooled waves and combined men and women. For each respondent a
raw health score is obtained from the principal component loadings and the raw
scores have been converted to percentiles (1 to 100). Thus a value of the health
index of 25 implies that a person’s health is at the 25th percentile of all HRS
respondents in all years. The index has several important properties, which are
summarized in more detail in PVW (2012b): 1) it is strongly related to the
drawdown of assets as shown in our previous work, 2) it is stable over time--the
weights given to each of the health variables vary very little as persons age, 3) it
is strongly related to mortality, 4) it is strongly predictive of future health events
such as stroke and the onset of diabetes, 5) it is strongly related to economic
outcomes prior to retirement as well as to post-retirement outcomes. Figure 1-1
shows the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of health by age. In reporting results
below we often refer to the effect of a 10 percentile point change in health. We
can see in Figure 1-1 that 10 percentile points covers a much greater portion of
the total range in health for the oldest persons. For example, the difference
between the health index value for the individual in the 10th percentile of all 72-
year olds, and the value of that index for the individual in the 90th percentile at
age 72, is about 73 percentile points. The comparable difference is about 49
percentile points at age 90.

 A fourth group, persons in one-person households in 1993 who later married, is excluded from
the analysis because sample sizes are too small for meaningful analysis.

Section 2. Descriptive Findings

           To motivate our descriptive analysis of wealth trajectories, health, and
income flows, Figure 2-1 illustrates the potential pathways through which poor
health can affect wealth at older ages. The schematic suggests two potential
                                                             pathways between poor health
                                                             and post-retirement asset

retirement and (2) low pre-retirement earnings reduce the level of Social Security
and private pension annuities paid after retirement. We are particularly
interested in how the drawdown of non-annuity assets and the level of non-
annuity assets at death are related to health status and to Social Security
benefits

       Trends in Wealth from 1993 to the Last Year Observed: Several figures
and tables help to motivate the analysis. Figure 2-2 shows the evolution of non-
annuity wealth (primarily housing and other real estate, financial assets and PRA
balances) by last year observed (LYO) for each of the three family pathways.
The last point plotted in each segment identifies the last year observed. Persons
for whom the last year observed is 2006 or earlier died between the 2006 and
2008 waves; if the last year observed is 2010 (the "top" segment in each family
pathway group) then the person is still alive in 2010 which is the last year for
which data are available. Most waves in the AHEAD are spaced two years apart,
with the exception of a three year gap between the 1995 and 1998 waves. Thus
for persons who have a last year observed before 2010, the last observation may
be up to two years before the actual date of death (or three years if the last year
observed is 1995.) The estimation procedure discussed below essentially
estimates how these trends for individuals are related to health and annuity
income.


                     Figure 2-2. Median non-annuity wealth by family

      Two features of Figure 2-2 stand out. First the non-annuity wealth of
persons in the single-person pathway is much lower than the comparable wealth


                                           6
of persons in the two-to-one person pathway, who in turn have much lower
wealth than persons in the two-to-two person pathway. Second, there is a strong
negative correlation between non-annuity wealth in 1993 and subsequent
mortality. Within each pathway, persons who began the period with higher
wealth live longer. In each pathway group, the non-annuity wealth of persons
who survive the longest is at least twice as large as the wealth of persons with
the highest mortality. This is a startling illustration of the relationship between
wealth and mortality noted by others, including Smith (1999, 2004, 2005), Adams
et. al. (2003), Wu (2003), Michaud and van Soest (2008), Case and Deaton
(2009), Attanasio (2003), and Hurd, McFadden, and Merrill (2001). Both of these
features of the data are also evident in profiles constructed for total wealth and
for each of the other asset categories reported in PVW (2012a).

       Figure 2-3 shows median Social Security income by family pathway. The
figure shows that for persons in one-person and two-to-two person households
there is little difference in Social Security income as persons age. But for the
persons who transition from two- to one-person households, meaning that they
outlived their spouses, there is a substantial decline in Social Security income
with age. This presumably reflects the shift in many cases from two beneficiaries
to one beneficiary.

      Figure 2-4 shows the evolution of home equity. For one-person
households the data show a very sharp decline in median home equity beginning


                                             7
two or three years before death. Indeed for each LYO, median home equity in
the wave prior to death was zero for all but those whose LYO was 1993. For
original two-person households with the spouse deceased at the LYO, a sharp
decline near the end of life is also apparent, although the median at death is zero
only for those whose LYO was 2002 or 2004. For original two-person
households with the spouse alive at the LYO, there is a decline in home equity in
the year or two before death, but it is more modest than that for the previous two
groups. Home equity declines relatively little in prior years for this group. The
results are consistent with the findings of Venti and Wise (2002, 2004) who
emphasize that home equity tends to be husbanded until a precipitating shock
such as entry to a nursing home or death of a spouse.

        Non-Annuity Assets and LYO: Figure 2-5 shows the median of home
equity and financial assets (PRA assets and financial assets held outside of tax-
deferred accounts) in 1995 by LYO and by pathway. The key feature of the
figures is that persons with the greatest total non-annuity assets in1995 tend to
live the longest, especially persons in one-to-one and in two-to-two households.
The median for a third component—“other” non-annuity assets (mostly business
assets, trusts, and vehicles)—is zero for each LYO for all pathways. The means
of total non-annuity assets in 1995 (not shown) are not as strongly related to
longevity and the mean of the “other” component is positive for all LYO and for
each of the pathways.

       The Distribution of the Change in Non-Annuity Wealth between 1995 and
the LYO: Figure 2-2 above shows the median decline in non-annuity assets by
family pathway. The median does not capture, however, the substantial diversity
in the decline which our analysis relies on. Table 2-1 shows the distribution of
non-annuity asset change between 1995 and the LYO (the beginning and end
points for each profile shown in Figure 2-2), showing selected percentile
changes—10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 For original singles, the median change is
negative in all LYO. But for each LYO, the difference between the 30th and the
70th percentiles and especially between the 10th and the 90th percentiles is quite
large. The difference between the 10th and 90th percentiles in particular may be
affected substantially by the misreporting of asset balances discussed in detail in
Venti (2011).

       Note: Persons whose LYO is 2010 are still alive when last observed.

Figure 2-2 shows that the median decline in assets is largest for persons who
were originally married but were predeceased by their spouse. The values for
this group are shown in the second panel of the Table 2-1. The large decline for
many persons in this pathway, as well as the wide range in the changes, is again
especially evident in the 10th and 30th and the 70th and 90th percentiles. The
bottom panel shows the median decline in assets for persons who were originally
married and whose spouse was alive when they died. The median change is
zero for the 2000 LYO and positive for the 2002 LYO. For other LYOs the
medians are negative, but smaller than for the pathway shown in the middle
panel.

       The summary statistics in Table 2-1 suggest that the median change in
assets between 1995 and the LYO is rather modest but there is enormous
heterogeneity. For some the drawdown of non-annuity assets is very large; for
other the increase in these assets is very large.

       The Distribution of the Percent Change in Non-Annuity Wealth between
1995 and the LYO: Table 2-2 shows the percentile distribution of the percentage
change in non-annuity assets between 1995 and the LYO. While the median
dollar declines in the singles group were small, the percentage declines are
much larger, between 10 and 67 percent. That is, many persons in this group
had very low non-annuity assets in 1995 and thus small dollar declines


                                          11
corresponded to large proportional declines. The median percent changes are
smallest for persons in original two-person households whose spouse was still
alive at their death. Thus, while we find modest median dollar drawdown in non-
annuity assets for persons in single-person and in two-to-one households, we
find that the median percent drawdown in these households is large. As with the
dollar drawdown, there is enormous heterogeneity, with the drawdown as much
as 100 percent for some and the addition to non-annuity assets well over 100
percent for others. For two-person households the median percent change is
small. But again there is enormous heterogeneity.

        Table 2-2 provides information that bears on the long-standing question of
whether households draw-down assets in retirement as the lifecycle hypothesis
predicts. The results demonstrate that for each sub-group of the population,
more than half of the households draw down assets by a substantial percentage,
but that more than a quarter of the households seem to draw down assets by
very little, or to accumulate assets, as they age.

        The Distribution of Non-annuity Assets in the LYO: Table 2-3 shows the
distribution of the level of non-annuity assets in the LYO (in $000’s). Among
original singles over 40 percent have less than $40,000 in non-annuity assets in
the last year observed before death—the 40th percentile ranges from $2,000 to
$38,000 depending on the LYO (persons for whom the LYO is 2010 are excluded
from this and subsequent calculations because these persons are still living
when last observed). Among persons in two-to-one households at least 30
percent have less than $40,000 in the LYO. But even in these pathways a large
fraction of persons have substantial wealth in the LYO. Fewer persons in two-
to-two households have little non-annuity wealth in the LYO and a large fraction
has substantial wealth in the LYO. Over all pathways combined at least 30
percent have wealth less than $40,000 in the LYO. This amount ranges from
$5,000 to $39,000 depending on the LYO. The table shows that while a large
fraction of households have little or no wealth at retirement, a large fraction also
have a great deal of wealth and indeed many households increased their wealth
between 1995 and the LYO.

       Health and the Change in Non-Annuity Assets between 1995 and the
LYO: Table 2-4 shows the relationship between health and the decline in non-
annuity assets between 1995 and the LYO for single persons. Survivors - those
whose LYO is 2010 - are excluded from the table. To facilitate health
comparisons we have allocated persons to three health terciles based on the
value of their health index in 1995. Over all age groups combined the decline
was -68.3 percent for those in the lowest health tercile, -42.6 percent for those in
the middle health tercile, and -22.9 for those in the third (best) health tercile. A
similar trend holds for each of the age intervals.

       Comparable information for persons in two-to-one and continuing two-
person households are shown in Tables 2-5 and 2-6 respectively. In each of
these pathways the health effects are also noticeable—for persons in the two-to-
one pathway the decline is -52.4 percent for persons in the lowest health tercile
versus-43.6 percent for persons in the highest; for persons in the two-to-one
person pathway the decline is -7.4 percent for persons in the worst health tercile
versus +9.2 percent for persons in the best. In percentage terms the difference
is greatest for persons in the two-to-one person pathway.

Section 3. Regression Models for Asset Evolution

       The goal of our analysis is to determine the relationship between the post-
retirement evolution of non-annuity assets and the health and the income flows of
persons at advanced ages. We do this by estimating regression models in which
assets in a given wave are explained by assets in the previous wave, as well as
key health and income variables:

(1) Aw = k + λ*Aw-1 + α*Hw-1 + β*∆Hw.w-1 + a*SSw + b*DBw + c*Earnw + m*Mw + εw

In this equation, where the subscript w denotes wave, Aw denotes the level of
assets, λ is the marginal effect of an additional dollar of assets in wave w-1, given
the other covariates, on assets in wave w. Hw-1 and ∆Hw.w-1 denote the level of
health in the previous wave and the change in health since the last wave
respectively. Higher levels of Hw-1 and ∆Hw.w-1 are expected to reduce the need to
rely on assets to finance health care needs and thus are likely to be associated
with a positive change in assets. Higher levels of Social Security benefits SSw
and DB annuity income DBw are also expected to be positively associated with
asset change, given the level of assets in the previous wave, since persons with
greater income should be able to cover the cost of health-related and other
expenses with less need to draw down their accumulated assets. Mw is an
indicator of expected lifespan, which we discuss below. We also include year
effects (not shown in the equation) that we interpret as controlling for differences
in market returns across years. In PVW (2012b), we use a specification similar
to equation (1) to investigate how education is related to the evolution of late-life
asset holdings for households in the HRS.

        One interesting feature of our data set and the specification in (1) is that
real Social Security benefits are "fixed" at the date of first receipt for single-
person households. Thus these benefits vary across households, but not over
time for the same household, as shown by the flat profiles for continuously single
and continuously married individuals in Figure 2-3. DB pension benefits are only
partially indexed and thus real benefits will vary over time.

       Baseline Estimates: Our baseline estimates of equation (1) are shown in
Table 3-1. We focus on persons in AHEAD in the three family pathway groups
defined using marital status in 1995 and marital status in the last year observed.
We restrict the sample to persons who are known to be deceased and thus
exclude all persons whose last year observed is 2010 (survivors). As noted
above, there is substantial measurement error in assets. To minimize the effect
of misreported asset values we trim the sample by running a first stage model
and then excluding observations with residuals in the top or bottom one percent.
Because lagged assets are likely to be measured with error, the coefficient on
lagged assets (λ) may be biased toward zero and the coefficients on other
variables, such as SS and DB, may be biased to the extent that these variables
are correlated with the “true” value of lagged assets.



                                         16
       The best way to address this measurement error problem would be to find
instrumental variables that are correlated with “true” lagged assets but can be
excluded from the model for current assets. We are not convinced that the
exclusion restrictions needed for such a strategy would be defensible. We
therefore present the results from trimmed GLS estimation of (1), and then
discuss several ways to evaluate the possibility that measurement error in lagged
assets is leading to biased estimates on the SS and DB coefficients.

        Several findings are noteworthy. First, the age effect is small and not
significantly different from zero for the first two pathways. Thus holding income
and health constant, there is little evidence of purely age-related asset
drawdown. However, the age effect is -$4,199 and statistically significant for
persons in original two-person households whose spouse is alive at their death.



                                        17
Second, the health variables and the annuity income variables are large and
statistically significant. Figure 3-1 graphs the effect of a 10 percentile point
increase in the level of health in the previous wave, a 10 percentile point change
in health since the previous wave, a $5,000 increase in Social Security benefits,
and a $5,000 increase in DB benefits on non-annuity assets. Each of the effects
is large for each family pathway group, but is lower for single persons than for the
other two family pathway groups, presumably because single persons have the
lowest levels of non-annuity assets. The relationship between a 10 percentile
point increment in lagged health and non-annuity wealth is over $6,000 for single
persons, about $12,000 for persons originally in two-person households whose
spouse predeceased them, and over $14,000 for persons originally in two-person
households and whose spouse survives them. The relationship between a 10
percentile point increment in the change in health and non-annuity wealth,
ranges from over $4,000 for single persons to over $17,000 for persons originally
in two-person households and whose spouse survives them. The relationship
between non-annuity wealth and a $5,000 increment in Social Security benefits is
about $12,000 for single persons, $29,000 for persons in original two-person
households whose spouse was predeceased, and $21,000 for persons in original
two-person households whose survives them. The relationship between non-
annuity wealth and a $5,000 increment in DB pension benefits ranges from about
$9,000 in single-person households to over $18,000 for persons in original two-
person households whose spouse was predeceased them. This suggests that
both Social Security income and DB income are "protective" of non-annuity
wealth, while poor health is an important determinant of the drawdown of non-
annuity wealth.

       We have explored in some detail the concern that assets are measured with
error. Our use of a trimmed sample (we trim the top and bottom one percent
based on residuals of a preliminary regression) is an attempt to address this
potential problem. Indeed, estimates based on untrimmed data show
substantially lower coefficients on lagged assets and larger coefficients on SS
and DB. Additional trimming however—as much as the top and bottom 3 percent
of asset values and based on different methods of trimming—has very little effect
on either the estimated coefficients on lagged assets or on the estimated
coefficients of the SS or DB variables. In addition estimates based on a similar
specification used in Poterba, Venti, and Wise (forthcoming), which imputes a
rate of return to lagged assets based on individual attributes, yields essentially
the same results as those reported in Table 3-1. The importance of this
comparison is that the estimates on lagged assets in the earlier paper are in the
0.8 to 1.1 range. Whatever the extent of errors in variables, it is essentially the
same in the datasets used in the two papers. The sample underlying Table 3-1
is all AHEAD respondents who die by 2010, while that in Poterba, Venti, and
Wise (forthcoming) is all persons over the age of 65 in all cohorts of the HRS.

      We have also obtained median regression estimates comparable to the
estimates shown in Table 3-1. As expected, the estimates on health and annuity



                                        18
income are all smaller than the linear regression estimates—the largest is just
over 2—but the median regression estimates on lagged assets are little different
from the linear regression estimates. This finding suggests that while there may
well be measurement error in lagged assets, this measurement error is not the
primary reason for the large coefficients on SS and DB.

      The size of the coefficients on both SS and DB suggest not only that the
receipt of these annuitized income streams may help to avoid the draw-down of
financial assets, but also that they may be correlated with other income streams
or with an unobserved household propensity to save. Consider the coefficient on
SS income for a married couple with both spouses still alive (coefficient 4.13) and
with only one member of the couple still living (coefficient 5.83). Recall that the
typical time period between two waves of the HRS is two years, so additional
income of $1000 per year would imply $2000 of total payments between waves.
If the individual saved all of the income from Social Security, the resulting
coefficient would be somewhat larger than 2.0. The estimated coefficients more
than twice this size raises the concern of omitted variables that are correlated
with the SS variable. In the standard omitted variable setting, the estimated
coefficient on SS in part reflects these omitted variable influences.

      We suspect that the coefficient values on SS and DB in part reflect a
correlation between these variables and unobserved individual attributes that
affect the propensity to accumulate assets in retirement. As the descriptive
Tables 2-1 to 2-3 show, many households increase assets substantially from
wave to wave, even after retirement. These households tend to be those with
substantial assets, and also to be those with high lifetime earnings and large SS
benefits. If characteristics that permitted long, high-income labor market careers
are correlated with individual attributes that persist over time, and that are related
to late-life wealth accumulation behavior, then the cross-sectional variation in SS
benefits that underlies our estimates will in part capture this variation in
unobserved individual attributes, perhaps saving behavior that persists into old
age but is not determined by Social Security benefits. This makes it difficult to
interpret the coefficient estimate as purely a "protective effect" of Social Security
income on assets. This issue merits further analysis.

       Subjective Mortality: Life cycle theory suggests that all else equal, those
who expect to have long lives will spend down assets more slowly that those who
expect to live shorter lives. The next set of regressions adds a measure of the
self-reported survival probability to the specification used in Table 3-1. The
subjective probability measure is the ratio of the probability that the respondent
expects to live 10 more years divided by probability that the respondent will live
10 more years based on the life table values for a person of the same age and
gender. Unfortunately, the subjective probability of survival is only available for
some respondents in most years and is not available for anyone in 1998. Thus
the sample used in these regressions is smaller than that used in Table 3-1. The
reduction in the sample due to each of these reasons is described in Table 3-2.
Between 43 and 62 percent of the sample are missing the survivor probability
variable and are thus excluded from the sample used to obtain the estimates in
Table 3-1.

        The estimation results are shown in Table 3-3. First, the estimated
coefficients on the age, health, and income variables are in some cases very
different from the estimates based on the full sample. This is perhaps not
surprising given that 62 percent of the observations on singles, 43 percent for the
second pathway, and 48 percent for the third pathway are excluded as the result
of missing data. Because of the apparent non-randomness of the missing
observations, perhaps limited credence should be put in these results.
Nonetheless, the estimated subjective probability coefficient is statistically
insignificantly different from zero in each of the three pathways. It appears
though that the restricted sample used in Table 3-3 makes it difficult to draw
conclusions about the role of subjective life expectancy in contributing to asset
draw-down. However, a similar specification was used in PVW(2012b) but
estimation was based on all HRS cohorts. That analysis was not affected to the
same extent by missing responses to the subject survival questions. The results
also showed no statistically significant effect of the subjective probability of
survival on assets.

Section 4. Conclusions and Future Directions

       Our analysis of asset drawdown at the end of life suggests that the
median change in assets between 1995 and the last year observed (LYO) is
rather modest, but that for more than half of households, assets when last
observed are below those in the early retirement period. It is difficult to
summarize the draw-down of assets in any simple way, however; there is
enormous heterogeneity in the change. Because many individuals were
observed in 1995 with relatively low levels of non-annuity assets, the median
percent drawdown is sometimes quite large even though the dollar amount of
draw-down is small. Persons who remained single and married persons
predeceased by a spouse experienced median asset reductions of 30 to 50



                                          22
percent between 1995 and the last year observed before their death. The
reductions for persons whose spouse outlived them were much smaller.

        We find that a large fraction of households have little or no wealth when
they are last observed in the survey. Some might suggest that these households
had "perfect foresight": they anticipated how long they would live and exhausted
their wealth as they were approaching death. Several results are inconsistent
with this view. First, most of those with little wealth at death also had little wealth
in 1995. Thus the pattern is not one of wealth draw-down after retirement, but of
arrival at retirement age without much wealth. Second, the drawdown of wealth
is closely associated with poor health. In order to “time” the wealth profile to hit
zero at death, persons would also have to anticipate health shocks. There is
some evidence [Hurd and McGarry (2002), Hurd, McFadden and Merrill (2001)]
that people are good judges of their own life expectancy, but the size and
randomness of many health shocks would suggest that for many the depletion of
assets was unanticipated and not planned for. Third, among those persons who
had assets in 1995, many apparently exhausted their assets before death—our
last measurement of assets is within two years of death, but many of these
persons have yet to face large medical expenditures that occur disproportionately
in the last six months of life. Finally, we find no significant relationship between
the draw-down of assets and a variable that measures an individual's subjective
life expectancy relative to population averages for persons of the same age and
gender.

        While we do not uncover significant links between subjective mortality and
asset draw-down, we do find substantively important links with other variables.
We estimate that a 10 percentile point increment in health in the previous wave is
associated with over $6,000 more wealth for single persons in the current wave,
over $12,000 more for persons originally in two-person household with a
deceased spouse by the LYO, and over $14,000 more wealth for persons
originally in two-person households with a surviving spouse at the LYO. The
estimated effect of a 10 percentile point change in health between waves ranges
from over $4,000 for single persons to over $17,000 for two-person households.
A $5,000 increment in Social Security is associated with increments in wealth
(over a two year period) ranging from about $12,000 for single persons to over
$29,000 for persons originally married with a deceased spouse in the LYO. The
relationship between non-annuity wealth and a $5,000 increment (again over a
two year period) in DB pension benefits ranges from about $9,000 for single
persons to over $18,000 for persons originally married with a deceased spouse
in the LYO. Thus our estimates suggest that both Social Security income and
DB income are “protective” of non-annuity wealth, while poor health is strongly
associated with the drawdown of non-annuity wealth. Some of the estimated
effects of annuity income on assets appear to be quite large, implying that one
dollar of income is associated with more than one dollar of additional assets. We
investigated measurement error in assets as a possible explanation for the
magnitude of these estimates and we conclude that measurement error is not the



                                          23
key explanation for the large effects. A more likely explanation is that Social
Security benefits are correlated with unobserved individual attributes that affect
the propensity to accumulate assets in retirement. This explanation merits
further investigation.

        Our results raise a number of important questions about the pre-retirement
planning of those who reach late life with essentially no non-annuity assets.
These households are disproportionately dependent on Social Security as their
primary source of income, and they are unlikely to be able to respond to financial
shocks such as out-of-pocket medical costs by relying on their own resources.
One question about this group is whether their level of consumption in retirement
is lower than their pre-retirement standard of living. Some households may
choose to accept low levels of consumption at advanced ages and thus save little
for retirement while young. On the other hand, HRS data summarized in Venti
and Wise (2001) show that two-thirds of respondents say they would save more
if they “could do it again.” And those who said they saved too little had assets at
retirement that were a much lower proportion of lifetime earning than those who
said their saving was “about right.”

       A second question is the extent to which low levels of retirement wealth
accumulation reflect hardship prior to retirement. Particularly for households that
have experienced chronic poor health, and associated low earnings, the
observed level of assets at retirement may be the outcome of many years of
financial struggle. For such households the level of Social Security benefits and
other aspects of the social safety net, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are key
determinants of retirement consumption.

        Finally, the evidence that those with the lowest wealth in retirement are
often those in the poorest health underscores the need to better understand the
causal pathways linking health to wealth at older ages as well as during
traditional working years. The prospect of continued increase in health care
costs suggests that the financial burden of out-of-pocket medical spending may
continue to grow; this could strengthen some of the channels linking health and
wealth. Our findings highlight the need to search for opportunities to identify how
both chronic health conditions, and acute health shocks, affect the trajectory of
wealth.
