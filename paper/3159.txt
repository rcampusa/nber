     This   paper uses the natural experiment provided by periodic   increases Ln
state   benefit levels to estimate the effects of higher unemployment insurance

benefits, Individuals who filed just before and just after sixteen benefit

increases are compared using data from five states during 1979-1984. The

increases, which average about 9 percent, are found to increase the period of

unemployment insurance receipt by about one week. This effect is precisely

estimated and found using several approaches. the incidence of layoffs

resulting in unemployment insurance claims is unaffected by the increases.

The evidence does not suggest that higher benefits lead to better jobs. In

fact, the post-unemployment earnings of individuals receiving higher benefits

are estimated to fall slightly, but the estimates are imprecise.

     There are many unresolved issues about the effects of unemployment

insurance (UI). Many studies have examined the effects of the level of UI

benefits on the length of unemployment spells. However, Welch (1977) and

others have criticized these studies, arguing that it is difficult to

distinguish effects of UI from effects of previous earnings since the level of

benefits is a nonlinear function of previous earnings. In this paper, the

natural experiment provided by periodic increases in state benefit levels is

used to obtain estimates of the effects of higher UI benefits. While higher

UI benefits may increase the length of unemployment spells, they may also lead

to higher reemployment earnings. This hypothesis has not been extensively

tested.   I compare both the spell lengths and reemployment earnings of people

beginning UI spells just before and after benefit increases.

     There are numerous papers on the effects of UI on the length of

unemployment spells. Excellent surveys can be found in Danziger. Haveman and

Plotnick (1981), Gustman (1983), Hamermesh (1977), and Welch (1977). Welch

(1977) criticizes the conventional methodology by pointing out that within a

given state at a point in time, the weekly Ut benefit is a constant fraction

of previous earnings except when an individual receives the minimum or maximum

weekly benefitJ Thus, in a regression of spell length on weekly benefits and

previous earnings, it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of UI

and possible nonlinear effects of previous earnings.




     'The benefit structure of state workers' compensation programs also has
this form. Ehrenberg (1988) makes the same criticism of studies of the
effects of workers' compensation benefits on the time until return to work.

     This paper uses only the variation in UI benefit levels that comes from

periodic increases in the maximum weekly benefit amount to estimate the

effects of the level of UI benefits on the length of unemployment and

reemployment earnings. This new methodology allows one to examine the effect

of exogenous variation in benefits on unemployment duration and incidence. In

the typical study of spell lengths, the variation in UI benefits comes from

some combination of different replacement rates in different states different

minima and maxima, and maybe some variation in these parameters over time.

This paper uses one component of this variation which can be separated out and

used to identify the effects of UI.

     The spirit of the approach taken here is similar to that of Classen

(1979) and Solon (1985). Classen uses data from Arizona and Pennsylvania

around the time of two benefit increases. In a regression analysis, she

allows a kink at the earnings necessary for the maximum benefit in an

otherwise linear relationship between previous earnings and spell length.

Solon examines the length of UI receipt in Georgia just before and after the

introduction of federal income taxation of UI for high income individuals in

1979. He compares the spell lengths of individuals with high income last year

who are likely to pay taxes on their UI benefits, to individuals with low

income last year who are unlikely to pay taxes. The present study has the

advantage that the assignment of an individual to the high or low benefit

group is precise, and does not rely on the imputation of tax rates.

Additionally, sixteen events which change the level of benefits are examined,

rather than one or two.

     Some early work by Ehrenberg and Caxaca (1976) and others examined the

effects of UI on reemployment earnings, but this topic has not been pursued
                                        3




much recently. Many theoretical search models such as Mortensen (1970)

predict that higher UI benefits will be associated with longer unemployment

spells, and a higher wage conditional on finding a job. This paper tests

these hypotheses using a source of variation in UI benefits that is unrelated

to the individual's earnings history.

     This paper is novel in its disaggregation of the effects of UI by recall

status, expectations about recall, and UI payroll tax status. Various authors

have emphasized the importance of these variables in determining the effects

of UI. Feldstein (1975, 1978) emphasizes the quantitative importance of

temporary layoffs. He concludes that among "unemployed job losers" temporary

layoffs account for about half of the spells. He further argues that

conventional models of search unemployment are inappropriate for this group.

In his empirical work using the Current Population Survey (CPS) he finds that

higher UI benefits are associated with much higher levels of temporary layoff

unemployment.

     Topel (1983, 1984) also uses the CPS and distinguishes between temporary

and permanent layoffs, and the incidence and duration of unemployment. Also,

for state/industry cells he imputes the average UI subsidy due to incomplete

experience rating. Re finds that this subsidy greatly increases temporary

layoff unemployment and slightly increases permanent layoff unemployment.

Incidence of unemployment is found to be particularly affected by incomplete

experience rating.

     Corson and Nicholson (1983) find that about two-thirds of UI recipients

in a small two-state sample return to their previous employer. Using the same

data, Katz and Meyer (1988) find the two alternatives of being recalled or

taking a new job have very different time patterns and are affected in very
                                         4


different ways by UI and other variables. The present study provides separate

results for those that expect to be recalled and those who do not.

        It is important to know whether higher benefits affect spell lengths

primarily through individual search as opposed to firm layoff and recall

policies. Brechling (1981) and Topel (1983, 1984) have empirically examined

the effect of incomplete experience rating on unemployment using state level

measures of experience rating. Surprisingly, no one has looked at firm level

tax rates even though the incentive effects of incomplete experience rating

depend on where a firm lies on a nonlinear and nonmono tonic marginal tax

schedule, This paper examines the effect of firm level tax rates on layoff

and recall patterns.



                                     2. Data



        The source of data for this study is a large sample of UI claimants taken

from the Continuous Wage and Benefit History (CWBH) project. Individuals are

randomly selected for the sample using the last two digits of their Social

Security number. Data on 392,000 unemployment spells2 in eight states3 from

January 1979 to early 1984 are available. The data include accurate

administrative records on the key UI parameters: the weekly benefit amount,


     2The unit of observation is really a benefit year. The benefit year is a
year long period starting when an individual files for UI benefits. Some
information on the length of spells within the benefit year is available, but
the best information is on cumulative benefits received during the benefit
year.

     3nte eight states are Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Washington. GWEN data were collected for
several other states, but these states have intermittent data, cover a shorter
time period, or have other drawbacks.
                                       S



the potential duration of benefits, and weeks of benefits received. Some

demographic information including age, sex, race and education is in most

cases administratively collected, along with additional survey information on

expectations about recall to a previous employer, marital status, dependents,

occupation, family earnings, and other variables. These individual data are

matched to administrative data for each of an individual's covered employers

during a 21 quarter period. These additional data allow the calculation of

previous and subsequent earnings, and an indicator for whether or not an

individual is recalled by a previous employer. The employer data also

include UI payroll tax rates, 4-digit SIC codes, and the number of employees

each quarter.



                                 3. Methods



     The main idea for the experimental design for this study can be seen in

Figure 1. Figure 1 displays a typical state schedule relating the weekly UI

benefit amount to previous earnings.   The solid line is the schedule prior to

a change in the state law which raises the minimum and maximum weekly benefit

amount (WBA). The dashed line is the schedule after the benefit increase.

Between the minimum and the maximum, the weekly benefit amount is a constant

fraction of earnings during the highest calendar quarter of the base period

(the first four of the last five calendar quarters prior to the date of filing

for UI).

     For people with high quarter earnings of at least E4 (the H group), I

compare the mean weeks of UI received and reemployment earnings of people who

filed for UI benefits just prior to and just after the change in the benefit
                                      6




schedule.4 Those who file before the increase receive B°max while those

filing afterwards receive Bnmax.   An individual's filing date determines his

UI benefit amount for his entire benefit year (the one year period following

date of claim). Thus, two individuals with high quarter earnings greater than

E4 will receive different weekly benefits for their entire benefit year if one

filed a few days before and the other a few days after the effective date of

the benefit increase. This is the main idea of the paper. Most of the

remaining methodological problems involve correcting for possible differences

between the individuals filing just before and just after the benefit

increase. In much of what follows, I will use as a comparison group those

with earnings between E2 and E3 (the L group) who file just before and just

after the benefit increase. The benefits these individuals receive are

unaffected by the increase in the maximum benefit amount.

     The analysis uses sixteen benefit increases which are listed in Table 1.

Table 1 summarizes some key characteristics of the state UI laws.5 I exclude

increases which straddle any of the following changes: the partial taxation of

benefits in January 1979 and January 1982, changes in the replacement rate (on

the linear part of the benefit schedule), and changes in the potential

duration of benefits, I also use only benefit increases far enough from the

beginning and end of the sampling frame that a complete benefit year of data

is available for each person. Lastly, I exclude South Carolina because the


     'In principle, one could also examine the effects of increases in the
minimum weekly benefit amount. Unfortunately, few people receive the minimum
benefit and it is raised infrequently.

     5The information needed for this table was obtained from the Department
of Labor publications Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws, and
Significant Provisions of State Unemployment Insurance Laws, and numerous
conversations with officials of state employment security agencies.

benefit increases are very small (they total $7 over three years). An

extremely large benefit increase itt Georgia is excluded because it is three

times as large as the others. Results for this increase are discussed in

Section 6.

     The sixteen benefit increases are fairly evenly spread across three times

of the year: January, July and September. The increases are automatic annual

increases because the maximum benefit is indexed to state average weekly

earnings in the five states examined. This research is aided by the high

rate of nominal wage growth during the late seventies and the early eighties,

which leads to large benefit increases averaging between 9 and 10 percent.

also present results for sixteen "placebo periods" below. These are periods

around   the same day   and year as actual benefit increases but the data come

from states where the UI law did not change. These periods serve as an

additional   comparison group for the results found using the benefit increases.

A list of the placebo periods is provided in Table 2. The selection criteria

for placebo periods was similar to that for benefit increases in that the

periods could not overlap any other change in the UI law. In 13 of 16 cases

this reduced the set to a single state. In the other 3 cases I picked a state

that had not been already used for many placebo periods.

     To make the before group (B group) and after group (A grâup) as

comparable as possible, the upper and lower limits (E2 and E3) on previous

earnings for the L group, and the lower earnings limit (E4) for the H group,

were indexed using state level average weekly earnings in UI covered

employment.6 The period before and after each benefit increase that was used


     6These data are unpublished, but were provided on a quarterly basis by
Cindy Ambler of the Department of Labor.

for the analysis is diagrammed in Figure 2. The B group is the two month long

period ending one-half month before the benefit increase, and the A group is

the two month period beginning one-half month after the increase. The one

month period surrounding the increase was not analyzed in case there was

strategic behavior by claimants who waited until after the increase to file

for benefits in order to receive a higher weekly payment.7 The sample only

includes males, since in most cases there are less than 20 women in the high

earnings groups. In all, I use 18,370 observations around benefit increases,

and 24,642 around placebo periods. A breakdown of these totals by subgroups

is given in the notes to Table 4.

     Figure 3 shows the timing of the earnings periods that are used to

measure the effects of UI on post-unemployment earnings. Two earnings

periods are examined. The first period is the 4 quarters beginning with the

quarter of claim (this is approximately the benefit year). The second period

is the 4 quarters after the first period, so it is approximately the year

after the benefit year. Notice that the mean claim date (assuming a uniform

distribution) for the B group is exactly one quarter before the mean claim

date for the A group. This sample design was used to keep the earnings

measures comparable for the A and B groups.




     7Results excluding a two month period around the benefit increases are
reported in Table 13. They do not differ appreciably from the results with
the one month exclusion, except for the expected larger standard errors.

   4. Results for Weeks of UI Received and Change in Reemployment Earnings

increases in state maximum benefits on spell length, earnings, and the

received for the AN group. The AH group is just the intersection of the A

group and the H group, i.e. those claimants with high quarter earnings above

those needed for the new maximum benefit amount who filed between one-half

month and two and one-half months after the benefit Increase.                        LAL.

and LBL. are defined analogously. The statistic AL. is the change in mean

spell length for those subject to the change in the maximum benefit compared

to the change over the same period for those unaffected by the increase.

Subtracting out the change for those unaffected by the increase should

eliminate the potential bias caused by changes in durations (and variabl.es

affecting them) over the three month period between the claim dates of those

in the B group and those in the A group. Results with and without this

adjustment are generally reported below. Table 4 and the following results

also exclude individuals that were rehired as part of a recall that was a

large fraction of the state's data because these observation cannot be treated

as independent. If a recall accounts for more than 3 percent of the

observations, it is dropped from the sample.8

     The earnings measures used are the natural log of mean earnings. Let

high earnings individuals compared to low earnings Individuals. The separate

halves of AN., NMIL/NBH and NALi/NBLi are also generally reported.

     The change in weeks of UI benefits1 reemployment earnings and incidence

of UI claims can be seen for each of the 16 increases in Table 4. The weeks

of benefits measure is the number of weeks of full Iii benefits9 received

during the benefit year. There is evidence that higher benefits tend to

increase the number of weeks of benefits received, Of the 16 increases, 12

show longer unemployment spells. there is no clear pattern to the change in

relative incidence of UI claims. There is some pattern of a. decline in

earnings during the year following the benefit year.

     Table 5     reports   the results of optimally combining the numbers from the

16 increase of Table 4 into a single number. The statistics from each benefit

increase are summed, weighting by the variance of the statistic. For example,

the mean change in weeks of benefits received, AL is calculated as




     9Weeks of full benefits do not include partial UI. Partial benefits are
paid when an individual does some work for pay after being laid off from his
primary job.   Tabulations from the CWBH data indicate that about one-third of
UI claimants receive some weeks of partial Cit benefits. Most of these people
receive partial UI for only a few weeks.

and the other terms are calculated using the usual formula for the variance of

a sample mean. The earnings and incidence statistics are averaged in the same

mariner. 10

      Table 5 reports several estimates of duration, earnings and incidence in

addition to those in Table 4. Means and standard deviations for the duration

as well as other key sample variables are reported in Table 3. The duration

measure. "Weeks of Full Benefits, Only Positive Weeks" excludes those claims

that do not result in any benefits being paid. In the CWBH data about 18

percent of claims do not result in the payment of benefits. Roughly half of

these claims without benefits are individuals who are disqualified, while the

other half are people who find a job before the waiting week expires.11 The

Last duration measure is weeks of regular UI benefits. -    This measure excludes
federal and state extended benefits and federal supplemental benefits and is

calculated using dollars paid so that it accounts for partial UI. Weeks of

regular benefits provide a check against the other results. The changes in


     lOi have also tried weighted least squares (WLS) regressions using the 16
observations on the change in weeks of benefits or earnings regressed on the
corresponding percentage increase in the maximum benefit amount. I do not put
much weight on these \JLS results since they are riot very robust and depend on
the treatment of the constant. An example is provided by the weeks of full
benefits results. If a constant is included, the coefficient (standard error)
for the constant and the percentage increase are -1.505 (1.621) and .294
(.179) respectively. If a constant isnot included the, coefficient (standard
error) for the percentage Increase is .133 (.040).

     This statement is based on the average initial claim disqualification
rate which is 8.5 percent in 1982 as reported in unpublished Unemployment
Insurance Service data, and the fraction of spells lasting one week which is
9.4 percent in the CWBH data.

regular benefits are expected to be smaller than the other estimates because

they are more likely to be censored at exhaustion of benefits. The additionaL

earning measure is for the period of the benefit year as indicated in Figure

3. The second incidence measure excludes claims that do not result in any

benefits being paid.

     Table 5 indicates large and significant increases in all measures of the

number of weeks of UI received for the average of the sixteen benefit

increases. Weeks of full benefits in the benefit year, with or without those

with zero weeks, are estimated to rise over one week. Using the means from

Table 3, the implied elasticities of weeks of full benefits, including and

excluding those with zero weeks, are .698 and .549 respectively. If one

takes the average percentage increase in the maximum to be 7.28 (the 9.32

average nominal percentage increase minus the 2.04 average percentage increase

in wages) the elasticities are a bit larger, .894 and .703 respectively. In

comparison, the average of each duration measure for the placebo periods is

small, negative and insignificant. Thus large increases in duration occur

after benefit increases, while no significant change is seen for placebo

periods.

     Table 5 also decomposes the benefit increase and placebo period

statistics into changes for the high and low earnings groups separately. The

decomposition shows that most of the changes in duration for the benefit

increases are due to large increases in spell length for those with high

earnings. Those with low earnings experience a small and in most cases

insignificant increase in duration. These last results suggest that the true

effects of higher benefits are being measured. The results are also

consistent with the change in duration for the low earnings group being an
                                          13


unnecessary control, so that the results for the change in duration for those

with   high   earnings could be used directly.

       For the benefit increases, earnings show an appreciable decline during

the benefit year. The decline is consistent with more weeks of UI receipt and

fewer weeks of work during the benefit year. There is an estimated decline

also during the year after the benefit year, but the estimated decline is

smaller than that found for the placebo periods. There is essentially no

change in the relative incidence of layoffs of high earnings individuals

after the benefit increases and the placebo periods. The change in the number

of claims is very close to zero and insignificant.

       Separate results for those expecting recall and those not expecting

recall are reported in Table 7. The exact question is "do you expect to be

called back to work by any of your past employers?" The question is part of

the CWBH questionnaire which is administered when an individual files for UI.

This is the ex ante concept of temporary layoffs discussed in Katz and Meyer

(1988). This measure should be preferred to the CI'S ateasure since it is asked

at the start of spell for all individuals. The CPS question asks people with

in-progress spells of varying length if they are "on layoff awaiting recall by

their employers." The CPS recall expectation concept is likely correlated

with unexpected changes in spell length if recall expectations change in the

course of spells)'2 As indicated in Table 6, about half of the individuals

in the benefit increase and placebo period sample expect to be recalled.

       Large increases in duration are found for both those who expect recall

and those who do not. Comparisons of the two groups are difficult however


     1'2See Katz (1985) for a model where a person updates his recall
expectations as a spell continues.
                                      14


because of the larger standard errors and because the sign of the difference

in the point estimates depend on the statistic examined. If one compares the

high-low results, then those who expect recall have bigger responses. the

reverse is true if one compares the high statistics. The high-low placebos

for those expecting recall are surprisingly large and negative. In general,

the disaggregated results seem much more variable and are hard to compare

because their standard errors are larger.

     Similar results are found when the sample is divided by actual recall

status rather than expectations. An individual is classified as recalled if

his employer during any of the three quarters after his last UI payment

matches his employer during either of the two quarters prior to claim. The

frequency of recall for each of the 7 states is reported in Table 6.

     The last division of the sample is by the marginal tax cost of layoffs.

It is difficult to find variation in experience rating across firms that is

exogenous to the process of layoffs and recall rates since a firm's tax rate

is a function of previous layoff and recall rates. A possible solution is to

interact tax status with an exogenous change in benefits, such as an increase

in the maximum benefit amount. One can then examine whether tax status

affects the response of different firms. This strategy is taken here.

     In four of the five benefit increase states13, I determine the firm which

laid off each individual, and then match that firm's UI payroll tax rate for

the year to that individual's spell. Given the firm's tax rate, I can

determine the firm's location on the state's tax schedule. I then treat the



     13The tax cost of unemployment has not been calculated for Pennsylvania
since the combination of Benefit Ratio and Reserve Ratio experience rating
that is used there is much more difficult to summarize.
                                     15


schedule as being locally linear and determine how the firm's tax rate would

change in response to a small increase in unemployment by its former

employees.14 Then, following the approach of Topel (1983), I calculate the

present value of future taxes that the firm would pay if it slightly increased

the number or duration of its layoffs. The derivation of the formula for the

marginal tax cost of layoffs is reported in Appendix A. The calculations

modify Topel's formula for reserve ratio states to account for differing state

growth rates in the taxable wage base. The tax cost is the fraction of a

dollar that the firm would pay in future taxes if one dollar were paid to

former employees by the UI system.

     I have divided the sample into UI recipients from low (< .5) and high (>

.5) tax cost firms and calculated the average change in duration and earnings

for each group. The results can be seen in Table 8. Most theories would

suggest a larger increase in duration or incidence of layoffs for low tax cost

firms, since they are paying a smaller fraction of the UI costs of the layoff.

Surprisingly, the point estimates suggest a greater change in weeks of UI

received for those with a high tax cost of unemployment,t5 Most of the

differences between high and low tax cost firms are statistically

insignificant though. The incidence number for the placebo periods are also


     4The determination of states' tax schedules was done mostly by
contacting the individual states. Some information was obtained from the
Department of Labor's Comparison of State Unemployment Insurance Laws and
Commerce Clearing House's Unemployment Insurance Reports. Government
entities, reimbursable employers, and employers that are charged the standard
rate are excluded from the sample. Changes in tax rates cannot be determined
for standard rated firms, since the changes depend on the firms' age and
reserve ratio which are unavailable.

     15This is true for the entire sample as reported in Table 8, and when
Idaho and Louisiana are examined separately. These two states have a fairly
even split between UI recipients from high and low tax cost firms.
                                      16


puzzling as there are large changes in incidence in opposite directions for

the high and Low tax cost firms.



                           5. Regression Estimates



     Regression estimates of duration and earnings effects that control for

differences across individuals are reported in Tables 9 through 12. The

estimates confirm the average change results reported earlier in Table S.

tables 9 and 10 report equations for the log of weeks of full benefits

received. The Table 9 sample includes both high and low earnings individuals,

while Table 10 includes only high previous earnings individuals, since the

results of Table S suggest that the low earnings individuals are an

unnecessary control that adds imprecision to the estimates.

     In Table 9, the estimate of the effect of the benefit increases is the

coefficient on "After Increase, High Earnings Group (AM Group)". The AM Group

dummy variable equals one if an observation is in both the A and H groups. A

set of dummy variables has been included in the specifications in Table 9 50

that the AM group coefficient has an interpretation similar to the average

change estimates in table 5. All specifications include IS dummy variables

for benefit increases, 16 dummy variables for increases interacted with being

in the high earnings group, and 16 dummy variables for increases interacted

with being in the group after the benefit increase. In Table 10, the estimate

of the effect of the benefit increases is the coefficient on "After Increase,"

and I have included in the specifications 15 dummy variables for benefit

increases -
                                     17



     In both Table 9 and 10, I progressively add more explanatory variables to

check if the AR group coefficient is biased by omitted differences between the

individuals who file before and after the benefit increases. The controls are

fairly extensive; they include race dummy variables, 5 age dummy variables, 6

education dummy variables, 45 industry dummy variables, 4 firm size variables,

and additional variables described in Appendix B. The sample sizes decrease

as additional variables are added because more observations are excluded due

to missing values.

     The benefit increase coefficients in Table 9 are large and statistically

significant with a value of .07 to .08 through specification (4). This

specification already Includes controls for previous earnings, the duration of

benefits, age, race, education, firm size and 2-digit industry. In

specifications (5) and (6) the coefficients are smaller and less precisely

measured as one-half to two-thirds of the observations are excluded due to

missing variables. In Table 10 the benefit increase coefficients tend to be

somewhat more stable, ranging from about .06 to .09 in the six specifications.

     The benefit increase coefficients from the Table 9 and 10 regressions

imply somewhat larger elasticities than implied by the differences in means of

Table 5. SInce the dependent variable is in logs, the coefficients are

directly interpretable as implying a 7 to 8 percent increase in duration after

the benefit increases. Since the increases average 9.32 percent, the implied

elasticity is approximately .8, or about 1.0 if one adjusts for the three

months of inflation between the before and after groups.

    Tables 11 and 12 are analogous to Tables 9 and 10, but the regressions

estimate the change in earnings In response to the benefit increases. The

dependent variable is (earnings during the 4 quarters after the benefit year -
                                       18



base period earnings)/base period earnings. The earnings coefficients in

Table 11 have relatively large standard errors and are not very stable; the

last two specifications have coefficients of the opposite sign from the rest.

Those in Table 12 imply a decline in earnings in response to the benefit

increases and three of the coefficients are significantly different from zero

at the .05 level.. These coefficients provide some evidence for, an earnings

decline after the benefit increases.



           6. Robustness Checks and the July 1981 Georgia Increase



     Several alternative samples to the one analyzed in Table S are tried as

a check on the robustness of the earlier results. Table 13 reports four

alternative samples which (1) exclude the month before and after the increases

(2) include the Georgia July 1, 1981 increase as a 17th increase (3) include

large reeinployers, and (4) cover the entire year before and after the Georgia

1981 increase. The first alternative sample which excludes those filing one

month before and one month after the benefit increases gives estimates which

differ little from those in Table 5 except for slightly larger duration

effects and larger standard errors. The sample which includes the Georgia

1981 increase along with the others gives duration estimates which are sixty

to seventy percent as large as the ones from the 16 increases. This

difference results from a large estimated decline in duration after the

Georgia increase)6 The sample which includes large reemployers gives

estimates which are thirty to fifty percent larger for duration effects than


     L6The point estimate (standard error) for the change in weeks of benefits
for the Georgia increase is -1.991 (.996).
                                      19


those in Table 5 and which suggest a slight decline in the incidence of

layoffs and a slightly greater decline in earnings than indicated in Table 5.

     The last subsample, the year before and after the Georgia July 1, 1981

27.8 percent increase in the maximum benefit amount, was analyzed extensively.

I. compared the people who filed in a given calendar quarter to people who

filed in that same calendar quarter one year later. I excluded the one-half

month period just before and after the increase, and the corresponding

calendar periods one year earlier or later. These four groups were then

averaged in exactly the same way as the 16 increases were above.

     The results reported in the last two columns of Table 13 indicate that

there are severe problems with using the Georgia increase to determine the

effects of higher beneflts   During the year following the increase, layoffs

resulting in lit receipt rose dramatically, with the increase unevenly split

between high and low earnings individuals. While the 16 increases of Table 5

show changes in the two relative incidence measures of - .009 and .000

respectively, the Georgia increase shows changes of - 649 and - .609.    These

large declines in the relative incidence of high earnings individuals result

from enormous increases in incidence for low earnings individuals combined

with moderate increases for high earnings individuals.

     Furthermore, the implied duration elasticities for Georgia depend greatly

on whether the High-Low estimates or the High estimates are used. Since the

mean duration of UI receipt in Georgia is about half that for the 16

increases, the elasticities are larger than one might expect from Table



     17The mean duration of UI receipt for the Before High group in Georgia
with and without individuals with zero weeks is 9.91 .and 11.74 respectively,
compared to 16.79 and 20.07 respectively for the average of the 16 increases.
                                      2Ô


For the High-Low statistics, the elasticities for the two duration measures

(with and without zeros) are .241 and .086 respectively. For the High

statistics the corresponding elasticities are .518 and .371 respectively.

Adjusting for the 10.2 percent increase in average wages over the year, the

elasticities are .818 and .585 respectively. These last elasticities are

similar to those found for the 16 increases above, while the High-Low

elasticities are considerable lower than the above elasticities.18

     Regression equations analogous to those in Table 9 were estimated for the

Georgia sample. The coefficient estimates, which depend quite dramatically on

whether explanatory variables are included, evidence large changes in the

composition of unemployment during this period. In the specification

analogous to (4) in Table 9 the coefficient (standard error) on the "AB

groupTM dummy variable is .090 (.056). When specification (1) is tried with

this same sample the coefficient (standard error) is .014 (.054). In the

specification analogous to (5) in Table 9 the coefficient (standard error) on

the TMAH groupTM dummy variable is .105 (.056). When specification (I) is

estimated with the same sample the coefficient (standard error) is - .019

(.056). Specification (6) cannot be estimated since occupation is not known

for Georgia UI claimants. The specification (4) and (5) coefficients imply

benefit elasticities in the .3 to .6 range, with estimates at the higher end

if one adjusts for inflation.

     A final check on the estimates of Table 5 was performed using information

on weeks worked in each calendar quarter which is available for individuals



     18This analysis of the July 1, 1981 Georgia increase ignores the effects
of taxation of unemployment benefits which was extended to middle income
households and individuals on January 1, 1982.
                                       21


from Pennsylvania and Washington for 5 benefit increases. While the estimates

are only suggestive because of large standard errors, the increase in weeks of

UI seems to be associated with a roughly comparable decline in weeks worked.

The estimate (standard error) for the change in weeks of UI is 1.13 (.76) and

change in weeks worked is -.96 (.72)



                       7. Conclusions and Extensions



     The estimates of duration effects found in this paper are somewhat larger

than most previous estimates. The elasticity of weeks of UI benefits with

respect to the weekly benefit amount is estimated to be about .8 to 1.0.

Previous elasticity estimates have clustered in the .2 to .5 range (see

Hamermesh (1977) or Dan.ziger, Haveman and Plotnick (1981)). However, the

estimates are comparable to those found by Classen (1979) and are only

slightly larger than those found in Meyer (l988a). Glassen found an

elasticity of .6 in linear equations and about 1.0 in logarithms. When she

tried modifications of the OLS results such as splines or Tobits to account

for censoring, her estimates always rose.

     One might argue that the duration results given here apply to weeks of

benefits and may say little about the number of weeks without work. One line

of argument is that higher UI benefits induce people to claim earlier. This

has been examined by Katz and Meyer (1988) and Solon (1981), who find no

support for this hypothesis. A second hypothesis is that filing for UI may

increase. There is no evidence in the incidence measures that the number of

initial claims increases. One could argue that people file for additional

weeks at the end of spells, but do not work less. The evidence on weeks
                                       22


worked from Pennsylvania and Washington given above is not consistent with

this last argument.

     The estimates show some evidence of a decline in reemployment earnings

following the increases in benefits. Because the confidence intervals around

many of these estimates are large, the evidence in less conclusive about

effects on earnings. The estimates are, however, consistent with findings in

other studies which examine earnings responses. A decline in earnings in

response to higher UI benefits was generally found by Classen, but the

evidence was not strong. The UI experiments in Illinois and New Jersey which

offered payments to people who found a job quickly seemed to reduce the length

of UI receipt, but they also resulted in no change in earnings or a slight

increase in reemployment earningsJ9

     There are several unsatisfactory aspects of this paper which suggest that

the approach should be taken as a complement, rather than a substitute for

more conventional regression approaches, Large standard errors prevent the

comparison of UI responses for different groups. The reemployment earnings

results are somewhat inconclusive. Lastly, the incidence results are puzzling

and suggest that a more direct approach like the examination of firm histories

of layoffs and recalls stay be useful. Other alternative ways of estimating UI

effects are estimation using flexible function of previous earnings and weekly

benefits, and comparisons of states with the same replacement rate but

different   maximum benefit amounts.

Notes: (1) The numbers in parentheses are ranks. (2) All numbers are
calculated using the sample from periods around benefit increases and
placebo periods. In each column, missing values are excluded from the -
calculations. i.e. those whose recall expectations are unknown are dropped
from the sample when calculating the percentage expecting recall.
(3) Since the sample exludes those who were part of a large recall, the
recall and expect recall fractions are below those from the full sample.

                          Appendix A: Reserve Ratio Experience Rating

This appendix derives a formula for the amount paid by a firm in future
benefits if one dollar is paid to the firm's recent former employees by the
UI system. The formula applies to reserve ratio experience rating systems
which are is use in most states. The derivation below extends the work of
Srechling (l977a, l977b) and Topel (1983). The notation follows that of
Topel.

Some useful definitions are:

    —     fraction       of employees receiving UI on average during year t,
    — UI benefits on an annual basis in year t, i.e.                   is the average
      weekly benefit amount times 52,
      —   reserves       credited to employer's acount in year t,
      —   taxable    wage base per employee in year t,
Nt — number of employees in year t,
   a UI tax rate in year t,
8     a geometric growth rate of firm's employment, i.e. N+1a8N
1   a geometric growth rate of the nominal taxable wage base, i.e.
i   — nominal interest rate, and
r reserve ratio in year t.

The reserve ratio is the ratio of reserves to taxable payroll averaged over
the last three years,


(1) r— ________                                t
                     2
                (E                  )/3


for 8 and i close to I. The change in reserves is the difference between
taxes paid and benefits paid to former employees

(2) R —         R1 + rWN -                PtZtNt   .   In   terms of the reserve ratio
