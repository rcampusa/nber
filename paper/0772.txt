                        The Effects of Pensions and Earnings
                           on Retirement: A Review Essay


                                       ABSTRACT


       Does retirement behavior react predictably to economic incentives?

Evidence on this question would be useful to policy makers responsible

for work and retirement programs affecting the elderly. This paper reviews

the   lessons and limitations of recent economics literature on pensions,
earnings,   and retirement.1   Section I develops the life cycle context for
analyzing   this problem. Theoretical literature is examined in Section II,

followed by a review of the empirical literature in Section III. Conclusions

appear at the end of each Section.




1Additional determinants of retirement which we do not review in this paper
are health, changes in the valuation of leisure time as workers age, labor
supply interactions between household members, and the impact of inflation
as well as other types of uncertainty. For a review of the literature on
these additional determinants, see Clark and Spengler, and Clark.

                 I. RETIREMENT IN A LIFE CYCLE CONTEXT

A. The Problem
     This review of existing theoretical and empirical models
of the effects of pensions and earnings on retirement is
guided by life cycle theory. The individual's problem is to choose
the optimal amount of work to do in each of the remaining
T years of life. "Optimal" is defined as the labor supply
path that maximizes lifetime utility, a function of consumption
and leisure. An individual's income possibilities are constrained

by his lifetime earning capacity and his pension opportunities
(including both employer-provided benefits and Social Security

payments). Thus, a life cycle framework leads immediately to
a structure in which the lifetime labor supply path (1)   is   a

function of the lifetime streams of earnings ()) pensions ()
and other pertinent explanatory variables ():
           -)-
     (1)   H =     L(E,   P, X).
Various aspects of the labor supply vector       may be
selected for analysis: whether or how much the individual
is working as of some age, whether or how much he is working
as of some calendar date, whether he retires early or not,
or his age of retirement. Regardless of which of these
measures is used as the dependent variable, to be true to

life cycle theory, the independent variables in equation (1)
must be expressed as streams and not just in terms of their
current levels. Models without this feature are fundamentally
flawed.
                                 —2--




    Another evaluation standard used in this review is
sensitivity of the various models to essential institutional
features of pensions. One such feature is that pensions,
unlike most other economic assets, have a contingency pro—
vision: to receive a pension, one typically must not work.'

Secondly, pension benefits per year typically increase if
retirement is deferred.2 And thirdly, whereas some pension
plans are actuarially neutral,3 most are not.4 Models which

neglect the contingency provision, the increase in pensions
if reitrernent is delayed,' the possibility of actuarial non-

neutrality run   the   risk of reaching conclusions of quite

limited applicability.




'Employers usually require that the worker cease employment
 before pension benefits are initiated. Social Security
 pensions are subject to an earnings test; after $5,000 is
 earned, each extra dollar of earnings reduces Social Security
 benefits by fifty cents.
2This is true of defined contribution plans (such as TIAA—CREF)
 for three reasons: later retirement adds to the number of
 dollars contributed, allows previous contributions to accumulate
 an additional year's interest, and permits an actuarial
 increase in annual benefits because the expected payout period
 is shortened. Plans which specify benefits rather than
 contributions (including most employer-provided pension plans
 as well as Social Security) usually provide more benefits to
 those who work longer, because of increased years of service,
 raises in the wage base, and a shorter expected payout period.
3"Acutarial neutrality" means that for all possible retirement
 ages, the present discounted value of pension benefits over
 the remainder of one's lifetime is equal to the accumualted
 value of pension contributions up to that time.

4See, for example, Lazear (1981) on private pensions and
 Burkhaus.er and Warlick on Social Security.

 B. Rules for Utility Maximization in a Life Cycle Context

       The foregoing features are easily combined into a quite
 general framework. In this section, we use this model to
 derive rules characterizing optimal retirement behavior.
 Sections II and III compare existing theoretical and empirical
 studies against this framework.

      Utility (U) is a positive function of the lifetime
consumption vector () and of the lifetime leisure vector ()
       (2.a)   U =   U(,)   ,
                                  tJ1>O, U2>O.
Consumption increases with income ()
       (2.b) C = C(Y),          C'>O.

Income depends positively on earnings (net of taxes and pension
contributions) until retirement (R), (E1, E2, . . .           , ER),
and on pension benefits in each remaining year of life,
                  1/2/

      (2.c) 'i =                    .   . ER; R+l' R+2'
                     Y(E1, E2, .                                '




                Yt>o       Vt.

Let   be some aspect of working that increases pension benefits.3
If retirement is postponed, or if             is greater, the benefit
in each year after retirement is higher:


1/
 The length of life (T) is assumed known with certainty.
2/
If work in a post-retirement job is allowed for, an extra
vector of terms running from R+l to T would enter into (2.c).
To avoid complicating the model further, we assume in what
follows that post-retirement work is not chosen, either because
the option is not available or because the individual does not
elect it.
3/
  might alternatively be years of service, wage in the highest
u years preceding retirement, contributions to a pension
fund, or some combination of these.
                                                 —4—


      (2.d) Pt =           Pt'          Pt >0, Pt >0.
                                            1          2

Let the aspect of working that affects pension benefits, (tb) be
a non-decreasing function of lifetime labor (a).

      (2.e) t = W(),                  W'>0.

Finally, hours of work (ii) and of leisure ()               exhaust the hours
in a year:

      (2.f)      +             = constant>.
Collapsing (2a—f) into a single equation, we have:
      (3) U =
                 U{C[El,...ER; PR+l(W(),R),...,PT(W(L),R)]}
The individual's goal is to maximize utility U by choice of a

labor supply path .                  The control variable is the amount of
labor supplied in each period.

      Consider what happens if the individual supplies more labor.
The intensive and extensive margin may be distinguished:


        a) Extra hours of work within some year holding the

        the nunber of years in the work life constant.

Such an increase in labor supply on the intensive margin
has four effects: it may raise earnings, it may raise pension
benefit per year, it leaves unchanged the number of years of
pension benefits, and it reduces leisure.

                                           —5—


Taken by themselves, each of the first two effects may raise

utility, while the fourth effect, by itself, lowers utility.
Hence, whether extra hours of work raise or lower utility is

ambiguous and depends on the parameters of the particular
individual'sutility function and income opportunities. Utility
is maximized when no possible change in hours produces
income gains worth more than the loss of leisure.
         b) Extra years of work holding the number of work hours

         in a year constant.

Such an increase in labor supply from Rorig to Rnew has four

effects on the extensive margin: raises earnings, raises
pension benefit per year, lowers the number of years during
which pension benefits are received, and reduces leisure:

                 Ls[E11.. .,ER]
         (4.b)       iR
                                  >   0;


                 ER >0,      Vt>R

                  t                    orig



Each of the first two effects raises utility, while each of the
latter two lowers it. Hence, whether working additional years
raises or lowers utility depends on the parameters of the
particular individual's utility function and income opportunities.
Utility is maximized when no possible change in years worked

produces gains in earnings and in pension per year worth more
than the loss of years of pension benefits and of leisure

years.

C. Conclusions
    Life cycle theory specifies that labor supply and retirement

status in any period depend upon earnings and pensions in
all periods. In Section II we shall consider how individual
confronting different earnings and pension streams would be

expected to differ with respect to retirement behavior, and
in Section III, review empirical evidence on these effects.

II. Theoretical Specifications in the Literature
     The theoretical literature addressing various aspects

of pensions, earnings, retirement, and life cycle labor supply
is voluminous. However, a much more limited number of studies
considers-how pensions and earnings affect retirement decisions
and life cycle labor supply. In this section, we review the
available literature on the effects of pensions and earnings
on retirement. These studies, in order are: Feldstein;
Kotlikoff; Pellechio; Boskin and Hurd; Burtless and Hausman;

Zabalza, Pissarides, and Barton; Burkhauser and Quinn; Reimers;
Sarnmartino; Gordon and Blinder; Hemming; Fields and Mitchell;

Sheshinski; Burbidge and Robb; MacDonald and Carliner; Gotz
and McCall; Crawford and Lilien; Gustman and Steinmeier; and
Clark and Joinson) A brief outline of the structure of each
model comes next, followed by a comparison of their similarities
and differences and then by a statement of the comparative

dynamic results that emerge.


1Five lines of research also appear in the literature which,
 though tangentially related to the effects of pensions and
 earnings on retirement, do not deal directly with this question.
 We mention them here so that the reader may understand that
 these literatures do not offer guidance on the question at
 hand. Many of these studies are surveyed in Campbell and
 Campbell; Clark, Kreps, and Spengler; and Clark and Spengler.
     Besides the models reviewed belDw, there are other theore-
 tical life cycle models. These others address choices of
 education, work, and leisure over the life cycle. Among the
 most fully—developed of these analyses are the works of Ben
 Porath, Ghez and Becker, Heckman, and Ryder, Stafford and
 Stephan. These studies explicitly analyze individual workers'
 lifetime decisions, paying particular attention to the inter—
 dependencies between past, current, and future alternatives
 and constraints which shape people's actions. However, because
 these studies are directed toward understanding individuals'
 decisions to invest in education and training, they do not
 analyze the retirement decision in any serious way. In particular,
 Ben Porath assumes away retirement by adopting an infinite
                    —continued next page-
                            —8—



1 continued
 time horizon, while the other authors assume the worker never
 retires. These models should not be faulted for failing to
 do well something for which they were not designed.
     A second set of models considers retirement decisions in
 a life cycle context but does not pay serious attention to
 the structures of pensions and Social Security as determinants
 of retirement behavior. Examples in the economics literature
 are the works of Weiss, Blinder and Weiss, Driffill, Lazear (1979),
 and Cotterman. Outside of economics, other social scientists,
 particularly sociologists, have conceptualized retirement
 in a life course perspective; see for instance Abeles and Riley.
     A third group has provided a detailed examination of the
 budget set facing older workers, taking due account of kinks,
 discontinuities, and other features of pension and earnings
 opportunities. This is not done, however, in a life cycle
 context. Examples are Boskin, Bulow, and Honlg and Hanoch.
     A fourth group of models looks at pensions but does not
 focus on retirement decisions. Examples are some of Feldstein's
 works on the effects of Social Security and private pensions
 on savings, Smith's and Schiller and Weiss' (1980) investigations
 of the economics of underfunded pensions in terms of compensating
 differentials; studies by Munnell, and Clark and McDermed on
 the effect of inflation on pensions; and the works of many on
 the adequacy of retirement income (see Clark, Kreps, and Spengler;
 Robertson or Schulz for reviews of these literatures). The
 Pensions Program at the National Bureau of Economic Research has
 produced several studies on pension fund assets (see for instance
 the references in Tepper) and pensions as they relate to compen-
 sation packages (see for example Eatcn and Rosen, Mitchell, and
 Taubman). Since these studies do not consider explicitly the
 employment and retirement decisions of older workers, we do
 not incorporate them into our present review of the literature.
     A fifth literature looks at the optimal design of retire-
 inent systems. Examples are the studies by Diamond and Mirrlees,
 Hu, and Hagens on the Social Security system. These studies
 address general equilibrium aspects of Social Security and
 private pensions, often in a sophisticated way; but the retire—
 ment decision process embodied in these models is not very
 informative. (Diamond and Nirrlees' model, for example produces
 the result (p. 324) that ". . . the consumer is indifferent
 about his date of retirement.") On the other hand, studies
 like those of the President's Commission on Pension Policy are
 realistic institutionally but lack a formal analytical structure
 for characterizing and designing optimal retirement systems.
 A Worthwhile direction for future research would be to integrate
 the general equilibrium models or Social Security from the
 public economics literature with the life cycle models of
 retirement from the labor economics literature, using realistic
 assumptions about Social Security and private pensions Such
 analyses await future study.

A. The Structure of Existing Models
     Feldstein's studies of the Social Security system set off
the recent surge of interest in the economics of pensions. By
means of simple examples in a two period earnings and con-

sumption model, he showed that some individuals' total lifetime
work effort might be invariant to Social Security while Social
Security might cause others (those who might have otherwise
gone on working after 65) to retire earlier. For the first group

of individuals, public saving would substitute for private
saving leaving total labor supply unaffected, while for the
second, Social Security "acts as a combination of an annual
lump sum grant and a tax on earnings after the standard retire-
ment age. The result is to reduce the labor supply of pension

recipients, generally through earlier retirement.*   (p.908)

Proceeding to aggregative analysis, Feldstein introduced the
notion of a Social Security Wealth (SSW) variable, defined as
the total value of normal retirement benefits obligated by the

Social Security system, ignoring contributions. Retirement
benefits available to workers at ages other than the normal
retirement age were not considered. Feldstein used this variable
in a Modigliani-type macro consumption function and found that

SSW reduced aggregate savings by a substantial percentage.
It remained for his students, Kotlikoff and Pellechio, to extend
the SSW notion in more micro directions.

     Kotlikoff's paper recognizes that Social Security wealth
can also be defined for dates other than the normal retirement

age, and concludes that "Social Security may induce early
retirement due to an implicit tax on post-62 earnings."
                               —10—

Beyond this, Kotlikoff's main contribution is empirical (see

Section III below).

     Pellechio's theoretical approach, like Kotlikoff's,
derives from Feldstein's notion of Social Security wealth,

but takes the notion one step further theoretically by linking
it with a microeconomic labor supply model. Following upon

recent analyses by Gronau, Heckman, Hall, and others, Pellechio

(1978) posits two equations:
     Market wage equation: Zn W = Xc + e1
     Reservation wage equation: Zn S =   Y   + yI< + e2,

where X and Y are vectors of determinants of market wages and
reservation wages respectively, K is the amount of work time,

and e1 and e2 are error terms. Different individuals supply
different amounts of labor according to their particular values
of X and Y. If it is assumed that the individual chooses to
work when the market wage exceeds the reservation wage, this
would be a standard single'-period labor supply model. To try
to make it a life cycle labor supply model, Pellechio includes
a variable for Social Security wealth (SSW) defined for one
particular age. Adding this variable to the market and reser-
vation wage equations above yields Y3 + e2<SSSW + Xcx + e1 as

the participation condition, or P(participate) = P(e2—e1<6SSW
+ Xa — Ye). By further specifying the form of the errors e1

and e2 and with additional derivations Pellechio arrives at an
econometric specification of the retirement probability as a
function of a number of wage determining and reservation—wage—
determining variables plus a single value of SSW. Note, however,

that this rendering of older persons' labor supply decision
                            —11—


takes no account of alternative earnings or retirement

income streams available at different retirement ages.

     In a more recent paper (1981), Pellechio extends the simple
model described above in three directions. To the reservation
wage equation, he adds a measure of Social Security payroll taxes
the worker contributes over his worklife, thus taking into

account a variable ignored in previous studies. In the market
wage function, he includes a measure of the Social Security
benefits a worker would forego if he postponed retirement

by one year. He also incorporates the gain in future SSW
obtained by postponing retirement by one year. In so doing,
the model is extended to take into account several institu-

tionally relevant features of the Social Security system that
had been excluded in his earlier stud'r. Nonetheless this more

recent study still does not recognize the role of private

pension and earnings streams at all possible retirement dates,
and limits its attention to Social Security benefit increases

obtained for only one more year of work. Thus it captures
more but not all of the relevant economic variables determining
the retirement decision.

     Boskin, Boskin and Hurd, and Hurd and Boskin. These

papers are motivated more by empirical concerns than by
theoretical ones. In the paper by Boskin alone., a life cycle
model is presented, but it is an appendix disjoint from the

body of the paper. The appendix sets up the individual as
maximizing the present discounted value of utility, where
the arguments of the utility function are additively separable
and the instantaneous utility function depends on consumption
                               —12—


of goods, X, and leisure, L:
     T
     f      u(x,L)dt
    t=o

The constraint is K = rK + W(t)       (T—K(t)) —   P(t)X(t),   where K
is assets, K saving, and W(t) and P(t) are the after—tax wage

rate and price of consumption goods. T denotes two different
things: the number of periods in the objective function, and
the number of hours per period in the constraint equation. Note
the absence of both Social Security and private pensions from

this budget constraint. Hence, this is a life cycle model
without pensions. The model in Boskin's text, on the other
hand, while considering the real-world Social Security benefit

structure, completely ignores life cycle features. Using
Figures la—ld, Boskin shows that some individuals are unaffected
by Social Security: those in Figure la work despite being
eligible for Social Security while those in Figure lb retire
completely and would do so even in the absence of Social

Security. But for other individuals, Social Security does
affect retirement, inducing full retirement in Figure ic
and partial retirement in Figure ld. This model, unlike most,
allows for partial work rather than assuming an all—or—nothing

choice, but the life cycle feature is absent. The same single
period model is used in the subsequent paper by Boskin and Hurd.
The third paper is primarily empirical and is reviewed below.

     Similar approaches (using a single-period model to analyze
a trichotomous dependent variable) were used by Burtless and
Hausman and by Zabaiza, Pissarides, and Barton. Burtless and
Hausman's sample consisted of U.S Government employes; their

dependent    variable was whether at a subsequent date, the

individual was still working for the government, working the
private sector, or unemployed. Zabaiza, Pissarides, and Barton
studied the choice between full-time work, part-time work, and
retirement for a sample of older persons in the U.K. Theore-
tically, posing retirement as a discrete data problem is an

interesting idea. Life cycle aspects have been integrated
into the theory of discrete choice by Gustman and Steinmeler;

see below.

     Burkhauser, and Burkhauser and Quinn. Burkhauser's
theoretical model (1976) was the first life cycle model of

retirement that took real world pension structures into account.
It was explicitly formulated in reaction to the absence of life

cycle considerations in earlier models. In Burkhauser's

worLd (1979, P. 64): "In contrast to the approach of previous
investigators (Boskin, Quinn), it is not simply the size of the

annual pension payments, but the present value of the pension,

that emerges as theoretically important." By considering the
gain (or loss) in pension value if one takes early retirement
rather than waiting until the normal retirement age, Burkhauser

captures one important component of life cycle models. His
theoretical discussion indicates his awareness of other rele-

vant life cycle factors (1979, pp. 64—5):
     If the acceptance of a pension were not related to
     leaving one's job, the timing of its acceptance would
     be unambiguous. Given a choice among different yearly
     payments (Be) based on age (s) when accepting a pension,
     a worker would accept a pension at the age that yielded
     a stream with the greatest present value (A(s) 1     Ac-
                                                          -




     cepting a pension usually requires leaving the job, which
     suggests that loss of wages and fringe benefits must be
     taken into account.... Earnings from the job in each

     benefits) and tj is time spent on the job, are considered
     totally lost to the worker taking the early pension.

     In     the specific formulations of his theoretical relation-

ships (his equations 2 and 3), he has the individual evaluating

only two possibilities (retirement at present versus retirement
at 65) rather than the whole range of alternatives (the possi-

bility of retiring sometime between the present and 65). Also,
his 1979 study makes no mention of the gain or loss in Social
Security benefits if retirement is postponed. Nonetheless,
Burkhauser's theoretical model represents a substantial advance
in modeling the effects of pensions on retirement. As noted
below in Section III, his empirical studies are also among the
better of the applied studies.

     In two more recent papers, Burkhauser develops his theore-

tical and empirical arguments further. Burkhauser (1980) focuses
on the asset value of Social Security benefits and suggests
that this measure, because it is life cycle based, is more

appropriate than a comparison of one year's pension benefits with
that year's earnings. Burkhauser and Quinn (1980) treat
private pension and Social Security together and consider their
asset value, A(s), along with wages, w(s), in an indirect utility
function:

     ii =   f(w(s),   A(s)).
The individual's goal is to choose that work path which

maximizes .      This   specification highlights Burkhauser and
Quinn's fundamental point that ". .      . the   trade—off between
potential wages and potential changes in the asset value of
the .pension is the crucial financial factor in the decision

to separate from a job." (p. 41) While we agree with this
point, what is missing from this analysis is an explicit
                                 —16—


specification of the form of the indirect utility function

and of the tradeoffs implicit in the budget contraint.
Other authors have made considerable headway on this problem.
Their contributions are reviewed below.

     Reimers' work in 1977 came after Burkhauser completed his
dissertation (1976) but before the publication of his first
article (1979). Her chapter on the theory of retirement builds
on Burkhauser's analysis but adopts a fuller life cycle frame—

work. She notes, quite correctly, that it is necessary to
compare retirement at present with all possible retirement
ages, not just 65 alone as Burkhauser had done. In the most
general version of her model, the individual's problem is to
choose an optimal hours path as a function of present and

future wages, present and future job opportunities, and
present and future pensions. Retirement by her definition
occurs when the individual leaves the primary employer and
accepts a pension. The optimal age of retirement is solved

using optimal control techniques.
     In Reimers' model, the retirement decision is made as

follows. If the individual works one more year, the change
in well-being (Z) associated with a unit change in ace of

retirement (a) is:

                   subsumes hours decisions and shadow price of time.
Neglecting the yr's, this equation has a clear interpretation.

The term in brackets on the right hand side is the extra earnings

(hourly wage multiplied by time worked) if one works another
year, less the private pension and Social Security benefit fore-

gone in that year. The first integral represents the change
in present value of private pension benefits if retirement is
postponed one year, while the second is the corresponding figure
for Social Security. The last term is the change in the cost
of commodities.         The ¶(a) terms impose utility values on each
of these incomes taking account of the work needed to produce
them. To sum up this expression for retirement behavior, the
individual is assumed to balance the gain (or loss) in ut1ity
from more income but less leisure now, against the gain in
utility from more income from private pensions and Social

 Security later if retirement is postponed. The first order
 condition specifies that he retires when the two are equal,
 i.e., — = 0.
            Reimers' model comes close to deriving the behavior
 of interest to us, namely, the effects of changes in wages

 and changes in pensions (both public and private) on work
 hours and retirement. Her formulation differs from what we
 would want in two respects: she assumes wages are constant,
 when we would have the individual considering how wages would

 change if retirement is postponed;1 and in the specific solution
 she actually displays, the optimal work/leisure path is derived
 implicitly but is never stated explicitly or characterized.

            Sammartjno (1978) constructed a model whicth, like Reimers',
adopts an optimal control framework. The individual must
decide how to spend his time now and in the future in order to

maximize the present discounted value of goods (X) and leisure
 CL):


        r
The decision-maker begins with an initial stock of assets.
If he works in a period, he receives an income which adds to

his stock of assets. When he doesn't work, he receives the

Utility from leisure. Sammartino uses optimal control to derive

the utility—maximizing path. In the absence of a pension, his
equation 13' gives the change in leisure along this optimal
path as:
                            0
        0
        L = (q -    r   +   w
                                e Cq-r)t
                                        W/ULLI

1Some life cycle models in fact place wage change at the core of
 the explanation for why people retire.
                                —19—


where L is the change in leisure, q is the individual's discount
    rate, r is the rate of return on assets, w/w is the rate of

growth of wages, A0 is the implicit value of a marginal dollar
of initial wealth, and ULL is the second derivative of utility
with respect to leisure (assumed negative). If the first term
                         0
in parentheses (q-r + w/w) is negative, leisure will increase
over time (i.e., L >    0).   If the increase is sufficiently rapid,
the individual reaches the point of full leisure, hence
zero work. Thus, if retirement is defined as zero work, an
individual is more likely to retire the greater is the difference
between the market rate of interest Cr) and the individual's

subjective discount rate (q) relative to his rate of wage

growth (w/w).
        Thus far, the model does not build in pensions explicitly.

Once a pension is allowed for, and receipt of pension benefits
is conditioned on ceasing to work for the principal employer,

the system becomes much more complicated. Sammartino sets up
but does not solve for the optimum in this expanded system.

He notes that the age of retirement depends on the pre and post

retirement wages, the level of pension benefits, the change in
pension benefits from the delaying reitrement, the interest
rate, the discount rate, and the otpimal amount of work time
in both the pre and post retirement periods. However, this
paper does not develop the comparative dynamics implicit in the
model.1                                -

to    tie together a full-fledged life cycle model of retirement
with an institutionally realistic pension structure.        An

accompanying paper (Blinder, Gordon, and Wise) addresses
institutional aspects of Social Security and consequent effects
on work incentives in greater detail.

       Their retirement model has three periods: the past

 (period 0), the present (period 1), and the future (period
2).     Individuals of different ages have pasts and futures

of different lengths (T0 and T2 years respectively). The
individual's problem is to decide how much work to do at

present (L1) and how much to do in the future (L2), taking the

past as given. Denoting the utility from consumption in a
period by U(C) and the utility of leisure in a period by
V(L.), the decision-maker seeks that combination of work

and consumption which maximizes the following utility function:
                                        + V(L1)
       J =
             T0U(C0) + V(L0)} + U(C1)             + T2'2) + V(L7)
                                   1    + p1         (l+p1) (l+p2)
Retirement    occurs when, following Gordon and Blinder's def i—
nition, the number of hours worked for pay goes to zero.

       What role do they give to pensions in affecting retirement?
The way they think about it is that workers accrue pension

rights while working and these accruals are considered to be
wages at the time of the accrual. Workers, however, do not

necessarily value the pension contributions as they do money
wages. They define a parameter, lambda, which indicates the
subjective weight given by workers to pension contributions
relative to money wages. This formulation obligates them to
maintain a direct link between pension contributions and pension
benefits based on an (empirically) unobserved weighting factor.
                            —21—



It would seem better as a general proposition to drop that

link and to treat direct correspondence between pension benefits
and pension contributions as a special case.

     This three-period model, with the future being treated
as a single period, does not by its very nature afford examination
of allocation of time within the future. That being the case,
it is very hard to imagine why an optimal solution would be
to work now and not work in the future, since that would be

a sharply discontinuous result in a model with no apparent
discontinuities. In fact, the authors have discontinuities within
the future in mind: deterioration in health, falling wages,
and changing preferences in favor of leisure. But these do
not enter exulicitly into their theoretical model.

     Hemming proposes a more general life cycle model of
retirement, where the individual selects a retirement date (Ri)
to produce the largest income flow over his lifetime.
The individual is assumed to work full time up to the age of
retirement and not to work thereafter; no part—time employment

is allowed for. Income streams depend explicitly on the
worker's choice of retirement date, since they are composed
of earnings until the date of retirement, private pension

income thereafter, and public pension benefits from some

institutionally set age until death. The private pension
benefit stream is structured to depend directly on the worker's
retirement date, which is an essential feature of real-world
pension systems. However, it is assumed that the public
pension always pays a flat amount (p). In eauation form, the
model assumes that the worker maximizes, by choice of
                                 —22—


the   following:

                       (l-)w(t)dt       (R1)dt +
        Y(R1) =                     +
                                                    pdt
where:

(l-c)w(t)         is the net wage in year t

y(R1)             is the private pension amount received per year if
                the retirement date of        is chosen
L               is length of life

R2              is the date public pension benefits begin

Y(R1)           is the present value of future income streams

                  (discounting is ignored for expository convenience).
        One of the most important contributions of this study is
that it explicitly recognizes that the life-cycle model requires
the worker to compare the gains in pension income from a
longer work life against the loss in earnings from retiring
earlier. The first order condition is stated clearly: "at
the margin, the increase in the present value of net wage
income plus pension benefits after retirement from postponing
retirement. .   .must equal the present value of the pension
income foregone through later retirement." (p. 170). An
implicit function for the optimal retirement date is derived,

and impliáations of changes in pension parameters noted.
For instance: an increase in the flat benefit provided by the

public pension always induces earlier retirement because
retirement is made more lucrative than work. An increase in
the tax ratE' on earnings Ccx) is found to produce postponed

retirement. However a change in y has theoretically ambiguous
effects on the optimal retirement date, depending on other
                                    —23—


 parameters in the model. Another novel feature of the study
 is that the pension is not necessarily actuarially neutral.

 Hemming assumes an income—maximization framework, which is

 advantageous theoretically in focusing attention on the role
 of pensions and earnings in determining retirement but un-

realistic empirically. A more serious limitation is that the
functional forms used by Hemming to characterize public and

private pension plans are too simplistic and need to be made
more realistic.

     Fields and Mitchell (1981) also model how an income—
maximizer chooses the optimal age—of-retirement when each
period's work hours are given. That paper showed that a

necessary and sufficient condition for an income maximizer
ever to retL.-e is that the annual pension benefit must cut the

net earnings function from below. If this condition holds and
if earnings and pension benefit per year are both linear functions
of time, E = m +   nt   and iT =   p +   qt   respectively, then the
income—maximizing age-of-retirement is given by R* = mp+qT
This optimum is found by balancing off the gain in earnings
and in pension benefits from working one more year against
the loss of one year's pension benefits. We refer to this as
the "life cycle rule." Other decision rules are shown to
lead to retirement ages that differ systematically from the

optimum, as shown in Figure 2:

where:

     V(R)       is present discounted value of lifetime income;

     Rule 1:    Retire at the age when the last year's
                earnings are just offset by the loss in present
                discounted value of pension benefits by post-
                poning retirement one more year.

     Rule 2:    Retire when the current year's pension equals

                the current year's earnings.
     Rule 3:    Retire when pension wealth (PDVP) is maximized.

     Rule 4:    Retire when the replacement rate (the ratio of

                pension benefits to pre—retirement earnings)
                is maximized.

The retirement ages using Rules 2 and 3 are definitely, less

than the optimum for an income—maximizer and the retirement
age using Rule 4 is too late; but where the ages using Rules
2 and 3 are relative to one another depends on specific

parameters. Additionally, comparative dynamics were considered
for the income maximizer. It was shown that although conven-
tional wisdom usually holds that higher pensions lead to

earlier retirement and higher wages to later retirement, the
reverse results are also possible; examples were presented to
show that some pension increases may result in earlier
retirement and some wage increases may result. in later retire-

ment. These possibilities are also noted by Burbidge and Robb
and by Sheshinski in studies reviewed below.

     Sheshinski presents a thorough analysis of the problem
confronting a utility-maximizer who values both consumption
and leisure and whose control variable is the number of
periods worked before retiring. He first analyzes a highly
                            —25—


stylized model at length and then generalizes it in more
realistic ways though in less detail. Both models contain
a rigorous development of the life cycle framework and the
decision rule it implies: To paraphrase the rule, the
individual assesses the direct loss in utility from further

postponement of retirement, weighs this loss against the
utility value of the gain in present value of earnings and

pension receipts, and chooses as his optimum the point at
which these gains and losses are equal. Another result of
interest emerges from his more general model: that the effects
of higher wages and higher pensions on the age of retirement
are ambiguous depending on the parameters of the respective
functions. Sheshinski deserves credit as the first to develop

these ambiguities rigorously. Despite these strengths, his
conclusions are limited in generality owing to his assumption
of actuarial neutrality of pensions, which is unrealistic in
most circumstances.

     Burbidge and Robb offer a more realistic analysis, in

that they do not require actuarial neutrality. Their basic
framework is illustrated in Figure 3 for an individual whose

utility function gives positive weight to consumption and
time in retirement. Let FM be the individual's lifetime budget
constraint-with no pension under alternative retirement

dates (measured from right to left——time spent in retirement
is measured from left to right). A representative indifference
curve is drawn as PQ in Figure 3a; an individual with budget
constraint FM and preference mapping PW would retire at a*

years of leisure. Introducing a pension plan shifts the life—
time budget constraint. How it shifts depends on the balance

 between pension benefits and pension contributions at each age.
 Three possibilities are illustrated in Figures 3b—3d.
 The remainder of Burbidge and Robb's analysis consists of

 analyzing the consequences of these different pension structures
 for the age of retirement.

      Another paper that pursues a similar approach is that of
 MacDonald and Carliner. They too work in a framework assuming
 Utility-maximizing that hours of work are fixed within each
period. The authors examine how      the   optimal retirement date
varies as pension and other parameters change (assuming interior

solutions). Of particular interest is their formulation of
a specific pension function, which is nonlinearly related to
the age of retirement. Some unexpected resulté are apparently

peculiar to their specific pension function; for instance they
find that inclusion of fewer years of salary in the pension

base calculation induces earlier retirement, and increases in

the penalty for early retirement probably induce earlier
retirement.

     Gotz an McCall have sketched a similar way of analyzing

the life cycle retirement problem, but focus heavily on sources
of behavioral differences across people. Their primary interest
is in deterrrining retention rates of military personnel, and

in particular in evaluating how the military retirement system
affects an officer's choice of retirement dates. The individual
is posited to compare the extra earnings and higher pension

produced by one more year of work, against the lost benefits

foregone by not retiring immediately. In addition the authors
acknowledge that nonmonetary factors may play an important

other factors, which enter via an individual specific utility
function (that varies across people))- They also relax the
assumption of perfect certainty, so that both economic factors
and random variation are allowed to determine the optimal

retirement date. Much of this work is still in progress, so
that the final form of the theoretical equation is not yet
clear, but their approach appears to be one of the more

sophisticated analyses of a life cycle retirement problem. On
the other hand, the model has not yet incorporated many specific
institutional features of military pensions and the Social
Security system, and how these interact to determine retirement.
     Crawford and Lilien approach the retirement question in

a somewhat different but systematic manner. They begin with
a highly-stylized model (which has its origins in the work of
Feldstein and Burbidge and Robb) that assumes that pensions

are actuarially neutral, capital markets are perfect, and length
of life is known with certainty. In this "base case" model
pensions have no effect on retirenieni:; the individual merely

substitutes savings through the pension fund for savings he
would have done on his own, borrowing or lending in the capital
market to achieve the desired timing of consumption and savings
over the life cycle. Crawford and Lilien then relax the perfect

capital market assumption, and find that higher required pension
contribution levels produce earlier retirement. This is

explained by the declining marginal utility of consumption at.
higher income levels, and the tendency to use some of these

 Pissarides and Barton, also allow for differences in preferences
 across individuals. Neither utilizes a life cycle framework
 in their retirement model, however.
 forced savings to purchase additional leisure. In a model
 where the individual can only adjust the number of periods
 worked, and not hours within a period, the worker will retire
 earlier. Deviations from pension neutrality are also examined
 in some detail: for example, current Social Security rules

 apparently create an incentive to move retirement toward age

 65, at least among those who would have retired later in the

 absence of Social Security. Finally, these authors also
 examine the effect of an actuarially neutral pension scheme
 in a world with uncertain lifetimes, concluding that the

insurance feature of Social Security creates an income effect

toward early retirement, and an ambiguous substitution effect

 (assuming that private insurance schemes are not available).
The authors have not yet combined all three features (imperfect
capital markets, uncertain lifetimes, and non—neutral
pensions) into a single model.   This extension awaits further
research.

     Finally, two new theoretical directions in the literature
bear mention. Gustman and Steinmejer set up a variable-hours
life cycle model for a utility-maximizer. The novel feature
of their work is to include the wage in an alternate job as an

additional explanatory factor and the hours worked in the
alternate job as an additional control variable.    They do not
yet have an analytical solution to their model. Another
novelty is thund in the work of Clark and Johnson, whose point
of departure is to introduce a family context.     (All other
researchers considered a single individual's problem.) Like
Gustman and Steinmeier, they have a variable—hours life cycle
                                —30—


  model of a utility-maximizer; and, they too have been unable

  to obtain an analytical solution.


  B. Comparing the Structures
     1. The Control Instrument

      Most models of pensions and retirement assume that older
 workers must choose between full—time work and zero work.
 These so-called "age—of—retirement models" are useful since
 they are capable of capturing many of the interesting life

 cycle aspects of income opportunities and consequent work

 patterns. Five theoretical models have gone beyond this age—

 of-retirement specification to consider part—time work and
 variable hours models. Sammartjno (1978) and Clark and
 Johnson discuss the hours decision explicitly in a life cycle

 context; Reimers considers the hours decision implicitly
 inwhat is otherwise an age-of—retirement model; Boskin and
Hurd evaluate semi—retirement as an option to full retirement,

but do not take a life cycle approach; and Gustman and Stein—
meier allow for variable hours on the main job and on an

alternate job. Unfortunately, their theoretical models are
not yet very informative on the factors making one hours path
more likely than another, for the following reasons. Sainmartino
assumes that hours of work decline smoothly to zero, Reimers
does not display the hours path at all, Boskin and Hurd do not

examine changes in hours over time, and Gustman and Steinmeier
and Clark and Johnson were unable to solve analytically the

optimal control model they had set up. More research is needed

on the forces leading alternatively to discrete switches from
full—time work to zero work, from full—time work to part—time,
                             —31—


 or to smoothly declining hours paths.
      2. The Objective Function

          a. Multiperiod or Not? Since retirement and life-
 time labor supply are life cycle decisions, they must be

 modeled in a multiperiod framework. The earliest models
 did not do this; they were limited to one period only.

Burkhauser (in his dissertation) presented the first genuine
life cycle model of retirement. His contribution to the
literature was to demonstrate that the decision of when to

retire depends on the present discounted value (PDV) of
alternative pension streams. However, he unduly restricted
the choice set by considering only the value of retiring today
as opposed to retiring at the age of compulsory retirement.
A life cycle approach suggests that someone facing mandatory
retirement should also consider whether it might be even
better to retire at some intermediate age; workers not subject

to mandatory retirement should also examine the advantages
of deferred retirement at all possible ages. All life cycle

models after Burkhauser's have recognized that an anlysis of

retirement options should consider all possible retirement dates.

         b. Does the Utility Function Value Leisure? Some
authors (Hemming, Fields and Mitchell) consider income-

maximization models, thereby assuming the indivudal places no
value on leisure.' Income-maximization models highlight the

effects of the budget constraint (pensions and earnings) on


'Models in which people are assumed to maximize Social Security
 wealth or private pension assets also leave aside the utility
 value of leisure.
                             —32—


retirement. And, as Hemming notes (p. 171): "Although it
is fairly straightforward to incorporate leisure in the model
it can be shown that it does not affect the qualitative nature

of the results." Most models, however, explicitly introduce
leisure as well as income (or consumption) as argument in the

utility function.
          c. How Does Leisure Enter the Utility Function?
      The most general approach is to express utility as a
function of each period's consumption and leisure, as we did
earlier: U =            Further specification is often helpful.
The most common one is to impose intertemporal separability:
U =
       U(Ct,Lt); U1>O, U11<O, U2>O, U22<O. Sometimes, within—
period separability appears: U =          41(Lt); '> 0, q"< 0,
p'> 0, p"< 0. The previous specifications are particularly
well—suited to variable hours models. However, in age—of—
retirement models, a lifetime utility function is sometimes
used instead: U = U(PDVY, RET), U1> 0, U1< 0, U2> 0, U< 0,
where PDVY is the present discounted value of lifetime income
or consumption and RET is the length of the retirement

period. In the age-of—retirement models, where additional
leisure can only be obtained by working fewer periods, a
lifetime utility function, unlike the others, allows for

diminishing marginal utility of leisure across periods. For
this reason, we regard the lifetime utility function as the
most appropriate in an age-of-retirement context.
      3. The Budget Constraint
      The life cycle model presentedinSection I maintained
that the steams of several economic variables are essential
                             —33-.



 to determining the budget constraint.   They are: the earnings
 stream (net of taxes), the (net) private pension and Social

 Security benefits that could be received at different ages,
 the contributions to private pensions and Social Security,
 and (where relevant) the wage that could be earned on an

 alternate job. No theoretical study in the literature has
 done this.

      Two problems stand out. First, some models consider
 Only the current values of economic variables, overlooking

 their streams over time. This is less frequently a problem
 in the theoretical literature than it is in the empirical

 literature reviewed below, where streams of explanatory
variables rarely appear.

     Second, theoretical studies vary in the way they in—
corporate pensions in the budget constraint. Some require

actuarial neutrality of pensions while others do not impose
a dollar-for.-.dollar linkage between benefits and contributions;
we prefer the latter, both for its theoretical generality and
for its institutional realism. Another issue is whether models
allow pension benefits per year to rise if the individual

retires later. Most models have this feature but reservation
wage models do not. Once again, theoretical generality and

institutional realism argue in favor of such a specification.
A final feature, the fact that most individuals are eligible
to receive pension benefits only after retiring, has been
included in most theoretical models.

     4. The Decision Rule

    The rules characterizing the optimal age of retirement
are derived in most moddls by maximizing the objective function
                               —34—


subject to a budget constraint and the available instruments.
This is as it should be. Some models, however, use ad hoc
rules instead. For example, the asset—maximization decision
rule holds that the optimal retirement date is that which
maximizes the asset value of pension benefits. Other criteria
for determining the optimal age of retirement are even less
appropriate. Two such rules are: "Retire when the replacement
rate is maximized" and "Retire when pension benefit comes to
equal earnings." These alternate rules are not derived directly
from maximization of the objective function, and Fields
and Mitchell (1981) show they err systematically.
           c. Results of the Models: How Pensions and Earnings
                                     1
                Affect Retirement.

        It is often assumed that higher wages lead to later

retirement and higher pension benefits (from Social Security
or private pensions) to earlier retirement. This presumption
has been challenged and shown to not necessarily be true at
three levels:

        1. The "Base Case World." [Feldstein, Bur.bidge and

Robb, Crawford and Lilien]. If pensions are actuarially neutral,
capital markets perfect, and lifetimes known with certainty,
the pension system leaves the budget constraint unchanged and
hence does not affect the individual's choices of lifetime

consumption and leisure and the corresponding amount of lifetime
work.


'These comparative dynamic predictions are for an age-of-retirement
 framework where the individual either works full time or else
 withdraws from market work altogether. Models which allow part-
 time work have not yielded meaningful comparative dyanmic results.
                              —35—

     2. The Income-Maximizer.        [Hemming, Fields and Mitchell]
The income maximizer does not value leisure. Consequently,

a change in pension or earnings has no income effect, only
substitution effects. Several theoretical predictions on
comparative dynamics are available for the income maximizer:1
     (a) If pension benefits are increased exogenously, by
          a constant number of dollars for each possible
          retirement age, then the retirement alternative
          becomes more attractive and the individual is
          induced to retire earlier. This is an ordinary
          substitution effect in response to changes in the
          level of pension benefits.

     (b)   If pension benefits are increased exogenously, by
           a non—uniform number of dollars for each possible
           retirement age, two substitution effects obtain.
           The ordinary substitution effect favors retirement.
           In addition, an intertemporal substitution effect
           arises since the individual now has a different
           amount to gain if he postpones retirement. If,
           for instance, pension benefits increased by a
           constant percentage at each age, the intertemporal
           substitution effect would encourage delayed retire—
           irtent, because more is to be gained by retiring later.
           In opposition, the ordinary substitution effect en-
           courages earlier retirement. On net, the effect
           of such a tilt in the benefit formula may lead
           to earlier or later retirement, depending on which
           effect dominates. Thus pension benefit increases
           of this form have an ambiguous impact on retirement.2

     Cc) An exogenous increase in earnings ceteris paribus
          raises the opportunity cost of retiring. Therefore,
          the income-maximizing individual would substitute
          in favor of the (relatively higher) net earnings
          stream and away from the pension stream, implying
          that he is more likely to retire later.

     Cd) An exogenous drop in pension contributions, ceteris
         paribus, has the identical effect as in (c), and
         produces a substitution response favoring later
         retirement.


1Thecomnparative dynamics reported here apply to workers who
 do plan to retire during their lifetime; individuals who plan
 never to work or never to retire may not respond to marginal
 changes in earnings or pensions.
2Specific examples illustrating these points are presented in
 Fields and Mitchell (1981).
                               —36—


     (e) The higher is the wage in a post-retirement job,
          the greater is the value of leaving the principal
          employer. Defining retirement as the date of
          leaving the principal employer and accepting a
          pension, an income-maximizer is more likely to
           retire earlier.,1

     3. The Utility-Maximizer [Sheshinki, Burbidge and Robb,
Crawford and Lilien, Fields and Mitchell, MacDonald and Carliner].
For the case of a utility maximizer, satisfaction is derived
from the leisure as well as income. In this case, when the

earnings stream and/or pension stream changes, income effects
arise in addition to the substitution effects, producing even

fewer unambiguous conclusions.

     (a)   If pension benefits increase for every retirement
           age by a constant number of dollars, then ceteris
           paribus, both ordinary substitution and income
           effects are present. By the substitution effect,
           retirement is now more attractive, so the individual
           tends to retire earlier. By the income effect, full
           lifetime wealth is now higher and the individual
           tends to buy more of normal goods; if leisure is
           a normal good, he would buy more by working fewer
           periods. Thus both the substitution and income
           effects work in the same direction; a utility
           maximizer would tend to retire earlier in response
           to an increase in his pension benefits by a fixed
           number of dollars per year.

     (b) If pension benefits are increased by a non-uniform
          amount, in addition to the effects cited for the
          income—maximizer in (2.b), an income effect is now
          also present. The pension increase raises his
         wealth, and the income effect leads him to retire
          earlier. This tends to reinforce the ordinary
          substitution effect, which also favors earlier
          retirement. But because the intertemporal substitution
         effect may be positive and large, the effect of a
         non—uniform pension increase on the age of retirement
          is still ambiguous for a utility—maximizer.

     (c)   If earnings are increased £xogenously, two offsetting
           effects obtain for a utility-maximizer. As in the
           case of the income maximizer, there is a substitution


'An income—maximizer would never stop working if he could
 simultaneously receive a pension from his principal employer
 and earn a positive net• wage in a post—retirement job.
                             —37—


          effect: because the payoff to working is greater,
          the substitution effect facors later retirement.
          However, the utility-maximizer also has an income
          effect: after working the first period, the
          individual's wealth is greater, and the income
          effect tends to make the individual increase con-
          sumption of leisure and retire earlier. Thus, in
          general, for a utility—maximizer, the effect of
          increased earnings on retirement is theoretically
          ambiguous. This ambiguity has not been recognized
          by others who have looked at the comparative dynamics
          of this problem.

      (d) An exogenous drop in pension contributions, ceteris
          paribus, is also theoretically ambiguous for the same
          reasons as in (c) : the substitution effect favors
           later retirement and the income effect favors earlier
          retirement.

      (e) The higher are earnings on a post—retirement job,
           the greater are the opportunity costs of remaining
          with the principal employer and of leaving the labor
           force completely. The incentives are therefore to
          accept a pension from the principal employer earlier,
          hastening retirement by the age—of—pension—acceptance
          definition. The individual may or may not leave
          the labor force earlier, depending on his response
          to the increment to his lifetime income. Thus,
          this too has an ambiguous effect.
D. Theoretical Conclusions

     Life cycle theory has guided most existing theoretical
models of the effects of pensions and earnings on retirement.

Accordingly, in these models, how much work to do in each of
T periods of life depends on conditions in each and every
period.

     A special case of lifetime labor supply modeling has

proved particularly tractable: the so-called "age—of—retirement
models." In this class of models, labor supply within a
period is dichotomous: the individual either works a specified
number of hours or doesn't work at all. Interesting results
for the effects of pensions on retirement emerge only from

the age—of-retirement literature. In contrast, variable hours
models have been unsuccessful in taking account of the effects
                                —38—


 of pensions on labor supply.

     Theory suggests that six economic factors——-the net
wage stream on the main job, the net wage stream on an alternate

job, net private pension benefits, Social Security benefits,
private pension contributions, and Social Security contributions-—
play a central role in determining the age of retirement. Of
these, three have received serious consideration; they are the

wage stream on the main job, private pension benefits, and
Social Security benefits. The other three--the wage stream

on an alternate job, private pension contributions, and Social
Security contributions-——have largely been ignored.
     How each of these variables enters into the retirement

decision has undergone a change of perception in the theoretical
literature. First generation models held that higher wages
induce later retirement and higher pension benefits induce
earlier retirement. More recent theoretical developments
have shown that these earlier surmises were not necessarily

correct. Theory has now shown that some wage increases can
lead to earlier retirement and some to later retirement.

Theory has also now shown that some pension increases lead to
earlier retirement and some to later retirement. These (ceteris
paribus) results may be summarized as follows:1

 pensions, perfect capital markets lifetime known with certainty)

111. Empirical Models in the Literature

      A. Specifications
     This section, and the table on the following page,

summarize several key features pertaining to empirical
retirement models. The next section reviews specific empirical
findings on the determinants of retirement.

     The table indicates clearly the great variety of dependent
variables examined in the literature. Most authors focus on
a simple probability of retirement, as measured at some
particular time, either on the survey date, some other year,
or by the time the individual attains a specified age.
Typically the definition of retirement is a labor force measure,

though a few authors equate accepting a pension with retirement.
Some models expand the choice set under examination to include

more options; for instance, a 3—way model involving retirement,
semi-retirement and full time work is the focus of the analyses
by Boskin, Hamermesh, Burkhauser and Quinn, and Gustman and

Steinmeier. Still other authors contemplate job change
patterns as a method of examining retirement (Burtless and

Hausman, for instance). Finally, a couple of empirical analyses
use a continuous variable such as hours of work (in the survey
week, for instance) as the labor supply measure of interest.

None of these summary measures of lifetime labor supply is
obviously superior to the others. No study examines hours of
work patterns in all possible years, as would be consistent

with the general theoretical life cycle labor supply model
sketched in Section I and II above. Despite the great diversity
of ways to define and analyze retirement, only Gustman and
                             —41—


 Steinmeier evaluate systematically the different empirical
 results produced by different definitions of retirement.     Further
 work along these lines would be useful.

      Empirical models also differ according to the ways in
which they specify the economic variables postulated to
 influence retirement. Consider the six theoretical variables
which theory suggests determine older workers' labor supply——
namely, the net wage stream on the current job, the net wage
stream on an alternative lob, the net private pension benefit
and contribution streams, and the Social Security benefit
and contribution streams. To date, no empirical study takes
into account the current values of all six variables, let
alone their streams over time. For instance, Burkhauser's

(1976) work does a good job in using a discounted flow of
after—tax earnings, but assumes that the worker retired at
age 65 so earnings at other ages and in other jobs are ignored.
Gustman and Steinmeier are careful to include a wage rate on

post—retirement job, but omit consideration of taxes and
earnings streams. Measures of retirement benefits used in
the literature have some of the same drawbacks. Kotlikoff
nets out payroll taxes from a discounted flow of Social Security
benefits, which is more complete than others' measures; however,

he considers that variable for only one retirement date.

Pellechio (1981) and Burkhauser and Quinn do the best job of

including both private pension and Social Security income streams,
as well as changes in these streams if retirement were to be

postponed one year. Nonetheless changes in these streams if
retirement were postponed more than one year are ignored.

     It is clear then, that most writers use only current
values of explanatory variables, rather than the theoretically
appropriate streams of economic variables over the individual's
remaining lifetime. The implication is that most empirical
studies suffer from omitted variables and measurement error
that may well bias results; implications of these problems
should be examined by future researchers.

     In order to address many of these issues, however,
what is required is more and better data on the determinants
of older workers' labor supply patterns than are now available.
Existing surveys are deficient on several counts: they provide
incomplete earnings data, they often contain too little in-

formation to determine Social Security benefits, and generally
reveal next to nothing about the private pension plan rules

confronted by employees. Some surveys are very sketchy indeed,
reporting only whether a worker is eligible for a private
pension or Social Security rather than benefit levels and the
structure of benefits as retirement is postponed. Others do
more: for instance, the LRHS (see Table) can be used to

compute Social Security benefits, but contains only sketchy
private pension data. The Auto Workers' sample, on the other

hand, may be used to derive benefits for different retirement
ages but is silent on Social Security benefits to which
workers are entitled. Most surveys contain no information on
contribution schedules for private pension plans at all, and
often do not report enough data to determine tax rates for
individual workers. In part, these data problems account
for the failure of empirical analysts to include all the
                                —45—


    relevant life cycle variables in empirical models. More
    complete survey information on workers' characteristics, and
    the structures of their earnings, pension and Social Security

    benefit streams would be invaluable.

         B. Empirical Results
         This section briefly summarizes what we have learned
    empirically about the effects of economic variables on
    older workers' labor supply. Of special interest are estimates
    of the impact of wages, pensions, and Social Security on

    retirement.1 As we have shown above, the life
                                                  cycle context
requires that the empirical analyst consider the theoretically

important streams of wage and retirement
                                            income. Lacking this,
we conclude at the outset that most of the empirical studies
do no tell us much about the effects of wage and pension

streams on retirement behavior.     Therefore, this discussion

a
Some of the studies discussed below,
                                     and others in the
  literature, develop empirical models of expected rather than
  actual labor supply patterns. For instance Reimers used the
 planned age of retirement as a dependent variable, as did
 Kotljkoff and Hall and Johnson. One problem with this is
 that many individuals report that they never will retire,
 empirical analysts sometimes make ad hoc assumptions aboutyet
-when retirement will actually take place. For instance,
 Kotlikoff assigns a retirement date of age 70 to those workers
 who state that they will
                           never retire. However, a more funda--
 mental problem is that planned retirement ages differ sub-
 stantially from many workers' actual retirement ages. Reimers
 Concludes that "the connection between expected and actual
 behavior is loose. Most men predict their   own retirement date
wrong." (p. 150). In addition she finds that the prediction
 error is not associated with
                               wage and pension variables in
any significant way. A systematic analysis of the factors
Tnaking planned and actual retirement dates differ is a worth-
while endeavour for future researchers.               -
                            —46—

is confined to an overview of the partial information
             1
available.

     Wages. Two kinds of wages influence retirement:
the wage stream available on the workerts present job, and
the wage stream available from some alternative employer.2
     A parallel shift in the wage profile on the present job
has both substitution and income effects and they work in

opposite directions.   An increase in the rate of wage growth
has an additional intertemporal substitution effect, which,

by itself, leads to postponed retirement. Thus, theory
suggests that the present job's wage stream (including both
wage level and wage growth) affects the age of retirement
and that both of these effects are ambiguous in sign. None-

theless, most analysts include current wage only and hypothesize
that the effect of a higher current wage is later retirement.

     From theory, a higher wage available from an alternative

employer encourages earlier retirement from the present job,
since income and substitution effects work in the same direction
for the decision to leave the principal employer; however, a

higher wage from an alternative employer has an ambiguous effect


1Another empirical study on pensions is that of Schiller and
 Weiss..(1979). We exclude it because the authors do not have avail-
 able information on whether a worker left to retire, whether
 he quit, or whether he was laid off or fired from his firm.
 Thus it is not informative on the effects of pensions on
 retirement.
2Presumably, net or disposable earnings are the relevant
 economic variable to use, after having substracted income
 and Social Security taxes, and required pension contribu-
 tions if any. However, net earnings have been used in
 few empirical studies.
                            —47—


on the date of labor force withdrawal, since income and
substitution effects work in opposite directions for the
withdrawal decision. Most empirical analysts in the retire-
ment field examine the effects of wages on the main job only.

However, one study, by Gustman and Steinmeier, exploits the
longitudina,l character of panel data to impute wages avail-

able in alternative jobs.

    Turning to empirical results, we find:
     Current Wages. Many studies discern no statistically
significant effect of changes in the current wage: Cotterman,
Hurd and Boskin, Quinn, and Reimers are in this group.
Pellechio (1981') found that current wages had a statistically

insignificant effect on retirement for all age groups but one,
the over—65 (where the effect was negative). Gustman and
Steinmeier do not report significance levels but state that
the current wage measures they use had no impact on the probability
of retirement. On the other hand several studies find that
higher current wages deter retirement in a statistically

significant way: studies reaching this conclusion are Boskin,
Boskin and Hurd (with their gross wage measure), Burkhauser
(1980), Burkhauser and Quinn, Clark and Johnson, Kotlikoff,
Pellechio (1978), and Sammartino (1980). One study reaches

the opposite conclusion, finding that higher current wages
have a statistically significant effect inducing earlier
retirement (Boskin and Hurd's net wage Tneasure)) Empirically,
higher wage levels do not have a systematically strong impact


'The study by Hall and Johnson finds that the current hourly
 wage was positively and significantly associated with planned
 earlier retirement.
                              —48—



on retirement, though when statistically significant, higher
wages result in later retirement.

     Wage Streams. The disagreement over empirical results
is reiterated in studies that develop a measure of the wage
stream available to a worker on his present job. Burkhauser
(1976,1979) concludes that a worker has a significantly higher

probability of continuing to work when the present value (PV)
of the earnings stream rises. Gordon and Blinder agree with
this conclusion but present rio significance levels for their

retirement results. Pellechio (1981) finds that higher PV of
earnings has no effect on any groups, except males over age
65, where the effect is to reduce the likelihood of retirement.1

Higher wage streams, when statistically significant, tend to
encourage later retirement.

     Wages from an Alternative Employer. The one study with
clearcut answers on this issue is that by Gustman and Steinmeier.

They find that a higher alternative wage has a statistically

significant hut small impact on behavior, by reducing the
probability of withdrawing from the labor force. They do not
present statistical significance levels for the effect of this
wage measure on other behaviors, such as the probability of
leaving the main job.2



'Burtless and Hausman find that workers with higher wage growth
 are significantly less likely to retire, but the fact that
 several wage variables are included interactively in their model
 makes it difficult to sort out a pure wage response.
2Burtless and Hausman include a measure of earnings on an
 alternative job, via an imputed 1977 wage term; however the
 complex nonlinear and interactive ways in which it enters the
 model makes it difficult to sort out the impact on retirement.
                            —49-.



     Contributions. Most of the analysts mentioned above
utilize earnings measures that are gross of pension contributions.

However, when a pension plan requires workers to contribute,
the worker's net pay is less than his gross pay. In the model
by Boskin and Hurd, current gross earnings are reduced by the
Social Security payroll tax, and they find that increases
in the net wage significantly encourage retirement.' Pellechio
(1981) finds a similar result with a different variable; he

uses the PV of payroll taxes a worker has paid over his life-
time until the present as a separate regressor, and concludes

that lower taxes significantly encourage retirement.2 Only
one empirical piece, Gordon and Blinder's, directly examines
private pension contributions in a retirement model.3 -However,
these authors assume that benefits eoual contributions for

each individual, so that the separate impacts of pension benefit
and cost streams are impossible to disentangle.

     Social Security. Theory suggests that a higher value of
Social Security benefits at first eligibility (age 62) induces
earlier retirement, whereas the effect of a higher rate of in-
crease in Social Security benefits is ambiguous. Empirical
evidence, though limited, is available on each of these propo-
sitions. The results are inconclusive.


'Kotlikoff uses yet a different earnings measure to evaluate
 the determinants of expected retirement ages. This is an
 annual labor earnings term which is net of income taxes but
 gross of both the employer's and employee's Social Security
 contribution. The interpretation of such a wage measure is
 unclear, since retirement depends on a comparison of net
 returns from work vis a vis pension income.
      variable is tautologically endogenous because when a worker
 retires earlier, he pays payroll taxes for fewer years.
3The pension contribution variable is an imputed measure, since
 it was not reported in their data set.
                            —50—


     Some studies used data sets which measured only Social
Security eligibility, not the dollar amount of benefits. Quinn,

as well as Clark and Johnson, discern a positive relationship
between own eligibility for Social Security and retirement.
This finding that Social Security eligibility is associated with
earlier retirement is what theory would predict. A second study

that measured Social Security eligibility finds just the opposite
—--Reimers reports a negative effect of Social Security eligi-
bility on the probability of retirement.
    Other authors utilize measures of dollar benefits for

which the individual is currently eligible but are not able
to measure the streams of Social Security benefits. These
results are in disagreement too: the studies by Boskin, Boskin
and Hurd, and Pellechio (1981) fixxd that higher current Social

Security benefits significantly encourage retirement, whereas
Reimers and Kotlikoff find that higher benefit levels have no

impact on retirement.2
    Following in Feldstein's footsteps, several researchers
develop a measure of the present value of Social Security
benefits (SS) over the remainder of the individual's lifetime.
Typically researchers compute only one value of SSW as of the

date of the survey, or some other date. Pellechio (1978,81) uses
such a measure and finds that SSW significantly encourages the
probability of being retired. This conclusion is reiterated


1Gustman and Steinmeier report eligibility deters retirement
 but do not provide statistical significance levels.
2The variables representing levels of Social Security benefits
 used by Burtless and Hausman are not statistically significant,
 though complex interaction terms make intepretation difficult.
                            —51—


in Burkhauser (1980), and Hurd and Boskin.1 However, Harnerrnesh

and Clark and Johnson reach the opposite conclusion: in these
studies, higher levels of own Social Security wealth signifi-
cantly deter retirement. No significant impact is discerned
by Burkhauser and Quinn, Cotterman, Kotlikoff and Sammartino

(1980).

     Other authors go further in incorporating measures of
Social Security benefits streams available to a worker should
he postpone retirement. Some authors find no effect: for
instance Sarninartino (1980) computes the difference in SSW if

the worker retires one year later, but finds that it does not
significantly influence retirement. The same variable sig-
nificantly encourages retirement in Burkhauser and Quinn, but
deters retirement in Pellechio's (1981) study.

     In summary, our literature review indicates that retire—

inent is affected ambiguously by Social Security eligibility,

by current dc'llar benefits, by Social Security wealth, and
by the change in Social Security wealth. No study includes
values of Social Security benefits available at all possible
retirement dates. Clearly, no empirical conclusion can be
drawn about t.he effects of Social Security on retirement.

     Private Pensions. Theory suggest that a higher private
pension benefit level in the year of first eligibility
induces earUer retirement, whereas the effect of a higher


'Gordon and Blinder's finding is consistent with these four
 but no statistical significance levels are given.
                               —52—


rate   of   increase in private pension benefits is ambiguous.
Evaluating the effects of pensions in empirical data has been
difficult, however, since information on the structures of

private pensions is very poor. Data sets with national
coverage, such as the NLS and the LRHS (see Table) seldom have

information on pension levels, and never report how pension
benefits would change if the worker postponed retirement.
Only the Auto Workers' sample used by Burkhauser provided the

requisite information.
       Because of such data limitations, researchers have often
been limited to constructing eligibility dummies reflecting

private pension coverage) Quinn's research concludes that
people eligible for private pensions are significantly -more
likely to leave the labor force than those without pensions.

This conclusion is reiterated by Gordon and Blinder, as well

as by Gustman and Steinmeier, though neither study reports
significance levels. Clark and Johnson find that males react
as expected (eligibility is posItively associated with retire—
ment), but females who are covered tend to remain in the labor

force.2 On the other hand there is room for diversity of
opinion here too: the studies by Reimers, Burkhauser and Quinn,

and Kotlikoff, report that people with pensions are significantly
less likely to leave the labor force.      Samrnar-tino (1980) finds


1Many empirical studies omit private pension variables altogether;
 see Table.
2The authors suggest that women covered by private pensions may
 be more career oriented than women without this coverage,
 which might explain their lower retirement probability.
                              —53—


 no significant effect of private pension coverage.'

      Three studies, by Boskin, Burtless and Hausman, Sarnmartjno
  (1980) examine the impact of current pension benefit levels.

 Boskin reports that higher benefit levels are significantly
 related to the probability of being retired rather than
 working; the latter two studies however, find no significant
 impact on retirement.

      A few recent studies develop measures of private pension

 wealth, analogous to the SSW variable described above.2
 Clark and Johnson, and Hamermesh, find that higher private
 pension wealth is positively and significantly associated

with retirement, among males. For females, however, Clark
and Johnson discover that higher PPW significantly lowers

the probability of retirement. An equivalent measure in
Cotterman's work, and that of Burkhausr and Quinn, is found
to have no effect on retirement.3

     Three empirical analyses evaluate the PDV of the difference
between the private pension one would receive if one retired now,
and the annual pension that could be received if retirement

were postponed a year. Burkhauser (1976, 1979) reports that
the Auto Workers in his sample retired significantly earlier


1Hall and Johnson report that private pension
                                              eligibility is
 PSotively associated with planned early retirement.
20f course the relevant economic variable is after—tax
                                                       private
 pension amounts, though only one study corrected for taxes
  (Burkhauser, 1979).
3Hurd and Boskin include pensIon wealth in a nonearned income
 variable and find a negative effect on retirement. However,
 the interpretation of this term is difficult since the effect
 of pension wealth is confounded with other nonearned income
 Sources.
                                —54—


when they faced a larger decline in their private pension
wealth as retirement was postponed. Burkhauser and Quinn reach
the same conclusion using the LR}IS data set.

        On balance then, the evidence (when significant) is
reasonably consistent with theory: current eligibility for a
private pension has an ambiguous effect on retirement, but

higher current benefit levels tend to encourage retirement.
However, even the best empirical studies have considered the

patterns of pension benefits only at two possible retirement
ages. No one has modeled the entire stream of pension oppor-
tunities available to the older worker. Better data on private
pension levels and rules are required to derive better estimates
of the effects of pensions on retirement.                 -




        C.   Summary
        In sum, our review of the empirical literature suggests
                        -

that:

        (1) Higher wages from the principal employer, when statis-
             tically significant, are associated with later retirement.
        (2) Higher wages on an alternate job have been considered

             in only one study; they have a small negative effect
             on retirement.

        (3) Contributions to private pensions have not received

             empirical attention independent of benefit streams.
   • (4) Contributions to Social Security have been considered

             independently of Social Security benefits in one
             study, in which they were found to deter retirement.
                            —55—


     (5) Higher Social Security benef its have an amgibuous

        effect on retirement.

     (6) Higher private pension benefits tend to encourage
        retirement though the evidence is somewhat mixed.

     Existing empirical studies have not incorporated even the

majority of the relevant wage and pension variables determining
older workers' life cycle labor supply and retirement patterns,

and hence are subject to serious specification errors. The
links between life cycle theory and empirical analysis are
weak. Data limitations are severe. Until these deficiencies
are remedied, the empirical effects of pensions and earnings
on retirement will remain uncertain.
