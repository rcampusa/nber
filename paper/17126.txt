                                              ABSTRACT

We study a newly released data set of scanner prices for food products in a large Swiss online supermarket.
We find that average prices change about every two months, but when we exclude temporary sales,
prices are extremely sticky, changing on average once every three years. Non-sale price behavior is
broadly consistent with menu cost models of sticky prices. When we focus specifically on the behavior
of sale prices, however, we find that the characteristics of price adjustment seems to be substantially
at odds with standard theory.

                                             Abstract
            We study a newly released data set of scanner prices for food products in a
        large Swiss online supermarket. We find that average prices change about every two
        months, but when we exclude temporary sales, prices are extremely sticky, changing
        on average once every three years. Non-sale price behavior is broadly consistent with
        menu cost models of sticky prices. When we focus specifically on the behavior of
        sale prices, however, we find that the characteristics of price adjustment seems to
        be substantially at odds with standard theory.


1       Introduction
In introductory micro-economic textbooks, prices adjust to equate supply and demand.
When we move to macro-economics, we often qualify this assumption to allow for the pos-
sibility of sticky prices. According to this theory, firms face costs of frequently changing
prices. As a result, they set prices in advance, and adjust them only at (ir)regular inter-
vals, or in face of large shocks. Sticky prices form the core of New Keynesian approaches
to macro-economic modeling. Despite the ubiquity of the sticky price assumption, until
recently, there was little hard micro-economic evidence on the way in which prices adjust,
the frequency at which they adjust, and the determinants of price adjustment. Following
Bils and Klenow’s (2004) seminal study of the US CPI micro data base however, there
has been a rapid growth of new studies of micro price data 1 .

     We discuss the empirical literature on micro price studies below



                                                 1
    One development within this literature is the use of scanner, or electronic price data.
This is particularly attractive, because it gives the transactions price of an individual
product (rather than a category) at very high frequency, so it comes as close as we can
possibly get to the micro-economic concept of the sale price of an exact product. Scanner
price data sets have been examined by Chevalier, Kashyap and Rossi (2003), Eichenbaum
et al. (2011), Broda and Weinstein (2010), Kehoe and Midrigan (2010), and Chevalier
and Kashyap (2011), among others (these papers are discussed more fully below).
    So far however, most of the literature using scanner prices has focused on data sets
from North America (US and Canada). While these results are of great importance,
it may be that pricing behavior and characteristics from other countries give different
results. This paper adds to this literature by looking at a new scanner price data set
from a large on-line retail outlet in Switzerland. Our data cover a variety of food groups
over a four year interval from 2004-2007.
    Our findings present some interesting contrasts to the previous literature. We ag-
gregate our real time data into weekly prices and quantities sold. As in the previous
literature, we find that unconditionally, price changes are very frequent (on average,
prices change every two months). But there is a huge difference between temporary
price changes - changes which are reversed after one week (which we refer to as sales
prices), and more permanent price changes - defined in our study as modal prices within
a quarter, which we call reference prices, following Eichenbaum et al. (2011). Reference
prices changes are extremely infrequent - in our data, on average, reference prices change
only once every three years! Thus excluding sales, we find that prices are extremely sticky
- significantly more so than in other studies.
    We investigate the implications of our data for the relevance of standard menu cost
models of price change. Menu cost models predict that the frequency of price change
should be positively related to average inflation. As argued by Eichenbaum et al. (2011)
and Kehoe and Midrigan (2010), the relevant prices for studying menu cost models should
be reference prices, rather than actual prices. During the sample of our data set, Swiss
CPI inflation was just under 2 percent and did not vary significantly on a year to year
basis. However, we can investigate the implications of inflation at the individual product
category level in determining variations in the frequency of price changes for each different
category of product. Interestingly, for the food groups in our data set, CPI inflation in
Switzerland was negative during the sample. But we find clear evidence that the higher
the absolute level of inflation in a category, the higher the frequency of reference price
changes.
    In addition, we find that for reference prices, there is an unambiguous positive asso-
ciation between the frequency of reference price change and the absolute level of price
changes, both for all prices, and for each category of product in our sample. The more
often reference prices are adjusted, the larger is the size of the adjustment. It is not
clear whether this observation represents a confirmation or a contradiction of standard
menu cost pricing. If variation in the frequency of price adjustment is driven mostly by
differences in the volatility of cost or demand, we should expect to see a positive asso-
ciation between size and frequency. If on the other hand, variation in the frequency of
adjustment is mostly determined by variation in menu-costs, we should expect to see the
opposite.
    While recent literature has been careful about making the distinction between reference

                                             2
prices (or regular prices, in Kehoe and Midrigan’s (2010) terminology) and actual prices,
much less theoretical focus has gone into the explanation of temporary price changes,
which represent the difference between reference prices and actual prices. The classic
model of firm sales is due to Varian (1980). An important recent paper by Chevalier and
Kashyap (2011) adapts Varian’s model of sales in an empirical study of US scanner price
data. They develop a number of clear predictions which follow from firm profit-maximizing
determination of the frequency of sales. Sales should be important in determining the
overall average selling price of a product - defined as the ‘effective price’. Large sales,
(involving substantial reductions in the price of the product) should be relatively infre-
quent. Finally, most sales should involve one product, and coincident sales of two or
more products within a category should be relatively rare.
    We use our data to investigate these implications of the theory of profit-maximizing
sales. Our results are quite striking. We find strong contradictory evidence for all three
predictions. Effective prices of products are very close to reference prices, and far above
sales prices. There is a strong positive association between frequency of sales and size
of sales. Goods that have more frequent sales also have larger sales. Finally, coincident
sales of more than one product is substantially more common in the data than predicted
by the theory. Hence, taken together, our results seem to throw substantial doubt on the
standard theory of sales, leaving a puzzle over the understanding of sales frequency and
size in our data.
    The next section reviews some recent literature in micro pricing. Section 3 describes
our data in detail. Following this, we describe the main characteristics of price adjustment
in our data. Section 5 describes the characteristics of reference prices, and explores the
implication for menu cost models. Section 6 discusses the behavior of sales prices and
compares these to a theoretical model of sales. Some conclusions follow.


2    Literature Review
Our paper is related to a growing recent literature on micro price data. Since the value-
added of our paper is in the alternative data set, it is important to place our work in the
context of the literature. The now seminal paper by Bils and Klenow (2004), using BLS
monthly data for 1995-97 from the US CPI Research Database, finds that the median
duration of prices that cover 70% of the CPI basket is less than 4.3 months, or 5.5 months
excluding sales. They find that the duration of prices is highly heterogeneous, ranging
from 80 months for coin-operated laundry to 0.6 months for gasoline. This contrasts with
the previous consensus estimate of the price stickiness of about one year (Taylor, 1999).
In contrast to their findings, calibrated versions of Calvo and Taylor sticky-price models
tend overpredict inflation persistence and undepredict volatility.
    Klenow and Kryvtsov (2008), using a longer span of BLS micro-data (1988-2004),
document non-sale price changes of 4-7 months on average, and of an order of 10%.
Their findings are in fact close to ours. They find that both the size and probability of
a price change are unrelated to the time since the last price change. This contrasts with
our findings below. In addition, they find that aggregate inflation changes arise from
changes in the size of price changes, rather than the frequency of price changes.
    Nakamura and Steinsson (2008) document 5 “facts” gleaned from the BLS micro-data


                                             3
that can shed light on the relevance of standard menu cost models. They find that a)
median non-sale price change frequency is half of sale frequency, b) a third of non-sale price
changes are decreases, c) the frequency of price increases covaries strongly with inflation
(but not the frequency of price decreases or the size of price changes), d) the frequency
of price changes is highly seasonal, and d) there is no evidence of upward sloping hazard
functions of price functions. Nakamura and Steinsson argue that only the first three facts
are consistent with the menu cost models. Our findings are generally consistent with
Nakamura and Steinsson, save for the extreme stickiness of non-sale prices in our data.
    However, the ability of the BLS monthly micro-data to identify sales-related statistics
remains a concern, given that sales in many retail outlets are offered at much higher than
monthly frequency and given also the fact the BLS data describe an area or category
rather than a single store or a product.
    In contrast to CPI data, scanner price data give exact prices for transactions at the
product level. Using scanner data, Chevalier, Kashyap and Rossi (2003) find that su-
permarket prices (Dominick’s Finer Foods, Chicago area, 1989-1997) fall during seasonal
demand peaks, as margins fall, a relationship which is consistent with “loss-leader” mod-
els of retailer competition but rules out manufacturer behavior as the main driver of this
countercyclical price behaviour.
    On the other hand, Eichenbaum et al. (2011) find that manufacturer behaviour plays
an important role to the extent that it translates to fluctuations in supermarket costs.
Using weekly scanner and cost data from a major US supermarket retailer, they document
considerable inertia in non-sale prices, which they refer to as ‘reference prices’. Reference
prices are sticky for around one year. On the other hand, in their data set, prices including
sales change on average every two weeks around their reference values. One advantage of
the Eichenbaum et al. (2011) paper is that they have access to imputed costs as well as
transactions prices. They argue that sticky costs are the main source of sticky reference
prices. In addition, they find that reference prices are on average re-set so as to maintain
mark-ups within 20% of their desired level.
    Using AC Nielsen prices of 100 products in 7000 US stores of 33 chains in 2004,
Nakamura (2008) decomposes variation in prices. She finds that 16% of it is common
across stores, 65% is common within a chain (but not across chains) and 17 % is id-
iosyncratic. She argues that such little comovement of prices of the same products across
various chains diminishes the role of manufacture-level supply, and demand shocks, and
contradicts menu cost models such as that of Golosov and Lucas (2007) and Klenow and
Kryvtsov (2007).
    There are relatively few explicit models of temporary price changes in the empirical
literature. Kehoe and Midrigan (2010) extend a standard New Keynesian model to repli-
cate both sales- and regular price- dynamics documented in the aforementioned literature.
In their model, firms can deviate from a sticky pre-existing price if they incur a fixed cost.
They do so in response to changes in production costs. However, temporary “micro” price
changes cannot offset monetary policy shocks well, unlike the regular price changes. The
low frequency of the regular changes leads to large real effects of monetary shocks, as well
as a sticky aggregate price level in their model.
    Chevalier and Kashyap (2011) present a model of price setting for substitutable prod-
ucts driven by the heterogeneity of consumer types, which highlights the importance of
sales at a macroeconomic level. Retailers optimally chose pricing plans to optimally seg-

                                              4
ment “bargain-hunters” from the “loyal” buyers who have a strict preference of a brand
in a range of substitutable products. The model’s main prediction is that, because of
the substituting behaviour by a number of buyers, effective prices are substantially below
regular posted prices (which they confirm for a small sample of products). The model
also predicts that sales should be evenly spaced apart and that sales that are more fre-
quent should be of a smaller magnitude, and that sales should not be synchronized within
groups of highly substitutable products.
    Modelling of sales dates back at least to the seminal contribution of Varian (1980),
with randomized pricing (hence sales) used optimally by retailer to segment between the
informed and the uninformed buyers. One feature of Varian’s model is a U-shaped price
density function, which implies a positive relationship between the frequency and the size
of the sale, unlike Chevalier and Kashyap (2011).
    As described in the next section, our study is based on online scanner price data,
which gives exact product description, time of sale, quantity and prices sold. Unlike
Eichenbaum et al. (2010), we have a relatively small group of food product categories.
But within these categories, we have a large number of individual products. In addition,
as in Chevalier and Kashyap (2011), we can identify time and size of sales at the product
level.


3     Data-Description
Our data-set contains 2068 bar codes of products in three categories: beverages, dairy
and pasta. Aside from the bar code, each product has 5 classifications: main category,
subcategory (15, including cocoa, coffee, ice tea, ...), sub-subcategory (101, including decaf
coffee, ground coffee, instant coffee, etc.), and two additional classifications of which the
last one contains the exact product description with weight or volume (e.g., Gatorade
Fitness PET 75cl). The data-set contains transactions for these products in a four-year
period from January 1, 2004 until December 31, 2007. Each transaction includes an exact
time of purchase, bar code, price and quantity purchased.
    We aggregate all transactions into weekly data. Our main results will relate to
products that have more than one year of data, although we also report results for products
with more than one month of data (the results differ little between the two sub-samples).
Focusing on products with more than one year of data narrows our sample to 700 products,
and a total of 1.12 million transactions (about 97,000 weekly data points), while in the
second group (products with more than one month of data) there are 1177 separate
products. Figure 1 plots sample paths of some of the products. As in many other price
data, we see that there appear to be two quite separate types of price changes; relatively
frequent reductions in prices which are reversed quickly, and more permanent changes in
prices. These two different types of price change will form the focus for our discussion of
this data set.
    For the products with over one year of data, the mean duration of the product in
the sample is 149.5 weeks or nearly 3 years. The majority of this sub-sample consists
of products that are present for the full four year sample. Figure 2 plots the histogram
of durations for these products. Goods in the one-year or above sample cover all main
categories and 77 subcategories.


                                              5
4    Frequency of price changes
Our main interest is the way in which prices change. A price change is defined as an event
where there is a difference in price from one week to the next, including prices that are
reversed after a short time. Table 1 documents the features of price changes for the full
group of products as well as for the 3 main subcategories. For all products together, the
monthly frequency of price change is .453, implying that on average prices change every
2.2 months, or 5.5 times per year. This indicates a reasonably frequent degree of price
change, which is in line with other literature (e.g. Eichenbaum et al. 2010). But behind
this average, there is a large degree of heterogeneity in the frequency of price changes
across products. The standard deviation of the monthly frequency of price change in the
sample is .332. This implies a range of price adjustment from every 1.2 months to every
8.3 months. There are 38 products whose prices change less than once a year and 35
products which change price at least 12 times a year. Figure 3 plots the distribution of
the number of price changes per month. With weekly data, monthly frequency exceeds
1 if a product’s price changes at least once a month (which as noted is the case for 35
products). The maximum feasible frequency of price changes in a month with weekly data
is 4, as there are 4.33 weeks in a month on average. In our data, the maximum frequency
is 1.64, while the minimum is 0 (which is the case for 17 products).
    Table 1 also breaks down the sample frequencies into the three main categories. Our
sample (of products with more than 1 year of data) contains 418 products in the category
of beverages, 207 products in dairy and 75 products in pasta. The average sample length
is 154 weeks for beverages, 145 weeks for dairy and 129 weeks for pasta. Yoghurt prices
tend to change least frequently, on average every 2.4 months, followed by beverages (2.25)
and pasta (1.6). However, frequency of price changes of pasta is most disperse. Figure 4
summarizes this information.
    We further separate the products into 12 level-two categories. The average rate of
price adjustment varies from every 1.6 months for pasta to every 12.5 months for tea.
Table 2 shows summary statistics for all categories. Figure 5 plots data time coverage by
category (from a low average of 117 weeks for Energy drinks to a high of 142 weeks for
Syrups), and Figure 6 plots the distributions of monthly price change frequencies.
    Finally we separate the products into 54 level-three categories. Table 3 provides
summary statistics. The number of products within level-three category varies from 1 (in
7 cases) to 47 for energy drinks. The average monthly frequency of price changes varies
from from 0.08 for Black tea to 0.99 for Barilla pasta. The average price changes by the
level-three category are nearly as disperse as all price change frequencies, with the mean
CV of price change frequencies of 0.44.
    There is also a varying degree of heterogeneity of price change frequencies within level-
three categories (the last column of Table 3). The coefficient of variation within each
category is between 0.1 for Nectar juice, (and by construction also 0 for all single-product
categories) to 1.3 for Migros Pasta.
    The last column of Table 1 reports the proportion of all price changes that were price
increases. Slightly over half of price changes were price increases on average over all
categories, and a similar result applies for each category. Again, this reflects the fact
that a lot of price changes in the data were temporary price reductions. We now discuss
the nature of these price changes in more detail.

                                             6
4.1     Temporary Prices and Reference Prices
While the frequency of price changes is relatively high when we look at all price changes, we
also recognize from Figure 1 that many price changes are quickly reversed. The recent
empirical pricing literature has acknowledged the importance of separating temporary
price changes from price changes that are not reversed. Temporary price changes are
associated with sales or promotions that are not necessarily part of the longer term price
markup calculations that firms undertake. Accordingly, we separate these two different
types of price change. We define a temporary price change (or a sale) as any price change
which lasts just one week, where the price after one week returns to the original price2 .
As can be seen in the examples of Figure 1, there are many such instances of temporary
price changes in the data. We argue below that the interpretation of temporary price
changes as sales is appropriate for our data, since in almost all cases, these price changes
involve a fall in price which is later reversed.
    These temporary price changes do not seem to affect the ‘permanent’ price of the
product however. Following Eichenbaum et al. (2011), we refer to this latter price as
the ‘reference price’. In our data set, we define the reference price for any product as
the modal price within each calendar quarter. Reference prices therefore omit temporary
price changes by construction. As discussed by Eichenbaum et al. (2011), we can think
of reference prices as the relevant price that is determined by the firm’s longer term profit
maximization.
    Figure 7 and Table 4 show the equivalent measures of price change frequency as
Figure 2 and Table 1, but now for the reference prices for each category. The first and
major fact to note is that there is an extreme degree of price stickiness in reference prices.
The average monthly frequency of changes in reference prices is 0.027 (for products with
at least 1 year of data). As we saw above, the average monthly frequency of changes in
all prices is 0.45 (the medians are 0.021 and 0.42, respectively). This contrasts sharply
with the findings in the US data. Bils and Klenow (2004) document median duration of
prices of 4.3 months, or 5.5 months excluding sales. Eichenbaum et al. (2011) find median
duration of price changes in supermarket scanner data of about 3 weeks for all prices, but
nearly 1 year for reference prices. Our median durations obtained by the simple inversion
are 37 months (3 years) for reference prices and 2.2 months for all prices3 .
    The extreme price stickiness for reference prices is uniform across the three categories.
Again there is some degree of heterogeneity - the standard deviation of price change
frequencies for all products is 0.034, implying mean durations varying from 20 months
to infinity . Across categories there is also heterogeneity - again with Pasta having the
highest frequency of price changes. Nonetheless, for all categories, the frequency of price
change for reference product prices is an order of magnitude lower than that for actual
prices, and much lower than in other studies.
    Because we do not have data on costs, we cannot calculate the degree to which the
   2
     There are some but very few examples of temporary two week price changes. We omit these from
our measure, since they do not affect any of the results
   3
     Note that for very low price change frequencies, simple inversion under-estimates true duration (see
Baharad and Eden 2004). This implies that prices are even more sticky than suggested here when duration
measures are calculated correctly (to be updated in next draft).




                                                   7
seller allows reference price markups to vary over time in face of variation in costs. The
data set used in Eichenbaum et al. (2011) does have cost data, however, and finds a
considerable degree of markup variation even when reference prices have a much higher
frequency of price change than in our data. This would make it highly unlikely that
reference price stickiness is reflecting constancy of marginal costs.
    What is the average direction of change in reference prices? Table 4 shows that
on average, price changes for reference prices were positive. Over 60 percent of price
changes were price increases. This is what we would expect in an environment with
positive average inflation. Interestingly however, CPI inflation rates corresponding to
the three products in our sample were negative during the sample period. CPI inflation
rates for Switzerland for the products categories over the sample period were negative, for
all three categories. Monthly inflation rates for Beverages and Yoghurts over the sample
averaged at -0.02%, while average monthly inflation for Pasta was -0.014%. Thus, on
average, relative reference prices seem to have been rising over time.
    How large are price changes in these data? Table 5 reports on the size of price changes,
conditional on prices changing. For all price changes, the average absolute price change
is 11.4 percent (median 10.8) percent. There is some variation across categories in
this respect, with price changes for yoghurts being 14.8 percent, while price changes for
beverages being 9.7 percent. As is clear from the illustrations in Figure 1, temporary
price reductions are often countered by exactly offsetting price increases. The mean price
increase in the data is 11.9 percent, while the mean price decrease is 11.5 percent. For
reference prices, the size of price increases and decreases is smaller. Moreover, the size of
decreases in the reference price is larger than the size of increases, and more importantly,
the median price change is significantly lower than the mean price change. This aspect
of the data is developed further below when we look at the relationship between size and
frequency of price change.
    To help comparison with previous studies, Table 6 compares the basic properties of
reference prices in our dataset with two scanner datasets; that of Eichenbaum et al.
(2011), and the Dominicks data set used also in Eichenbaum et al. (2011) and in Kehoe
and Midrigan (2010). In our data, the reference price is substantially more commonly
applied in transactions. Prices are at the reference price almost 90 percent of the time,
compared with 62 percent in Eichenbaum et al. (2011) and 77 percent in the Dominicks
data set. More striking, the reference price does not change in 56 percent of all quarters
in the data. In Eichenbaum et al (2011) and Dominicks data set, the equivalent number
is 10 and 19 percent, respectively. This underscores the large difference in the degree
of price rigidity in our data set and other scanner price data series. In addition, over
80 percent of quantities are sold at the reference price, and over 80 percent of revenue
is collected at the reference price; substantially more than in the other data sets. We
return to this issue in section 6 below when we discuss ‘effective prices’. Finally, in our
data, essentially all non-reference prices are below the reference price. In the two other
data-sets, over one quarter of deviations from the reference price lead to prices above the
reference price. This strongly supports our interpretation of temporary departures from
non-reference price as sales. In section 6 below, we explore in more detail the nature of
sales in our data.

5     Reference Prices and Menu Cost Models
In traditional macroeconomic models of sticky prices, the assumption is that it is costly
for a firm to alter the nominal selling price of its product. Time dependent models assume
an alternation between periods of infinite costs of price change and other periods with
zero costs.of price change. State-dependent models assume that firms always face some
cost of changing its nominal price (its ‘menu cost’), and chooses to alter its price when
the benefit from doing so outweighs the menu cost.
    Neither time or state dependent models can accurately capture the characteristics of
price adjustment described in our data set. Many price change quite frequently, clearly
undermining the idea that there are many periods where the firm cannot change its price.
But this also seems to invalidate the assumption that the firm has a fixed menu cost of
nominal price change and therefore would conserve on costs by keeping the nominal price
constant for long periods. The fact is that in scanner price data, it is hard to argue for
the literal existence of costs of changing the menu of posted prices, and the presence of
substantial episodes of temporary price change suggests that menu costs in a literal sense
cannot account for the behaviour of prices.
    The proposed resolution of this puzzle has been to apply the idea of menu costs not
to the behavior of all prices, but to the changes in the regular or reference prices. So
Eichenbaum et al (2011), Guamaires and Sheedy (2011), and Kehoe and Midrigan (2010)
argue that the appropriate prices relevant for menu cost models are prices that have been
purged of temporary price changes, equivalent to our reference prices. In these papers, the
standard menu cost models are augmented in ways so that firms choose both a reference
price (or price plan, or target price) and at higher frequencies choose to allow prices to
temporarily deviate from this plan. In Eichenbaum et al. (2011), the firm chooses a price
plan that determines the reference price over a fixed interval, and then chooses whether to
engage in temporary departures from the reference price due to idiosyncratic cost shocks,
within the life of the reference price. In Guamaires and Sheedy (2011), different groups
of consumers have different elasticities of demand for a firms product. As a result, there
are multiple prices over which a firm may profit maximize, and firms engage in a mixed
strategy over the setting of these prices. In their model, average prices within a period
are set as in Calvo (1983). In Kehoe and Midrigan (2010), there is a distinction between
‘regular price’ and ‘posted price’. They assume that there is a fixed cost of changing
regular prices and another cost of changing posted prices. One common aspect of all
three papers is that the influence of aggregate macro shocks should be seen in reference
prices (or regular prices), which change at lower frequencies than actual prices.
    Given this reinterpretation of price stickiness, it is reference prices rather than all prices
that should be consistent with standard menu cost models. What are the characteristics
of menu-cost models, and how do the relate to the observable characteristics of reference
prices in our data? The standard menu cost model (e.g. Sheshinski and Weiss 1977,
Gertler and Leahy, 2008, Golosov and Lucas, 2007) predicts that firms change prices in-
frequently, at irregular intervals that depends on both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks.
The observable features of the data relate to the frequency and size of price changes, and
to the degree of asymmetry between price increases and decreases. The frequency of price
change should be greater, the higher is the aggregate rate of inflation. Higher aggregate
inflation should also increase the absolute size of price changes, since with higher inflation,

                                                9
once prices change, they have to adjust by more. In addition, higher variability in either
demand or cost shocks should increase the frequency of price changes, at the same time
as increasing the absolute size of price changes. It should increase the frequency, since in
standard Ss type pricing models (e.g. Sheshinski and Weiss 1977) more volatile demand
or cost will involve hitting the upper and lower bands for price adjustment more often.
At the same time, higher positive or negative shocks should involve more absolute price
adjustment. On the other hand, if variations in the frequency of price adjustment across
different products or firms is determined primarily by variation in the size of the menu
cost, then we should anticipate to see a negative relationship between frequency and size
of price adjustment, since a small (large) menu cost will involve frequent (infrequent) but
small (large) price adjustments.
    How do these predictions of menu cost models apply to our data on reference prices?
The impact of aggregate inflation on the frequency of price change represents a time
series channel, and there is not a sufficiently long sample or enough variation in aggregate
Swiss inflation to test this causal linkage. We can alternatively look at differential inflation
rates across the products categories based on disaggregated CPI data by products groups.
Specifically, we obtain category- specific CPI series for each of the main categories in our
data, over the same sample as our data coverage. Movements in aggregate CPI categories
may be thought of as roughly proxying for category-specific costs facing the firm. Higher
average inflation in each category should then be associated with more frequent reference
price adjustment by category.
    Table 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the relationship between inflation and frequency of
price change. From the Swiss CPI, we obtained data on 8 CPI groups which closely
accord with equivalent categories in our sample. The Table shows, for each category,
summary statistics for the CPI for that category, and summary statistics for monthly
reference price change frequency in that category.
    As we see, all 8 CPI categories exhibit negative average monthly inflation rates over the
sample. The most negative are pasta and ”cocoa and similar drinks”, at -0.15% per month
on average. The correlation of average monthly inflation and average monthly reference
price change frequency is -0.69.. The negative correlation applies because inflation rates
are negative. Note however that three of the categories in the Table have either one or
two products in them. If we drop these, the correlations becomes -0.97.
    Although this is just a small sample of all our data, it does suggest that reference
product prices change more frequently for products with higher inflation rates. This is
what we would expect from a menu cost model, if category inflation rates act as a proxy
for costs.
    Now, let us address the relationship between size and frequency of reference price
changes. Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between the absolute size of reference price
changes and the frequency of reference price change in our data, both for the full sample,
and by individual categories of products. The results are quite unambiguous. There
is a strong positive correlation between size of reference price changes and frequency
of reference price change. Goods whose reference prices change more frequently also
have higher absolute percentage reference price changes. Table 8 indicates that this
relationship is highly significant. It reports results from a regression of frequency of
reference price change with average absolute percentage reference price change. Figure 9
also makes clear that this relationship holds across individual categories of products.

                                              10
    This relationship suggest that to the extent that the menu cost model is an appropriate
interpretation of reference price changes, differences in the frequencies of reference price
change are driven by differences in the volatility of cost or demand shocks, and not by
differences in the cost of price change. Recall that if heterogeneity in frequency of
price change were principally generated by heterogeneity in menu costs, we would see the
opposite relationship between size and frequency.
    This discussion is based on the assumption that reference prices, rather than observed
prices, are the relevant variable for understanding the menu cost model. But even if we
took the view that all price changes (and not just reference prices) were the more relevant
variables in the relationship between size and frequency of price changes, we will show
below that we still get the same positive relationship between frequency and size.


6       Temporary Price Changes
Let us now focus on temporary price changes. Recall that we define these as episodes
where the price changes for a one week period, and then goes back to the original level
for the next week4 . Table 6 established that 96 percent of non-reference prices are below
the contemporaneous reference price. Clearly therefore, we may think of temporary
price changes away from the reference price as sales prices. .And we have seen that price
changes coming from sales are far more common than reference price changes.
    It is also the case that price changes associated with sales are typically bigger than
reference price changes. As noted in Table 4, the median price increase and decrease for
all prices is around 11 percent, while the corresponding changes for references prices are
5 and 7 percent.
    We have already discussed the reason why the typical menu cost model should probably
not be applied to the analysis of sales. From the observations of frequent sales, it seems
hard to argue that there are substantial costs to the firm of reducing the nominal price of a
product for purposes of a sale. But then what theory should be used to understand sales?
The classic model of sales in economics is developed in Varian (1980). A recent paper by
Chevalier and Kashyap (2011) adapts Varian’s modeling framework along an empirical
dimension to analyse the occurrence of sales in scanner price data. In their model, there
are two types of consumers. ‘Loyal’ consumers purchase their favorite brand in every
period and never substitute for other products. ‘Bargain hunters’ on the other hand are
willing to substitute across products and moreover, do not necessarily make a purchase
in every period. They can wait for a sale price of a product within a given category of
products and then buy in bulk. Their model predicts two key features of the data. First,
‘effective prices’ of a product, defined as the average of the price at which the product is
purchased where the averaging is over sales and non-sales purchases, is considerably lower
than the regular price (which is the reference price in our terminology). Secondly, sales
of similar brands (or, in our terminology, products within narrowly defined categories)
tend not to be coincident - a firm will typically offer a sale price on only one product
within a category at any moment in time, ensuring that it will absorb the accumulated
demand from bargain hunters for this category, while at the same time maintaining a
    4
    There are some instances of two week price changes. In the current version of the paper, we ignore
those events. None of the results discussed here are affected by the absence of two week price changes.


                                                  11
high price paid from the loyal costumers for other products within the category. A third
prediction of the model is that more frequent sales tend to involve less price discounting
(smaller reductions in price relative to the regular price). The intuition is as follows.
Bargain hunters have a lower valuation for any product relative to loyal consumers, and
are willing to wait to consume the product. If the valuation difference is quite small, then
sale price reductions are small, but sales are quite frequent, since they are quite lucrative
(they absorb demand from shoppers at a rather high price). But if shoppers have a very
low valuation of the product, it is necessary to have large sales. In this case, the sales
are quite infrequent, since it is necessary to have a lot of accumulated demand before the
sale becomes profitable. Hence, the model predicts a clear negative association between
the frequency of sales and the size of price reductions in sales.
    We now examine how these predictions are borne out in our data. Beginning with the
last prediction, Figure 10 plots the relationship between the size of price changes for sale
prices and the frequency of sale price change. Just as in the case of reference prices, there
is a clear positive relationship between size of price changes and the frequency of price
change. That is, products that have more frequent sales have also larger sales. This is
confirmed in Table 8, where the relationship between size and frequency across products is
seen to be highly statistically significant. Hence, our data seem to be sharply at variance
with the theory of sales based on using price reductions as a device to absorb accumulated
demand on the part of bargain hunting consumers. If this were the case, we’d expect
to see the opposite relationship between frequency and size; infrequent sales would be
associated with extreme bargain hunters, and would therefore involve very substantial
discounts relative to the regular price.
    The next question concerns the relationship between the sales price and the ‘effective
price’. Given that sales prices are on average 11 percent below the reference price, then
we would infer that the effective price would be somewhere in between the reference price
and 11 percent below the reference price. As argued by Chevalier and Kashyap (2011),
sales are an essential part of the price plan if the effective price is substantially below the
regular price. We measure the effective price by the average price actually paid for each
product, by combining transaction price and quantity sold for each product over the full
sample. Table 9 illustrates that the median effective price over all products is somewhat
less than 2 percent below the reference price. Figure 11 plots the distribution of effective
price discounts over the whole sample. Thus, the reference price does not, on average give
a significantly misleading view of the effective price for products. When broken down
into different categories, we find some heterogeneity. The median effective price for pasta
involves a larger discount of 2.7 percent. In comparison to Chevalier and Kashyap, our
results indicate a much smaller difference between reference prices and the effective price.
    The final prediction we look at is the degree of coincidence of sales for products within
narrowly defined categories. Recall that the theory predicts a preponderance of single
product sales. Here we also find quite striking contradictions to the predictions of the
standard model. Broadly speaking, we find that sales tend to come in groups. When
one product within a category experiences a sale, then so do the other products, at least
much more so than would occur if sales in products were chosen independently. This
represents a striking contrast to the Dominicks scanner data examined by Chevalier and
Kashyap (2011).
     Following Chevalier and Kashyap (2011), our approach is as follows. For each cate-

                                              12
gory of products, imagine that there N separate products. Over the sample, each product
j ∈ N has a sale with frequency pj < 1. If sales of a particular product within a cate-
gory were completely independent, then for each category, then at each period, we would
have zero sales with probability ΠN  j (1 − pj ), sale of product N only with probability
  N −1                                                            N −2
Πj=1 (1 − pj )pN , sale of product N − 1 only with probability Πj=1    (1 − pj )(1 − pN )pN −1 ,
                                                    N −2
sale of product N and N − 1 with probability Πj=1 (1 − pj )pN −1 pN etc. Thus, we can
conduct a full frequency distribution for zero, single, and multiple coincident sales using
the independence assumption We can then compare this with the observed incidence
of zero, single and multiple sales over the sample, for each category of products. In
the model of Chevalier and Kashyap, if sales are chosen to maximize profits, balancing
the loyal shoppers against the bargain hunters, then the incidence of single product sales
will be greater than that predicted by the independent distribution, and the incidence
of zero and multiple product sales will be less than that predicted by the independent
distribution.
    Figure 12 and Table 10 illustrate these results. Strikingly, Figure 11 strongly rejects
the model predictions. The incidence of single product sales in the data is below that
predicted by an independent distribution, for every category of product, while the inci-
dence of zero, or more than two coincident sales is above the independent distribution.
For coincident sales of two products only, the results are evenly mixed, with 16 categories
having two-product sales with frequency less than that predicted by the independent
distribution, and 16 having two-product sales more than predicted by the independent
distribution.
    Table 10 illustrates the same data by each category of product. The conclusion we
arrive at from both Figure and Table is that within categories, the firm tends to combine
sales of products. There are many instances where multiple products, or even all products,
are on sale at the same time. For categories within multiple products, this would be very
unlikely if sales were determined independently across products, and would be a measure
zero observation if we take the model literally. But taking a more general interpretation,
the finding that one product sales occur far less often than predicted by the independent
distribution seems to undermine the theory of sales based on the differentiation of loyal
consumers from strategic bargain hunters.


7     Conclusions
We have provided a first pass at analyzing the behaviour of micro prices from scanner
data at a large European outlet. Compared to other studies, prices are substantially
more sticky in our data. While references prices do seem to accord with implications of
menu-cost models, the behavior of sales prices seems not to be well explained by standard
theory.
    Our study obviously has its limitations. We are focusing only one a relatively narrow
category of products, and all products pertain to just a single retail online firm. Neverthe-
less, within this category of products, there are a large number of different products, and
the coverage is at very high frequency, over a substantial time period. In addition, the
online retailer who provided the data have a market share of approximately 70 percent
of the Swiss grocery online market. So the price data are significantly representative of

                                              13
the Swiss CPI. Hence, the results can throw some light on the nature of price adjust-
ment in retail sales, the importance of sticky prices, and the relevance of sales prices for
macroeconomic models.
