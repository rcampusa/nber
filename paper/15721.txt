                                              ABSTRACT

This paper addresses three issues related to the relative rates of growth in the United States, the European
Union, and China during the four decades between 2000 and 2040. The first concerns the source of
the factors which make it likely that China will continue to grow at a high rate for another generation.
The paper argues that this growth will be the result of both favorable economic and political conditions.
The second concerns the source of declining GDP growth in the original fifteen nations of the European
Union. For these countries, the underlying cause is due in large measure to low fertility rates and an
increase in the dependency ratio. The third issue is the projection of long-term U.S. growth in GDP
at a rate of 3.7 percent per annum.

       Further Comments on The Impact of the Asian Miracle on the Theory of Economic Growth



This paper deals with three principal issues raised by some readers of my NBER working paper, The

Impact of the Asian Miracle on the Theory of Economic Growth (http://www.nber.org/papers/w14967).



    1. Why do I predict that the growth rate of GDP for the EU‐15 will be only 1.2 percent per annum

        between 2000 and 2040?

    2. Why do I believe that U.S. GDP between the same years will grow at 3.7 percent per annum?

    3. Why am I so optimistic about China’s future growth rate, which I put at 8.0 percent per annum

        between 2000 and 2040?



        Let me deal first with my optimistic estimate for China. How and why China will become an

economic colossus has to do not only with the country’s economics, but also with its politics. To begin

with, it helps to divide China’s economy into three major components: agriculture, services, and

industry. Over the 25 years between 1978 and 2003, the growth of labor productivity has been high in

each of these sectors, averaging about 6 percent each year. At the national level, however, output per

worker grew by 9 percent annually over the same period. The national growth exceeded the sectoral

growth rates because output per worker was much higher in industry and services than it was in

agriculture. So as millions shifted from agriculture—where the bulk of China’s labor has been

concentrated—to industry or services, the country’s annual growth rate rose by an additional 3

percentage points. Between 1978 and 2005, about 195 million workers shifted from agriculture to

industry and services. In other words, internal migration accounted for about 47 percent of the labor

force in industry and services in 2005. I expect such shifts between sectors to continue to be an

important element in China’s overall economic growth over the next generation (Fogel 2007).


                                                                                                          2
          Many observers believe that social unrest, both active and latent, will retard China’s rate of

economic growth. Potential pitfalls include the shaky state of the banking system. They also include

income disparities between the rapidly growing coastal provinces and the more slowly growing interior

provinces, between urban and rural labor, and between highly skilled and manual labor. Other potential

flashpoints arise from pressures on fuel supplies and electrical power, the growth of environmental

pollution, and the adequacy of water supplies. These problems are well understood by China’s leaders

and solutions are being actively pursued. So far, the government has managed to head off potential

crises.

          As a consequence, the polls conducted by reliable agencies reveal a widespread belief among

the Chinese that their living conditions have improved and will continue to improve in the future. This

optimism reflects the rapid increases in income experienced by the great majority of households for

more than a quarter of a century.

          Still another possibility is that internal growth will be derailed by international conflicts such as

the border disputes over Kashmir with India and Pakistan and disputes over the sovereignty of the

Spratly Islands with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. But these issues are being treated

diplomatically rather than militarily. The most tumultuous dispute, over the sovereignty of Taiwan, now

appears to be headed toward a resolution, tentatively endorsed by both China and the incoming KMT

government in Taiwan.

          An important factor in sustaining China’s high growth rate will be its investments in expanding

secondary and tertiary education—another key shift likely to boost labor productivity growth. In a 2006

study, I reported that high‐school graduates in the United States were 1.8 times as productive, and

college‐educated workers 3.1 times as productive, as their peers with less than a ninth‐grade education.

Extrapolating these findings to China, and estimating that the enrollment ratio in high school will grow

to about 100 percent and in college to about 50 percent over the next generation, would, in and of


                                                                                                                  3
itself, add over 6 percentage points to the annual growth rate (Fogel 2006).

        These targets for higher education are not out of reach. As recently as 1980, Western European

nations had tertiary enrollment ratios (the ratio of the number of students in colleges and universities to

the total number of persons at college ages, usually 18–22) of about 25 percent; only in the United

States was that figure above 50. The movement to from 25 to 50 in Western Europe took place over just

two decades at the end of the twentieth century. In the case of Britain, two‐thirds of the increase from

19 to 52 percent took place between 1990 and 1997.

        The significance of investment in human capital as an engine of economic growth has not eluded

the State Council in China. In 1998, Jiang Zemin called for a massive increase in enrollments in higher

education, and the response was swift. Over the next four years, enrollment in higher education

increased by 165 percent (from 3.4 million to 9.0 million), and the number of students studying abroad

rose by 152 percent. Given that the tertiary enrollment ratio increased by about 50 percent between

2000 and 2004 (from 12.5 to 19.0 percent), my projection for 2040 is not overly optimistic. China is

already on track to reach it (Fogel 2007).

        Next, my forecast for the EU‐15. Here, demography is the key issue. What is worrisome is not

just the zero rate of population growth (the demographic forecasts are not mine but those of the U.N.

population division) but the changes in the age structure of the population.

        The population of OECD nations has been aging rapidly, and that trend is likely to continue over

the next several decades. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1 present the forecast of the Population Division of

the United Nations on the change in the median age of the five largest West European nations. In

Germany, Italy, and Spain, the predicted increases range between 11 and 14 years. In France and the

United Kingdom, the median age increases by six and five years, respectively.

        Columns 3 and 4 forecast the change in percentage of the population that will be over 65. For

Germany and Italy, the elderly will increase to nearly a third of the population. Only in the United

Kingdom will the elderly be less than a quarter of the population.

        The basic reason for the rapid aging of the population has been the low level of fertility. In all of

these countries, the total fertility rate has been below the level needed to replace their populations for

several decades. As a result, the percentage of women in the childbearing ages has declined from about

50 percent in 2000 (it was also about 50 percent in 1950) and is projected to be about 35 percent in

2040. So we have a double whammy (to use American slang): not only will women in the reproductive

ages have sharply reduced fertility rates, but the proportion of women who are in the childbearing ages

will also have declined sharply (see Table 2).

        Attitudes toward sex have evolved sharply. One hundred fifty years ago, it was considered a sin

to enjoy sex, the only legitimate purpose for which was procreation. But today, even in Rome, young

women respond that sex is mainly a recreational activity. Behind the statistics on trends in fertility is a

vast change in ethics embodied in a culture that is much different from that embraced by the generation

                                                                                                              5

        The widespread embrace of the ethic that celebrates sex as recreation means that the rate of

natural increase (births minus deaths) is likely to decline in the principal EU‐15 nations. Indeed, even in

2000, the natural rate of increase was negative in Germany and Italy. By 2040, it is likely that natural

increase will be negative in all of the designated nations except the United Kingdom (see Table 3).

          Although the twentieth century increase in the share of the population that is elderly is a tribute

to the great advances in economic performance, biomedical sciences, and environmental

improvements, there is no automatic guarantee of equitable balance between the generations in the

future. Indeed, there are new problems that will have to be solved if a third of population in 2040 is over

age 65.

          Moreover, since younger workers are a major source of new ideas, slowing down the

ascendency of the next generation may retard the pace of technological change. The solution to such

problems will not be easy. The elderly should not be shunted aside as if they were rotten tomatoes. To

force their premature retirement will undermine not only their morale, but also the morale of those

who expect to replace them.

          As a result of the demographic trends, the dependency ratio is expected to rise sharply in 4 of

the 5 largest EU‐15 nations between the years 2000 and 2040, as shown by Table 4.




                                                                                                            7

        The inverse of one plus the dependency rates is a reasonable proxy for the labor force

participation rate (which I designate by ρ). Hence, Table 4 suggests an annual rate of decline of 0.4

percent in the labor force participation rate due purely to changes in the age structure of the

population. I allow ρ to decline by an additional 0.2 percent per annum because of a reduction in the

length of the work year over the period 2000–2040. This allowance raises the annual rate of decline in ρ

to 0.6 percent per annum. Since I expect the annual rate of growth in labor productivity of the 5 nations

to average about 1.8 percent, it follows that their annual rate of growth in both per capita income and

GDP will average 1.2 percent.

        Now let me turn to my forecast for the United States. Although the U.S. and EU‐15 growth rates

were the same during 1975–2005, I do not believe that to be an overriding consideration. The key issue

is the slowness of the EU relative to the U.S. in adopting the new information technology. Other issues

are the greater EU preference for leisure than commodities when compared with the U.S., and the

decline of the EU’s annual rate of growth in labor productivity from 2.4 percent during 1980–1995 to 1.5

percent during 1995–2004. By comparison, U.S. labor productivity growth increased from 1.5 percent

per annum during 1980–1995 to 3.0 percent during 1995–2004 (van Ark et al. 2008).

                                                                                                          8
        During 1995–2004, U.S. GDP grew at 3.7 percent per annum. I believe that this high rate will

persist down to 2040 because of continuing technological advances in genetic engineering, health care,

information technology, transportation, energy production and consumption, and education (van Ark et

al. 2008).
