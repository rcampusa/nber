What are the fundamental causes of the large diÔ¨Äerences in income per capita across coun-
tries? Although there is still little consensus on the answer to this question, diÔ¨Äerences
in institutions and property rights have received considerable attention in recent years.
Countries with better ‚Äúinstitutions‚Äù, more secure property rights, and less distortionary
policies will invest more in physical and human capital, and will use these factors more
eÔ¨Éciently to achieve a greater level of income (e.g., North and Thomas, 1976, North,
1981, Jones, 1981).        This view receives some support from cross-country correlations
between measures of property rights and economic development (e.g., Knack and Keefer,
1995, Mauro, 1995, Barro, 1998, Hall and Jones, 1999, Rodrik, 1999), and from a few
micro-studies that investigate the relationship between property rights and investment or
output (e.g., Besley, 1995, Mazingo, 1999, Johnson, McMillan and WoodruÔ¨Ä, 1999).
       At some level, it is obvious that institutions matter. Witness, for example, the di-
vergent paths of North and South Korea, or East and West Germany, where one part of
the country stagnated under central planning and collective ownership, while the other
prospered with private property and a market economy. Nevertheless, we still lack con-
clusive evidence that institutional diÔ¨Äerences can have a large enough eÔ¨Äect to explain
the phenomenal diÔ¨Äerences in output per capita across countries. It is quite likely that
economies that are rich choose or can aÔ¨Äord better institutions. Perhaps more important,
economies that are diÔ¨Äerent for a variety of reasons will diÔ¨Äer both in their institutions
and in their income per capita.
       To estimate the impact of institutions on performance, we need a source of exogenous
variation in institutions. In this paper, we propose diÔ¨Äerences in mortality rates faced
by European settlers at the time of colonization as a possible source of such exogenous
variation.1 We focus on societies that were colonized by European countries. These provide
us with a set of economies that had relatively similar income levels 400 years ago and
still exhibit large diÔ¨Äerences in per capita income today. Moreover, institutions in these
countries were shaped, at least in part, by their colonization experience.2
   1
      We do not argue that diÔ¨Äerences in mortality rates are the only, or even the main, cause of variation
in institutions. For our empirical approach to work, all we need is that they are a source of exogenous
variation.
    2
      Young (1994) and Chazan et al. (1993) argue that the colonization policies of European powers had


                                                    1
   Our argument rests on three premises:

   1. There were diÔ¨Äerent types of colonization policies which created diÔ¨Äerent sets of in-
      stitutions. At one extreme, European powers set up ‚Äúextractive states‚Äù, exemplified
      by the Belgian colonization of the Congo. These institutions did not introduce much
      protection for private property, nor did they provide checks and balances against
      government expropriation. In fact, the main purpose of the extractive state was to
      transfer as much of the resources of the colony to the colonizer, with the minimum
      amount of investment possible.
      At the other extreme, many Europeans went and settled in a number of colonies,
      creating what the historian Alfred Crosby (1986) calls ‚ÄúNeo-Europes‚Äù. The settlers
      tried to replicate European institutions, with great emphasis on private property,
      and checks against government power. Primary examples of this include Australia,
      New Zealand, Canada, and the United States.

   2. The colonization strategy was influenced by the feasibility of settlements. In par-
      ticular, in places where the disease environment was not favorable to European
      settlement, the cards were stacked against the creation of Neo-Europes, and the
      formation of the extractive state was more likely.

   3. The colonial state and institutions persisted even after independence.

   Based on these three premises, we use the mortality rates expected by the first settlers
in the colonies as an instrument for institutions. More specifically, our theory can be
schematically summarized as

  (potential) settler                    early         current        current
                      ‚áí settlements ‚áí              ‚áí              ‚áí
      mortality                       institutions   institutions   performance

   We use data on the mortality rates of soldiers, bishops, and sailors stationed in the
colonies between the 17th and 19th centuries, largely based on the work of the historian
Philip Curtin. These give a good indication of the mortality rates faced by settlers. Eu-
ropeans were well informed about these mortality rates at the time, though they did not
a long-lasting eÔ¨Äect on Africa. In contrast, Chabal (1986) and Herbst (2000) maintain that the current
African state is a continuation of the precolonial state. Although our assessment agrees with that of
Young, since we are not comparing ex-colonies to non-colonized countries, our empirical approach does
not take a position on this.

know how to control the diseases that caused these high mortality rates. Furthermore,
since these mortality rates refer to fairly homogeneous groups, they are comparable across
countries. We document empirically that (potential) settler mortality rates were a major
determinant of settlements; that settlements were a major determinant of early institu-
tions (in practice, institutions in 1900); that there is a strong correlation between early
institutions and institutions today; and finally that current institutions have a first-order
eÔ¨Äect on current performance.
       Our most parsimonious specification is to regress current performance on current in-
stitutions, and instrument the latter by settler mortality rates. Since our focus is on
property rights and checks against government power, we use the ‚Äúrisk of expropriation‚Äù
index from Political Risk Services as the proxy for institutions. This measures diÔ¨Äerences
in institutions originating from diÔ¨Äerent types of states and state policies.3 The first-stage
relationship between this measure of institutions and settler mortality is strong. For ex-
ample, settler mortality alone explains over 25 percent of the variation in this index of
institutions. Using this specification, we find that institutions are a major determinant
of per capita income. The estimates are quite precise, and in fact larger than the OLS
estimates. They suggest that approximately three-quarters of the cross-country income
diÔ¨Äerences we observe can be explained by diÔ¨Äerences in institutions.
       We document that this relationship is not driven by outliers. For example, excluding
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United States does not change the results,
nor does excluding Africa. Interestingly, we show that once the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on
economic performance is controlled for, neither distance from the equator (latitude) nor
the dummy for Africa is significant. These results suggest that Africa is poorer than the
rest of the world not because of pure geographic or cultural factors, but because of worse
institutions.
       The validity of our approach is threatened if other factors correlated with the esti-
   3
     We do not mean to imply that government expropriation is the only institutional feature that matters.
Our view is that there is a variety of institutional guarantees, including constraints on government
expropriation, independent judiciary, property rights enforcement, equal access to education, and respect
for civil liberties, that are important to encourage investment and growth. Expropriation risk is related
to all these institutional features. In the Appendix, we report results using a variety of other measures of
institutions that have been used in the literature, including the extent of the constraints on the executive
coded from the Polity III dataset, an index of law and order tradition from Political Risk Services, a
measure of property rights from the Heritage Foundation, a measure of rule of law from the Fraser
Institute, and the eÔ¨Éciency of the judiciary from Business International. We obtain very similar results
with all of these measures.

mates of the mortality rates faced by the settlers aÔ¨Äect income per capita. We adopt
two strategies to substantiate that our results are not driven by omitted factors. First,
we investigate whether institutions have an important eÔ¨Äect once we control for a num-
ber of variables potentially correlated with settler mortality and economic outcomes. We
find that none of these overturn our results; the estimates change remarkably little when
we include controls for climate, geography, religion, legal origin, main colonizer, natural
resources, and soil quality. Furthermore, the results are also robust to the inclusion of
controls for the current disease environment (e.g., the prevalence of malaria), the current
fraction of the population of European descent, and measures of ethnolinguistic fragmen-
tation.
   Naturally, it is impossible to control for all possible variables that might be corre-
lated with settler mortality and economic outcomes.        Furthermore, our empirical ap-
proach might capture the eÔ¨Äect of settler mortality on economic performance, but work-
ing through other factors. For example, early European settlers might have brought a
‚Äúculture‚Äù conducive to economic progress, which could still have an eÔ¨Äect on income per
capita today. Our instrumental variables strategy would then incorrectly assign this ef-
fect to institutions. We deal with this problem by using a simple overidentification test.
Since our hypothesis is that settler mortality aÔ¨Äected settlements; settlements aÔ¨Äected
early institutions; and early institutions persisted and formed the basis of current day
institutions, we can test the validity of our approach by using measures of European
migration to the colonies and of early institutions as additional instruments. We then
use overidentification tests to detect whether settler mortality, or any of the other instru-
ments, has a direct eÔ¨Äect on current performance. The results are encouraging for our
approach; they generate no evidence for a direct eÔ¨Äect of settler mortality on economic
outcomes.
   We are not aware of others who have pointed out the link between settler mortality
rates and institutions, though scholars such as McNeill (1976), Crosby (1986) and Dia-
mond (1997) have discussed the influence of diseases on human history. Diamond (1997)
emphasizes comparative development, but his theory is based on the geographical deter-
minants of the incidence of the neolithic revolution. He ignores both the importance of
institutions and the potential causes of divergence in more recent development, which
are the main focus of our paper. Work by Gann and Duignan (1962), Robinson and
Gallagher (1961), Denoon (1983), and Cain and Hopkins (1993) emphasizes that settler


                                             4
colonies such as the U.S. and New Zealand are diÔ¨Äerent from other colonies, and point
out that these diÔ¨Äerences were important for their economic success. Nevertheless, this
literature does not develop the link between mortality, settlements and institutions.
   Our argument is most closely related to work on the influence of colonial experience
on institutions. Hayek (1960) argued that the British common law tradition was superior
to the French civil law, which was developed during the Napoleonic era to restrain judges‚Äô
interference with state policies (see also Lipset, 1994). More recently, La Porta, Lopez-de-
Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1998, 1999) document empirically the importance of colonial
origin (the identity of the colonizer) and legal origin on current institutions. For example,
they show that common law countries have better property rights and more developed
financial markets. Similarly, North, Summerhill and Weingast (1998) argue that former
British colonies prospered relative to former French, Spanish and Portuguese colonies
because of the good economic and political institutions they inherited from Britain, and
Landes (1998, chapters 19 and 20) stresses the importance of the culture inherited from
Britain in these colonies. In contrast to this approach, which focuses on the identity of the
colonizer, we emphasize the conditions in the colonies. Specifically, in our theory‚Äìand
in the data‚Äì it is not the identity of the colonizer that matters, but whether European
colonialists could safely settle in a particular location: where they could not settle, they
brought worse institutions. In this respect, our argument is related to that of Engerman
and SokoloÔ¨Ä (1997) who also emphasize institutions, but link them to factor endowments.
   Empirically, our work is related to a number of other attempts to uncover the link be-
tween institutions and development, as well as to Bertocchi and Canova (1996) and Grier
(1999) who investigate the eÔ¨Äect of being a colony on postwar growth. Two papers deal
with the endogeneity of institutions by using an instrumental variables approach as we do
here. Mauro (1995) instruments for corruption using ethnolinguistic fragmentation. Hall
and Jones (1999), in turn, who use distance from the equator as an instrument for social
infrastructure because they argue that the distance from the equator is correlated with
‚ÄòWestern influence‚Äô, which leads to good institutions. The theoretical reasoning for these
instruments is not entirely convincing. It is not easy to argue that the Belgian influence
in the Congo, or Western influence in the Gold Coast during the era of slavery promoted
good institutions or governance. Ethnolinguistic fragmentation, on the other hand, seems
endogenous, especially since such fragmentation almost completely disappeared in Eu-
rope during the era of growth when a centralized state and market emerged (see, e.g.,


                                             5
Weber, 1976, Anderson, 1983). Econometrically, the problem with both studies is that
their instruments can plausibly have a direct eÔ¨Äect on performance. For example, East-
erly and Levine (1997) argue that ethnolinguistic fragmentation can aÔ¨Äect performance
by creating political instability, while Bloom and Sachs (1998) and Gallup, Mellinger, and
Sachs (1998) argue for a direct eÔ¨Äect of climate on performance. This climate theory of
development has a long pedigree; it goes back at least to Montesquieu [1748](1989), who
suggested that low income and despotism are more likely in warmer climates. If, indeed,
these variables have a direct eÔ¨Äect, they are invalid instruments and do not establish that
it is institutions that matter. The advantage of our approach is that conditional on the
variables we already control for, settler-mortality more than 100 years ago should have
no eÔ¨Äect on output today, other than through its eÔ¨Äect on institutions. Interestingly,
our results show that distance from the equator does not have an independent eÔ¨Äect on
economic performance, so it validates the use of this variable as an instrument in the work
by Hall and Jones (1999).
      The next section outlines our hypothesis and provides supporting historical evidence.
Section 3 presents OLS regressions of GDP per capita on our index of institutions. Section
4 describes our key instrument for institutions, the mortality rates faced by potential set-
tlers at the time of colonization. Section 5 presents our main results. Section 6 investigates
the robustness of our results, and Section 7 concludes.

                  2   The Hypothesis and Historical Background

We hypothesize that settler mortality aÔ¨Äected settlements; settlements aÔ¨Äected early in-
stitutions; and early institutions persisted and formed the basis of current institutions. In
this section, we discuss and substantiate this hypothesis. The next subsection discusses
the link between mortality rates of settlers and settlement decisions, then we discuss
diÔ¨Äerences in colonization policies, and finally, we turn to the causes of institutional per-
sistence.

2.1    Mortality and settlements

There is little doubt that mortality rates were a key determinant of European settlements.
Curtin (1964 and 1998) documents how both the British and French press informed the
public of the mortality rates in the colonies. For example, early European attempts to
settle in West Africa foundered due to high mortality from disease. In the ‚ÄúProvince of


                                              6
Freedom‚Äù European mortality in the first year was 46 percent, in Bulama (April 1792-
April 1793) there was 61 percent mortality among Europeans, and in the first year of the
Sierra Leone Company (1792-1793) 72 percent of the European settlers died. On Mungo
Park‚Äôs Second Expedition (May-November 1805), 87 percent of Europeans died during
the overland trip from Gambia to the Niger, and all the Europeans died before completing
the expedition. Such rates of mortality were shockingly high for Europeans at the time.4
       An interesting example of the awareness of the disease environment comes from the
Pilgrim fathers. They decided to migrate to the U.S. rather than Guyana because of the
very high mortality rates in Guyana (see Crosby, 1986, pp. 143-144). Another example
comes from the Beauchamp Committee in 1795 which was set up to decide where to send
British convicts, who had previously been sent to the U.S.. One of the leading proposals
was the island of Lemane, 400 miles up Gambia river.                  The committee rejected this
possibility precisely because they decided mortality rates would be too high even for the
convicts. South-West Africa was also rejected for health reasons. The final decision was
to send convicts to Australia.
       The eventual expansion of many of the colonies was also related to the living conditions
there. In places where the early settlers faced high mortality rates, there would be less
incentive for new settlers to come. Curtin (1964), for example, documents how early
British expectations for settlement in West Africa were dashed by very high mortality
among attempted settlers, about half of whom could be expected to die in the first year.

2.2      Types of colonization and settlements

The historical evidence supports both the notion that there was a wide range of diÔ¨Äer-
ent types of colonization and that the presence or absence of European settlers was a
key determinant of the form colonialism took. Historians, including Gann and Duignan
(1962), Robinson and Gallagher (1961), Denoon (1983), and Cain and Hopkins (1993),
have documented the development of ‚Äúsettler colonies‚Äù, where Europeans settled in large
   4
     Most mortality in the tropics was from (1) malaria (particularly Plasmodium Falciporum), and (2)
yellow fever (with devastating periodic epidemics). In the first half of the nineteenth century there
was almost a complete misunderstanding of the nature of malaria‚Äì ‚Äúmiasma‚Äù from swamps was the
prevailing view. Quinine was available but not understood nor used widely. The role of hygiene was
also not properly understood. In the second half of the nineteenth century, there developed improved
heuristic rules about how to control disease‚Äìe.g., an understanding that mortality from malaria is often
less at higher altitudes. Low mortality for Europeans in areas with tropical diseases only arrived in the
early twentieth century. Throughout the whole nineteenth century, areas without malaria, such as New
Zealand or Mauritius, were more healthy than Europe.


                                                   7
numbers, and life was modeled after the home country. Denoon (1983) emphasizes that
settler colonies had representative institutions which promoted what the settlers wanted,
and what they wanted was freedom and the ability to get rich by engaging in trade. He
argues that ‚Äúthere was undeniably something capitalist in the structure of these colonies.
Private ownership of land and livestock was well established very early...‚Äù (p. 35).5
       In many cases, when the establishment of European-like institutions did not arise
naturally, the settlers were ready to fight for them against the wishes of the home coun-
try.     Australia is an interesting example here. Most of the early settlers in Australia
were ex-convicts, but the land was owned largely by ex-jailors.                Initial property rights
were therefore unequal, and there was no legal protection against the arbitrary power
of landowners. But, the majority of settlers wanted institutions and political rights like
those prevailing in England at the time. They demanded jury trials, freedom from arbi-
trary arrest, and electoral representation. Although the British government resisted at
first, the settlers argued that they were British and deserved the same rights as in the
home country (see Hughes, 1987). Cain and Hopkins agree with this conclusion and write
(1993, p. 237) ‚Äúfrom the late 1840‚Äôs the British bowed to local pressures and, in line with
observed constitutional changes taking place in Britain herself, accepted the idea that, in
mature colonies, governors should in future form ministries from the majority elements in
elected legislatures.‚Äù They also suggest that ‚Äúthe enormous boom in public investment
after 1870 [in New Zealand]... was an attempt to build up an infrastructure... to maintain
high living standards in a country where voters expected politicians actively to promote
their economic welfare.‚Äù (p. 225).
       This is in sharp contrast to the colonial experience in Latin America during the 17th
and 18th centuries, and in Asia and Africa during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The
main objective of the Spanish and the Portuguese colonization was to obtain gold and
other valuables from America. For example, soon after the conquest the Spanish crown
granted rights to land and labor (the encomienda) and set up a complex mercantilist
system of monopolies and trade regulations to extract resources from the colonies (see
Lockhart and Schwartz, 1983, and Lang, 1975).6 Other European powers were attracted
   5
     Bates (1983, ch. 3) gives a nice example of the influence of settlers on policy. The British colonial
government pursued many policies that depressed the price of cocoa, the main produce of the farmers in
Ghana. In contrast, the British government supported the prices faced by the commercial cereal farmers
in Kenya. Bates shows that this was mainly because in Kenya, but not in Ghana, there were many settler
farmers, who exerted considerable pressure on policy.
   6
     Migration to Spanish America was limited by the Spanish Crown, in part because of a desire to keep


                                                    8
to colonialism because of the success of this strategy (see for example, Young, 1994, p.
64).
    European powers developed the slave trade in Africa for the same reasons. Before the
mid-nineteenth century, colonial powers were mostly restricted to the African coast and
concentrated on monopolizing trade in slaves, gold and other valuable commodities‚Äì
witness the names used to descibe West African countries: the Gold Coast, the Ivory
Coast. Thereafter, colonial policy was driven in part by an element of superpower rivalry,
but mostly by economic motives. Crowder (1968, p. 50), for example, notes ‚Äúit is signif-
icant that Britain‚Äôs largest colony on the West Coast [Nigeria] should have been the one
where her traders were most active and bears out the contention that, for Britain....flag
followed trade.‚Äù7
    Davis and Huttenback (1986, p. 307) conclude that ‚Äúthe colonial Empire provides
strong evidence for the belief that government was attuned to the interests of business
and willing to divert resources to ends that the business community would have found
profitable.‚Äù They find that before 1885 investment in the British empire had a return 25
percent higher than that on domestic investment, though afterwards the two converged.
Roberts (1976, p. 193) summarizes the extent of resource extraction by Britain from
Northern Rhodesia by writing ‚Äú[from]..1930 to 1940 Britain had kept for itself 2,400,000
pounds in taxes from the Copperbelt, while Northern Rhodesia received from Britain
only 136,000 pounds in grants for development.‚Äù Patrick Manning (1982) estimates that
between 1905 and 1914, 50 percent of GDP in Dahomey was extracted by the French,
and Young (1994, p.125) notes that taxation rates in Tunisia were four times as high as
those in metropolitan France.
    Probably the most extreme case of extraction was that of King Leopold of Belgium in
the Congo. Gann and Duignan (1979, p. 30) argue that following the example of the Dutch
in Indonesia, Leopold‚Äôs philosophy was that ‚Äúthe colonies should be exploited, not by the
operation of a market economy, but by state intervention and compulsory cultivation of
cash crops to be sold to and distributed by the state at controlled prices.‚Äù Peemans (1975)
control of the colonists and limit their independence (for example Coatsworth, 1982). This gives further
support to our notion that settlers were able to influence the type of institutions set up in the colonies,
even against the wishes of the home country government.
   7
     Although in almost all cases the main aim was to cement trading privileges, protect economic interests,
and obtain profits, the recipients of these profits varied. In the Portuguese case, it was the state, in the
Belgian case, it was King Leopold, and in the British case, it was often private enterprises who obtained
concessions or monopoly trading rights in Africa (Crowder, 1968, Part III).



                                                     9
documents the amount of resources extracted from the Belgian Congo and calculates that
tax rates on Africans approached 60 percent of their income during the 1920‚Äôs and 1930‚Äôs.
Jewsiewicki (1983) writes that during the period when Leopold was directly in charge,
policy was ‚Äúbased on the violent exploitation of natural and human resources,‚Äù with a
consequent ‚Äúdestruction of economic and social life...[and].. dismemberment of political
structures.‚Äù
       In non-settler colonies, there were also few constraints on state power. The colonial
powers set-up authoritarian and absolutist states, with the purpose of solidifying their
control and facilitating the extraction of resources. Young (1994, p. 101) quotes a French
oÔ¨Écial in Africa as ‚Äúthe European commandant is not posted to observe nature,... He
has a mission... to impose regulations, to limit individual liberties...., to collect taxes.‚Äù
Manning (1988, p. 84) summarizes this as: ‚ÄúIn Europe the theories of representative
democracy won out over the theorists of absolutism...                  But in Africa, the European
conquerors set up absolutist governments, based on reasoning similar to that of Louis
XIV.‚Äù
       With a strategy of exploitation in mind, European powers had little incentive to invest
in institutions or in infrastructure in Africa. In fact, despite apparently very high rates
of return, almost no investment went to Africa (except from South Africa, see Freiden,
1994). The Indian textile industry was similarly rundown heavily, with no investment
(e.g., Fieldhouse, 1999). Young writes ‚Äú [the Belgian companies] brought little capital‚Äìa
mere 8000 pounds...[to the Congo basin]‚Äìand instituted a reign of terror suÔ¨Écient to
provoke an embarrassing public-protest campaign in Britain and the United States at a
time when the threshold of toleration for colonial brutality was high.‚Äù (1994, p. 104).

2.3      Institutional persistence

There is a variety of evidence suggesting that the control structures set up in the non-
settler colonies during the colonial era persisted, while there is little doubt that the in-
stitutions of law and order and private property established during the early phases of
colonialism in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.S. have been the basis of the
current day institutions of these countries.8 Young emphasizes that the institutions set up
   8
    The thesis that institutions persist for a long time goes back at least to Wittfogel (1957), who argued
that the control structures set up by the large ‚Äúhydraulic‚Äù empires such as China, Russia, and the
Ottoman Empire persisted for more than 500 years to the 20th century. Engerman and SokoloÔ¨Ä (1997),
North, Summerhill and Weingast (1998), Coatsworth (1999) and La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer



                                                    10
by the colonialists persisted long after the colonial regime ended. He writes that (1994,
p. 283) ‚Äúalthough we commonly described the independent polities as ‚Äònew states‚Äô, in
reality they were successors to the colonial regime, inheriting its structures, its quotidian
routines and practices, and its more hidden normative theories of governance.‚Äù Arthur
Lewis gives a succinct statement of the issues (1965, pp. 32-33)

           ‚Äú...for most of [the governments of newly independent African states] in-
      dependence means merely that they have succeeded to the autocracy vacated
      by British and French civil servants. They model themselves on the arrogant
      and arbitrary pattern set by Governors and district commissioners.‚Äù

    There are a number of intuitive economic mechanisms that will lead to institutional
persistence of this type. Here, we discuss three possibilities.

   1. Setting up functioning institutions, which place restrictions on government power
      and respect property rights, is costly (see, e.g., Acemoglu and Verdier, 1998). If
      these costs have been sunk by the colonial powers, then it may not pay the elites at
      independence to switch from this set of institutions to extractive institutions. In
      contrast, when the new elites inherit extractive institutions, they may not want to
      incur the costs of introducing better institutions, and may instead prefer to exploit
      the existing extractive institutions for their own benefits.
      An interesting case where functioning institutions proved to be very durable is
      Mauritius.      The French settled in relatively large numbers in Mauritius, and the
      institutions were less extractive than in many other colonies.9 After independence,
      Paul Berenger and his party Mouvement Militant Mauricien, which were viewed as
      Communists at the time, came to power. But in contrast to other African regimes,
      they continued to support property rights and businesses. In fact, they significantly
      expanded the export processing zones, which were instrumental for the very rapid
      growth experience of Mauritius (see, for example, Bowman, 1991).

   2. The gains to an extractive strategy may depend on the size of the ruling elite. When
      this elite is small, each member would have a larger share of the revenues, so the
and Vishny (1998, 1999) also argue that colonial institutions persisted. Engerman, Mariscal and SokoloÔ¨Ä
(1998) provide further evidence supporting this view.
   9
     Unfortunately, Mauritius is not in our data set as we do not have information on current institutions.
Interestingly, however, Mauritius had very low mortality according to our sources, and is a relatively rich
country, with GDP per capita similar to that of Argentina.

                                                    11
         elite may have a greater incentive to be extractive (see Acemoglu and Robinson,
         2000).   In many cases where European powers set up authoritarian institutions,
         they delegated the day-to-day running of the state to a small domestic elite. This
         narrow group often was the one to control the state after independence and favored
         extractive institutions. Reno (1995), for example, argues that the governments of
         post-independence Sierra Leone adopted the tactics and institutions of the British
         colonizers to cement their political power and extract resources from the rest of
         society. Boone (1992) provides a similar analysis of the evolution of the modern state
         in Senegal. Perhaps the most extensively studied case is the Congo. Most scholars
         view the roots of authoritarianism under Mobutu in the colonial state practices (e.g.,
         Callaghy, 1984, or, Turner and Young, 1985, especially p. 43)
         The situation in Latin America is similar. Independence of most Latin American
         countries came in the early nineteenth centuries as domestic elites took advantage of
         the invasion of Spain by Napoleon to capture the control of the state. But, the only
         thing that changed was the identity of the recipients of the rents.10 The experience
         of many other Latin American countries is also similar (see Lynch, 1986).

   3. Finally, if agents make irreversible investments that are complementary to a par-
         ticular set of institutions, they will then be more willing to support them, making
         these institutions persist (see, e.g., Acemoglu, 1995). For example, agents who have
         invested a lot in human and physical capital will be in favor of spending money to
         enforce property rights, while those who have less to lose may not be. For exam-
         ple, in the Mauritius example, the presence of a middle-class that had a stake in
         democracy and the rule of law seems to have been important.

       Further evidence for the persistence of extractive state institutions into the indepen-
dence era is provided by the persistence of the most prominent extractive policies. In
Latin America, the full panoply of monopolies and regulations, which had been created
by Spain, remained intact for most of the nineteenth century. Forced labor policies per-
sisted and were even intensified or re-introduced with the expansion of export agriculture
  10
    Coatsworth (1978, p. 95) notes ‚ÄúMexican independence came through a virtual coup d‚ÄôeÃÅtat by the
colony‚Äôs Creole elite, carried out largely to separate Mexico from the liberalizing process under way in
the Mother country... The principal proponent of these conservative eÔ¨Äorts was a limited social group of
major landowners and industrialists in the center of the country...who had been the principal beneficiaries
in the colony of the crown‚Äôs interventionism or who, like the large merchant houses of the capital, sought
to regain privileges the crown itself had abolished in the reforms of the late Bourbon era.‚Äù


                                                    12
in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Slavery persisted in Brazil until 1886, and
during the sisal boom in Mexico, forced labor was reintroduced and persisted up to the
start of the revolution in 1910. Forced labor was also re-introduced in Guatemala and El
Salvador to provide labor for coÔ¨Äee growing. In the Guatemalan case, forced labor lasted
until the creation of democracy in 1945. Similarly, forced labor was re-instated in many
independent African countries, for example, by Mobutu in Zaire.
      The situation is similar with other extractive policies. For example, marketing boards,
which were used by colonial powers for rent extraction, were a ready made instrument
for the newly independent governments to tax agricultural producers (Bates, 1981). The
elites who controlled the government had little to gain from abolishing these marketing
boards or from setting up more eÔ¨Écient institutions. Very often these boards fitted well
with the structure of political power in the post independence era. For example, in Ghana,
Nkrumah‚Äôs support was primarily urban and amongst the Fanti, while the cocoa farmers
were inland and Ashanti. So he did not find it beneficial to set up institutions that would
restrict his taxation powers, and the marketing board provided a perfect instrument for
raising taxes from a group that was not going to support him politically in any case (see
Rimmer, 1992). Fieldhouse (1999, p. 96) writes ‚Äúonce these boards came under the control
of local politicians they were used to extract surplus from the rural producer, notionally
for development purposes, in practice largely for party and personal advantage.‚Äù He
also argues (p. 146) that the fact there were no marketing boards was important in the
development experience of Australia.

  3     Institutions and Performance: Ordinary Least Squares Estimates
3.1     Data and Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the key variables of interest. The first column
is for the whole sample, and column 2 is for our base sample, limited to the 64 countries
that were ex-colonies and for which we have settler mortality, institutions and GDP data.
The GDP per capita in 1995 is PPP adjusted and is taken from the World Bank‚Äôs 1999
World Development Indicators CD-Rom (a more detailed discussion of all data sources
is provided in the Appendix Table A1). Income (GDP) per capita will be our measure
of economic outcome. Since all ex-colonies in our sample had relatively low levels of
income 400 years ago, income per capita today is a good measure of long run economic
performance. The standard deviation of log per capita income both in the world sample


                                              13
and in our basic sample are similar (1.1 in both cases), indicating that the large income
diÔ¨Äerences are present in our sample.
       We use a variety of variables to capture institutional diÔ¨Äerences. Our main variable,
reported in the second row, is an index of protection against expropriation.                          These
data are from Political Risk Services (see, e.g., Coplin, 1993), and were first used in
the economics and political science literatures by Knack and Keefer (1995). Political Risk
Services reports a value between 0 and 10 for each country and year, with 0 corresponding
to the highest expropriation risk. We use the average value for each country between 1985
and 1995 (values are missing for many countries before 1985). This protection against
expropriation measure is appropriate for our purposes since the focus here is on diÔ¨Äerences
in institutions originating from diÔ¨Äerent types of states and state policies. We expect our
notion of extractive state to correspond to a low value of this index, while the tradition
of rule of law and well enforced property rights should correspond to high values.11 The
next row gives an alternative measure, coded from the Polity III data set of Gurr and
associates, which is constraints on the executive in 1990 (see Appendix Table A3). This
variable is also closely related to state policies and institutions, so is relevant for our
purposes. To economize on space, in the text we report only results with the protection
against expropriation variable. Results using the constraints on the executive and other
measures are reported in the Appendix.
       The next three rows give measures of early institutions from the same Gurr data set.
The first is a measure of constraints on the executive in 1900 and the second is an index of
democracy in 1900. This information is not available for countries that were still colonies
in 1900, so we assign these countries the lowest possible score in each index. In the third
row, we report an alternative measure, constraints on the executive in the first year of
independence, which does not use this assumption, and assigns values for earlier years for
many of the Latin America countries and Neo-Europes that were already independent in
the 19th-century. The final row gives the fraction of the population of European descent
in 1900, which is our measure of European settlement in the colonies, constructed from
McEvedy and Jones (1978), Curtin et al (1995) and some additional sources; see Appendix
  11
    The protection against expropriation variable is most specifically for foreign investment, since Political
and Risk Services construct these data for foreign investors. However, as noted by Knack and Keefer
(1995), risk of expropriation of foreign and domestic investments are very highly correlated, and risk of
expropriation of foreign investment may be more comparable across countries. In any case, all our results
hold also with a variety of other institutions and property rights measures (see Tables A1 and A4a, b, c,
d, and e).


                                                     14
Table A5).
       The remaining columns in Table 1 give descriptive statistics for groups of countries
at diÔ¨Äerent quartiles of the settler mortality distribution.               This is useful since settler
mortality is our instrument for institutions (this variable is described in more detail in
the next section).

3.2     Ordinary Least Squares Regressions

Table 2 reports Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions of log per capita income on the
protection against expropriation variable in a variety of samples. The linear regressions
are for the equation
                                     log yi = ¬µ + Œ±Ri + Xi0 Œ≥ + Œµi ,                                     (1)
where yi is income per capita in country i, Ri is the protection against expropriation
measure, Xi is a vector of other covariates, and Œµi is a random error term. The coeÔ¨Écient
of interest throughout the paper is Œ±, the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income per capita.
The first two columns of Table 2 are for the whole world sample, while the second two
are for our former colonies sample. Since a priori we have no reason to believe that the
relationship between the institutions index and log GDP per capita is linear, in the second
and fourth columns, we regress GDP per capita on a set of dummy variables for diÔ¨Äerent
quartiles of the distribution of the institutions index. The omitted group is the set of
countries in the lowest quartile (with the worst institutions), and three dummies for the
other three quartiles are included in the regression.12
       Column 1 shows that in the whole world sample there is a strong correlation between
our measure of institutions and income per capita‚Äìrecall that the high value of the index
means greater protection against expropriation risk. Column 2 indicates that the linear
specification is appropriate, as the dummies are ranked in the expected order, and the
gap between the various dummies is not very diÔ¨Äerent from that implied by the linear
specification. Columns 3-4 show that the impact of the institutions variable on income per
capita in our base sample is quite similar to that in the whole world, and Figure 1 shows
this relationship diagrammatically. To get a sense of magnitudes, let us compare the 25th
and 75th percentiles of the distribution of the institution variable among all ex-colonies.
The 25th percentile of the institutional measure in this sample corresponds to a value of
  12
    More generally, it may therefore be more appropriate to interpret the OLS and IV estimates from
linear specifications as local average treatment eÔ¨Äects giving the weighted average of the eÔ¨Äects at diÔ¨Äerent
points (as suggested in Angrist and Imbens, 1995).

                                                     15
5.6, while the 75th percentile of institutional measure is 7.4.13 The estimate in column
3, 0.52, indicates that there should be on average a 94 log point diÔ¨Äerence between the
log GDPs of the corresponding countries (or approximately a diÔ¨Äerence equivalent to 154
percent of the GDP of the poorer country). In practice, this GDP gap is 185 log points
(approximately 540 percent). Therefore, if the eÔ¨Äect estimated in Table 2 were causal, it
would imply a fairly large eÔ¨Äect of institutions on performance: diÔ¨Äerences in institutions
would account for approximately a quarter of the income per capita diÔ¨Äerences across
countries.
      Many social scientists, including Montesquieu [1784](1989), Diamond (1997) and Sachs
and coauthors have argued for a direct eÔ¨Äect of climate on performance, and Gallup,
Mellinger, and Sachs (1998) and Hall and Jones (1999) document the correlation between
distance from the equator (latitude) and economic performance. To control for this,
in columns 5-8, we add the absolute value of the distance from the equator in degrees
(latitude) as a regressor (we follow the literature in using a measure of latitude that is
scaled between 0 and 1). This changes the coeÔ¨Écient of the index of institutions little.
Latitude itself is also significant and has the sign found by previous studies. The coeÔ¨Écient
1.80 in column 7 indicates that a ten degree (0.10) distance gap from the equator, such
as the gap between Mauritania and Algeria, is associated with approximately 18 percent
diÔ¨Äerence in income per capita. In columns 6 and 8, we also add dummies for Africa,
Asia and other continents, with America as the omitted group. Although expropriation
risk remains significant, the continent dummies are also statistically and quantitatively
significant. For example, the coeÔ¨Écient of the Africa dummy in column 8 indicates that
in our sample African countries are 90 log points (approximately 145 percent) poorer even
after taking the eÔ¨Äect of institutions into account.
      Overall, the results in Table 2 show a strong correlation between institutions and
economic performance. Nevertheless, there are a number of important reasons for not in-
terpreting this relationship as causal. First, our measure refers to current institutions, so
it is plausible that rich economies are able to aÔ¨Äord, or perhaps prefer, better institutions.
Arguably more important than this reverse causality problem, there are many omitted
determinants of income diÔ¨Äerences that will naturally be correlated with institutions. Fi-
nally, the measures of institutions are constructed ex post, and the analysts may have
had a natural bias in seeing better institutions in richer places. As well as these problems
 13
      We focus on the inter-quartile range in order to reduce the influence of measurement error.



                                                    16
introducing positive bias in the OLS estimates, the fact that the institutions variable is
measured with considerable error creates attenuation and may bias the OLS estimates
downwards. All of these problems could be solved if we had an instrument for institu-
tions. Such an instrument must be an important factor in accounting for the institutional
variation that we observe, but not have a direct eÔ¨Äect on performance. Our discussion
in Section 2 suggests that the mortality rates faced by the settlers during the time of
colonization is a plausible instrument. The next section will describe the construction of
this variable in more detail.

                 4   Data on the Mortality of Early Settlers

Our data on the mortality of European settlers come largely from the work of Philip
Curtin. In a series of books and articles over a period of nearly 40 years, Curtin has used
a variety of sources to document the mortality of Europeans in new colonies. Systematic
military medical record keeping began only after 1815, as an attempt to understand why
so many soldiers were dying in some places. The first detailed studies were retrospective
and dealt with British forces between 1817 and 1836. The U.S. and French governments
quickly adopted similar methods (Curtin 1989, p. 3 and p. 5), and some early data
are also available for the Dutch East Indies.     By the 1870s, most European countries
published regular reports on the health of their soldiers.
   The standard measure is annualized deaths per thousand mean strength. This measure
reports the death rate among 1,000 soldiers where each death is replaced with a new
soldier. Curtin (1989 and 1998) reviews in detail the construction of these estimates for
particular places and campaigns, and assesses which data should be considered reliable.
   The data can be divided into two parts.       Curtin (1989), Death by Migration, deals
primarily with the mortality of European troops from 1817 to 1848. At this time modern
medicine was still in its infancy, and none of the European militaries yet understood
how to design their campaigns so as to reduce mortality. This period is well before the
control of malaria and yellow fever was understood, and these were the major causes
of death from disease for both soldiers and settlers in places where mortality was high
(the third main cause of death was gastrointestinal diseases). These mortality rates can
therefore be interpreted as reasonable estimates of settler mortality. They are consistent
with substantial evidence from other sources (see, for example, Curtin 1964 and Curtin
1968).


                                            17
       Curtin (1998), Disease and Empire, adds similar data on the mortality of soldiers in
the second half of the nineteenth century. These numbers have to be used with more care,
because there was a growing awareness of how to avoid epidemics of the worst tropical
diseases, at least during short military campaigns. For example, the campaign in Ethiopia
at the end of the nineteenth century had very low mortality rates because it was short
and well-managed (see Table A2 and Figure 1). Although the mortality rates from this
successful campaign certainly underestimate the mortality rates faced by the settlers in
Ethiopia, we did not exclude this country because excluding it would have helped our
hypothesis. In all cases, we use the earliest available number for each country, reasoning
that this is the best estimate of the mortality that settlers would have faced, at least until
the 20th century.
       Appendix B reviews in detail how our data are constructed, and describes alternative
assumptions that check the robustness of our results. The main gap in the Curtin data is
for South America since the Spanish and Portuguese militaries did not keep good records
of mortality.      However, Gutierrez (1986) used Vatican records to construct estimates
for the mortality rates of bishops in Latin America from 1604 to 1876.                  Because these
data overlap with the Curtin estimates for several countries, we are able to construct
a data series for South America (details are in the Appendix).14                  Curtin (1964) also
provides estimates of mortality in naval squadrons for diÔ¨Äerent regions which we can use
to generate alternative estimates of mortality in South America.                We show in Table 5
that these alternative methods produce remarkably similar results.

       5     Institutions and Performance: Instrumental Variables Results
5.1        Determinants of Current Institutions

Mathematically, our theory can be expressed in the following way. Equation (1), which
we rewrite here,
                                   log yi = ¬µ + Œ±Ri + Xi0 Œ≥ + Œµi ,                                   (1)
describes the relationship between current institutions and log GDP. In addition we have

                                  Ri = ŒªR + Œ≤R Ci + Xi0 Œ≥R + ŒΩRi                                     (2)

                                   Ci = ŒªC + Œ≤C Si + Xi0 Œ≥C + ŒΩCi                                    (3)
  14
     Combining data from a variety of sources will surely introduce measurement error in our estimates of
settler mortality. Nevertheless, since we are using settler mortality as an instrument, this measurement
error does not lead to inconsistent estimates of the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on performance.

                                                   18
                                Si = ŒªS + Œ≤S log Mi + Xi0 Œ≥S + ŒΩSi                                 (4)

where R is the measure of current institutions (protection against expropriation between
1985 and 1995), C is our measure of early (circa 1900) institutions, S is the measure of
European settlements in the colony (fraction of the population with European decent in
1900), and M is mortality rates faced by settlers. X is a vector of covariates that aÔ¨Äect
all variables.
       The simplest identification strategy is to use log Mi directly as an instrument for Ri in
equation (1). This identification strategy will be valid as long as log Mi is uncorrelated
with Œµi ‚Äìeven if Ci and Si were correlated with Œµi . For example, if Europeans were more
likely to migrate to places with better resources and soil quality, and if resources and soil
quality still had an eÔ¨Äect on income, there would be a correlation between Si and Œµi . This
would make European migration patterns an invalid instrument for current institutions.
Nevertheless, our identification strategy of using log Mi directly as an instrument would
be valid. We start with this identification strategy, and then use the other equations to
derive overidentifying restrictions.
       Figure 2 illustrates the relationship between the (potential) settler mortality rates and
the index of institutions. We use the logarithm of the settler mortality rates, since there
are no theoretical reasons to prefer the level as a determinant of institutions rather than
the log, and using the log ensures that the extreme African mortality rates do not play a
disproportionate role. As it happens, there is an almost linear relationship between the
log of the mortality rate and our measure of institutions.15
       In Table 3, we document that this relationship works through the channels hypothe-
sized in Section 2. In particular, we present OLS regressions of equations (2), (3), and (4).
In the top panel, we regress the protection against expropriation variable on the other
variables. Column 1 uses constraints faced by the executive in 1900 as the regressor, and
shows a close association between early institutions and institutions today. For example,
past institutions alone explain 21 percent of the variation in the index of current institu-
tions. The second column adds the latitude variable, with little eÔ¨Äect on the estimate.
Columns 3 and 4 use the democracy index, and confirm the results using the constraints
on the executive variable.
       Both constraints on the executive and democracy indices assign low scores to countries
  15
    Note that Gambia has a surprisingly good score for protection against expropriation risk. We do not
exclude this country, since doing so would help our hypothesis.



                                                  19
that were colonies in 1900, and do not use the earliest post-independence information for
Latin American countries and Neo-Europes . In columns 5 and 6, we adopt an alternative
approach and use the constraints on the executive in the first year of independence (and
also control separately for time since independence). The results are similar, and indicate
that early institutions persist.
      Columns 7 and 8 show the association between protection against expropriation and
European settlements. The fraction of Europeans in 1900 alone explains approximately
29 percent of the variation in our institutions variable today. Columns 9 and 10 show the
relationship between the protection against expropriation variable and the mortality rates
faced by settlers. This specification will be the first-stage for our main 2SLS estimates.
These regressions show that settler mortality alone explains 26 percent of the diÔ¨Äerences
in institutions we observe today.
      Panel B of Table 3 provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that early institu-
tions were shaped, at least in part, by settlements, and that settlements were aÔ¨Äected by
mortality. Columns 1-2 and 5-6 relate our measure of constraint on the executive and
democracy in 1900 to the measure of European settlements in 1900 (fraction of the pop-
ulation of European decent). Columns 3‚Äî4 and 7-8 relate the same variables to mortality
rates of settlers. These regressions show that settlement patterns explain over 50 percent
of the variation in early institutions.      Finally, columns 9 and 10 show the relationship
between settlements and mortality rates.
      Overall, Table 3 provides support for our hypothesis that mortality rates faced by
potential settlers aÔ¨Äected settlement behavior, and that settlement behavior aÔ¨Äected the
type of institutions that the colonialists brought to the country, and finally that early in-
stitutions persisted to the present. We next use settler mortality directly as an instrument
for current institutions, and look at the impact of current institutions on performance.

5.2    Institutions and Economic Performance

The basic results are presented in Table 4. The main equation is (1). We treat the
protection against expropriation variable, Ri , as endogenous, and model it as

                                   Ri = Œ∂ + Œ≤ log Mi + Xi0 Œ¥ + vi                        (5)

where Mi is our settler mortality rate. The exclusion restriction is that this variable does
not appear in (1). So we estimate equations (1) and (5) jointly with two stage least
squares (2SLS), using log Mi as an instrument for Ri .

                                                20
       Panel A of Table 4 reports 2SLS estimates of the coeÔ¨Écient of interest, Œ± from equation
(1) and Panel B gives the corresponding first-stages.16 Column 1 displays the strong
first-stage relationship between (log) settler mortality and current institutions in our
base sample, also shown in Table 3.           The corresponding 2SLS estimate of the impact
of institutions on income per capita is 0.95 This estimate is highly significant with a
standard error of 0.16, and in fact larger than the OLS estimates reported in Table 2.
This suggests that measurement error in the institutions variables that creates attenuation
bias is likely to be more important than reverse causality and omitted variables biases.
       To evaluate the quantitative significance of these estimates, we again compare the 25th
and 75th percentiles of the distribution of the protection against expropriation variable
among all ex-colonies. The baseline 2SLS estimate of 0.95 implies that there should be
a 171 log point (450 percent) diÔ¨Äerence between the average GDPs of the countries at
the 25th and 75th percentiles of the distribution of protection against expropriation, as
compared to the 185 log points (540 percent) diÔ¨Äerence in the data. Therefore, these
estimates suggest that over three-quarters of the income per capita diÔ¨Äerences across
countries is due to diÔ¨Äerences in institutions.           Figure 3 plots the predicted values of
income per capita from our baseline regression, which includes only the institutions index
as a regressor, against actual income per capita for the countries in our sample (as well
as the 45 degree line). Most observations are close to the 45 degree line, which confirms
the explanatory power of our regression.17
       Column 2 shows that adding latitude does not change the relationship; the institutions
coeÔ¨Écient is now 0.98 with a standard error of 0.22.18 Remarkably, the latitude variable
now has the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù sign and is insignificant. This result suggests that many previous
studies may have found latitude to be a significant determinant of economic performance
because it is correlated with institutions (or with their exogenous component caused by
early colonial experience).
       Columns 3 and 4 document that our results are not driven by the Neo-Europes. When
we exclude the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the estimates remain highly
  16
     We have also run these regressions with standard errors corrected for possible clustering of the
mortality rates assigned from the same disease environment. This clustering has little eÔ¨Äect on the
standard errors, and does not change our results.
  17
     The cloud of points in this graph indicates a slope somewhat smaller than the 45 degree line, so our
2SLS estimates may be underpredicting the income level in the countries with the worst institutions.
  18
     In 2SLS estimation, all covariates that are included in the second stage, such as latitude, are also
included in the first stage. When these first stage eÔ¨Äects are of no major significance for our argument,
we do not report them in the tables to save space.


                                                   21
significant, and in fact increase a little. For example, the coeÔ¨Écient for institutions is
now 1.29 (s.e.=0.37) without the latitude control, and 1.2 (s.e.=0.35) when we control for
latitude.
       Columns 5 and 6 show that the result is also robust to dropping all the African
countries from our sample. The estimates without Africa are somewhat smaller, but also
more precise. For example, the coeÔ¨Écient for institutions is 0.61 (s.e.=0.11) without the
latitude control, and 0.59 (s.e.=0.12) when we control for latitude.
       In Columns 7 and 8, we add continent dummies to the regressions (for Africa, Asia
and other, with America as the omitted group).                The addition of these dummies does
not change the estimated eÔ¨Äect of institutions, and the dummies are jointly insignificant
at the 5 percent level, though the dummy for Asia is significantly diÔ¨Äerent from that
of America. The fact that the African dummy is insignificant suggests that the reason
why African countries are poorer is not due to cultural or geographic factors, but mostly
accounted for by the existence of worse institutions in Africa.
       In Appendix Table A4a, b, c, d, and e, we repeat the same exercise using a variety
of alternative measures of institutions. These are constraints on the executive from the
Polity III dataset, an index of law and order tradition from Political Risk Services, a
measure of property rights from the Heritage Foundation, a measure of rule of law from
the Fraser Institute, and the eÔ¨Éciency of the judiciary from Business International (see
Tables A1 and A4 for more details). The results and the magnitudes are very similar
to those reported in Table 4. Furthermore, in Appendix Table A3, we also report very
similar results with 1970 values for the constraints on the executive and income per capita
in 1970, which show that the relationship between institutional measures and income per
capita holds across time periods.19
       We should note at this point that if we limit the sample to African countries only,
the first stage relationship using the protection against expropriation variable becomes
considerably weaker, and the 2SLS eÔ¨Äect of institutions is no longer significant.                     The
2SLS eÔ¨Äect of institutions continue to be significant when we use the constraint on the
  19
    The presence of alternative measures of institutions also enables us to ascertain whether the diÔ¨Äerence
between OLS and 2SLS estimates could really be due to measurement error in the institution variable. If
we use the constraints on the executive measure as an instrument for the protection against expropriation
measure, this would solve the measurement error, but not the endogeneity problem. This exercise leads
to an estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of protection against expropriation equal to .88 (with standard error .16),
which suggests that measurement error in the institutions variables is very important, and can explain
the whole diÔ¨Äerence between the OLS and 2SLS estimates.



                                                    22
executive variable or Fraser Institute‚Äôs rule of law variable (and not with other measures).
Therefore, we conclude that the relationship between settler mortality and institutions is
weaker within Africa.
      Overall, the results in Table 4 show a large eÔ¨Äect of institutions on economic perfor-
mance. In the rest of the paper, we investigate the robustness of these results.

                                      6   Robustness
6.1    Alternative samples

In Table 5, we investigate the robustness of our results in diÔ¨Äerent subsamples. In Table
4 we reported results in samples which diÔ¨Äered by region. Here our objective is to see
whether the results are robust to varying degrees of data quality and diÔ¨Äerent methods of
constructing the mortality estimates. In columns 1 and 2, we only use data from Curtin
(1989), Death by Migration, which is for 17 countries and refers always to pre-1840 data.
In this smaller sample, we find an even stronger relationship both in the first stage and
the second stage. The 2SLS estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income per capita
is 1.0 (s.e.=0.25) without controlling for latitude, and 1.1 (s.e.=0.33) when latitude is
included in the regression (compared to 0.95 and 0.98 in Table 4).
      In columns 3 and 4, we add data from the second book by Curtin (1998), Disease and
Empire, for the earliest date available for each country.     This increases the sample to
31 countries, and reduces both the estimate and the standard error a little; the results
are now much more similar to those reported in Table 4.        In columns 5 and 6, we use
other information (described in detail in the Appendix), to assign mortality rates to
neighboring countries with the same disease environment. This increases the sample to
44, and changes the estimates little. In columns 7 and 8, we add data for Latin America,
but this time from naval stations instead of bishops. The results are identical to those
obtained in Table 4. In columns 9 and 10, we use an alternative (‚Äúconservative‚Äù) coding of
the African data. In particular, rather than using African estimates from small samples,
we assign mortality rates to areas that shared the same disease environment. For example,
the same number from Sierra Leone is applied to Benin, Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Guinea,
Nigeria, Togo, and the number from French Soudan is assigned to Mali and Niger. This
leads to estimates very similar to our baseline results.    Finally, in columns 11 and 12,
we report regressions using mortality rates relative to home country, which again yield
very similar eÔ¨Äects. Overall we conclude that the results hold in diÔ¨Äerent samples with


                                              23
varying degrees of data reliability.

6.2     Additional controls

The validity of our 2SLS results in Table 4 depends on the assumption that settler mor-
tality in the past has no direct eÔ¨Äect on current economic performance. Although this
presumption appears reasonable, here we substantiate it further by directly controlling
for many of the variables that could plausibly be correlated with both settler mortality
and economic outcomes. Overall, we find that our results change remarkably little with
the inclusion of these variables, and many variables emphasized in previous work become
insignificant once the eÔ¨Äect of institutions is controlled for.
       La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1999) argue for the importance of
colonial origin (main colonizer) as a determinant of current institutions. The identity of
the colonial power could also matter because it might have an eÔ¨Äect through culture, as
argued by Landes (1998).          In column 1, we add dummies for the identity of the main
colonizer (for Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, with
Britain as the omitted group).20 The top panel gives the 2SLS estimates, the second panel
gives the first stage, and the bottom panel gives the corresponding OLS coeÔ¨Écient on the
protection against expropriation variable.            The even numbered columns add latitude.
With or without latitude, the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income per capita is robust to
the inclusion of these dummies. Interestingly, the first-stage estimates show that these
dummies are jointly insignificant at the 15 percent level (i.e., a p-value over .15), when
the eÔ¨Äect of mortality rates faced by the colonizers is controlled for (even though the
dummy for being a Belgian colony, which captures the Congo, is significantly negative).
These results therefore show little evidence for a major influence of the identity of the
colonizer on institutions once we control for the eÔ¨Äect of the mortality rates faced by
colonialists. They therefore contrast with a common perception that the British former
colonies perform better.21 The reason why British colonies appear to perform better in
  20
      In the table, we only report the coeÔ¨Écients on the Belgian, French and Spanish dummies to save
space, but the other dummies are also included in the estimation.
   21
      2SLS estimates show that the identity of the colonizer does have an eÔ¨Äect on income per capita (i.e.,
an eÔ¨Äect not working through institutions). In particular, Belgian and Spanish ex-colonies do better than
expected relative to their institutions. This is because Belgian and Spanish ex-colonies have substantially
worse institutions, but the performance of these countries is not as bad as would be expected on the
basis of their institutions alone. The Belgian and Spanish dummies therefore take on positive values
in the 2SLS estimatation to compensate for this. For example, in the case of Belgian colonies, the
first-stage eÔ¨Äect is -2.9, which multiplied with the coeÔ¨Écient of 1.1 on institutions, implies that Belgian


                                                    24
other studies seems to be that Britain colonized places where settlements were possible,
and this made British colonies inherit better institutions (in our sample too, ex-British
colonies have considerably better institutions, so if we drop the log mortality variable
from the regression, the British dummy has a significant and large positive eÔ¨Äect on
institutions).
    Hayek and (1960) and LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1999) also
emphasize the importance of legal origin. In columns 3 and 4, we control for legal origin.
In our sample, all countries have either French or British legal origins, so we simply add a
dummy for French legal origin (many countries that are not French colonies nonetheless
have French legal origin).         Once again, our estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on
income per capita is unaÔ¨Äected. This time, however, we find that French legal origin is
associated with worse institutions, even when we control for the mortality rates faced by
the settlers.22
    An argument dating back to Max Weber views religion as a key determinant of eco-
nomic performance. To control for this, in columns 5 and 6, we add the fraction of the
populations that are Catholic, Muslim, and of other religions, with Protestants as the
ommitted group. In the table we report the significance level (p-value) of the correspond-
ing F-statistic for these dummies as well as the 2SLS estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of institutions.
Religion appears highly correlated with income per capita (in particular, higher fractions
of Catholics and Protestants are associated with greater income per capita), but the 2SLS
estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of institutions hardly changes. Finally, column 7 adds all the vari-
ables in this table simultaneously. Again, these controls have very little eÔ¨Äect on our main
estimate.
    Another concern is that settler mortality is correlated with climate and current dis-
ease environment. Our instrument may therefore be picking up the direct eÔ¨Äect of these
variables. In Table 7, we add a set of temperature and humidity variables. These are:
average, minimum and maximum monthly high temperatures, and minimum and max-
imum monthly low temperatures, and morning minimum and maximum humidity, and
ex-colonies should be approximately 320 log points poorer. The positive coeÔ¨Écient of 2.4 in the second-
stage somewhat compensates for this, and leaves a net eÔ¨Äect of 240-320=-80 log points (122 percent) for
Belgian colonies‚Äìstill a very large eÔ¨Äect!
  22
     In the second stage estimation, when the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on performance is taken into account,
the French legal origin dummy is positive. This is again for the reasons outlined in footnote 21. The net
eÔ¨Äect of having French legal origin is not as bad as one would expect on the basis of the eÔ¨Äect of French
legal origins on institutions, but is still substantially negative, -90+23=-67 log points (approximately 95
percent).


                                                    25
afternoon minimum and maximum humidity. In the table we report joint significance
levels for these variables (all data from Parker, 1997). Again, they have little eÔ¨Äect on
our estimates.
       Sachs and a series of coauthors have argued for the importance of malaria in explain-
ing African poverty (see, for example, Bloom and Sachs, 1998, Gallup and Sachs, 1998,
and Gallup et al., 1998). Since malaria was one of the main causes of settler mortality,
our estimate may be capturing some of the direct eÔ¨Äects of malaria. We are skeptical
of this argument since the prevalence of malaria is highly endogenous; it is the poorer
countries with worse institutions that have been unable to eradicate malaria.23 Moreover,
it is hard to imagine how malaria could have such a large eÔ¨Äect on economic performance.
Although Sachs and coauthors argue that this works through poor health, high mortal-
ity and absenteeism, most people who live in high malaria areas have developed some
immunity to the disease‚Äìif they survive to the age of five, they can fall ill periodically
but malaria is not fatal to them (see Curtin, 1998, or Bruce-Chwatt, 1980). We might
therefore expect that malaria should not have a very large eÔ¨Äect on economic performance
(though, obviously, it will have very high social costs).           In contrast, for Europeans, or
anyone else who has not been exposed to malaria as a very young child, malaria is fatal,24
making variations in malaria a key determinant of whether Europeans could settle in a
colony.
       In any case, controlling for malaria does not change our results. We do this in the
second part of Table 7 by controlling for the fraction of the population who live in an area
where falciporum malaria is endemic in 1994 (as constructed and used by Gallup et al,
1998). In Appendix C, we show that the inclusion of an endogenous variable positively
correlated with income or institutions will bias the coeÔ¨Écient on institutions downwards.
Since the prevalence of malaria in 1994 is highly endogenous, controlling for it directly
will therefore underestimate the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on performance. As a result, the
coeÔ¨Écient on protection against expropriation is estimated to be somewhat smaller in
  23
      For example, the U.S. eliminated malaria from the Panama Canal zone, and Australia eliminated
it from Queensland (see Crosby, 1986, pp.141-142). Even in Africa, there are very successful campaign
against malaria, including those in Algeria and that conducted by the Rio-Tinto Zinc mining company
in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia).
   24
      Some types of malaria are quite local. It is therefore quite possible for a person to have immunity
to the local version of malaria, but to be highly vulnerable to malaria a short distance away. This
is probably one explanation why Africans had such high mortality when they were forced to move by
colonial powers. For example, African labor on the Congo-Ocean railroad had mortality of 240 per
thousand at its peak, and 100 per thousand on average (Curtin, et al., 1995).



                                                   26
Table 7, .76 instead of .95 as in Table 4. Nevertheless, it remains highly significant with
a standard error of .27, while malaria itself is highly insignificant.25 Hence, we conclude
that the eÔ¨Äect of settler mortality on performance is not through its correlation with the
current disease environment, but likely through its eÔ¨Äect on institutions.
       A related concern is that in colonies where Europeans settled, the current population
consists of a higher fraction of Europeans. One might be worried that we are capturing
the direct eÔ¨Äect of having more Europeans. To control for this we add the fraction of the
population of European descent in columns 7 and 8 of Table 7 (constructed from McEvedy
and Jones (1978), Curtin et al (1995) and some additional sources; see Appendix Table
A5). Interestingly, this variable is insignificant, while the eÔ¨Äect of institutions remains
highly significant, with a coeÔ¨Écient of .87 and a standard error of .21. In column 9 of
Table 7, we add all these variables, for temperature, humidity, malaria, and European
descent, together, and the estimate of the eÔ¨Äect of protection against expropriation on
income per capita is aÔ¨Äected little.
       Finally, in Table 8 we add a variety of controls for other potential determinants of
income per capita. These include a measure of ethnolinguistic fragmentation, measures
of soil quality and natural resources, and whether the country is landlocked (see the
Table A1 in the Appendix for definitions). For example, in column 1 where we include
ethnolinguistic fragmentation, the coeÔ¨Écient of protection against expropriation is 0.74
(s.e.= 0.13), which is only slightly smaller than our baseline estimate. Since ethnolinguistic
fragmentation is likely to be endogenous with respect to development (i.e., ethnolinguistic
fragmentation tends to disappear during periods of growth and formation of centralized
markets, see Weber, 1976, or Andersen, 1983) and is correlated with settler mortality, the
estimate of 0.74 likely understates the eÔ¨Äect of institutions on income (see Appendix C).
The estimates also change relatively little when other controls are added. We therefore
conclude that the eÔ¨Äect of variations in institutions caused by early colonial experience
on income is robust, and likely captures the causal eÔ¨Äect of institutions and government
policies on economic well-being.
  25
     Malaria is marginally significant in column 9 when we control for latitude, fraction of European
descent, and eight temperature and humidity variables. Nevertheless, all of these variables, or any subset
of them with malaria, are always jointly insignificant. For example, the F-test that all of these variables
are insignificant has a p-value of .17.

6.3     Overidentification tests

We can also investigate the validity of our approach by using overidentification tests.
Recall that according to our theory, settler mortality aÔ¨Äected settlements; settlements
aÔ¨Äected early institutions; and early institutions aÔ¨Äected current institutions. Mathemat-
ically, we expressed these links by equations (2), (3), and (4). We can test whether any
of these variables, C, S, and M , has a direct eÔ¨Äect on income per capita, log y, by using
measures of C and S as additional instruments.
      The overidentification test will reject if:

  1. the equation of interest (1) does not have a constant coeÔ¨Écient, i.e., log yi = ¬µ +
        Œ±i Ri + Œµi , or

  2. C or S has a direct eÔ¨Äect on income per capita, log yi (i.e., either S or C is correlated
        with Œµi ), or

  3. settler mortality, M , has an eÔ¨Äect on log yi that works through another variable,
        such as culture.

      The overidentifying restrictions implied by our approach are never rejected. This
implies that, subject to the caveats related to the power of the overidentification tests, we
can rule out all three of the above possibilities. This gives us additional confidence that
settler mortality is a valid instrument and that we are estimating the eÔ¨Äect of institutions
on current performance with our instrumental variable strategy (i.e., not capturing the
eÔ¨Äect of some other variable correlated with settler mortality).
      The results of the overidentification tests, and related results, are reported in Table 9.
In the top panel, Panel A, we report the 2SLS estimates of the eÔ¨Äect of protection against
expropriation on GDP per capita using a variety of instruments other than mortality
rates, while Panel B gives the corresponding first-stages.         These estimates are always
quite close to those reported in Table 4.           For example, in column 1, we use European
settlements in 1900 as the only instrument for institutions. This results in an estimated
eÔ¨Äect of .90 (with standard error .13), as compared to our baseline estimate of .95. The
other columns add latitude, and use other instruments such as constraint on the executive
in 1900 and in the first year of independence, and democracy in 1900.
      Panel D reports an easy-to-interpret version of the overidentification test.      It adds
the log of mortality as an exogenous regressor. If mortality rates faced by settlers had

                                                    28
a direct eÔ¨Äect on income per capita, we would expect this variable to come in negative
and significant.   In all cases, it is small and statistically insignificant in all cases. For
example, in column 1, log mortality has a coeÔ¨Écient of -.06 (with standard error .07).
This confirms that the impact of mortality rates faced by settlers likely works through
their eÔ¨Äect on institutions.
   Finally, for completeness, in Panel C we report the p-value from the appropriate
œá2 overidentification test. This tests whether the 2SLS coeÔ¨Écients estimated with the
instruments indicated in Panels A and B versus the coeÔ¨Écients estimated using (log)
settler mortality in addition to the other instruments are significantly diÔ¨Äerent (e.g., in the
first column, the coeÔ¨Écients using European settlements alone are compared to estimates
using European settlements and log mortality as instruments).            We never reject the
hypothesis that they are equal; so these results also show no evidence that mortality rates
faced by settlers have a direct eÔ¨Äect‚Äìor an eÔ¨Äect working through a variable other than
institutions‚Äì on income per capita.

                               7    Concluding Remarks

Many economists and social scientists believe that diÔ¨Äerences in institutions and state
policies are at the root of large diÔ¨Äerences in income per capita across countries. There is
little agreement, however, about what determines institutions and the attitude of govern-
ments towards economic progress. This makes it diÔ¨Écult to isolate exogenous sources of
variation in institutions to estimate their eÔ¨Äect on performance. In this paper we argued
that diÔ¨Äerences in colonial experience could be a viable source of exogenous diÔ¨Äerences in
institutions.
   Our argument rests on the following premises. Europeans adopted very diÔ¨Äerent col-
onization strategies, with diÔ¨Äerent associated institutions. In one extreme, as in the case
of the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, they went and settled in the colonies and set-up
institutions that enforced the rule of law and encouraged investment. In the other ex-
treme, as in the Congo or the Gold Coast, they set up extractive states with the intention
of transferring resources rapidly to the metropole. The slave trade is perhaps the most
extreme example of this behavior. These sets of institutions were very detrimental to in-
vestment and economic progress. Which colonization strategy was adopted was, at least
in part, determined by the feasibility of European settlement. In places where Europeans
faced very high mortality rates, they could not go and settle, and they were more likely


                                              29
to set up extractive states. Finally, we argue that these early institutions persisted to the
present. Determinants of whether Europeans could go and settle in the colonies, therefore,
have an important eÔ¨Äect on institutions today. We exploit these diÔ¨Äerences as a source
of exogenous variation to estimate the influence of institutions on economic performance.
   We document these hypotheses in the data by showing a high correlation between
mortality rates faced by soldiers, bishops, and sailors in the colonies and European set-
tlements; between European settlements and early measures of institutions; and between
early institutions and institutions today. We estimate large eÔ¨Äects of institutions on in-
come per capita using this source of variation. Our estimates imply that diÔ¨Äerences in
institutions account for roughly three-quarters of the diÔ¨Äerences in income per capita. We
also document that this relationship is not driven by outliers, and is robust to control-
ling for climate, current disease environment, religion, natural resources, and current race
composition.
   It is useful to point out that our findings do not imply that institutions today are
predetermined by colonial policies and cannot be changed. We emphasize colonial expe-
rience as one of the many factors aÔ¨Äecting institutions. Since mortality rates faced by
settlers are arguably exogenous, they are useful as an instrument to isolate the eÔ¨Äect of
institutions on performance. In fact, our reading is that these results suggest substantial
income gains from improving institutions in poor countries.
   There are many questions that our analysis does not address. Institutions are treated
to some degree as a ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù: our results indicate that reducing expropriation risk
(or increasing other measures of propoerty rights enforcement) would result in significant
gains in income per capita, but do not point out what type of concrete steps would lead
to an improvement in these institutions.      Institutional features, such as expropriation
risk, property rights enforcement or rule of law, should probably be interpreted as an
equilibrium outcome, related to some more fundamental ‚Äúinstitutions‚Äù, e.g., presidential
vs. parliamentary system, or the presence of common law, etc., which can be changed di-
rectly. A more detailed analysis of the eÔ¨Äect of more fundamental institutions on property
rights and expropriation risk is an important area for future study.

                            8    Appendix A:Data Sources

    Appendix Table A1 shows the complete list of variables that we use, together with
their definitions and sources.

            9   Appendix B:Construction of Settler Mortality Data

Appendix Table A2 reports our estimates for settler mortality in each country. The first
column of mortality estimates shows data from Curtin (1989) for countries located in the
exact place for which we have a mortality estimate from the first half of the nineteenth
century. These data are used in the first two columns of Table 5.
   We have direct estimates of settler mortality for Algeria (1831-38), Canada (1817-
36), Guyana (1819-36), Jamaica (1817-36), Malta (1817-36), Mauritius (1818-36), New
Zealand (1846-55), Senegal (1819-38), and Sierra Leone (1819-36). We also have compara-
ble estimates for Britain (1830-36) and France (1820-22 and 1824-26). In some cases there
has been a simple change of name, but the country is the same geographically. We can
therefore use the estimate of settler mortality from Ceylon (1817-36) for Sri Lanka, from
Coastal Burma (1829-38) for Myanmar, from Cape Colony (1818-36) for South Africa,
and from the Windwards and Leewards islands (1817-36) for Barbados and for Trinidad
and Tobago. It is also reasonable to use the mortality estimate from Bengal (1830-38)
for Bangladesh, from the Dutch East Indies (1819-28) for Indonesia, and from the Straits
Settlements (1829-38) for Malaysia and Singapore. Note that there is a large variation in
mortality between the Straits Settlements and Dutch East Indies, even though these areas
are quite close geographically. This is because there exists substantial variation in disease
environment, particularly for malaria, even in neighboring areas. For example, Curtin
(1998) explains in detail the substantial variation in malaria risk just within Madagascar
at the end of the nineteenth century. Micro-climate, particularly the pattern of rainfall
and the precise vegetation, play a significant role in determining the risk of malaria. See
Curtin (1989) for further discussion.
   For large countries where we have more than one regional estimate, we need to make
a choice.   For the U.S. we use the estimate for the Northern United States (1829-38).
For India we use the estimate from Madras (1829-38); this is lower than for Bengal but
higher than for Bombay.     None of our regression results are significantly aÔ¨Äected if we
use alternative regional data for these countries.
   The second column of mortality estimates in Appendix Table A2 adds data from

                                             31
Curtin (1998), which covers the second half of the nineteenth century. Whenever Curtin
provides more than one estimate, we use the earliest available number for each country.
We have mortality data directly from Mexico in 1862-63 and Tunisia in 1881.          As we
note in the text, data from the second half of the nineteenth century have to be used with
care, because there were improvements in the practice of military medicine around the
mid-nineteenth century, but most of this would not have helped to reduce the mortality
of civilian settlers. For example, the British campaigns of 1882 in Egypt, 1867-68 in
Ethiopia and the 1884-85 Nile expedition had low mortality because the army hurried
in and out with reasonable preventive health measures. We use the estimate for the
Magdala campaign of 1867-68 for Ethiopia (Curtin 1998, p. 44) and the post-campaign,
1882, mortality estimate for Egypt (the Egyptian 1882 campaign mortality was about
half the mortality in the immediate post-campaign period, see Curtin 1998, p. 158). For
Sudan, we use the death rate from 1885 at Suakin (on the coast). This was 88.2 per 1000
mean strength, mostly from typhoid. The very high mortality from disease in Madagascar
in 1895 is a reasonable estimate of what settlers would have expected because this was
not a particularly well-organized campaign (Curtin 1998, p. 188).
   In the Mali campaign during 1878, the French expeditionary force lost 49 percent of
its Europeans to disease, particularly to yellow fever, in less than two months (Curtin
1998, p. 89). This is equivalent to an annual rate of 2,940 per 1000 mean strength. This
is high relative to what would have been expected in most years, but quite typical of
periods when there was an outbreak of yellow fever. We do not know the true extent
of yellow fever in West Africa, precisely because it was a major disincentive to settle
and Europeans generally stayed away from the most dangerous places. Yellow fever was
thought less frequent on the Gold Coast (Ghana) than elsewhere in West Africa, but there
were recorded outbreaks in 1852, 1857, 1859, and 1862 (Curtin 1998, p. 65). In April-May
1873, an outbreak of yellow fever in the Niger delta killed two-thirds of the Europeans
there. This was a quite typical death rate (see Curtin 1998, Table 4.1, p. 79, for the death
rate of Europeans in Senegal yellow fever epidemics). The case fatality for nonimmune
adults before quinine was 25-75 percent from malaria and 75 percent for yellow fever.
   In Gambia, from May 1825 to December 1826, fever killed 279 British soldiers out
of a force that was seldom over 120 and often only 40 strong (Curtin 1998, p. 10).
Assuming a mean strength of 120 gives total deaths per 1,000 of 2,300, which is high but
not extraordinary for that time and place. This converts into a mortality rate of 120 per


                                            32
month, or 1,470 per year.
   The second column of mortality estimates in Appendix Table A2 assigns a settler
mortality number to a modern country if the country name today is the same as in Curtin
(1998). In Haut-Senegal (Niger), in 1880-83 there was a death rate of 400 per 1000 mean
strength (Curtin 1998, p. 85). In 1841, European mortality on a Niger expedition (in
modern Nigeria) was 167 per 1000 per month, equivalent to 2,004 per 1000 mean strength
per year (Curtin 1998, p. 89). In a period of several months, 82 percent of the Europeans
died from malaria. At least in this time and place, it was almost impossible for a person
to go for an entire year without receiving at least one infective mosquito bite.
   This second column also assigns the same number to countries that were previously
part of one country. For example, Burkina Fasu, Central African Federation, Chad, French
Congo, and Mauritania were part of French Soudan. The estimate for Vietnam is from
Cochin China.
   The third column of mortality estimates assigns a mortality number to a country if it
neighbors a country for which we have data and has the same disease environment. On
the Gold Coast (approximately southern Ghana today) in the period 1824-26, European
troops died from disease at a rate of 668 per 1000 per annum (Curtin 1998, p. 18).
Cote d‚ÄôIvoire and Togo had the same disease environment and we use the same estimate.
Angola, Cameroon, Rwanda, and Uganda receive the estimate from French Soudan, and
Guinea is from the Sierra Leone estimate. The estimate for Morocco is from Algeria and
Pakistan is from Bombay. Surinam is a neighor of French Guinea, for which we have a
direct estimate for the period 1819-36. The estimate for Kong is from the 1860 China
Field Force.
   The third column of mortality estimates also assigns a number to several countries
for which we do not have mortality data for Europeans but we do have data for Africans
who moved into this country from a diÔ¨Äerent disease environment, so they did not have
a built-up immunity to local malaria. As Curtin (1968) shows, in all situations where we
have adequate data, mortality of Africans from a disease environment is lower than but
comparable to European mortality. We can have a reasonable lower bound on European
mortality in Kenya of 145 per 1000 (Curtin et al 1995, p. 491) and in Congo of 240 per
1000 (Curtin et al 1995, p. 463).
   The fourth column of Appendix Table A2 provides the data that we use in most of our
analysis. We use the data from the third column and add settler mortality estimates for a


                                            33
few countries that are close by and have the same disease environment as places for which
we have direct data. We use the New Zealand estimate for Australia and the Windwards
and Leewards estimate for the Bahamas, Jamaica for Haiti and the Dominican Republic
(information from Gutierrez 1986 indicates that these were similar disease environments).
       We also use a combination of the Gutierrez (1986) and Curtin (1989) numbers to
construct estimates for South America.              Gutierrez calculates the mortality of bishops
aged 40-49 for three disease environments in the Caribbean, Central and South America:
10 (low), 11 (medium), and 23 (high) per 1000. We assume the ratio between bishop
mortality levels in diÔ¨Äerent disease environments was the same as the ratio between soldier
mortality. We also assume that the type of disease environment (low, medium or high)
was the same for bishops and soldiers. We then use Gutierrez‚Äôs ratios with the Curtin
(1998) estimate of mortality of 71 per 1000 for Mexico 1862-63 (a low mortality region
in Gutierrez‚Äôs classification), to generate estimates of mortality for Central and South
America.
       Note that the estimates we obtain would be virtually the same if we used the Curtin
(1989) estimate for Jamaica as the benchmark (a high disease environment by Gutierrez‚Äôs
classification).    The implied mortality in Jamaica, using the Gutierrez data, would be
163.3. The direct estimate for mortality in Jamaica is 130 per 1000 in 1817-36 (Curtin,
1989).      Running our regressions using data that takes Jamaica as the base for applying
the Gutierrez‚Äôs ratios actually strengthens our results.
       Gutierrez provides considerable detail on the location of low, medium, and high mortal-
ity areas for bishops. High mortality regions are the Caribbean, low lying parts of Central
America, and tropical South America. This includes Nicaragua, and Panama. Medium
mortality locations are Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Paraguay, and Venezuela.
Low mortality locations are Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, and
Uruguay.26 Some of these countries have a large variation in their disease environment,
even for a relatively small country.          We know, for example, that the Colombian coast
was very unhealthy to Europeans. Mortality in the British siege of Cartegena in 1742
was very high‚Äì the force was there for only two months, but deaths from disease were
between 2/3 and 3/4 of the army (Curtin, 1989, p. 2). But most Europeans who went
  26
     It is particularly diÔ¨Écult to assign an estimate to Brazil because we do not know the precise diÔ¨Äerence
in mortality between the North-East, where much of the early settlement was attempted, and more
southern locations that later attracted population. We have adopted a low mortality estimate as this is
less favorable to our hypothesis.



                                                    34
to Colombia were able to settle at a higher altitude, e.g., in Bogota, where the disease
environment was much more favorable. It therefore seems reasonable to follow Gutier-
rez‚Äôs classification of disease environments, as the bishops tended to live where European
population was concentrated.
     The last column of Appendix Table A2 uses an alternative source to calculate mortality
in Latin America. Average annual mortality, 1825-1845, from disease in the British naval
forces oÔ¨Ä West Africa was 54.4 per thousand (Curtin, 1964, p. 486).            Comparable
mortality from disease at other naval stations over the same period was 7.7 in South
America, 9.3 in the Mediteranean, 9.8 in the Home Station, 15.1 in the East Indies, and
18.1 in the West Indies. The level of mortality from disease for British sailors was lower
than for British soldiers in all locations, but it is reasonable to assume that the ratio of
mortalities between the various regions was approximately the same.
     This change of data does not aÔ¨Äect the numbers much. For example, Argentina and
Chile move from a mortality of 71 per 1000 (using the data on bishops) to 68.9 (using the
data on naval forces). Table 5 reports regression results using alternative classifications,
with little eÔ¨Äect on our findings.
     Our baseline estimates in column 4 imply very high mortality rates in a number of
West African countries. Some of these estimates come from relatively small samples of
soldiers. We take comfort in the fact that our results are not aÔ¨Äected when all African
countries are dropped from the sample. Nevertheless, as another check on our results, we
constructed a more conservative series of mortality estimates, which is reported in column
6.   This series uses only Curtin estimates from long sample periods, and assigns those
to neighboring countries with the same disease environment.       In particular, this series
assigns the mortality estimate from Sierra Leone to Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and
Togo, and assigns the estimate from French Soudan to the French Congo, Kenya, Mali,
Niger, Tanzania, and Zaire. We also use an alternative, lower estimate of mortality for
Madagascar (from Curtin, 1998). Table 5 shows that this diÔ¨Äerent series leads to very
similar results to our baseline series.
     There still remain several significant gaps.   Most important, we do not have any
reliable estimates for much of Southern Africa, including Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, or Botswana. We also do not have any rea-
sonable estimates for Eritrea, the Philippines, Cape Verde or Comoros.         Liberia and
Thailand were not colonies and are not included in our study.


                                             35
   Appendix Table A2 reports mortality data for several countries for which we do not
have data on institutions or GDP per capita (PPP basis): Barbados, Central African
Federation, Chad, Mauritania, Myanmar, Mauritius, Rwanda, and Surinam.             Qualita-
tively, the GDP per capita in these countries is quite consistent with the settler mortality
numbers and our regression results.
   Finally, note that these estimates of mortality for soldiers are similar to the more
fragmentary evidence available on civilian settlers.    For example, we know that early
European attempts to settle in West Africa foundered due to high mortality from disease
(Curtin, 1964). In the ‚ÄúProvince of Freedom‚Äù European mortality in the first year was
46 percent, in Bulama (April 1792-April 1793) there was 61 percent mortality among
Europeans, and in the first year of the Sierra Leone Company (1792-1793) 72 percent of
the European settlers died.

To simplify notation, suppose that Ri is exogenous, and another variable that is endoge-
nous, zi , such as prevalence of malaria or ethnolinguistic fragmentation, is added to the
regression. Then, the simultaneous equations model becomes
                                   Yi = ¬µ0 + Œ±Ri + œÄzi + Œµi
                                   zi = ¬µ1 + œÜYi + Œ∑i ,
where Yi = log yi . We presume that Œ± ‚â• 0, œÜ < 0, and œÄ < 0, which implies that
we interpret zi as a negative influence on income. Moreover, this naturally implies that
cov (Œ∑i , Œµi ) < 0 and cov (zi , Ri ) < 0, that is the factor zi is likely to be negatively correlated
with positive influences on income.

                                       Ri = Œ∫0 + Œ∫zi + Ri

and so

                                       Œ∫=             < 0,
                                         var (zi )
which is negative due to the fact that cov (Ri , zi ) < 0. The reduced form for zi is:
                               1
                       zi =         ((¬µ + œÜœÄ) + œÜŒ±Ri + œÜŒµi + Œ∑i ) .                    (7)
                            1 ‚àí œÜœÄ
We impose the regularity condition œÜ ¬∑ œÄ < 1, so that an increase in the disturbance to
the z-equation, Œ∑i , actually increases zi . Now using this reduced form, we can write
                                       cov(zi , Œµi )              (œÉŒµŒ∑ + œÜœÉŒµ2 )

                                                i                                i

where œÉŒµ2 is the variance of Œµ, and œÉŒµŒ∑ is the covariance of Œµ and Œ∑.
   Substituting for Œ∫ in (8), we obtain:
                                            (œÉŒµŒ∑ + œÜœÉŒµ2 )      cov (zi , Ri )

Standard deviations are in parentheses. Mortality is potential settler mortality, in deaths per annum per 1000 people,
sources and methods are described in Appendix Table 2. Quartiles of mortality are for our base sample of 64
observations. These are: (1) less than 65.4; (2) greater than or equal to 65.4 and less than 78.1; (3) great than or equal
to 78.1 and less than 280; (4) greater than or equal to 280.
Average Protection Against Expropriation is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score indicates greater
protection against risk of expropriation of investment by government, from Political Risk Services, with128
observations in the Whole World sample and 64 observations in our Base Sample. Constraint on Executive in 1990,
1900, and First Year of Independence is measured from 1 to 7, where a higher score indicates more constitutional
limits on arbitrary actions by the executive in that year, from the Polity III data set, with 89 observations in the Whole
World sample and 59 observations in our Base Sample. First Year of Independence is the first year that the country
appears in the Polity III data set. Democracy in 1900 is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score
indicates more democracy, from the Polity III data set, with 89 observations in the Whole World sample and 59
observations in our Base Sample.
European settlements in 1900 is the fraction of the population in 1900 that was European or of European descent
constructed from McEvedy and Jones (1978), Curtin et al (1995) and some additional sources (see Appendix Table
A5), with 155 observations in the Whole World sample and 63 observations in the Base Sample. Constraint on
executive in 1900 and democracy in 1900 are set equal to 1 (the lowest score) for countries that were colonies in that
year. See Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and sources.

Dependent Variable: Log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995, current prices, (from the World Bank's World Development Indicators
1999). Average protection against expropriation risk is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score means more protection
against expropriation, averaged over 1985 to 1995, from Political Risk Services. Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions
including dummies for the anti-expropriation index, the dummy for the first quartile --i.e., with highest risk of expropriation-- is the
omitted category. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy for America is omitted. See Appendix Table A1 for more detailed
variable definitions and sources.

All regressions are OLS, using base sample. Standard errors are in parentheses. Regressions with constraint on executive in first year of independence also include years since
independence as a regressor. Average protection against expropriation risk is a on scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score means more protection against expropriation of private
investment by government, averaged over 1985 to 1995. Constraint on Executive in 1900 is on a scale, from 1 to 7, with a higher score indicating more constraints. Democracy in 1990 is
on a scale from 0 to 10, with a higher score indicating more democracy. European settlements is percent of population that was European or of European descent in 1900.

"Average Protection Against Expropriation Risk 1985-95" is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score means more protection
against risk of expropriation of investment by the government, from Political Risk Services (see Appendix Table A1 for more detail). Panel
A reports the two stage least squares estimates with log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable and instrumenting for
protection against expropriation risk using log settler mortality; Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS
coefficient from regressing log GDP per capita on protection against expropriation risk, with the other control variables indicated in that
column (full results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy for
America is omitted.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates and Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from
regressing log GDP per capita on average protection against expropriation risk, with the other control variables indicated in that column (full results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses.
Columns (1) and (2) use data only from Curtin (1989); this is the "first mortality estimate" in Appendix Table A2. Columns (3) and (4) use earliest available data on mortality for each country; this is the "second
mortality estimate" in Appendix Table A2. Columns (5) and (6) assign the same mortality estimate to neighboring countries with similar disease environments; the "third mortality estimate" in Appendix Table A2.
Columns (7) and (8) use an alternative estimate of mortality in Latin America, based on data from British naval stations; the "fifth mortality estimate" in Appendix Table A2. Columns (9) and (10) use an alternativ
version of the Curtin estimates for Africa, which uses data only from long sample periods, and bishops for Latin America (the last column in Appendix Table A2).
Columns (11) and (12) use the log of the ratio of colonial to European mortality (Britain for British colonies and France for other colonies) as the measure of mortality; using the "fourth mortality estimate" colum
in Appendix Table A2. See Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and sources.

Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates with log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as dependent variable, and
Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. The Dutch, Italian, German and Portuguese colonial dummies are not
significant in the second or first stage and are not reported (to save space); the religion variables are included in the first
stage of columns (5) and (6) but not reported here (to save space). Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from regressing log
GDP per capita on average protection against expropriation risk, with the other control variables indicated in that column
(full results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions have 64 observations. The
religion variables are 100 times percentage of population that are Catholics, Muslims, and "other" religions; Protestant is the
base case. Our sample is all either French or British legal origin (as defined by La Porta et al 1999.)

including malaria and percent of European descent in 1975, which have 61 observations. The temperature and humidity variables are: average, minimum
and maximum monthly high temperatures, and minimum and maximum monthly low temperatures, and morning minimum and maximum humidity, and
afternoon minimum and maximum humidity. In the table we report joint significance levels for these variables (from Philip Parker, 1997). See Appendix
Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and sources.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995. Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates and Panel B reports the
corresponding first stages. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from regressing log GDP per capita on average protection against expropriation risk,
with the other control variables indicated in that column (full results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions
have 64 observations, except those including natural resources, which have 63 observations. Measures of natural resources are: percent of world gold
reserves today, percent of world iron reserves today, percent of world zinc reserves today, number of minerals present in country, and oil resources
(thousands of barrels per capita.) Measures of soil quality/climate are steppe (low latitude), desert (low latitude), steppe (middle latitude), desert
(middle latitude), dry steppe wasteland, desert dry winter, and highland.

Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates with log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable, and Panel B reports the corresponding first
stage (latitude is included in even numbered columns but is never significant and not reported here to save space). Panel C reports the p-value for the null hypothesis
that the coefficient on average protection against expropriation risk in the second stage regression (i.e., Panel A) is the same as when instrumented using log mortality of
settlers in addition to the indicated instruments; the two covariance matricies are based on a common estimate of the disturbance variance. Panel D reports results from
the regression in which log mortality is included as an exogenous variable and current institutions are instrumented using the alternative instrument indicated (latitude is
included in even columns but is never significant and not reported here to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. All regressions with constraint on executive
and democracy in first year of independence also include years since independence as a regressor. All regressions have 59 observations, except those with European settl

A blank indicates missing data. When mortality varies across different cities for a country, we use the lowest rate. Countries
in italics have reasonable mortality estimates, but they cannot be included in our basic sample as other data are missing.
Gutierrez shows that the ratio of mortality for bishops aged 40-49 is, by disease environment: low mortality 10 per 1000;
medium mortality, 11 per 1000; high mortality, 23 per 1000. We use these proportions and the death rate in Mexico from
Curtin to infer mortality in Latin America. The results would be essentially the same if we used Curtin (1989)'s Jamaica
estimate as the base case for calculating Latin American settler mortality using the Gutierrez estimates.
Curtin (1964) reports average annual mortality from disease in the anti-slavery blockade (West Africa) as 5.44%, and
mortality from disease in the South American Naval Stations as 0.77%. Mortality at other naval stations is consistent with
the Curtin and Gutierrez estimates (comparing the ratios with West Africa): Mediterranean (0.93%), East Indian (1.51%),
West Indian (1.81%), Home Station (0.98%).
The alternative mortality estimates are calculated as follows. First mortality estimate: data from Curtin (1989), "Death by
Migration" only. Second mortality estimate: data from "Death by Migration" plus earliest data for each country from Curtin
(1998), "Disease and Empire". Third mortality estimate: including neighbours with same disease environments and African
mortality for Kenya and Congo, from other Curtin sources discussed in the appendix. Fourth mortality estimate: using
Gutierrez (1986) data on bishops to estimate mortality in South America and the full set of Curtin estimates of mortality. Fifth
mortality estimate: using Curtin (1964) data from naval stations for Chile and Argentina. Alternative version of Curtin data:
using long sample periods from Curtin (1989) and (1998) and data on bishops to estimate mortality in South America.

Dependent Variable is log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1975. Constraint on Executive in 1970 is measured on a scale of 1
to 7, where a higher score represents more constraint, from the Polity III data set. Panel A reports the two stage least squares
estimates and Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from regressing log GDP per
capita on average protection against expropriation risk, with the other control variables indicated in that column (full results
not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy for
America is omitted.
See Appendix Table A1 for more detailed variable definitions and sources.

Constraint on Executive in 1990 is measured on a scale, from 1 to 7, with a higher score indicating more constraints on the
arbitrary actions that the executive can take, from the Polity data set (see Appendix Table 1 for more detail). Panel A reports
the two stage least squares estimates with log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable, instrumenting for
constraint on the executive using log settler mortality; Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS
coefficient from regressing log GDP per capita on constraint on the executive in 1990, with the other control variables
indicated in that column (full results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions with
continent dummies, the dummy for America is omitted.

"Law and Order Tradition in 1995" is measured on a scale from 0 to 6, where a higher score means more law and order, from
Political Risk Services (see Appendix Table A1 for more detail). Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates with
log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable and instrumenting for law and order tradition using log
settler mortality; Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from regressing log GDP
per capita on law and order tradition in 1995, with the other control variables indicated in that column (full results not
reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy for America
is omitted.

"Rule of Law in 1995" is measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where a higher score means stronger rule of law, from the Fraser
Institute (see Appendix Table A1 for more detail). Panel A reports the two stage least squares estimates with log GDP per
capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable and instrumenting for rule of law using log settler mortality; Panel B
reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from regressing log GDP per capita on rule of law
in 1995, with the other control variables indicated in that column (full results not reported to save space). Standard errors
are in parentheses. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy for America is omitted.

"Efficiency of the Judiciary 1980-83" is measured on a scale from 1 to 10, where a higher score means a more efficient
judiciary, from Business International (see Appendix Table A1 for more detail). Panel A reports the two stage least squares
estimates with log GDP per capita (PPP basis) in 1995 as the dependent variable and instrumenting for efficiency of the
judiciary using log settler mortality; Panel B reports the corresponding first stage. Panel C reports the OLS coefficient from
regressing log GDP per capita on efficiency of the judiciary, with the other control variables indicated in that column (full
results not reported to save space). Standard errors are in parentheses. In regressions with continent dummies, the dummy
for America is omitted.
