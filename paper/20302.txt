                                              ABSTRACT

We estimate the impact of weather variation on agricultural output in Indonesia by examining the impact
of local rainfall shocks on rice output at the district level. Our analysis makes use of local meteorological
data on rainfall in combination with government administrative data on district-level rice output in
the 1990s. We find that deviations from mean local rainfall are positively associated with district-level
rice output. 10% higher rainfall leads metric tons of rice output to be 0.4% higher on average. The
impact of rainfall on rice output occurs contemporaneously (in the same calendar year), rather than
with a lag. These results suggest that researchers should be justified in interpreting higher rainfall as
a positive contemporaneous shock to local economic conditions in Indonesia.

1     Introduction and summary
Life in rural areas of developing countries is prone to many kinds of risk, such as illness or mortality
of household members, crop or other income loss due to natural phenomena (weather, insect
infestations, or …re, for example), and civil con‡ict. Empirical work in development economics
often examines the impact of exogenous shocks of various sorts on households, as a way of shedding
light on various economic phenomena such as the quality and nature of household risk sharing
and consumption smoothing mechanisms, intrahousehold allocation decisions, gender bias, and
the long-run consequences of shocks experienced in vulnerable periods of life (such as infancy,
or school-age years). Many papers examine the impact of weather variation, and in particular
rainfall. Examples include Rose (1999), Hoddinott and Kinsey (2001), Jensen (2000), Miguel,
Satyanath, and Sergenti (2004), Miguel (2005), Newhouse (2005), and Maccini and Yang (2009).1

        A particularly fruitful body of research along these lines has focused on Indonesia, for many
reasons including the availability of a number of high quality datasets from the Indonesian gov-
ernment as well as outside organizations (RAND’s Indonesia Family Life Survey being the most
prominent). Examples of recent work which have examined the impact of shocks on Indonesian
households are Frankenberg, Smith, and Thomas (2003), Newhouse (2005), Maccini and Yang
(2009), and Yamauchi (2012).
        The purpose of this short paper is con…rm that rainfall is a positive shock to agricultural
output in Indonesia by examining the impact of district-level rainfall shocks on local rice output
in the 1990s. These results justify the interpretation of rainfall as a positive shock to local areas
in Indonesia. This is particularly important for research that examines the reduced-form impact
of rainfall shocks on various outcomes without being able to simultaneously examine rainfall’s
contemporaneous impact on crop output.
        The remainder of this paper consists of the following sections. Section 2 describes the data
used, section 3 carries out the empirical analysis, and section 4 provides an overall summary and
implications for researchers. The …nal section contains references. A single regression results
table follows.



2         Data

2.1        Rainfall data

Our focus is on local rainfall variation. Rainfall is the most important dimension of weather
variation in Indonesia; the country’s location astride the equator means that temperature shows
very little variation, either within years or across them (Library of Congress, 2003). Indonesian
rainfall exhibits substantial variability within year across districts as well as within districts over
time. In any particular year, the length of the wet season and the intensity of drought during
the dry season vary markedly across Indonesia, and sometimes within small geographic units.2
The speci…c trajectories of the monsoons vary from one year to the next, which combined with
di¤erences in local topography leads to wide variation in precipitation across the archipelago both
within year and across years (Library of Congress 2003). This variety within Indonesia is perhaps
not surprising, given that the country’s 13,700 islands span 5,100 kilometers from east to west
    2
    In the wet season, 200 mm or more of rain falls per month. This de…nition is based on the minimum threshold
necessary for rice production and takes into account evaporation and seepage through the soil (Kishore et al.,
2000).


                                                      2
and cross three time zones.
       Indonesia’s climate consists simply of one wet season and one dry season each year. The
distinguishing feature of the wet season is that at least 200 mm or more of rain falls per month,
and in the dry season mean rainfall is less than that threshold.3 The speci…c months of the wet
and dry season vary across Indonesian provinces, and we take these di¤erences into account when
constructing our rainfall variable.
       We obtain historical rainfall data for weather stations across Indonesia from the Global His-
torical Climatology Network (GHCN) Precipitation and Temperature Data (Version 2). The data
include monthly records for each rainfall station as well as the latitude and longitude of the sta-
tion’s location. We use the station location information to match each district represented in the
IFLS to the closest rainfall station.4 We disallow matches between districts and rainfall stations
that are more than 500 kilometers apart.
       In calculating rainfall in a particular year, we focus on rainfall in complete wet and dry seasons
(rather than in calendar years), as these should be most closely related to agricultural cycles. We
start by de…ning the months included in the wet and dry seasons in each Indonesian province.5
Depending on the province, the wet season starts anywhere from September to December, while
the dry season can start as early as March and as late as June. For example, in the province
of Central Java the wet season runs from October to April, and the dry season from May to
September. Then we identify the month of the start of the wet season of the previous calendar
year (either Sep., Oct., Nov., or Dec., depending on province) and measure rainfall at the district
(kabupaten) level for the 12 months that follow.
       In analyses of the impact of annual rainfall on rice output, we focus on the deviation of annual
rainfall from the norm for one’s birth district. Speci…cally, the variable is the natural log of annual
rainfall minus the natural log of mean annual rainfall in the given district. Mean district rainfall
is calculated over 1953-1999, but excludes rainfall in the given year (i.e., mean annual rainfall
used in calculating the rainfall deviation variable for 1995 excludes the year 1995 in calculation
of the mean).
   3
     This de…nition is based on the minimum threshold necessary for rice production and takes into account
evaporation and seepage through the soil (Kishore et al., 2000).
   4
     These data are produced jointly by the National Climatic Data Center, Arizona State University,
and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and are available at
http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/ghcn/ghcn.html. Because the number of rainfall stations varies
over time, data from di¤erent rainfall stations may be linked to the same district over time.
   5
     To do this, we combine information from secondary reports on the extent of the rainy season (Kishore et al.,
2000) with our own analysis of mean monthly rainfall across all weather stations within each province.




                                                       3
2.2        Rice output data

Data on rice output in metric tons at the kabupaten level were purchased in paper format from the
Indonesia Bureau of Statistics (BPS) for the years 1993-1999. These data were manually entered
into an electronic database, and then the data were cleaned to impute data for missing districts
on the basis of output in other districts within the same province. Rice output is measured over
the calendar year (Jan.-Dec.).



3         Empirical estimates
The empirical analysis involves estimating via OLS regressions of the following form for rice
output in district  and year :


                                     ln  =    0   +   1    +      +      +  


        The dependent variable ln  is the natural log of rice output in metric tons, for Indonesian
districts (kabupatens) from 1993 to 1999. The independent variable of interest,  , is the deviation
of log rainfall from log mean district rainfall over 1953-1999. The regressions also include …xed
e¤ects for district (  ) and year (  ).  is a mean-zero error term.
        Regression results are presented in the accompanying table. Across various speci…cations, we
examine the e¤ect of current rainfall on rice output in subsets of districts according to major city
(kotamadya) status (columns 1-3), as well as the e¤ect of rainfall in the past and future across
these same district subsets (columns 4-6).
        Column 1 presents results from a regression that includes all districts, and indicates that
higher rainfall leads to higher rice output. The coe¢ cient on the rainfall variable is positive and
signi…cant at the 10% level. Because the e¤ect of rainfall is likely to di¤er across rural and urban
areas, the following columns present results from the same regression, but for districts excluding
major cities (column 2), and for districts that are major cities (column 3). The result in column 2
indicates that rainfall has a positive e¤ect on rice output outside of major cities that is statistically
signi…cant at the 5% level. On the other hand, there is no evidence of a relationship between
rainfall and rice output in major cities: in column 3, the coe¢ cient on rainfall is not statistically
signi…cantly di¤erent from zero.6
    6
    Somewhat surprisingly, the coe¢ cient on rainfall in column 3 is much larger than the coe¢ cients in the previous
columns. However, this coe¢ cient is very imprecisely estimated so not much further can be said on this front.



                                                           4
    To better understand the timing of rainfall that matters for rice output, columns 4-6 of the
table present regression results analogous to those in columns 1-3, but where one lag and one
lead of the rainfall variable are included in the regressions. Across the three sample de…nitions,
the coe¢ cients on the current rainfall variable are little changed vis-a-vis columns 1-3. Moreover,
the coe¢ cients on lag and lead rainfall are all close to zero and none of them enter statistically
signi…cantly in the regressions. The results in columns 4-6 suggest that current-year rainfall
matters most for current-year rice output.



4     Summary and implications
In summary, we …nd that higher local rainfall leads to higher rice output in Indonesian districts.
10% higher rainfall leads metric tons of rice output to be 0.4% higher on average. In addition, the
impact of rainfall on rice output occurs contemporaneously (in the same calendar year), rather
than with a lag. These results suggest that researchers should be justi…ed in interpreting higher
rainfall as a positive shock to the fortunes of local areas in Indonesia, at least in terms of its
impact on rice output. These are likely to lead to higher household incomes in localities, both
directly and via general equilibrium e¤ects. Rainfall shocks may appropriately be interpreted as
contemporaneous (as opposed to lagged) shocks to locality-level rice output.
    Furthermore, we only …nd statistically signi…cant e¤ects of rainfall in districts that are not
major cities. Researchers examining the impact of local rainfall shocks in Indonesia on various
outcomes should therefore exclude major cities (kotamadja) from their analyses.
