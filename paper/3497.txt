 I. Introduction

      The debt crisis of 1982 drastically changed the circumstances of the

 developing world. After years of relatively rapid growth, partially fueled

by generous flows of foreign funds, in 1982 the poorer nations suffered a

major setback: growth plummeted, unemployment soared and acute balance of

payments crises ensued. Since then the direction of international net

resource transfers has been reversed and has run from the LDCs to the

advanced nations. Nowhere have these changes been more dramatic than in

Latin America. During the 1980s real per capita income in Latin America and

the Caribbean as a whole (excluding Cuba) declined by 8.2%.      Moreover, in

some nations such as Argentina, Bolivia, Peru and Nicaragua, real income        per
capita dropped by more than 20% during the decade of the l980s)

     There is little doubt that economic recovery and the   return to growth
and prosperity will take time and will require massive amounts of funds and

deep policy reforms. What makes the recovery prospects rather grim is the

fact that in a large number of the Latin American nations   domestic savings

ratios have declined significantly during the last few years (see the 1989

World Develoyrnent Retort). Even if the liberalization policy reforms advo-

cated by the IMP and the World Bank, among others, are undertaken, and if as

a consequence of them investment productivity increases, most countries    will
still need to supplement their domestic savings with foreign funds. How-

ever, one of the most serious consequences of the debt crisis has been that

for most developing nations the accessibility to the world capital market

has been greatly reduced, if not completely closed. What makes this situa-

tion particularly serious is the fact that, starting in the second half of

the l970s portfolio and bank lending became the single most important source

of capital flows, greatly surpassing direct foreign investment    (Lal 1989).
                                            2



      A key policy question - -    and,   in fact, one that haunts politicians as
 well as economists -   - is   how to improve the LDCs attractiveness for
                                                                            foreign
 capital flows. In their recent contribution to the Handbook of Develooment

 Economics, Cardoso and Dornbusch (1989) have succinctly captured the

 profession's concern regarding this issue:

      Commercial banks are unlikely to provide much development finance
      in the years to come. Bond markets, likewise, will be closed for
      countries with a poor debt experience. Efforts to develop private
      capital flows to debtor countries must, therefore, focus on other
      mechanisms.
                                                               (p. 1434)
      In the search for renewed sources of foreign capital flows a fairly

 long list of candidates, both old and new, has been identified.        In this

paper I explore the potential role of two of these sources of additional

rivate capital inflows into the less developed countries:          (1) increased
direct foreign investment (DFI), and (2) debt conversions (and especially

debt-equity swaps) mechanisms.

     The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the results

obtained from an econometric analysis of the determinants of the cross-

country distribution of the OECDs direct foreign investment into the LDCs.

More specifically, the question asked is why do the advanced nations tend to

direct their DFI to some countries and not to others.        A fundamental aspect
of this problem refers to empirically determining the
                                                             relative importance of
government policies, structural variables and political considerations        in

explaining DFI. The political angle is particularly relevant in the current

circumstances when so many developing nations -     - and   especially the Latin
American countries -- have
                           been experiencing massive political changes. In
Section III, on the other hand, I analyze the role of
                                                            debt-equity swaps as
instruments for reducing the debt burden and
                                                  potentially increasing private
capital flows, especially in the form of DFI, into the developing countries.

 This discussion is particularly important, since traditionally the magnitude

 of DFI has been relatively small, and poorer nations have tried to design

 mechanisms that would effectively increase the flow of external resources.

 I discuss both the simple analytics of debt reduction schemes, as veil as

 the recent Chilean experience with these mechanisms. Finally, Section IV

 contains some concluding remarks.


 II. The Determinants of Direct Foreign Investment: A Cross
                                                            Country
      Empirical Investigatfon

      Many authors have agreed that in the aftermath of the debt crisis

direct foreign investment should play an increasingly important role as a

source of foreign funds for the LDCs. At the same time, most experts are

aware that the total volume of resources likely to be involved through this

channel will probably not be very large. For instance, after pointing out

that bank loans and bonds issues are unlikely to have a major role as

sources of resources for the LDCs in the years to come, Cardoso and Darn-

busch (1989) say that "the immediately obvious candidate [for providing

foreign resources] is direct foreign investment. Unfortunately, the role of

direct investment has never been very large" (p. 1434). This means, then,

that for any individual developing country two important questions refer to

both the future total volume of direct foreign investment by the advanced

nations in the LDCs, as well as the cross-country distribution of this

limited volume. More specifically, will these resources flow to the "tradi-

tional" beneficiaries, or will they tend to go to countries that are

relative newcomers in the international scene? How will the political

changes that have recently swept the third world affect the total volume and

cross-country distribution of direct foreign investment? Will countries

with a greater degree of openness attract more funds, or will the
                                      4




distribution of DFI be independent of structural reforms? All these are, of

course, crucial issues whose answers are to a large extent empirical.

     A number of studies have empirically analyzed the sectoral distribution

of U.S. direct foreign investment, trying to determine why U.S. firms (both

financial and non-financial) have tended to favor particular sectors when

investing abroad.2 Relatively fewer efforts, however, have been undertaken

in order to understand what determines the cross-country allocation of

direct foreign investment by the advanced nations.3 The purpose of this

section is to empirically investigate the determinants of OECD direct

foreign investment into the LDCs during the period 1971-81. This time frame

was chosen for two reasons: first, some of the more important variables are

available for this period only; and, second, by concentrating on this

period, we are deliberately avoiding the abnormality and the complications

that the eruption of the debt crisis would introduce into this type of

empirical investigation.4 An important feature of this analysis is that it

explicitly incorporates the role of political variables -     - such    as political

instability and political polarization - -   into   the cross country

regressions. In undertaking this investigation, we tried to incorporate the

largest possible number of countries, both on the receiving and originating

ends. This quest for a substantial coverage has resulted on a need for

compromising on the quality of the data. First, we have had to concentrate

on aggregate DFI; there are no available data on the sectoral composition of

DFI for a large number of countries. Second, a number of potentially

important institutional variables, including detailed tax legislation, had

to be excluded from the analysis. In the sections that follow, we address

some of these important data problems in greater detail.
                                           5



      Table 1 contains data on two indicators of direct foreign investment

 for 58 less developed countries. The first variable DFISH. is defined as

 the 1971-81 average ratio of OECD total direct foreign investment into

country j relative to total OECD direct foreign investment into the LDCs.

That is

                              811 DFI
                 DFISH. —
                                  k DFIj('

where ZDFIk is total DFI by the OECD in the LDCs in a particular year.

The second variable, (DFI/GDP), is the 1971-81 average of the ratio of

direct foreign investment received by country j        to its CDP. DFISH, then,

tells us how total OECD direct foreign investment is distributed across

countries; (DFE/GDP), on the other hand is more closely a measure of the

amount of DFI, relative to GDP, that country j obtains. Thus,
                                                                     by explain-
ing the behavior of these two indexes we will be able to better understand

what determines both the distribution (DFISH) as well the as level - -

relative   to GD? --   of   direct foreign investment (DFI/GDP). As can be seen,

there is a considerable variability across countries of both of these

variables. These cross-country differences are particularly acute for the

case of DFISH, where one particular country (Brazil) takes as much as 30% of

total OECD's direct foreign investment during 1971-81.

     More specifically, the goal of the empirical analysis is to use two

groups of regressors in explaining their cross country variability in DFISH

and (DFI/GDP): the first group of regressors is constituted by traditional

economic variables that summarize the structure of each country, while the

second group of regressors captures political and institutional

characteristics of each nation. We start our analysis in subsection 11.1 by

 following the more traditional approach of focusing on the economic determi-

narits of direct foreign investment. In subsection 11.2 the potential role

of political variables is formally incorporated into the regression

equations. Finally, in subsection 11.3 we present a sensitivity analysis.

11.1 Economic Determinants of OECD's Direct Foreizn Investment in the LDCs

      In recent years the theory of direct foreign investment has rapidly

evolved, borrowing both from traditional trade theory and the industrial

organization literature. However, in spite of these developments, today

there still is not a unified and generally accepted theory of DFI. For this

reason, any empirical study on the subject has to take necessarily this

fact into consideration and, thus, follow what can be primarily described    as

a pragmatic approach. That is indeed the avenue we have decided to follow

in the current paper. In fact, in deciding which economic variables to

include in our cross-country regressions we have drawn from a broad   group of
papers from the modern DFI literature. The explanatory variables used in

this study can be grouped into three broad and (somewhat) interrelated

categories:   (1) variables that capture some of the most important

structural characteristics of these economies;   (2) variables that are

related to economic policy and that, in principle, can be manipulated by

these countries in order to make DFI more attractive; and (3) variables

that capture the political environment in each country. While in this

subsection we focus on the potential roles of structural and policy related

variables in explaining cross country variability of DFI, in the next

subsection we add political variables into the analysis. It is important to

insist, once again, that any massive cross country study, such as this   one,

faces non trivial problems in relation to data availability. These problems

are particularly severe with respect to some of the policy related
                                        7



 variables. As will be seen, we have handled these problems mainly in two

 ways: using proxies, when they were available, and excluding the variable

 if it was not possible to find appropriate proxies.    According to the most

 basic traditional theories of DFI, advanced nations will tend to channel

 their overseas investments to those poorer countries that have a higher

 return on capital. However, from an empirical point of view trying to test

 this hypothesis presents some problems: in poor countries where there are

 no well-functioning capital markets it is difficult to measure the     return to

 capital. As a consequence we have proxied (the inverse of) this variable        by
real per capita income; it is expected, then, that with other
                                                                things given,
countries with lower real per capita income will tend to receive     a higher
share of DFI. In those DFI theories based on comparative advantages, the

structure of production of the recipient country (e.g., the sectoral

distribution of output) is an important determinant of the   sectoral
allocation of DFI. Although it is not straightforward to apply this

disaggregated analysis to a cross country setting, it is clear that     the

structure of production in the host country is an important variable to

incorporate into the empirical analysis.

     In more recent theories of DFI, multinational firms   locate   in foreign
countries in order to "internalize" the potential
                                                    profits to be derived from
these niarkets.5 To the extent that one of the   aspects to be "internalized"

by the foreign firm are economies of scale it is expected that DFI will tend

to go to those countries with larger markets.
                                                 Moreover, the transnational

firms' capacity to actually take advantage of the potential profit opportun-

ities in the poorer nation will depend crucially on the existing atmosphere

in the host country towards private
                                      enterprise. One possible way (although
admittedly an imperfect one) of proxying the host country's stance towards
                                         8



private initiative is by the size of government. It would be expected,

then, that in the regression analysis the coefficient of a variable captur-

ing government size variable will be negative. (See, for example, the

discussion in Nelleiner 1989.) Directly related to this is the role of

investment by other agents in determining the cross-country allocation of

DFI. If, as is the most plausible case, domestic investment and direct

foreign investment are complements, we would expect a positive coefficient

for domestic investment in the regression analysis.6 Also, to the extent

that, as has been recently suggested by a number of authors, multinationals

tend to be located on tradables sectors both the degree of openness of the

host country and the behavior of its real exchange rate, or level of

international competitiveness will affect both the level and geographical

location of DFI.7 In fact, in addition to government size, these are the

more important policy variables considered in this investigation.

     In addition to the variables mentioned in the models of DFI discussed

above, a multinational's decision of locating a subsidiary in a particular

country   will,   in principle, be influenced by the specific DFI legislation,

including tax inducements, of the host country.8 Unfortunately, since there

are no comparable cross-country data on legal treatment of DFI, these

variables have been excluded from the regressions discussed in this paper.

     Table 2 contains the results from estimating a variety of possible

specifications of linear cross country regressions on DFISH and (DFI/CDP)

using only structural economic variables as regressors. All variables are

averages for 1971-81. Since White's test indicated the presence of

heteroscedasticity, the different equations were estimated using weighted

least squares, with each country's population used as weight. It should be

noted, however, that when other weights were considered, or when OLS were
                                      9



applied, the results obtained were very similar. Based on the previous

discussion, the following structural independent regressors were included in

the equations: (a) Income per capita. As pointed out, this variable is

used as a proxy for the (inverse of the) return on capital and its expected

coefficient is negative. (b) Ratio of foreign trade to GD?, whose

coefficient is expected to be positive. (c) In the DFISH regressions the

country's real GDP was included as a measure of the size of the economy and

potential extent of scale economies. Its coefficient is expected to be

positive.   (d) Domestic investment ratio. To the extent that domestic and

foreign investments are complements, its coefficient is expected to be

positive. (e) The share of government consumption in GD? was included as

an indicator of the size of government, and its coefficient is expected to

be negative. (f) The Summers and Heston measure of the real exchange rate

'was incorporated as an indicator of the country's degree of international

competitiveness and, given the way this RER index has been defined, its

expected coefficient is positive. (g) Different measures of each country's

structure of production (shares of manufacturing, mining and agriculture in

total GDP) were also included. The sign of their coefficients is not

determined a riort. (h) Finally, two      regional   dummy variables, for Latin
America and Asia were included in the regressions.            -




     As can be seen from Table 2 the results are quite satisfactory. The

vast majority of the coefficients have the expected sign and most of them

are significant at conventional levels. Moreover, the R2s of the regres-

sions indicate that these structural economic variables explain, as a     group,

approximately 60% of the cross-country variability in DFISH and (DFI/GDP).
        2
These R values are indeed very high for any type of cross-country

regression. The most important findings in Table 2 can be summarized as

follows: First, as expected, real income per capita --       which proxies the
inverse of the rate of return on capital -. has a negative, although

insignificant, coefficient. Second, in the (DFI/CDP) regressions the

foreign trade (or openness) variable is always significantly positive as

expected, while in the DFISH equations this coefficient turns out to be

insignificant. Third, in most equations were included the coefficients of:

(a) real CDP;     (b) domestic investment ratio;   (c) the size of

government; and     (d) the international competitiveness index (RER) have

the expected sign and are significant at conventional levels. On the other

hand, the coefficient of the size of manufacturing sector is significantly
                                                         9
positive, while that of agriculture share is negative.        Finally, the

geographical dummies are positive for Latin America and negative for Asia.

     From a policy perspective these results indicate that, with other

things given, countries that (1) reform their foreign sector opening up

international trade; (2) reduce the size of government; (3) maintain (or

increase) their degree of international competitiveness; and (4) increase

the rate of domestic investment, will tend to see an increase in their level

of DFI. This result, of course, suggest that structural reforms are likely

to have important side effects not usually measured in traditional analyses.

11.2 The Role of Political and Institutional Factors

     The results reported in Table 2 were obtained by restricting the

regressors to those economic variables usually considered as determinants of

DFI. It is a common belief, however, that the characteristics of the

political system in the LDCs play an important role in the process of

determining the magnitude and location of DFI.1° The purpose of this

subsection is to formally assess how important this common belief really is.

The question we address, then, is the following: after controlling for the
                                          11



 structural economic variables of Table 2, how important have     political
 variables been in explaining the cross-country variability in our two direct

 foreign investment indicators?

      Two   dimensions   of the political system appear, a priori to be

 particularly important in affecting DFI decisions: (1) the degree of

 political instability, and (2) the degree of political polarization and

 violence. It is expected that increases in both of these variables will

 tend to have negative effects on our measures of DFI.
                                                            Naturally, finding
 measures for these political variables is a nontrivial problem in

 implementiflg an empirical analysis of the type proposed here. In this paper

 we have used indexes of political instability computed by Cukiermart,    Edwards
 and Tabelljnj (1989). These indexes are based on a political data set

 constructed by Taylor and Jodice (1983), which contains yearly observations

on regular and irregular (i.e., coups) government transfers, unsuccessful

coup attempts, executive adjustments, and other political events.

     Cukierman-EdwardsTabelljni (CET) constructed their index on political

instability by endogenously estimating from the data the probability of

government change in any given year. This was done by fitting a probit

equation on government change on pooled time series and cross country data

for 79 countries, over the period 1948-82. The dependent variable in this

probit estimate took a value of 0 for the years in which there was no gov-

ernment change (regular or irregular), and a value of 1 otherwise. In turn,

the explanatory variables in the probit model included economic variables,

designed to measure the recent economic performance of the government;

political variables, which accounted for significant political events that

signal the imminence of a crisis; and structural variables, that accounted

for institutional differences and country specific factors that do not
                                     12




change, or that change only slowly over time. Using the pooled time series-

cross country probit estimates CET compute an estimated frequency of

government change in each country during the period 1971-82. The index on

political instability was then constructed by averaging the estimated

probabilities of government change over that time period. In this paper we

use this CET index of political instability as an additional explanatory

variable in the DFI regressions.

     In addition to the political instability index, the augmented DFI

regressions also included an index that proxies the degree of economic

polarization in each country. This variable measures the extent of

political violence, and is constructed as the sum of the yearly frequency of

political assassinations, violent riots, protests, political attacks and

politically motivated strikes. The raw data for constructing this index

were taken from Taylor and Jodice (1983).

     Table 3 contains the results obtained from the cross-country

regressions for OFISH and (DFI/CDP) that included political indicators. As

can be seen, the results are very satisfactory. First, the relevance of

structural economic variables appears to be even clearer than in the results

reported in Table 2. Most of the coefficients of economic variables have

the expected sign and are significant. Moreover, tests on the significance

of all economic variables as a group indicate that they are different from

zero at a very high level of significance (the values of the F-tests ranged

from 10.1 to 17.2). Second, the index of political instability is negative

in every regression and in three of the five equations where it is included

it is highly significant. The index of political violence has the expected

negative sign in two out of the three regressions where it was included, but

is never significant. Tests for the joint exclusion of the political
                                     13



instability and political violence indexes indicates that the null hypoth-

esis is rejected at high levels of significance. In sum, then, the results

reported in Table 3 for our full sample of 58 nations supports the hypoth-

esis that both economic and political variables affect the distribution and

magnitude of DFI. These results, then, indicate that reduced political

instability and polarization will tend to increase DFI, as will structural

reforms of the type supported by the World Bank and the IMF.

     The fact that the political and structural economic variables are

statistically significant, doesn't say anything regarding the relative

importance of each of these variables. Table 4 addresses this issue by

reporting the standardized estimates of each of the coefficients for two of

the regressions reported in Table 3: equations 9 and 10. As can be seen

from these estimates, in spite of the fact that the political instability is

statistically significant in these two regressions, its relative importance

is not very high when compared to that of other regressors. This means,

then, that although the popular belief that the political setting matters

for DFI turns out to be supported by the data, it is also true that these

political variables are, relatively speaking, not the most important ones.

From a practical and policy perspective this suggests that some structural

reform measures, such as reducing the size of government and (for the case

of DFI/GDP) increasing openness are likely to have a greater effect on

capital inflows than an improved political atmosphere.

11.3 Sensitivity Analysis

    An important question is how sensitive are our results to the presence

of outliers, and to the measurement of exogenous variables. The question of

the robustness of our estimates is formally addressed in this section.

     In order to analyze the role of outliers we carried out an influence

analysis (Belseley, Kuh and Welsch, 1980) to assess the contribution of each

particular country to our results. This analysis indicated that both in the

DFISH and (DFI/GDP) regressions there were three clear outliers: Brazil,

India and Indonesia. As a way to check for the robustness of our results a

number of regressions were estimated excluding these outliers. Some of

these results are reported in Table 5. As can be seen the results are

indeed robust. In fact, if anything, the exclusion of the three outliers

provide even greater support for the hypothesis that both economic and

political variables significantly affect DFI decisions. Notice, for

instance, how the foreign trade coefficient now also became significant in

the DFISH regression.

     A second sensitivity exercise consisted on experimenting with

alternative variables that measure the political characteristics of the

countries in the sample. Two of these were the actual frequency of

government change (both scheduled and unscheduled) and the frequency of

unscheduled government changes (coups and unscheduled regular government

transfers). The following regressions provide an illustration of the type

of results obtained when these variables were incorporated into the analysis

       Summarizing, the sensitivity analysis presented here shows clearly that

the result reported in the preceding subsections are quite robust and that

the main conclusions presented above, regarding the role of political and

economic variables in determining DFI, stand independently of the sample

used   and   of the measures chosen to capture the political characteristics of

each country.

       Finally,   it should be noticed that the regression analysis presented

here may be subject to some eridogeneity problems. Indeed, as pointed out

above, some of the structural variables may indeed be affected by the extent

of capital flows into these countries. In principle, this problem can be

handled through the use of standard instrumental variables techniques. The

problem with this, however, is that, as in most cross country studies, it is

not easy to find adequate instruments. One possible way out is to use the

structural variables for the previous decade as instrument: In fact, when

this was done, the results obtained were not significantly different. The

results, however, are still suspect from a simultaneity perspective. The

reason, of course, is that in order for these variables to be valid

instruments, it is required that the error terms are not correlated across

decades, which is not necessarily the case.

III. Debt Conversions. Debt-Eguity Swaps and Capital Flows

     Direct foreign investment is only one of the potential sources for

increasing capital inflows into the developing nations. A serious problem

is that historically the magnitude of DPI has not been very large. It has

been argued, however, that by using different debt-swap mechanisms, based on

the secondary market for third world debt, the developing nations could

significantly increase DFI, as well as other forms of capital inflows.11 In

fact, the proponents of this strategy have argued that in theory, these

debt-swaps are equivalent to an increase in capital inflows, which are then

partially used by the debtor country to reduce its foreign liabilities,12

     The purpose of this section is to investigate whether debt-swaps in

general, and debt-equity swaps in particular can, indeed, be a vehicle for

increasing the volume of capital flows and DPI into the developing

countries. First I provide a brief discussion of the analytics of debt-swap

as mechanisms for potentially reducing a country's debt burden and helping

finance growth and, second, I review in some detail the Chilean experience,

where different modes of debt swaps have been used to reduce the stock of

foreign debt by approximately one half.

111.1 Some Analytical Aspects of Debt ForEiveress Based on Secondary Market
       Mechanisms

     A number of authors have investigated theoretical issues related to

debt forgiveness and market based schemes. Dooley (1988a,b), and Rodriguez

(1988) have analyzed the market valuation effects of buyback schemes, and

have concluded that the quoted secondary market rate is not the relevant

price for evaluating a major buyback program. The relevant price is the one

that captures the expected flow of resource transfers after the buyback.

Depending on the volume of the operation this price may be significantly
                                           17



higher than the ongoing secondary market quotation, as was indeed the case

in the Bolivian buyback of 1986 (see Bulow and Rogoff, 1990).

     Corden (1988), Helpman (1988), and Sachs (1988), among        others,   have

discussed the effects of debt overhang on the debtor country's incentives to

adjust and implement structural reforms geared at generating additional

foreign exchange. These authors have pointed out that a situation of debt

overhang - -   which   has been referred to as "being on the wrong side of the

debt-Laffer curve" -     - is   equivalent to having a 100% marginal tax on foreign

exchange earnings. The reason for this is, of course, that any additional

foreign exchange will be used to increase payments to creditors. Under

these circumstances there are little, if any, incentives for governments to

implement costly, politically unpopular and harsh adjustment measures. This

incentive effect has in fact become the most important argument in favor of

debt forgiveness. By forgiving a portion of the debt the implicit marginal

tax can be reduced inducing countries to undertake structural reforms that,

in principle, may increase the actual resource transfer to creditors. Under

these circumstances it will pay for the creditor to forgive.

     Krugman (1988b) has used an option-pricing approach to investigate the

creditors decision on whether to forgive or finance the debt. He showed

that as long as there are good states of the world where the debt will be

fully paid, it is in the creditors interest to finance rather than forgive.

The reason is that by forgiving the creditor reduces the maximum possible

payment (the "ceiling") without affecting the minimum payment, or "floor",

obtained under the bad states of the world.

     Krugman (l988a), Froot (1988), Froot et al. (1988), Sachs (1988) and

Corden (1988) have investigated whether debt relief granted via mechanisms

based on the secondary market is in the interest of the debtor. They argue
                                        18




that   this   will be the case only under very special circumstances, Moreover,

if this is true it will also be the case that forgiveness will be in the

interest of the creditor. T,illiainson (1988), however, has argued that if

there are heterogeneous banks with different degrees of optimism there is

additional room for market based debt relief.

       The two most important swap mechanisms are debt-equity swaps and debt-

buybacks. Debt-equity swaps convert a foreign loan into domestic equity of

the debtor country. Although the country's external debt is reduced, this

operation amounts to a replacement of one type of obligation for another and

does not necessarily imply a reduction in the present value of foreign

liabilities. These replacements involved benefits and costs for the debtor

country, and the net balance between them will generally depend on the

specific operation being considered. A critical issue is how much of the

secondary market discount is captured by the debtor. A domestic distribu-

tional issue is also present; if the government is the major debtor and a

large fraction of the discount is captured by the private sector, there will

still remain the difficult problem of transferring resources from private

agents to the public sector.

       The main benefits of debt-equity swaps for the debtor country are that,

as long as the new foreign investment face restrictions on profits and

capital repatriation during an initial period, there will be a liquidity

relief. Moreover, profit repatriation normally bears a higher relationship

to the country's economic activity than interest payments. Also, as

discussed by the literature on DFI reviewed in the previous section new

investments will, in principle, contribute to the country's growth in terms

of technology transfer and managing technique. Finally, new investments may

help to increase capital formation in the host country. This final point,
                                           19



which relates to the so-called "additionality" problem, is indeed crucial in

evaluating the overall benefits of a debt equity swaps program.

     However, debt-equity swaps can also impose costs to the debtor:

(1) there can be substitution between investment with fresh resources and

debt-equity conversions; (2) these transactions can generate inflationary

pressures when the local debtor is the Central Bank and it redeems the debt

in local currency --    although   this need not be the case if redemption is

done using other financial instruments          -   and   (3) similar pressures can

occur in domestic interest rates if the local debtor issues bonds, uses its

available liquidity or increases its demand for credit in order to redeem

the foreign debt.

     Debt-buybacks, on the other hand, involve the repurchase of debt in

secondary markets, either directly by the debtor or through an intermediary.

The local debtor then uses existing assets or increases in domestic liabili-

ties to redeem the foreign debt. A crucial issue is where do the funds used

to finance the buyback come from. Generally speaking there are three

alternative sources: (1) international donations, as in the Bolivian case;

(2) the country's international reserves; or (3) reversed flight capital

as in the Chilean case discussed below. A related key element is the

provision of foreign exchange to carry out the operation. When no access to

the official reserves is granted, the foreign exchange will normally be

obtained through the parallel -     - or   black - -   market.   The potential benefits

of debt-buybacks are:     (1) that, unlike the case of debt-equity deals, an

official foreign liability is extinguished for the country, and (2) that

these operations may constitute a vehicle for the repatriation of offshore

capital held by residents, who would ultimately provide the dollars required

by the transaction. The costs in which the country can incur if this strat-
                                      20




 egy is followed are higher domestic interest rates or increased inflation,

which are qualitatively analogous to the costs involved in debt-equity

 conversions. Additionally, in those cases where foreign exchange is not

provided by the Central Bank, debt buyback operations may result in a hike

 in the -parallel market spread.

     As Kenen (1990) has pointed out, at the end the cost and benefits of

debt-swap schemes will depend on debtors and creditors valuations of the

debt; valuation that may, in fact, differ from that of the secondary market.

In fact, there will be debt relief when the present value of the debtor's

resource transfer, calculated using the discount factor of the debtor, is

reduced in relation to the contractual value of the debt. Most studies on

debt reduction have assuned that although the discount factor used by the

debtor can exceed the cost of foreign funds, it is constant through time and

independent of whether the relief schemes are successful or not. This, of

course, need not be the case; moreover, under most circu1stances it will not

be the case. In an open economy the social rate of discount will be a

weighted average of the three main sources of funds: increased savings,

displaced investment opportunities and foreign borrowing. The cost of

foreign funds, in turn, will be greatly affected by the degree of country

risk, or perceived probability of default, as perceived by the debtor. To

the extent that the debt reduction schemes affect the degree to which the

country can access the international capital market and/or the perceived

degree of country risk the social rate of discount will go do-n,13 and the

present value of a given stream of payments will increase. This, in turn,

will reduce the extent of the debt relief achieved through the scheme in
            14
question.

111.2 Chile's Debt-Conversion Schemes

     A nwnber of authors have dismissed the generalized use of debt-swaps to

reduce the debt problem on a series of grounds. For instance, referring to

debt-equity swaps, Kenen (1990) has said:

     Difficulties arise on three fronts. First, many debtor countries

     Chile, however, has made vigorous use of debt conversion mechanisms,

substantially reducing her stock of foreign debt. When the debt crisis

erupted in 1982, Chile's foreign debt was $17.2 billion, a figure

representing one of the highest debt per capita in the world. Through the

aggressive use of a variety of debt conversion schemes, between 1985 and

February of 1990 Chile has reduced its debt by more than $9 billion U.S.!

In this subsection I evaluate the two most important mechanisms -   - the   debt

conversion or buyback program (Chaoter 18) and the debt equity-swaps program

(Chapter 19) --   used in Chile during the last five years (see Table 6 for

the exact figures involved in the different debt reduction schemes).15

     The Chapter 18 (Ch. 18) mechanism allows domestic debtors to

(indirectly) buy their own foreign liabilities in the secondary market. The

Central Bank does not provide foreign exchange at the official rate for

these operations; the institutions that participate in this scheme have to

obtain the required foreign exchange in the domestic parallel market. Due

to a number of macroeconomic effects discussed below the Chilean authorities

have tightly controlled the access to the Ch, 18 mechanism. Until September

of 1985 the Central Bank of Chile allocated a monthly quota to private

banks. This allowed them to acquire up to that amount of its debt in the

 secondary market. Starting in October 1985, instead of allocating the

 quotas the Central Bank has auctioned them.

      The actual mechanics of debt conversions is rather complicated. A

 typical QJ debt     operation can be described as follows: A Chilean

 institution, a private bank say, decides to rescue some of its outstanding

 foreign liabilities. The first step is to buy a quota in the Central Bank

auction. Next it locates, through an international broker, a holder of its

debt that is willing to sell it. At that point the Chilean bank will have

to obtain foreign exchange in the local parallel market. This will imply

two steps:   (1) Pesos have to be obtained to buy the foreign exchange. For

this purpose the bank issues domestic debt which it sells in Chile.     (2) It
contacts an intermediary who buys the foreign exchange in the parallel

market. Once the foreign exchange is on hand the debt is actually bought

and the liability is extinguished.

     The public sector, and most notably the Central Bank and the state-

owned Banco del Estado, have also used Ch. 18 to reduce some of their debt.

In this case, however, the payment is not made with foreign exchange.

Instead the public sector foreign liabilities are exchanged for   long term

bonds denominated in domestic currency. The value of these peso bonds have

fluctuated in the Chilean secondary market at around 88 percent of par

value. A variant of the Ch. 18 program is the so-called Annex 4 of Charter

j. This scheme amounts to exchanging liabilities in foreign currency for

newly issued stock shares in a Chilean corporation. These operations are

directly monitored by the Central Bank and are not subject to the quota

allocation. A key aspect of this scheme is that it has not been financed

with reserves or other official funds but rather with reversed capital
                                          23



 flight. This turns out to be very important in determining the benefits of

 the scheme.

      An important aspect of Ch. 18 operations is that Chilean residents

capture most of the secondary market discount. Three agents have shared the

discouxt; (1) the Central Bank, (2) the suppliers of foreign exchange in

the parallel market, and (3) the various intermediaries. Larrain (1988)

has calculated that in 1987-88 the average discount on Ch. 18 operations

amounted to 35.7%. Of these, the Central Bank got the lion's share captur-

ing 20.5 points, the suppliers to the parallel market for foreign exchange

got 3.3 percentage points, with the rest corresponding to different fees)6

      Chapter 18 conversion schemes have several macroeconomic effects.

First, there is pressure on the black market for foreign exchange. It is

for this reason that in 1986 the government established the
                                                                      quota system.
It was expected that in this way the spread in this market would not become

"excessively" high. This was basically accomplished. In the first half of

1988, however, the parallel market premium started to increase,           mainly for
political reasons, and as a way to avoid additional pressures on this market

Ch. 18 operations were temporarily suspended. An important question is

whether the funds currently used to finance this scheme in the parallel mar-
ket - -   funds                                            - could
                  corresponding to past capital flight -             have been lured

to the country in a more efficient way. If the answer to this question is

positive, the desirability of this program becomes more dubious. The second

macroeconomic effect is related to the scheme's effect on interest rates.

The domestic counterpart of the rescue of foreign liabilities is the

creation of internal debt. This, of course, puts pressure on the domestic

capital market and as a result domestic interest rates will tend to rise.

It is important to notice, however, that contrary to some popular accounts
                                         24



  the Ch. 18 program has no short run consequences on the creation of
                                                                      money by
  the Central Bank.

       It is difficult to quantify exactly, and
                                                    to summarize in a single
 number, the costs associated with these
                                              macroeconomic effects. There seems
 to be consensus, however, that these are relatively minor.17 The

 desirability of the scheme, then, will basically depend on whether it is

 beneficial for the country to capture a discount that fluctuates around 32%.

 The answer to this depends partially
                                         on whether Chile expects to pay its
 debt in full or if it expects to have
                                         a large proportion of its debt
 forgiven (or alternatively, if it expects to repudiate it))8 If, as the

 Chilean authorities have pointed
                                    out, the government expects to pay all its
 debt in full, buying some of it at a discount is beneficial. If, however,

 it is expected that at the end of the road
                                                the country will not pay all of
 its debt and that a large fraction of it
                                              will be forgiven, it is not clearly
beneficial to buy it in the secondary market, even if it carries a sizeable

discount.

     The ChaterJ program corresponds to debt-equity swaps or a debt
capitalization scheme. A typical operation can be described in the follow-

ing way: A foreign investor buys Chilean private debt at a discount in the

secondary market and converts it into internal debt.      This debt is then sold
in the domestic secondary market and the proceeds are used to acquire

domestic (productive) assets, or to finance domestic investment projects.

Participants in this scheme cannot repatriate
                                                  profits for the first 4 years
and the principal can only be repatriated
                                              after 10 years. charter 19
operations are not subject to quota allocation and are approved on a case-

by-case basis by the Central Bank; it is expected that this case-by-case

approach will allow screening hna fide investors and to avoid "round trip-
                                     25




ping" operations. There is no Central Bank commission on these operations.

Most participants in Ch, 19 schemes have invested in the mining and other

natural resources sectors (forestry). Contrary to Ch. 18, Chapter 19

operations do not result in the extinction of a foreign liability. They

constitute a replacement of one type of liability for another. As noted in

subsection 111.1 above, to the extent that profits repatriation is delayed

for 4 years there is a beneficial liquidity effect. While in the operations

approved through Chapter 18 Chilean residents have captured most of the

secondary market discount, in the case of Ch, 19 most of the discount has

been captured by the foreign investor. This, of course, is equivalent to

providing a major subsidy to foreign investment. Larrain (1988) estimated

that this subsidy amounted to approximately 35% in 1987. It is unlikely

that providing such a sizeable subsidy is the most efficient way to attract

additional foreign investment. Moreover, the econometric results reported

in Section II indicate that the recent political and economic developments

in Chile would have provided an appropriate environment for increased DFI.

This, in turn suggests that Chapter 19 operations probably have not provided

an appropriate environment for orthant additionality component.19

     To sum up, Chile has been tremendously successful in using the

secondary market to reduce its debt. Approximately 50% of' Chile's initial

(that is 1982) long term debt to banks has been converted in the last few

years. The two main mechanisms used for these purposes are fundamentally

different. Chapter 18 consists of debt conversions or debt rescue schemes

where Chilean residents have captured most of the secondary market discount.

Moreover, after the access quota allocation system was implemented it has

been the Central Bank who has captured most of this discount. By and large,

given the fact that it has been financed with reversed capital flight, Q
                                      26



j has been an innovative program that seems to have resulted in positive

net benefits to the country. Charter 19, on the other hand is a debt

capitalization program. It has provided an implicit subsidy to foreign

investors of approximately 30%, and has resulted in very little, if any,

additionality (see also the discussion in Ffrench-Davis, 1990).


IV.   Coric1udjn   Remarks

      An important component in the developing countries' strategy for

recovery and growth is the design of mechanisms for attracting private

foreign capital inflows to finance investment projects and adjustment

programs. However, since for most nations bank loans and bonds issues are

closed avenues in the post-debt crisis, the search for increased foreign

resources has turned towards alternative sources of funds. A natural

candidate for this is direct foreign investment. In this paper I have

analyzed the potential role of DFI in providing additional foreign funds

from two perspectives. First, I have estimated empirical equations in an

effort to assess the roles played by structural economic variables, policy

variables and political variables in determining DFI. This type of analysis

allows us to understand how, if at all, governzients can implement policies

that would induce additional DFI into their countries. Second, I have

analyzed the role of debt-swaps operations as new mechanisms to encourage a

higher volume of DFI and other forms of capital inflows.

      A number of conclusions emerge from this paper. First, it is possible

to identify a well-defined empirical function for the determination of DFI

to developing countries. In fact, our empirical results have shown that for

the 1971-81 period DFI can be explained both by economic and political

variables. Second, and more specifically, our results indicate that, with
                                      27




 other things given, countries with lower income per capita, larger internal

 markets, and domestic investment ratios, will tend to be more    attractive to

 DFI. More importantly, however, the empirical results show that policies

 tending to move the economy towards greater openness and international

 competitiveness, as well as to reducing the size of government, will have      an
 important positive effect on DFI. Third, although our results
                                                                   suggest quite
 clearly that political variables (political instability and political    polar-
 ization) have played a significant role in determining DFI, they also show

 that these political variables have not been the most important ones for

explaining these flows. In fact, the analysis of standardized estimates

clearly shows that political considerations have been the least     important of
all the considered factors in determining DFI.

     From a policy perspective these results are important.
                                                                 They clearly
indicate that countries that undertake structural liberalization
                                                                    reforms,
that will open up their foreign trade and that will provide an enhanced role

to the private sector, will tend to attract greater flows of DFI. Moreover,

this suggests that the Eastern European countries are likely to continue

getting considerably attention from foreign investors,
                                                          attracting large
amounts of funds. However, it is important to bear in mind that, even if a

country is overly successful, and is able to drastically increase the flow

of DFI, the absolute volume of these funds will still be
                                                           relatively small.
Table 1, in fact, shows clearly that for most countries    during 1971-81 DFI

was, on average, below one percent of GD?. This means, then, that a

critically important question at this juncture is whether there    are new

mechanisms, not available during the period under study in the regression

analysis, that can be used to induce a larger volume of DFI and other forms

of capital flows. This is indeed the subject of Section III of the paper
                                      28



 where I analyze the role of debt-swap operations, and discuss the Chilean

 experience with these policies.

      Between 1985 and February of 1990, Chile has reduced its debt by more

 than one half through the aggressive use of three debt-swaps programs. The

 two most important of these have been a debt-rescue mechanisms and a debt

 equity swap program. While in the former one the funds used to retire debt

 in the secondary market have come from reversed flight capital, in the debt-

 equity swaps programs the funds have been provided by foreign investors.

 Our analysis suggests that the Chilean debt-equity swaps has not resulted in

 significant "additionality", and that to a large extent the program has

amounted to providing a large subsidy to previously existing foreign

investors. On the other hand, we also argue that the Chilean debt rescue

operations have been highly successful, permitting Chilean nationals    to use

reversed capital flight to retire debt at the same time as effectively

capturing a discount of approximately 30% in the secondary market. The

Chilean experience, although limited, provides some evidence   that suggests
LDCs that embark on secondary market operations should concentrate their

efforts on debt-rescue schemes rather than on debt-equity mechanisms.

     All of this, then, indicates that although individual LDCs could

increase the flow of DFI, the absolute magnitude of these funds will not be

dramatic. Other avenues should continue to be explored, including (closed-

end) investment funds, increased official assistance and,   especially, the

repatriation of flight capital. What is clear, however, is that the

implementation of structural reform policies will open up and modernize

these economies will not only have a positive impact on DFI but will also

have a positive impact on reversing capital flight.

 tion using an analytical framework somewhat similar to the one presented here.


      4An important
                      question is whether an analysis based on data from the

 1980s would provide insights on what is likely to happen in terms of DFI in

 the l990s. Anyone familiar with the ramifications of the debt crisis is

aware of the "abnormality" of the 1980s. Indeed, in
                                                         my view, the l980s
represent an extraordinary period with important but limited lessons for the
future of DFI behavior.


     5See, for example, Williamson (1975), Maggee (1977), and especially

Dunning (1981).


     6Blejer and Khan (1984) have studied the issue of
                                                           complementarity
between private and public sector investment, and have found a significant

amount of crowding-out.


     7See, for example, Lipsey (1988).


     8Rellejner (1989), however, reports that in practice tax inducements,

such as tax holidays, have not been very important.

      9Notice, however, that there may be a simultaneity problem here, since

 there has been a tendency for advanced countries to invest    in manufacturing.

      10Eaton and Gersovjtz (1984), for example, have recently derived a

 model on capital mobility, political risk, and expropriation.


      We use the debt-swaps term generically to refer to any mechanism

whereby old debt is exchange or reduced at a price below face
                                                                  price. They
 include debt-debt swaps, debt-rescue swaps, securitizacion, exit bonds,

debt-equity swaps and others. Chile has used debt-swaps
                                                             aggressively.
Also, Bolivia is often referred to as a successful case of a debt-buyback

scheme. However, this is not completely clear. See the controversy in the

Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 1988, 2.

     12
          Recently a growing controversy on whether there are circumstances

under which the use of this type of debt-swap mechanism is    beneficial for
both debtors and creditors has erupted. A nunber of authors have, in fact,

recently argued that under most realistic circumstances debt-swap schemes

will not benefit the poorer nations (Bulow and Rogoff, 1989). On this

controversy see, for example, the papers by Kenen (1990), Eaton (1990),

Sachs (1990), and Bulow and Rogoff (1990) in the Winter 1990     issue of

xrnal of Economic Persoectjves. See also the collection of papers edited

by Frenkel, Dooley and Wickhani (1989).


     131n Edwards (1986)


           number of empirical studies have investigated the determinants of

the market's perceived probability of default. For example, in Edwards

(1984) I found that this probability depends on a small number    of variables,
                                        31




 the most important of which are the level of the debt itself and the invest-

 ment ratio. A higher stock of debt reduces the probability of
                                                                   repayment,
while a higher investment ratio increases that probability.     Naturally, this

perceived probability will determine the price of the debt in the secondary

market; setting risk aversion aside the market value will be one minus this

probability.


      15These names stem from the fact that the regulations that govern these

operations are contained in Chapters 18 and 19 of the CorTrnendiun of Rules on

International Exchange of the Central Bank of Chile.


      16These computations refer to all operations that have used hj8, and

not only to those of the private sector.

     180f course, as pointed out above, what really matters is whether the

debtor's expectations differ from those of the buyer.


     19From an empirical perspective, it is not easy to quantify whether

there is or is not additionality, and the opinions appear to be divided.

Ffrench-Davis (1987), for example questions the existence of additionality,

while Fontaine (1989) argues that there is a significant proportion of new

funds. Larrain (1988) takes a somewhat intermediate position, arguing that

the fact that foreign banks have opted to participate, in    spite of the fact

that equity investment is not their main line of business,   is a sign that
there is at least some additionality.
