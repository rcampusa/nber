                                           ABSTRACT

The federal system for distributing student financial aid rivals the tax code in its complexity. Both
have been a source of frustration and a focus of reform efforts for decades, yet the complexity of the
student aid system has received comparatively little attention from economists. We describe the
complexity of the aid system, and apply lessons from optimal tax theory and behavioral economics
to show that complexity is a serious obstacle to both efficiency and equity in the distribution of
student aid. We show that complexity disproportionately burdens those with the least ability to pay
and undermines redistributive goals. We use detailed data from federal student aid applications to
show that a radically simplified aid process can reproduce the current distribution of aid using a
fraction of the information now collected.

Introduction
       The complexity of the federal tax code has been the focus of reform efforts for decades,

and has received considerable attention in the economic literature. The federal system for

distributing student financial aid is similarly convoluted, yet has received relatively little

attention from economists. For the typical household, the aid application (the Free Application

for Federal Student Aid, known as the FAFSA) is longer and more complicated than the federal

tax return. The aid process is also highly uncertain, with definitive information about freshman-

year aid not revealed until the spring of the senior year in high school.

       The consequences of complexity and uncertainty in aid extend beyond annoyance and

frustration. The intent of financial aid is to reduce the cost of college, thereby encouraging

college attendance. We argue that complexity disproportionately burdens those on the margin of

college entry, thereby blunting the impact of aid on their schooling decisions. Uncertainty about

aid similarly blunts its impact on behavior: high school students most sensitive to cost are

unlikely to start down the path to college if they do not know it is affordable. For those on the

margin of college entry, concrete information about aid simply arrives too late.

        Evidence on the behavioral impact of aid supports our argument. While simple, easily

communicated aid programs have been shown to have a robust impact on college entry and

completion, we have little to no compelling evidence that the traditional forms of student aid

(which require a FAFSA) increase schooling for their target populations. Complexity may be the

culprit. Simply put, potential college students cannot respond to a price subsidy if they do not

know it exists. As both the “sticker price” of college and aid for college have risen sharply, the

net price of college has grown increasingly individualized, making it difficult for prospective

students to estimate their own schooling costs. Most high school students overestimate the cost




                                                                                                     2
of attendance, but this confusion is of greater consequence for low-income students, who (unlike

their upper-income counterparts) are pessimistic about their ability to pay for college (Avery and

Kane, 2004).

         We use well-known principles of optimal tax policy, as well as more recent insights from

behavioral economics, to evaluate the costs of complexity in student financial aid. We

demonstrate that provisions intended to precisely target aid produce regressive compliance costs.

These costs rightly belong in our cost-benefit calculation when we consider the efficiency and

equity of a given targeting provision.1 The costs of aid complexity fall heavily on low-income,

non-white and non-English speaking youth, whose lagging educational levels are repeatedly

cited as a justification for financial aid. Though from a rational perspective these compliance

costs may seem small relative to the payoff of a college degree, the behavioral literature

demonstrates conclusively that even seemingly minor complexities can have profound impacts

upon the equity and efficiency of a policy.

         We show not only that the costs of complexity in student aid are large, but also that the

concomitant benefits are quite small. With student-level data from the 2003-04 National

Postsecondary Student Aid Survey (NPSAS:04), we show that much of the complexity in the aid

system fails to improve the targeting of aid. We find that the aid system imposes large costs in

order to measure small differences in ability to pay. Nearly all of the variation in aid is generated

by a handful of the more than 70 data items used in the aid formula. Parents’ adjusted gross

income (or, for tax non-filers, earnings from work), marital status, family size, and the number of

family members in college explain over three-quarters of the variation in Pell Grant awards.

With only a few more variables, we replicate 90 percent of the variation in Pell Grants for

  If this line of argument sounds eerily familiar, it is because it was made in the pages of this journal (Kaplow, 1996)
in the context of the income tax system. The Final Report of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform
repeatedly sounds the same theme.


                                                                                                                      3
dependent students. Our radically simplified process throws out 80 percent of the financial items

on the aid application. This aid application could fit on a single page. In fact, since the IRS

1040EZ already collects most of the key pieces of data that determine aid eligibility, a reasonable

option would be to eliminate the FAFSA completely and run student aid through the tax system.

       A simple aid program is an easily-communicated aid program. Simplification would

allow personalized information about aid to be communicated to families early. Just as workers

are annually sent projections of their Social Security benefits to help them plan for retirement,

families could be sent estimates of their aid eligibility to help them plan for college. Under the

current system, students do not get accurate information about student aid until late spring of

senior year in high school. Early information about federal help for paying for college is critical

for low-income families. If the goal of aid is to encourage college attendance, then the end of the

final year of high school is simply too late for information about subsidies to arrive.

       Our paper is emphatically not an argument against progressivity in aid. An aid system,

like a tax system, can be both simple and progressive, and we conclude that reducing complexity

in aid would be both efficient and equitable. The current aid system creates formidable barriers

to college. A key lesson of our research is that we can dismantle these barriers if we are willing

to tolerate minor imperfections in measuring ability to pay. This, we believe, is a worthwhile

tradeoff. Reducing unnecessary complexity will allow aid to serve its intended goal: opening the

doors of college to those who have the ability but not the means to further their education.



Financial Aid Overview

       Two programs provide the bulk of federal aid to college students: the Pell Grant and the

Stafford Loan. Both are distributed through the “need-determination” process, in which



                                                                                                      4
extensive data about a student's resources and expenses are used to estimate his “need” for aid.

We will describe this process shortly.

         During the 2004-05 academic year, $13 billion in Pell Grants was delivered to five

million students (expenditure data are from College Board, 2005). The grants averaged $2,500

per recipient, with a maximum value of $4,050. Pell Grants are highly progressive, flowing

almost exclusively to families with incomes below $40,000 (Stedman, 2003). During the same

year, $41 billion in low-interest loans was delivered to undergraduates through the Stafford Loan

program. Since the loans are eventually paid back, the cost of the Stafford program is less than a

quarter of this amount. Half of the Stafford loans distributed are need-based “subsidized” loans,

for which the government pays the interest while the student is in college. The other half are

“unsubsidized” Stafford loans, for which interest accrues during college. While the unsubsidized

loans are provided regardless of need, students must go through the need-determination process

to access them.

         Dependent undergraduates can borrow $2,625 for the first year of college, $3,500 for the

second year and $5,500 in each of the next three years.2 Stafford loans do not require a credit

check. Parents can borrow unsubsidized loans up to the cost of college (net of aid) through the

federal PLUS program, which does require a credit check and for which interest accrues during

college. Students whose parents do not pass the credit check are eligible for up to $5,000 in

unsubsidized Stafford loans over and above the usual annual caps (U.S. Dept. of Education,

2005b).

 Beginning in the 2007-08 academic year, loan limits will increase to $3,500 for the first year and $4,500 for the
second year.


                                                                                                                     5
        The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required for all federal grants

and loans. Most state aid and school scholarships also require the FAFSA.3 The FAFSA collects

basic demographics (e.g., name, social security number, citizenship, date of birth, etc.) as well as

detailed information about the student’s and parents’ income, assets, and expenditures. See

Appendix for a copy of the 2006-07 FAFSA. Families cannot obtain an estimate of their federal

aid eligibility without submitting a FAFSA.4 Prospective freshmen cannot file a FAFSA until

January of their senior year of high school. The aid determination process is summarized in

Figure 1.

                                            [FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]

Once the FAFSA is submitted, the U.S. Department of Education computes the expected family

contribution (EFC), an estimate of how much the family can pay out of pocket for college.

“Need” is defined as the difference between the cost of attendance (e.g., tuition, fees, books,

living expenses) and this family contribution. The EFC, but not any estimate of aid eligibility, is

mailed to the applicant as well as the colleges to which she has applied. Using the EFC, colleges

personalize a package of grants and loans for each student, which they then mail out in the form

of award letters, typically in March and April. Only upon receiving these award letters do

students know how much college will cost for the upcoming year.

        In Table 1 we compare the FAFSA to the IRS 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ income tax

forms. The FAFSA, at five pages and 128 questions, is lengthier than Form1040EZ (one page,

with 37 questions) and Form 1040A (two pages, with 83 questions). It is comparable to Form

1040 (two pages, with 118 questions). With this comparison we do not mean to suggest that the

3
  Some colleges require an additional aid application, such as the College Board's PROFILE or a school-specific
form.
4
  Some websites offer EFC calculators, which require the same data as the FAFSA. An enterprising student or parent
could therefore calculate the EFC without completing a FAFSA. We would hazard that, for a family that is able to
do this sort of sleuthing, federal financial aid is not a determinative factor in the college entry decision.


                                                                                                                6
U.S. tax system is a paradigm of simplicity. The statistics in Table 1 understate the complexity

faced by taxpayers who must fill out additional worksheets and schedules in order to complete

the questions listed on the 1040. But for the families targeted by need-based aid, complexity in

the aid application rivals the complexity they experience in the income tax system. Most families

eligible for the Pell file the shorter 1040A or 1040EZ; 86 percent of filing households with

income below $50,000 (and two-thirds of all households) use these simplified IRS forms. The

contrast between Form 1040EZ and the FAFSA is especially striking. With a third of the

FAFSA's questions and a fifth of its pages, the IRS captures the information needed to determine

tax liability for the very population targeted by need-based aid.

                                          [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

         Why is the FAFSA so long? In part, because the aid formula applies different “tax rates”

to the student's and parents' resources, and so asks separate questions about each.5 But, as Table

1 shows, the FAFSA demands more detailed measures of financial resources than do the income

tax forms. Thirty-four FAFSA questions probe for sources of income not shown on the W-2,

compared to two on the 1040EZ, 12 on the 1040A and 19 on the 1040. Further, while none of the

tax forms ask about assets, the FAFSA has six questions on this topic.

         The IRS estimates it takes 16 hours to complete a 1040. The 1040A and 1040EZ are

estimated to require 13 and eight hours, respectively. These are likely conservative estimates:

Blumenthal and Slemrod (1992) conclude that the time required for tax compliance averages 27

hours per filing household, and is longer for low- and high-income households. The U.S.

Department of Education improbably estimates that it takes one hour to complete the FAFSA.

  The highest tax rate on parental assets is about six percent for each year of college, while the student's assets can be
taxed at 35 percent (this rate will fall to 20 percent as of the 2007-2008 academic year). The marginal tax rate on
parental income ranges from 22 to 47 percent, while for student earnings the tax rate is zero below an earnings
protection allowance and 50 percent above that allowance. See Dynarski (2004b) for a discussion of how the aid tax
on assets varies by ownership and asset type.


                                                                                                                        7
        An obvious point, but one worth stating in this context, is that when a taxpayer has

completed her 1040, she knows how much tax she owes. To this end, twenty-one of the

questions on the 1040 are calculations or look-ups from tax tables. Completing the FAFSA

yields no comparable information about aid eligibility. We will return to this point later in the

paper. For now, we simply highlight the fact that, upon completing the FAFSA, the aid applicant

is no more informed about her financial aid eligibility than she was when she began.

        The complexity of the FAFSA not only creates costs, it obscures benefits. If the aid

formula were transparent and communicated early, families would have clear incentives to fill

out a long and intrusive form. But when families do not know the benefits of filling out the

form, the costs weigh heavily. Simplifying the aid formula would not just shorten the FAFSA

but allow families to determine their aid eligibility easily and early, when it can make a

difference in their decisions.



Insights from Optimal Tax Theory

        Complexity in the tax system arises from attempts to precisely measure taxpayers’ ability

to pay.6 Analogously, complexity in the need-based aid system arises from attempts to precisely

measure ability to pay for college. As has been highlighted in the tax literature (Kaplow, 1990

and 1996), measuring income more accurately produces costs to society that are frequently

ignored by policy-makers and analysts. Kaplow (1996) offers the following illustrative example.

Consider two people with “true” income of $40,000. Unless a deduction is allowed (say, for

unusual health expenses) one person will have a reported income of $45,000. Creating the

deduction will allow for more accurate measurement of income, so the added complexity has a
6
  Complexity can also arise when policymakers “deviate from tax principles in order to subsidize certain activities
and groups (Kaplow, 1996).” For example, the mortgage interest deduction and 401(k) are tax provisions intended
to encourage homeownership and retirement saving, respectively.


                                                                                                                      8
benefit: it prevents us from reducing one person’s income below its socially optimal level. But

there are also costs to this new provision:

                1) efficiency loss as taxpayers alter their behavior so as to shield income
                   under the deduction.
                2) administrative costs for the government (or schools), which are
                   ultimately paid by taxpayers in the form of higher taxes or reduced
                   services.
                3) compliance costs for taxpayers, such as time spent learning about the
                   rules and formulas, record-keeping, and completing forms.

We will shortly provide detail on the extent of these complexity costs in the aid system, but for

now let us speak of them in abstract terms.

       These costs of complexity should be weighed against its benefits in determining whether

a given aspect of the tax code (or aid system) enhances social welfare. Optimal tax theory shows

that a transfer between two groups can be worthwhile if the socially-weighted gain in utility from

those receiving the transfer outweighs the socially-weighted loss in utility of those paying for the

transfer. The weights are critical: the transfer is a losing proposition if those giving and receiving

weigh equally in the social welfare function, since the transfer then yields no social benefits but

does produce efficiency, compliance and administrative costs. But a group that weighs heavily

when we consider the benefits of the transfer also weighs heavily when we add up the costs of

the transfer. Compliance costs that fall on a group with high weight in our social welfare

function will disproportionately reduce social welfare. A key lesson is that any policy intended to

redistribute income should be carefully crafted so that it does not create costs that outweigh its

benefits.

       An example will illustrate how compliance costs can have a regressive impact. Consider

the Earned Income Tax Credit. Despite the large value of this credit, non-participation in the

program is substantial and a perennial source of concern (Greenstein, 2005). Applying for the


                                                                                                      9
EITC may be quite daunting for the target population (Berube et al., 2002). Recently, H&R

Block and other tax preparers have found a market niche filing tax returns for low-income

families eligible for the credit, and as a result seventy-five percent of EITC recipients now use a

tax preparer (President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, 2005). Both parties benefit –

the taxpayer gets a credit, and tax preparers take a cut in the form of a $100 fee and (annualized)

interest rates exceeding 200 percent charged on "refund loans" (Berube et al., 2002). A full

accounting of the costs and benefits of the EITC would include these as compliance costs.

Compliance costs clearly reduce the progressivity of the EITC, since part of the EITC leaks to

tax preparers. A simplification that at first blush appears to reduce the progressivity of the EITC

may prove progressive were it to reduce this leakage. We argue that the same holds in the aid

system: a simplification that appears distributionally neutral may prove progressive in its

incidence.

         In some cases, costs can enhance efficiency because they fall on those seeking the

transfer (Akerlof, 1978; Nichols and Zeckhauser, 1982). For example, requiring people to wait

in long lines in order to receive welfare benefits may be efficient if those with the least need have

the highest opportunity cost of their time. In this case, compliance costs help to screen out those

who are not the intended targets of the transfer. But the inverse also holds: if compliance costs

fall most heavily on the intended targets of the transfer, redistribution is less efficient. In the

extreme, costs may drive the targeted group out of the program.7 For a variety of reasons that we

detail below, compliance costs for student aid are likely highest for the poorest families, and may

deflect some their intended target (low-income families) from applying.




7
 Indeed, there is evidence that complexity in the provision of social benefits reduces the take-up of transfers (Bitler,
Currie, and Scholz, 2003; Brien and Swann, 1999; see literature review by Currie, 2004).


                                                                                                                     10
        We now describe the efficiency, administrative and compliance costs of complexity in

the aid system.



Efficiency Loss

        At the core of public finance is the principle that an efficient tax system taxes the

broadest base at the lowest rate. Variation in tax rates (induced, for example, by excluding some

goods from taxation) creates incentives and opportunities for gaming the system, such as shifting

assets into untaxed financial vehicles. This has equity consequences, since these strategies are

implemented only by those who have the resources to play the game – e.g., those who can hire

advisers to find clever shelters for their income and assets. Tellingly, an industry of highly-paid

aid advisers has emerged to guide families through the aid system.



Administrative Costs

        The administrative costs of student aid accrue to both the government and colleges. The

government’s administrative costs (excluding the administration of federal direct student loans)

are not strikingly high in comparison with the billions of dollars of aid distributed: an annual

report from the Office for Student Financial Assistance estimated an operational/overhead cost of

about $19 per unduplicated grant/loan aid recipient in 2000, which would imply administrative

costs of approximately $179 million in 2004 (U.S. Dept. of Education, 2002c).8

        The lion’s share of administrative costs are borne by the colleges themselves, who are

responsible for answering students’ questions, verifying student information, and packaging and

disbursing federal student aid. Financial aid administrators and support staff paid by the colleges


8
 In 2004 there were 9.4 million unduplicated aid recipients (U.S. Dept. of Education, 2005e,
http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget06/summary/edlite-section2d.html#tables).


                                                                                                   11
are responsible for these tasks. To pay colleges' administrative costs, the Department of

Education allocated to schools administrative allowances of $83.4 million in 2005.9 However,

schools almost certainly incur costs far in excess of this allowance. Estimates of the annual cost

of audits alone range from $132 million (US Office of the Inspector General) to $432 million

(Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, 2005).10 The lower bound of these

estimates exceeds the entire administrative allowance for 2005. Note that since the colleges’

costs are not a line item in the federal budget, they are likely to be overlooked when

policymakers consider the costs and benefits of complexity in the aid process.



Compliance Costs

         Compliance costs, which fall on applicants, are the focus of our analysis. Compliance

costs include the time and resources required to learn about the system and its rules, collect all of

the required documents, and fill out the form. Though low-income families likely have a

relatively low opportunity cost of time, the length of time required to learn about and comply

with any given provision of the aid process is higher for low-income families. In addition, some

families face barriers (such as language) that additional time does little to diminish.




9
  This is calculated from data at http://www.ed.gov/about/overview/budget/budget06/summary/edlite-
section2d.html#tables. Schools can allocate to administrative costs five percent of their funds for Supplemental
Educational Opportunity Grants, work-study, and Perkins Loans; these aid sources totaled $3.3 billion in 2005.
Schools are also allocated five dollars per Pell Grant recipient, of which there were 5.33 million in 2005.

                                                                                                                   12
        Low-income families have little prior experience with the aid system, since the parents

are unlikely to have gone to college and applied for aid themselves. Half of low-income high

school seniors do not have a parent who ever attended college.11 Their classmates and siblings

are also relatively unlikely to attend college. This lack of college-going peers and relatives

blocks a channel that could communicate information about need-based aid to the target

population. Liebman (1998) concludes that peers play a crucial role in informally transmitting

information about the EITC, a complicated tax program that encourages work by partially

matching the wages of low-income parents.12 A non-working, low-income mother may observe

the improving financial position of neighbors who have entered the workforce and (unknown to

her) received the EITC. Even if she does not understand the structure of the EITC’s incentives,

she may respond as if she did, and enter the workforce. Since 80 percent of families with

incomes between 100 and 150 percent of the poverty line receive the EITC, this is a plausible

scenario; a poor person is likely to know someone benefiting from the EITC. By contrast, just

34% of low-income black youth and 33% of low-income Hispanics have even attempted college,

severely limiting the informal transmission of information about college costs within these

populations.13

                                                                                                              13
        People can learn about complicated programs not only from observing peers’ transactions

but also through their own repeated transactions. Liebman and Zeckhauser (2005) conclude that

when faced with complicated price schedules (such as those for cell phone contracts) people may

respond not to marginal prices but “average” prices gleaned from past experience. In the case of

college, interactions with the aid system for a given family are infrequent, so opportunities for

backing out average prices are rare.

        Language is another barrier, with 13 percent of low-income students primarily speaking a

language other than English at home, double the rate of families with above-median incomes.14

Even the basic step of locating financial records is an obstacle for poor students, due to higher

mobility rates and family dysfunctions such as divorce and separation of children from parents.

Low-income families are substantially less likely to have access to the internet at home, a

handicap in a system that relies heavily upon the web for the dissemination of information and is

moving towards an exclusively on-line application system. In 2003, over two-thirds of children

from families with incomes below $25,000 had no access to the internet at home, compared to 12

percent of families with incomes above $50,000.15 Families may be reluctant to bring financial

documents to a school or a library in order to enter these data into a public computer.

        In sum, poorer families are likely to face greater costs of learning about the aid system,

collecting the required documents, and completing the aid form. Since compliance costs

correlate with poverty, and the poor weigh heavily in our calculations of social welfare, we

should strive to minimize their compliance costs. Consider the case in which we seek to measure

ability to pay for college more accurately by asking questions about untaxed income, such as

welfare benefits and disability benefits. Such questions account for much of the complexity in

the aid application. These questions are asked in order to withhold aid from families that can pay

more out of pocket than implied by a less precise measure of income. The benefit of this added

complexity is that money can be now channeled toward more optimal uses: more “needy” aid

recipients, other government programs, or lower tax rates. If the source of income is quite rare,

then only a small amount of money will be freed up in this way, yet every aid applicant must still

read through the additional questions and instructions in order to determine whether any of her

income falls into the relevant category. In this case, compliance costs could easily outweigh the

freed-up funds produced by the additional questions.




Insights from Behavioral Economics

       We have made the case that the cost of compliance in the aid system is substantial,

especially for low-income families, and that this complexity blunts the impact of the subsidies on

schooling decisions. However, a valid rejoinder to this argument is that the financial returns to a

college education dwarf any reasonable estimate of the costs of applying for aid. Thus, if people

behave rationally, anyone who is deterred from going to college by such relatively small

compliance costs must have an unusually low expected return to college.

       A key insight of behavioral economics is that people systematically do not behave

rationally, even in matters where we might most expect calculating rationality. Indeed,

individuals deviate from rationality in highly predictable ways that tend to shock only

economists. In this section, we provide a brief overview of insights that behavioral economics

can offer in the realm of student aid and college attendance.




                                                                                                    15
Time Inconsistency

       People are poor at committing to behaviors that require present sacrifice in pursuit of

future returns (O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999). This characterizes a broad range of behaviors,

including saving for retirement, exercise, and schooling. People may plan to get up early to

exercise, but hit the snooze button when the alarm goes off. They may plan to save for

retirement, but never enroll in their employer's 401(k). They may plan to go to college, but fail to

fill out their FAFSA or register for the SAT. While they may firmly believe that saving or

exercise or college is the right choice, when the time comes to make the required sacrifice,

commitment falters. These are examples of what economists refer to as time-inconsistent

preferences.

       By its nature, college is an investment: upfront sacrifices are required (tuition, forgone

earnings, studying) in order to obtain back-loaded benefits (better job, higher earnings, higher

social status). Applying for aid is part of the cost of college, requiring a current sacrifice in order

to yield a future return. Given that adults are guilty of procrastination and avoidance in quite

high-stakes investments (Thaler, 1994), we would not expect all teenagers who would benefit

from aid to apply.



Loss Aversion

       Nobel Laureates Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (2000) show that people are loss

averse: they avoid worthwhile bets because “losses weigh more heavily than gains.” That is, a

dollar lost decreases utility more than a dollar gained increases it. In lab experiments and in real-

world settings, people “underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with

outcomes that are obtained with certainty (Kahneman and Tversky, 2000).” When it is the gains




                                                                                                     16
that are probable and the losses that are certain, this will lead to risk aversion and avoidance of

even “good bets.” Certain costs and probable gains characterize college. Students must apply for

aid, give up earnings, pay tuition, and study. These are certain outlays. By contrast, students

cannot know with certainty how well their investment will pay off. While, on average, college is

a good bet, there is enormous variance in the earnings of college graduates. For some, college

will not pay off, and this possibility may weigh heavily in schooling decisions due to loss

aversion.



Default Behavior

        Economists and psychologists have found that individuals’ decisions are strongly

influenced by their “default” course of action (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). An influential

study examined retirement saving at a large financial firm (Madrian and Shea, 2001). At this

firm, 401(k) participation required that new employees check a box on a form; the consequence

of not checking that box was not participating in the 401(k). That is, the default option was non-

participation. Despite the low transaction costs of enrollment and strong financial incentives (tax

advantages plus an employer match of savings), participation rates were low. The company

made a minor change: non-participation now required that the new employee check a box on a

form and so participation was the default option. This small change in program design had a

profound effect on behavior, increasing participation by 50 percentage points.

        Seemingly minor obstacles put low-income youth off the path to college, much as adults

are put off the path to saving by bureaucratic details. A study of high school seniors in Boston

found that few low-income youth “decide” against college. Rather, they miss a key deadline, or

incorrectly fill out a form, or fail to take a required class, and thereby fall off the path to college




                                                                                                      17
(Avery and Kane, 2004). For upper-income teenagers, the affirmative actions of their parents and

schools establish college entry as the “default” path. Their high schools guide them through the

multiple steps and deadlines of the college and financial aid process. Schools provide SAT

preparation on site, schedule exams for students, organize the writing of recommendations, and

remind students repeatedly about relevant deadlines. Informal guidance and support is also

provided by their college-educated relatives and neighbors, who act as de facto guidance

counselors.

        By contrast, due to their comparatively weak institutional and social supports, the default

option for low-income students is to not go to college. Navigating the maze of college and aid

application requires both formal and informal support. Lower-income schools receive fewer

visits from college representatives and have fewer guidance counselors per student.16 Parents and

siblings are not likely have gone to college, and so cannot compensate for this lack of

institutional support.



Identity Salience

        A program may discourage participation through the self-identification it triggers in

people. The food stamp application process, for example, “cues negative identities and can

induce guilt and alienation,” thereby discouraging take-up (Bertrand, Mullainathan, and Shafir,

2004). The FAFSA is rich with negative cues relating to poverty and criminal activity. The

FAFSA asks “Have you ever been convicted of possessing or selling illegal drugs? If you have,

answer ‘Yes,’ complete and submit this application, and we will send you a worksheet in the

mail for you to determine if your conviction affects your eligibility for aid.” The final step in


16

Condition of Education 2000, Indicator 28, see also Indicator 27.


                                                                                                          18
submitting a FAFSA is the signing of a statement which concludes with “If you purposely give

false or misleading information, you may be fined $20,000, sent to prison, or both.” The full

signing statement is nearly five times longer than that on IRS Form 1040. Multiple questions

about welfare payments repeatedly remind low-income students about their poverty, while open-

ended questions that require the calculation of net worth or income (applicants are asked about

“money received, or paid on your behalf (e.g. bills), not reported elsewhere on this form”) could

generate anxiety among even middle-class applicants.




Evidence on the Impact of Student Aid

       There is plenty of evidence that student financial aid can have a large impact on behavior.

Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth show that the Social Security Student

Benefit program substantially increased college enrollment rates among eligible youth

(Dynarski, 2003). Under this program, children of Social Security beneficiaries continued to get

their benefits past their usual expiration at age 18, as long as they enrolled in college. The

compliance costs were minimal. The Social Security Administration sent a letter to child

beneficiaries shortly before their 18th birthday, asking if they intended to go to college. If they

replied in the affirmative, checks continued to arrive. Renewal required confirmation of

enrollment from the college registrar. The program provided early information, in that

beneficiary families were familiar with the provision. Families knew the exact amount of the

benefit, since they were already receiving it.

       Another simple program, Georgia’s HOPE Scholarship, requires only that high school

students maintain a 3.0 GPA in high school in order to have their tuition and fees paid at any

public college in Georgia. High schools proactively send transcript data to the state in order to



                                                                                                      19
identify scholarship winners. For most students, the HOPE application consists of a half-page of

basic biographical information. High school students are knowledgeable about the program.

More than seventy percent of Georgia high-school freshmen surveyed were able to name the

program without prompting. Fifty-nine percent, when asked to list some requirements of HOPE,

volunteered that a high school GPA of 3.0 is necessary (Henry, et al, 1998). The program

substantially increased college entry in Georgia (Dynarski, 2000), as well as the share of young

people completing a college degree (Dynarski, 2005). Research on similar state programs has

produced similar findings (Kane, 2003; Dynarski, 2004a and 2005).

        By contrast, there is little to no persuasive evidence that the Pell grant program affects

college enrollment decisions of young people.17 A plausible explanation is that the application

process screens out students teetering on the margin of college entry. A prospective student who

is able to deduce her aid eligibility, apply to college without knowing what resources will be

available to pay for it, and successfully complete the FAFSA almost by definition reveals herself

as firmly committed to attending college.




Simplifying the aid system

        We have argued that the costs of complexity in the federal student aid process are

substantial. We now measure the benefits of this complexity. How much does complexity

improve targeting in the aid system? We are especially interested in the “low-hanging fruit” –



17
  An early study by Hansen (1983) examined enrollment rates before and after implementation of the Pell Grant
program. Hansen found that while enrollment rates of all income groups increased during the 1970s, enrollment
among low-income students did not increase disproportionately. Kane (1995) utilizes more years of data and limits
the sample to women, whose enrollment patterns were less disrupted by the Vietnam War but is also unable to find
an effect. Seftor and Turner (2002) find a small effect of Pell Grants on college enrollment for older, independent
students. Bettinger (2004) finds suggestive evidence that Pell Grant size affects college completion, but notes his
results are very sensitive.


                                                                                                                 20
that is, identifying complexity that creates barriers to applicants while providing little payback in

the form of improved targeting.

         Using data from the nationally representative 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student

Aid Survey (NPSAS:04), we examine the relationship between federal aid received and

information in the FAFSA. We focus on Pell Grants, since they are the most expensive

component of federal need-based aid, but we also present results for subsidized Stafford loan

eligibility and for the EFC (as a proxy for all other need-based aid eligibility). Our sample

consists of 15,603 undergraduates who attended college full-time in 2003-04 and who applied for

federal aid (see Appendix for details).18 To simplify the analysis and exposition, all of our

simulations are limited to dependent students.19 We see no conceptual barriers to extending the

simulations to independent students, for whom there is a distinct but similar aid formula. Our

confidence is bolstered by a Congressional Research Service analysis that concludes that the

same FAFSA items explain most of the variation in the EFC for independent and dependent

students (Stoll and Stedman, 2004).

         We first use the NPSAS data to replicate the current distribution of aid. We calculate aid

using the federal financial aid formula (described in Appendix) and compare these calculated aid

amounts with their true values, which are given in the NPSAS. Our calculations of Pell Grants

and EFCs are extremely close to their true values. Regressing the actual against the predicted

values yields an R2 of 1.00 for the EFC and 0.997 for the Pell. For Stafford loans, it is not

possible to validate our estimate in this way: NPSAS contains data about loan take-up but not

18
   We exclude the six percent of observations for whom we cannot replicate the Pell or EFC within $1,000, even
using all of the data and the exact federal aid formula. For half of these cases, we calculate a Pell grant of at least
$1,000, while the actual grant is zero. These are likely cases in which an applicant was audited and failed to provide
documentation, or reflect adjustments made by aid administrators, who can exercise professional judgment in
distributing aid.
19
   With rare exceptions (e.g., parental desertion or death) students are considered dependent if they are under the age
of 24, unmarried, and have no children. Of full-time students attending a single institution all year who applied for
federal aid, 62 percent were classified as dependent.


                                                                                                                    21
loan eligibility, and many people do not take-up the full loan for which they are eligible (for the

Pell Grant, eligibility and take-up are essentially identical). However, our results suggest that we

are accurately calculating eligibility. Our prediction of Stafford eligibility is within one dollar of

the actual loan amount for 70 percent of borrowers.

         To measure the influence of the various data elements on aid, we sequentially exclude

data items from the aid formula and recalculate aid, and then compare the new estimates to the

baseline values described above.20 Mechanically, this is achieved by setting the value of the

excluded items to zero.21 We measure the predictive power of these simulations with the R2

from regressions of the baseline aid values against their simulated values under simplification.

         The R2 communicates the proportion of the variation in aid that can be attributed to each

set of variables, but it does not tell us who wins and who loses. We therefore plot gains and

losses against families’ financial resources. As our measure of financial resources, we will

primarily use the aid system’s current summary statistic for a family’s ability to pay for college,

the expected family contribution (EFC). If our simulations reproduce the current distribution of

aid across the EFC, then we have successfully reproduced the current system’s distributional

priorities. We will also use adjusted gross income, a more familiar metric for financial resources,

for some of our graphs.




20
   We are not the first to estimate the predictive power of individual FAFSA items on student aid. Kane (1995)
notes that most of the variation in Pell Grants can be explained using just a few variables. Stoll and Stedman (2004)
use student-level FAFSA data (from the 1999-2000 NPSAS) to simulate the effect on the EFC of excluding items
from the aid calculation.
21
   We have also tested setting excluded values to their means or medians, with substantively similar results. For state
of residence and elder parent’s age, which are excluded from some simulations, a value of zero is not meaningful, so
we assign to all applicants the default values that the aid formula imputes when these items are missing from a
FAFSA.


                                                                                                                    22
Simulation A: Distribute Aid Using Income, Assets and Family Structure

        We start with Simulation A, in which we throw out all of the data used in the aid

calculation except for adjusted gross income of the parents (or, for non-filers, earnings), student

earnings, parents’ and student’s assets, parents' marital status, family size and number of family

members in college. This approach discards parents’ and student’s taxes paid, the types of

income tax forms filed and the required worksheets (reproduced in Appendix) that elicit

information about transfer income (such as the EITC, welfare, and Social Security) and other

income (child support). These worksheets account for 45 of the 70 financial questions used in the

calculation of aid.

                                            [TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

        The extensive data we drop in this simulation explain only ten percent of the variation in

aid (Column (1), Table 2). With the few variables we include, we explain 90 percent of the

variation in the Pell Grant and 93 percent of the variation in the EFC, and 79 percent of the

variation in subsidized Stafford loan eligibility. Using only the items in Simulation A would cut

the number of financial questions on the FAFSA by more than 80 percent, while changing the

Pell Grant by less than $500 for 88 percent of the sample.

        The worksheet data appear particularly uninformative. Discarding only the worksheets

(results not shown) changes the Pell Grants by less than $100 for 82 percent of students and by

less than $500 for 91 percent of students. Worksheet C, which contains four questions on

education tax credits, child support, and work-study earnings, is especially egregious, explaining

0.1 percent of the variation in the EFC, 0.7 percent of the variation in loan eligibility, and 0.8

percent of the variation in the Pell Grant.22


22
  Unfortunately, we cannot say which of the individual worksheet questions have predictive power and which do
not. The worksheets are not submitted by applicants; their summary calculations are entered on the FAFSA.


                                                                                                                23
       The parent and student worksheets likely have so little explanatory power for two

reasons. First, many of the topics queried on these worksheets are relevant to few families (e.g.,

living stipends for the military and clergy, foreign income). Second, many of the questions are

only relevant for families near the top or bottom of the income distribution (e.g., IRA rollovers

and welfare benefits). Based on their AGI, these families either qualify for no aid or the

maximum of aid, so their aid eligibility is insensitive to the worksheet items. As a result, the

worksheets don’t affect aid eligibility much, despite the substantial compliance costs they create.

       Plotting simulated Pell Grant eligibility against true EFC shows that this approach

produces a distribution almost identical to the current one (see Figure 2.1, in which each EFC

bracket represents five percent of the sample). Student loan eligibility drops in the upper EFC

ranges (Figure 2.2), largely because this simulation excludes parents' tax liability, which

currently decreases the amount that families are expected to pay out of pocket. Table 3 provides

rough estimates of the revenue implications of each approach; these estimates reflect the

projected change in aid for our population of dependent undergraduates. Simulation A increases

Pell costs by just $9 per student, or less than one percent. Loan offers drop by about ten percent.

                                [FIGURES 2.1 AND 2.2 ABOUT HERE]

                                       [TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]



Simulation B: Distribute Aid Using Income and Family Structure, Dropping Assets

       We next discard parents’ and student’s assets from the simulation. The “taxation” of

assets by the aid formula has been roundly criticized by economists. Edlin (1993) and others

have argued that the taxation of assets by the aid formula creates horizontal inequities. Identical

families with identical lifetime earnings can be treated very differently by the aid system, with




                                                                                                    24
aid reduced for the family that has sacrificed consumption in order to save for college. A

rejoinder is that assets serve as a summary statistic for lifetime earnings, which are imperfectly

captured by current earnings. An alternative approach to measuring lifetime earnings, also

suggested by Edlin, is to estimate ability to pay using multiple years of earnings. We consider

this a sensible option worth consideration.

           In practical terms, assets have little impact on the calculation of federal aid. Moving from

Simulation A to Simulation B has relatively little effect on our predictive power. We still explain

86 percent of the variation in the Pell, 76 percent of the variation in the subsidized Stafford loan

and 84 percent of the variation in the EFC. Our simulated Pell falls within $500 of true Pell for

86 percent of applicants. The Pell is essentially unchanged at low levels of the EFC, and rises

slightly at the middle of the EFC distribution (Figure 3.2). Loan eligibility drops in the middle

and upper ranges of the EFC (Figure 3.2). The overall effect is an eight percent increase in Pell

Grants and a six percent drop in subsidized Stafford loans (Table 3).

           To isolate the impact of assets on the current distribution of aid, we also calculated

changes in the Pell and subsidized Stafford loan that would be induced by excluding only assets

from the current formula.23 Figures 4.1 and 4.2 plot the changes. Since ignoring assets can only

increase need, this approach increases aid eligibility across the board, but by very small amounts.

Pell Grants rise imperceptibly in the middle of the EFC distribution.

           Ignoring assets does not substantially alter the distribution of aid (in this static

simulation) because the bulk of household assets are already excluded from the aid calculation.

Retirement funds and home equity are ignored by the federal aid formula, and this is where most




23
     . That is, we restore all of the variables we had previously excluded, except for parents’ and student’s assets.


                                                                                                                        25
households hold their assets.24 Other assets are assessed only if they fall above a threshold that

rises with the age of the oldest parent; in 2003-04, the threshold was $54,500 for a two-parent

family (or $26,200 for a single-parent family) in which the older parent was 55. To demonstrate

that assets are determinative of federal aid for only a small number of families, we added $100 to

every family’s financial assets and recalculated aid eligibility. For 99 and 85 percent of the

sample, respectively, the Pell Grant and EFC were unchanged.

         This may be a case, however, in which the dynamic effect of aid simplification differs

substantially from its static effect. Families with substantial assets who do not currently bother

applying for aid may apply if assets are completely excluded from the aid formula. The revenue

risks of such a behavioral response can be estimated by comparing the assets of current FAFSA

applicants to the assets of all households with children in college, which we plan to do in future

work. The current analysis, at least, offers no support for the view that eliminating the aid tax

would substantially undermine the progressivity of federal aid. .

Simulation C: Distribute Aid Using Income and Family Structure, Dropping All Assets and

Students' Earnings

         We next exclude student earnings from the calculation of aid, reducing to four the

required items: parents’ income, parents’ marital status, family size, and number of family

members in college. These items, captured by six questions on the FAFSA, explain 77 percent of

the variation in the Pell Grant, 76 percent of the variation in eligibility for the subsidized Stafford


24
  All asset information is currently excluded from the EFC calculation for families that qualify for the “simplified
needs test” or “automatic zero EFC,” both of which we will discuss later in the paper.


                                                                                                                   26
loan and 83 percent of the variation in the EFC. In this simulation, Pell Grant eligibility rises

toward the middle of the EFC distribution (Figure 5.1). This is the most costly of the approaches,

with average Pell Grants increasing by $268 per applicant (25 percent) relative to baseline.

Subsidized loan volume drops slightly from its current level.

         The aid system's treatment of student earnings is deeply flawed, from both an equity and

an efficiency standpoint. The aid formula taxes student earnings (over an income protection

allowance of $2,550) at a rate of fifty percent. 25 This is a very high tax on students’ work effort,

and may serve to discourage work. Further, the tax falls more heavily on low-income students,

since both work effort and earnings drop as parental income rises. While 73 percent of students

from lower-income families have positive earnings, the figure is 62 percent for students from

upper-income families.26 Median student earnings are $2,730 for the lower-income group, as

compared to $2,231 for the upper income group.

         To isolate the relationship between student earnings and aid, we simulated an approach

that keeps the current formula intact except for the tax on student earnings. Relative to the

current system, the distributional impact of this change is to increase average Pell Grants by

about $500 for those from families with incomes between $15,000 and $45,000, and increase

eligibility for subsidized loans by a couple of hundred dollars in the upper income ranges.

Though this might be a desirable change, it is clearly expensive. An approach that would keep

costs at their current level, reduce compliance costs, and reward students for working would be

to assume that all students contribute a lump sum to their schooling expenses. This does not tax

students' work effort on the margin, yet has them contributing to schooling costs.


25
   In 2007-2008, the amount will rise to $3,000. Students also receive allowances for federal taxes paid and an
estimate of state taxes paid. If parents’ total allowances exceed parents’ income, the excess parents’ allowance is
used to protect more of the student’s income.
26
   We divide families at the rough median of household income, $50,000.


                                                                                                                      27
          We have tested this approach with a variant of Simulation C. We predict aid using

parents’ income, parents’ marital status, family size, and number of family members in college ,

but additionally require of each student (except for those with very low family incomes) a lump-

sum contribution to schooling costs of $1,000. This approach keeps Pell Grant spending at its

current level and reduces the volume of subsidized loans offered by 7 percent (see Table 3).

          In Figure 6.1, we plot the associated changes in Pell Grant eligibility against parents'

adjusted gross income. The results are highly progressive, shifting grants toward those whose

parents earn below $25,000. By contrast, if we plot the changes in Pell eligibility against current

EFC (Figure 6.2), the reform looks regressive. This is because the current EFC formula counts

some families as “richer” simply because their college students work more hours. We argue that

student earnings are almost completely a measure of effort, and thus should be excluded from the

calculation of ability to pay.

                                  [FIGURES 5.1 AND 5.2 ABOUT HERE]

                                   [FIGURES 6.1 AND 6.2 ABOUT HERE]



Simulation D: Distribute Aid Using Only Income

          Exhibit 1 describes a radically simplified aid system, encompassing Pell Grants,

subsidized loans, and unsubsidized loans. In this model, which we have mocked up to fit on a

postcard, Pell Grant eligibility is based solely on parents’ adjusted gross income. Subsidized

loan eligibility is a flat $5,000 for all families earning below $75,000, without regard to cost of

attendance or other student resources. Unsubsidized loans could be made available to all

families up to the cost of attendance (with rules similar to the rules for existing parent PLUS

loans).




                                                                                                      28
                                           [EXHIBIT 1 ABOUT HERE]

           This very simple approach explains 75 percent of the variation in current Pell Grants. As

was true in the previous simulation, when we also excluded student earnings, this approach

appears regressive when plotted against EFC but progressive when plotted against AGI (see

Figures 7.1 and 7.2). On average, Pell Grants increase by $53 per student, resulting in a cost

increase of $165 million (5 percent) for dependent undergraduates. Subsidized loan offers

increase by an average of $794, for a total increase of $2.4 billion (30 percent) in loan offers. It

should be noted, however, that as of July 1, 2007 the loan maxima will increase. Relative to the

new caps, this simulation raises loan offers by $1.4 billion (17 percent). It is also worth

reiterating that these loan offers cost taxpayers only a fraction of their face value, since many

students (30 percent) do not even take up their loans and most of the face value of the loan is

repaid with interest.

                                    [FIGURES 7.1 AND 7.2 ABOUT HERE]

           This radically simplified system dismantles many of the behavioral obstacles discussed

earlier. The design is simple enough that families can predict their eligibility for aid well in

advance of their child's high school graduation. It is easy to explain and easy to remember. It

could be proactively mailed to families. In addition, with such limited data requirements, the

entire aid processing system could be rerouted through the tax system, which already collects the

sole determinant of eligibility, adjusted gross income.27




27
     We can treat non-filers the same way the current aid system does, using earnings rather than AGI to assign aid.


                                                                                                                       29
Barriers to Aid Simplification

       Each of the approaches to simplification that we have discussed produces winners and

losers. Losers are inevitable when simplification is constrained by revenue neutrality, as noted

by the Final Report of the President’s Commission on Tax Reform. The only way to simplify and

keep everybody whole is to increase spending.

       Even producing winners can cause political problems. Winners are those whose estimated

ability to pay drops when we shift to a simpler measurement of income. By implication, many

families who do not currently “deserve” aid will get it under a simplified system. Some will

perceive the receipt of aid by such students as fraud, or evasion, or a policy failure. We perceive

it as a cost of simplification, outweighed by the benefits it confers on the vast majority of

students but especially upon the student teetering on the margin of entering college.

       While the political barriers to aid simplification are substantial, the bureaucratic barriers

may be even greater. Over the years, Congress has passed several provisions aimed at

simplifying the aid formula. In 1986, Congress mandated an “automatic zero” EFC for families

with taxable income below $15,000 who are also eligible to file an IRS Form 1040A or 1040EZ.

These applicants can potentially skip more than 50 of the over 70 financial questions on the

FAFSA. Congress also mandated a “simplified needs test” for families earning less than $50,000

who are eligible to file the 1040A or 1040EZ; for these families, asset information can be

disregarded.

       While laudable in intent, these efforts have been ineffectual. As implemented, these

simplifications have had virtually no impact on the aid system as it is experienced by students

and parents. In our sample, just half of applicants from families with income between $5,000

and $15,000 had their applications processed using the automatic-zero EFC or simplified needs



                                                                                                   30
test. Even among the applicants whose FAFSAs were flagged as having received this simplified

treatment, the evidence indicates that the student's application experience was not simplified.

Among those who had their FAFSA processed using the simplified needs test, and who were

eligible to skip the asset questions, 48 percent provided asset information. Among those who

had their application processed under the automatic-zero EFC formula, 90 percent had responded

to questions that they were not required to answer. For example, 63 percent had non-zero

amounts reported in Worksheet A and 30 percent reported non-zero assets.

          In effect, simplification has only made things easier for the computer that processes aid

applications. Simplifications are not communicated to students and their families; they are never

mentioned on the paper FAFSA, used by about half of dependent, undergraduate applicants with

incomes below $50,000.28 Even the online FAFSA only offers the option to skip the relevant

questions mid-application, and then warns that some schools may require that the questions be

answered. This phrasing will frighten many students into filling in the complete application.

          An additional barrier to simplification has been the states, who run their own aid

programs. Thirty-two states have rejected the federal simplifications, requiring the full FAFSA

data from applicants; in these cases, applicants using the web FAFSA never see a window that

allows them to skip questions. This imposes large compliance costs for all applicants in order to

distribute small amounts of aid to a few students. In half of the states, need-based grants average

less than $200 per undergraduate (National Association of State Student Gant and Aid Programs,

2005). By comparison, Pell Grants average $1,100 in our sample of dependent undergraduates.

Conclusion

       There is no doubt that the need-based aid system gets grants and loans to many low-

income families who would be worse off without it. There is little to no evidence that this aid has

the behavioral effect it is intended to have: getting more young people into college. In this

paper, we have proposed both modest and radical simplifications to the aid system that would

preserve its progressive nature while enhancing its positive impact on schooling decisions.

       Our contribution is to use the perspectives of optimal tax theory and behavioral

economics to explore the costs of complexity in financial aid for college. Optimal tax theory

reminds us that compliance costs rightly belong in our cost-benefit calculation when we consider

the efficiency and equity of a given targeting provision. We find that provisions intended to

precisely target aid to those with the lowest ability to pay unintentionally produce regressive

compliance costs. Behavioral economics suggests that minor differences in program design can

have profound impacts upon the equity and efficiency of student aid. We identify multiple

aspects of the aid system that behavioral economics suggest will blunt its impact upon schooling

decisions.

       The basics of need-determination have changed little since they were laid out fifty years

ago. At a College Board conference in 1953, John Monro, then-dean of admissions at Harvard

College, described to his colleagues at other elite colleges the formula he had been using to

distribute aid to Harvard admits. The assembled college administrators were eager to establish a

common formula for assigning aid, so that they could quash the competitive bidding for the best

students that that had recently developed. Within a year, a common aid application was in use

(the Parents’ Confidential Statement) and the new College Scholarship Service (CSS) had been

established by 94 charter members (Duffy and Goldberg, 1998; Wilkinson, 2005).




                                                                                                  32
           Then, as now, Harvard and other elite schools sought exhaustive measures of wealth and

income to tailor their scholarships.29 Today’s FAFSA and aid formula reflect this peculiar

history, providing extremely fine measures of ability to pay at levels of income that far exceed

the effective cutoffs for federal aid. While these distinctions are critical at institutions that

provide need-based grants to families with incomes well above $100,000 (Dynarski, 2004b), we

have shown such fine measures are irrelevant for the distribution of Pell Grants and Stafford

Loans.

           The U.S. system for subsidizing college students buries information about the

affordability of college within a thicket of paperwork. It delays sharing information with

prospective college students about the affordability of college until it is too late. As a result, the

impact of federal student aid remains far below its potential.

     Until 1973, the aid application asked about make and model of the family car (Wilkinson, 2005).

Source: Authors' counts unless otherwise noted. Counts for the FAFSA are for dependent students with
two parents, and includes questions on required student and parent worksheets. Total number of
questions includes subquestions and non-numbered questions, and ensures that items such as name and
address are counted in the same way on both IRS and FAFSA forms.
*For the FAFSA, this excludes items required only to determine dependency status or general eligibility
for federal aid.
**Estimates from official Paperwork Reduction Act notices in the instructions accompanying each
form. IRS-reported estimates of time and cost of preparation are based on non-business filers who self-
prepare without tax preparation software (these estimates can be found in each form's instructions, on
page 78, 58, and 23, respectively). The FAFSA estimate can be found on page 7 of the FAFSA.

SOURCE: Authors' calculations using FAFSA data from NPSAS: 2003-2004. Sample is limited to 15,603
dependent students who attended a single institution full time for the full school year. This excludes
approximately 6% of the sample for whom we could not replicate the EFC and Pell amount within $1,000 using
the EFC formula and complete FAFSA data. All analyses use NPSAS-provided weights (STUDYWT).
*Count refers to the number of questions on the 2003-2004 FAFSA required to elicit the items used in the
simulated needs analysis. For example, eliciting the parents' state of residence requires 3 questions on the FAFSA.
The count does not include questions used only to determine dependency status or questions unrelated to the
calculation of need. The differences between the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 FAFSA described in Table 1 are
minor.

Appendix

Data
        Student aid statistics and simulations are based on restricted-use, individual-level
data from the nationally representative 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid
Survey (NPSAS:04). NPSAS:04 includes data from the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) for 53,025 undergraduate federal aid applicants. We limited our
sample to full-time, dependent undergraduates who attended the same institution for the
full year. 47 percent of aid applicants are dependents, and of these, 61 percent attended a
single institution full time for the full year. This yields an initial sample of 17,064. From
this sample we drop 460 individuals (2.5 percent) who were missing the EFC, family
size, or number of family members in college. We drop 1,001 individuals (6 percent)
whose EFC and Pell awards could not be replicated within $1,000 using the published aid
formulas (described below).

Aid Formulas
         To replicate the student’s EFC, Pell, and subsidized Stafford eligibility, as well as
to test the consequences of formula simplification, we coded EFC, Pell, and Stafford loan
formulas and rules for dependent students as outlined in the 960-page 2003-2004 Federal
Student Aid Handbook.
         The EFC formula sums parents’ adjusted gross income (or W-2 earnings for non-
tax-filers) and other income, subtracts a number of allowances (of which the largest is the
amount of taxes paid), and adds in 12 percent of assets over an asset protection threshold
that depends on marital status and elder parent’s age. Marginal assessment rates from 22
to 47 percent are applied to this total (called parents’ “adjusted available income”). The
result is divided by the number of children in college to obtain the parents’ expected
contribution. The student’s expected contribution is computed by adding student’s
adjusted gross income and other income, subtracting a few allowances, and applying a 50
percent assessment rate. 35 percent of any student assets are added to this figure to yield
the student’s expected contribution (students have no asset protection allowance).
         The Pell award is estimated by subtracting the EFC from the maximum Pell Grant
($4,050). Following federal rules, grants between zero and $199 are rounded down to
zero and grants between $200 and $399 are rounded up to the minimum grant of $400.
Pell Grants over $2,700 are adjusted downwards for students at very low-tuition
institutions (tuition and fees less than $675, in 2003-2004) using what is called the
“tuition sensitivity adjustment.” Pell Grants are also reduced if the calculated amount
exceeds the cost of attendance at the student’s institution (which is provided in NPSAS,
as reported by the schools). In our sample, the tuition sensitivity adjustment applied to
only 35 people and the cost of attendance adjustment applied to none.
         Subsidized Stafford loan eligibility is estimated by subtracting the estimated EFC,
estimated Pell grant, and any other grants from the cost of attendance. The result is
capped at the maximum loan amount for the student’s class level, which in 2003-2004
was $2,625 for first-year students, $3,500 for second-years, and $5,500 for third and
fourth-year dependent undergraduates.

Notes for questions 55–83 (page 5) Step Four: Who is considered a parent in this step?
 Read these notes to determine who is considered a parent on this form. Answer all questions in Step Four about them, even if you do
not live with them. (Note that grandparents, foster parents and legal guardians are not parents.)
 If your parents are living and married to each other, answer the questions about them.
 If your parent is widowed or single, answer the questions about that parent. If your widowed parent is remarried as of today, answer the
questions about that parent and the person whom your parent married (your stepparent).
  If your parents are divorced or separated, answer the questions about the parent you lived with more during the past 12 months. (If you
did not live with one parent more than the other, give answers about the parent who provided more financial support during the past 12
months, or during the most recent year that you actually received support from a parent.) If this parent is remarried as of today, answer
the questions on the rest of this form about that parent and the person whom your parent married (your stepparent).
Notes for question 65 (page 5)
 Include in your parents’ household (see notes, above, for who is considered a parent):
 • your parents and yourself, even if you don’t live with your parents,
 • your parents’ other children if (a) your parents will provide more than half of their support from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, or
   (b) the children could answer “no” to every question in Step Three on page 4 of this form, and
 • other people if they now live with your parents, your parents provide more than half of their support, and your parents will continue to
   provide more than half of their support from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007.

Notes for questions 66 (page 5) and 85 (page 6)
 Always count yourself as a college student. Do not include your parents. Include others only if they will attend, at least half time in
2006-2007, a program that leads to a college degree or certificate.
Notes for question 84 (page 6)
 Include in your (and your spouse’s) household:
 • yourself (and your spouse, if you have one),
 • your children, if you will provide more than half of their support from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, and
 • other people if they now live with you, you provide more than half of their support, and you will continue to provide more than half of
   their support from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007.
Notes for question 98 (page 6)
 For undergraduates, “full time” generally means taking at least 12 credit hours in a term or 24 clock hours per week. “3/4 time”
generally means taking at least 9 credit hours in a term or 18 clock hours per week. “Half time” generally means taking at least 6 credit
hours in a term or 12 clock hours per week. Provide this information about the college you are most likely to attend.

Information on the Privacy Act and use of your Social Security Number
    We use the information that you provide on this form to determine if you are eligible to receive federal student financial aid and the amount that you are eligible to
receive. Sections 483 and 484 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, give us the authority to ask you and your parents these questions, and to collect the Social
Security Numbers of you and your parents. We use your Social Security Number to verify your identity and retrieve your records, and we may request your Social Security
Number again for those purposes.
    State and institutional student financial aid programs may also use the information that you provide on this form to determine if you are eligible to receive state and
institutional aid and the need that you have for such aid. Therefore, we will disclose the information that you provide on this form to each institution you list in questions
86–96, state agencies in your state of legal residence, and the state agencies of the states in which the colleges that you list in questions 86–96 are located.
   If you are applying solely for federal aid, you must answer all of the following questions that apply to you: 1–9, 14–16, 18, 21–22, 25–26, 31–36, 38–45, 48–67, 70–74,
76–85 and 99–100. If you do not answer these questions, you will not receive federal aid.
    Without your consent, we may disclose information that you provide to entities under a published “routine use.” Under such a routine use, we may disclose information to
third parties that we have authorized to assist us in administering the above programs; to other federal agencies under computer matching programs, such as those with the
Internal Revenue Service, Social Security Administration, Selective Service System, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and Veterans Affairs; to your
parents or spouse; and to members of Congress if you ask them to help you with student aid questions.
    If the federal government, the U.S. Department of Education, or an employee of the U.S. Department of Education is involved in litigation, we may send information to
the Department of Justice, or a court or adjudicative body, if the disclosure is related to financial aid and certain conditions are met. In addition, we may send your
information to a foreign, federal, state, or local enforcement agency if the information that you submitted indicates a violation or potential violation of law, for which that
agency has jurisdiction for investigation or prosecution. Finally, we may send information regarding a claim that is determined to be valid and overdue to a consumer
reporting agency. This information includes identifiers from the record; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the program under which the claim arose.
