                                           ABSTRACT

We use nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data linked with

data from multiple secondary sources to study the relationship between access to care among the

uninsured and the local healthcare market and safety net. We find that distances between the

rural uninsured and safety net providers such as hospital emergency rooms, public hospitals,

migrant health centers, public housing primary care programs, and community health centers are

significantly associated with utilization of a variety of healthcare services. In urban areas, we

find that the capacity of the safety net and the pervasiveness and competitiveness of managed

care have a significant relationship with healthcare utilization. Our findings suggest that

facilitating transport to safety net providers and increasing the number of such providers are

likely to improve access to care among the rural uninsured. By contrast, policies oriented toward

enhancing funding for the safety net and increasing the capacity of safety net providers are likely

to be important to ensuring access among the urban uninsured.

I. Introduction

       In 2002, 15.2 percent of Americans—43.6 million individuals—were uninsured for the

full year. While the percentage represents a slight increase over 2001 figures (14.6 percent of the

population, 41.2 million individuals), it is not a significant deviation from recent history: In each

of the last fifteen years, roughly one in seven individuals in the U.S. (between 12.9 and 16.3

percent of the population) have been uninsured (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003). For many of the

uninsured, access to healthcare is heavily dependent on a “safety net” of providers. Such

providers include traditional safety net providers—those who are legally obligated to provide

care to persons who cannot afford it, such as public hospitals, federally funded community health

centers, and local health departments—and mainstream providers—those who provide

uncompensated care voluntarily or as part of their community-service obligation.

       Despite the reliance of the uninsured on safety net providers, little is known about

whether and how differences in the safety net across communities affect access to care among

uninsured. A sole study (Long and Marquis, 1999) reports that uninsured children have more

annual visits to physicians in states with higher safety net capacity. Other studies have

described wide variation in access to medical care among uninsured individuals living in

different communities (Cunningham et al, 1998) and linked differences in access to managed

care penetration and the percent of the local population that is uninsured (Cunningham, 1999),

but these studies have focused on a limited number of communities This study extends previous

research by examining how the structure and capacity of the safety net and healthcare market

structure relate to access to care among the uninsured using nationally representative survey data

(the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, MEPS) linked to multiple secondary data sources.




                                                 3
II. Conceptual Framework and Hypotheses

       For an uninsured person, the out-of-pocket costs of medical care are largely determined

by the costs associated with the time, effort, and stigma of qualifying for discounted or free care

and by the available supply of such care. These variables, in turn, are influenced by

characteristics of safety net providers in the community and certain dimensions of the healthcare

market structure.

       Two aspects of the local safety net are likely to be important determinants of access to

care: Location of safety net providers and safety net capacity. Especially for low income

individuals, the direct and indirect costs associated with travel can strongly influence the

utilization of medical care (Acton, 1977). Specifically, we expect that travel costs increase with

distance and that the farther individuals live from safety net providers, the lower will be

utilization. We also hypothesize that uninsured individuals will be more able to obtain care the

better is the overall ability (including number of patients that can be served and range and type of

services available) of the safety net to provide needed services. Funding availability is a key

determinant of safety net capacity.

       Characteristics of the healthcare market structure other than the safety net are also likely

to affect utilization. Earlier research (Cunningham, 1999; IOM, 2003) suggests that two aspects

of the healthcare market structure—the managed care penetration rate and percentage of the

population that is uninsured—bear on access to care among the uninsured. In particular, we

hypothesize that a greater presence of managed care may limit the ability of providers to set

prices for insured patients that will allow for cross-subsidization of free or discounted care for

the uninsured. However, we also hypothesize that competition among managed care plans may

erode plans’ bargaining power, reducing their control over prices. Thus, in competitive managed




                                                 4
care markets, providers may be able to negotiate higher prices that enable them to subsidize

discounted care for the uninsured. Furthermore, uninsured individuals living in areas where a

relatively large fraction of the population is also uninsured may have to compete for limited

healthcare resources, and thus healthcare utilization may be lower in these areas for any given

uninsured individual. Finally, we expect that access to care among the uninsured is positively

influenced by the local supply of primary care doctors. A more dense distribution of such

doctors is likely to increase the probability that an uninsured individual is able to find a doctor

who provides charity care and is also likely to be associated with more proximate primary care

providers and thus a lower time-price of obtaining care.



III. Data and Methods

Data

       We use data from the MEPS household component (HC) survey linked to data from

numerous sources describing the safety net and healthcare market structure. The MEPS HC is a

nationally representative survey with detailed information on health status and health services

utilization. MEPS uses an overlapping panel design in which respondents are interviewed

multiple times over a 30-month period to collect data spanning a two year period. (Additional

information about the MEPS design is available in Cohen et al. 1996/97).

       To describe the healthcare safety net and market structure in each individual’s location,

we derived variables from numerous sources including the American Hospital Association

(AHA) Annual Survey of Hospitals, Area Resource File (ARF), the InterStudy Regional Market

Analysis database, the Bureau of Primary Healthcare Physicians (BPHC) Uniform Data System,

the Current Population Survey (CPS), Census of Governments, and the Census Bureau’s Annual




                                                  5
Survey of State and Local Government Finances.1 The public-use MEPS files do not contain the

geographic location of individuals (with the exception of region and whether or not the

individual resides in an MSA). However, through an arrangement with the Agency for

Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), we were able to create a limited-use MEPS file that

contains variables measured at more refined geographic levels. A major innovation of this

research is the calculation of distances from specific individuals to various safety net providers.

Study Sample

       Our analysis pools MEPS respondents who were uninsured for at least one full calendar

year during the period from 1996 to 2000. Each observation represents a one year period of an

individual being uninsured; thus, there are two observations for each respondent who was

uninsured during both calendar years in which he/she was surveyed. We exclude from analysis

respondents under the age of 18 or aged 65 or older, as well as individuals who were ineligible

for all or part of the calendar year (such as those who died or were institutionalized during the

year). In total, our data include 12,513 observations of full calendar-year episodes of

uninsurance from 8,285 respondents. There are roughly two to three thousand observations from

each year (1996=2,099, 1997=3,315, 1998=2,340, 1999=2,294, 2000=2,465). All analyses are

run separately for individuals living in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and non-MSAs. We

term the former “urban” uninsured and the latter “rural” uninsured.

Dependent Variables

       We analyze multiple dependent variables measuring different types of healthcare

utilization among the uninsured, including number of office-based physician visits, number of

office-based non-physician visits, total number of office-based visits, number of emergency




                                                 6
room visits, medical expenditures (excluding expenditures for dental or vision care), and

inpatient hospital nights.2 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the dependent variables.

Independent Variables

       All specifications include individual demographic characteristics, health status, and the

key independent variables of interest—those describing the local safety net and healthcare

market. Due to the nature of our data, our ability to characterize the safety net and healthcare

market structure is more limited for rural compared to urban areas. For the rural uninsured, we

control for the availability of safety net providers and the supply of primary care physicians; the

specification for the urban uninsured includes measures of safety net capacity, managed care,

and the percentage of people who are uninsured. Tables 2 and 3 provide descriptive statistics for

individual-level and market level independent variables, respectively.

       Demographic controls include education (high school degree, some college, and college

degree; less than high school omitted), household structure (marital status and whether or not the

individual lives alone), gender, age (18-24 years, 25-34 years, 45-64 years; 35-44 years omitted),

gender-age interactions, race (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic; non-Hispanic white omitted), and

family income as a percentage of the federal poverty line (100-200 percent, 200-400 percent,

over 400 percent; <100 percent omitted).

       We measure health status with variables spanning four domains: (1) functional, cognitive

and social limitations (a single indicator for any such limitation) (2) vision/hearing problems

(single indicator for any such problem, including blindness or deafness), (3) self-rated health

(dichotomous variables for categories very good, good, fair or poor; excellent omitted), and (4)

chronic conditions. We constructed indicators for the presence or absence of 25 chronic

conditions (such as diabetes, obesity, and asthma) and included specific indicator variables for a




                                                 7
subset of those conditions and a summary indicator for the presence of any of the remaining

conditions.

        We account for the location of safety net providers using measures of distances in miles

between each individual and the nearest emergency room and public hospital, which were

calculated using AHA data (which contains hospitals’ exact street address). We also determined

the distance between each individual and the nearest of one of three types of federally funded

health providers—migrant health center, community health center, or public housing primary

care program. These providers all receive funding through the Bureau of Primary Healthcare

(BPHC); for the sake of brevity we will often refer to them as “BPHC providers.” We

approximated individuals’ locations using the population centroid of their zipcode because their

exact address was unavailable. For sensitivity analyses, we created variables indicating the

number of emergency rooms, public hospitals, and BPHC providers within a given distance from

individuals. For the urban uninsured, these radius-based measures are constructed using a 5 mile

radius, and for those living in rural areas, the radius is 10 miles.

        For urban areas, we also measure safety net capacity. We use the level of local

expenditures for health and hospitals based on data from the Census of Governments and the

Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. Examples of public health

expenditures include money spent on public health administration, vital statistics, categorical

health programs (such as for tuberculosis or socially transmitted diseases), health related

inspection and regulation, immunization programs, outpatient health clinics, and alcohol and

drug abuse prevention and rehabilitations. Hospital expenditures are for hospital facilities

directly administered by the government or institutions for the care and treatment of the

handicapped directly administered by the government, or for the provision of hospital care in




                                                   8
other public or private hospitals and support of such hospitals. Expenditures were converted to

1998 dollars using the medical component of the consumer price index and scaled to the low-

income population (within 200 percent of the poverty line) in the MSA using data from the

March CPS.

       For the rural and the urban uninsured, we describe the primary care doctor supply in the

local area with the sum of family practitioners, internists, and general care practitioners per

thousand people in the county (based on ARF data). We further describe the healthcare market in

urban areas with variables indicating managed care penetration (specifically, HMO penetration)

and competition. These variables are derived from InterStudy data. The penetration measure

indicates the percentage of the population in an HMO and the competition measure is one minus

the sum of each HMO’s market share squared. The competition measure ranges from 0 to 1

where a value near 1 indicates a very competitive market and a value near 0 indicates little

competition. Finally, our specification includes the percentage of individuals who are uninsured

in the MSA (data are not available for non-MSAs), which is calculated using a three-year

moving average derived from CPS data.

Estimation

       All regressions were weighted and adjusted for the complex design of the MEPS survey

(Cohen et al, 1996/1997, 1999). We analyze the number of office-based physician and non-

physician visits, total office-based visits, and emergency department visits with a negative

binomial regression model (Keeler et al, 1988; Hausman et al. 1984; Cameron and Trivedi, 1986;

Kilpatrick, 1977). For medical expenditures and inpatient hospital nights, we use a two-part

model of medical care utilization (Blough et al, 1999; Manning et al, 1981, 1987). The first part

is an equation for any use and the second part is an equation for the amount of use conditional on




                                                  9
any use. We use a logistic regression model for the first part. For the second part, we explored a

variety of models (Manning and Mullahy, 2000; Burgess et al, 2002). We ultimately chose to

model conditional medical expenditures using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with the

log of expenditures as the dependent variable and where predictions are calculated using a

heteroskedastic smearing retransformation. (Manning, 1998; Mullahy, 1998; Duan, 1983; Duan

et al, 1983).3 We model conditional inpatient nights using a poisson family (in which the

variance is assumed to be equal to the mean) generalized linear model with a log link.

Simulations

       We simulated values for the various kinds of utilization using standardized predictions.

We performed separate simulations for a range of values of the (rural or urban-specific)

distribution of each of the variables describing the safety net or healthcare market structure.

Rural and urban simulation values are summarized in Table 4. For the negative binomial

regressions, we first obtained parameter estimates using the actual data. We then substituted the

simulation value for the actual value of the simulation variable, while retaining the values of all

other variables, and predicted utilization with the restyled data. Standard errors for the

predictions were calculated using the delta method (Bishop et al, 1975). We used the significance

of the coefficient on the simulation variable to determine the significance of differences among

predictions.

       The simulation process was similar for the two-part models of medical expenditures and

inpatient nights. For these variables, we first estimated the parameters of the two parts of the

model. Second, we substituted the simulation values for actual values of the simulation variables

in both parts of the model and produced predictions. Third, we obtained a prediction of

unconditional use by multiplying the predicted probability of any use and the predicted level of




                                                 10
use conditional on having any use. We used the delta method to derive the standard errors of the

unconditional predictions and for the statistical tests of differences between various predicted

values.



IV. Results

Descriptive Data

          With the exception of inpatient admissions, uninsured individuals living in rural areas

were more likely to have some versus none of each type of utilization (Table 1). However, the

intensity of use conditional on any use was consistently lower among the rural uninsured. In

terms of the safety net, as expected, mean distances between the rural uninsured and the nearest

safety net providers were larger than those for the urban uninsured (Table 3). Our sensitivity

measure of the number of safety net providers within a given radii was also smaller for the rural

compared to the urban uninsured, even considering 10 mile radii for those in rural areas and 5

mile radii for those in urban locales.

Multivariate Analyses

          Tables 5 and 6 show predicted annual utilization among the rural and urban uninsured,

respectively, for simulation values of each of the safety net and healthcare market variables.4 As

an example of how to interpret the values in these tables, the first row of Table 5 indicates that if

all uninsured individuals living in rural areas had an emergency room approximately a mile away

(the 25th percentile value of the distribution), the average number of physician visits would be

1.79. By comparison, if the rural uninsured all lived significantly farther away from the ER (13

miles, the 75th percentile value), physician visits would average 1.61. Tables 7 and 8 report




                                                  11
predictions for sensitivity analyses using radius-based measures of the availability of safety net

providers.



Rural Uninsured

        The analyses of utilization among the rural uninsured provide support for both own-price

and cross-price effects of distances to various safety net providers on utilization. We observe an

own price effect of distance to the closest migrant health center, community health center or

public housing primary care program, with a longer distance resulting in fewer office-based

physician visits and consequently fewer total office-based visits and lower medical expenditures.

The results are consistent with our hypothesis that a higher time-price of obtaining care from a

safety net provider decreases utilization of healthcare among the uninsured. Analyses using the

radius-based measure (number of migrant health centers, community health centers, and public

housing primary care programs within a 10 mile radius) confirm an association between

availability of BPHC providers and physician visits, but also suggest availability is negatively

associated with non-physician visits and, consequently, that availability is not associated with

either total office-based visits or total expenditures.

        We find a cross-price effect of distance to the nearest emergency room on physician visits

(and as a result total office-based visits) and inpatient hospital nights. We observe an inverse

relationship, with closer distances to the ER associated with more physician visits, total office-

based visits, and inpatient hospital nights, suggesting that these services are complementary with

use of the ER. Individuals may follow-up an ER visit with a physician visit, perhaps because an

ER doctor refers a patient to a provider, while a common path to inpatient hospital stays may be

through an ER visit. Surprisingly, while our results show longer distances to the ER are




                                                  12
associated with fewer ER visits, the relationship is not statistically significant. In a sensitivity

analysis, we do find that a greater number of ERs within a 5 mile radius is associated with more

ER visits and greater total expenditures, though the sensitivity analysis does not show a

significant association with other types of utilization. The positive cross-price effect we observe

of distance to the closest public hospital on non-physician visits suggests that the uninsured may

substitute use of the public hospital for non-physician office-based visits. Sensitivity analyses

with radius-based measures of availability of public hospitals lend further support to the finding.

The radius-based results also suggest that more public hospitals within a 10 mile radius decreases

the number of inpatient nights. The finding may reflect a difference in the probability of

admission or length of stay conditional on admission when uninsured individuals seek

admittance at a public versus a non-public hospital.

       Finally, while the main results show no effects of primary care physician supply on

utilization among the rural uninsured, the sensitivity analyses show a negative relationship

between physician supply and ER visits and between physician supply and total expenditures.

The results suggest that a greater physician supply may result in substitution among the

uninsured of office-based for ER visits. But, the association between physician supply and

office-based visits of all types, while positive, is not significant. A caution is that the measure of

supply is a county-level measure which may not adequately capture variation in physician supply

that is relevant to the individual, and especially so in rural areas where counties can be very large

Urban Uninsured

       In contrast to the rural uninsured, we do not find pervasive associations between

distances to safety net providers and healthcare utilization among the urban uninsured. We find

no association between distance to the closest emergency room and any type of utilization, and




                                                  13
associations between other distances to safety net providers and utilization observed in the

continuous distance specifications are not observed when radius-based measures are used.

Moreover, observed associations are sometimes counterintuitive. For example, a greater number

of ERs within 5 miles is associated with fewer ER visits. One possibility is that while distance

is a good proxy for the time-price of obtaining care for the rural uninsured, it may less precisely

capture the true time-price of obtaining care for the urban uninsured because of the effects on

travel time of mass transit systems and traffic (which we are unable to capture with our data).

       However, a key finding for the urban uninsured is the association between the level and

nature of managed care in the local market and utilization among the uninsured. The relationship

appears across numerous types of utilization, including physician visits (the greater is HMO

penetration, the fewer are visits), non-physician visits (the greater is HMO penetration, the more

such visits), inpatient hospital nights (greater penetration associated with fewer nights), and

medical expenditures (greater penetration associated with lower expenditures).      Our results

suggest that greater managed care presence shifts utilization among the uninsured away from

office-based physician visits and inpatient hospital stays and towards non-physician providers.

One possibility is that the uninsured are less able to find charity care from physicians in areas

where managed care limits their ability to set prices for insured patients. However, the

relationship between HMO penetration and the number of physician visits is attenuated by the

competitiveness of the HMO market; specifically, holding HMO penetration constant, higher

competitiveness is associated with more physician visits. In competitive managed care markets,

doctors may be better able to negotiate prices and thus more able to subsidize discounted care for

the uninsured. Corresponding to the findings of fewer (usually costly) inpatient nights, fewer

(relatively expensive) physician visits and a greater number of (less expensive) non-physician




                                                 14
visits in high HMO areas, we find that greater HMO penetration is also associated with lower

expenditures. Average expenditures in a low HMO area are 10.7 percent higher compared to

those in an urban area with a high HMO penetration.

       Other aspects of the healthcare market structure are not completely unrelated to

utilization, but the observed associations occur within a limited realm. First, a greater supply of

primary care doctors is associated with more inpatient hospital nights, which may reflect a

correlation between physician supply and hospital capacity in the urban area (such as number of

hospital beds available). Second, the percentage of the population that is uninsured is inversely

related to emergency room visits. This finding suggests that uninsured individuals living in areas

with many uninsured may compete for limited resources; in particular, emergency room

crowding may be a severe problem in areas with many uninsured (Grumbach et al, 1993; Solberg

et al., 2003). Though not statistically significant, the simulation results suggest a similar story

for physician visits (negative relationship between percent uninsured in the area and average

physician visits).

       A noteworthy finding pertains to the relationship between the safety net and access to

care among the urban uninsured. Thus we find that a greater safety net capacity, as measured by

public health expenditures, is associated with more non-physician visits and higher total medical

expenditures. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that greater safety net capacity

promotes with higher levels of healthcare utilization by the uninsured.



Additional Sensitivity Analyses

       For the urban uninsured, we compared the reported analyses to those omitting the HMO

index of competition and our results were robust to this change. In addition, we included a




                                                 15
measure of the density of the population in the area and also a measure of the distance to the

nearest public hospital or teaching hospital (COTH, or Council of Teaching Hospitals), but

dropped these variables because they consistently showed no association with utilization.



V. Conclusions

       While previous research has documented that the amount of healthcare uninsured

individuals receive varies significantly depending on where they live, little is known about the

factors underlying the differences in healthcare utilization. This study finds that features of the

local healthcare market and safety net explain some of the variation in access to care among the

uninsured, and moreover, that the specific healthcare market and safety net features that are

associated with utilization themselves vary depending on the type of community (urban or rural).

       Specifically, we find that among the rural uninsured, the location of safety net providers

is a key factor related to healthcare use. For the urban uninsured, we confirm and extend earlier

work (Cunningham et al, 1998) reporting lower access to care among the urban uninsured living

in areas where managed care penetration is high. Our study further finds that the influence of

managed care is diminished, and correspondingly levels of health services use among the

uninsured are higher, in more versus less competitive managed care markets. We also find less

use of emergency services among the uninsured living in urban areas where a relatively large

fraction of the population is also uninsured, corroborating recent IOM work on the effects of

uninsurance on communities (IOM, 2003). A novel finding is that greater safety net capacity is

significantly (positively) related to the ability of the uninsured to obtain care in urban areas and

to expenditures for medical care.




                                                 16
       Several limitations of this research should be noted. First, this study analyzed individuals

who were uninsured for a full calendar year. From other research, we know that the population

of uninsured individuals is heterogeneous, with some “chronically” uninsured and some

individuals who quickly transition between insured and uninsured states (Swartz and McBride,

1990; Monheit and Schur, 1988). Whether patterns of utilization differ for these different

groups of uninsured is an open question, as is whether the relationships between features of the

healthcare market and safety net and utilization vary amongst these groups of uninsured.

Methodologically, the calculation of individual-specific distances to safety net providers is an

important contribution of this research. It represents a step in understanding the link between

characteristics of the local community and individual specific outcomes like utilization. But, a

limitation is our ability to capture travel time for the urban uninsured. Distance in miles to

providers may be a reasonable proxy for travel time for the rural uninsured, but it may be less so

for the urban uninsured, where travel times are likely to depend heavily on traffic patterns and

the service areas of mass transit systems.

       A well-developed literature shows that lack of health insurance has substantial

repercussions on both access to healthcare and health status (IOM, 2002). Among the findings

are that, compared to the insured, the uninsured are less likely to visit a physician, have a usual

source of care, or be admitted to a hospital; are more likely to receive care in hospital outpatient

department or emergency room, to have unmet medical needs; and have lower annual medical

expenditures and higher mortality (Cunningham, 1999; Newachek et al, 1998; Marquis and

Long, 1994/95; Hafner-Eaton, 1993; Franks et al, 1993; Spillman, 1992; Weissman et al, 1992 ;

Hadley et al, 1991; Young et al, 1991; Weissman et al, 1989; Lurie et al, 1984).




                                                 17
       Absent the universal provision of health insurance, policy approaches to alleviating the

barriers to access facing the uninsured include incremental efforts to increase the affordability

and availability of public or private health insurance as well as measures to increase the

accessibility of healthcare for the remaining uninsured. Our findings shed light on areas of focus

for the latter class of measures. Specifically, facilitating transport to safety net providers and

increasing the number of such providers are likely to improve access to care among the rural

uninsured. By contrast, policies oriented toward enhancing funding for the safety net and

increasing the capacity of safety net providers are likely to be much more important to ensuring

access among the urban uninsured. Researchers have reported a relatively stable trend in safety

net capacity in the late 1990s through 2001 (Felland et al, 2003), but the absolute level of

capacity has been shown to vary widely across communities (Marquis et al, 2004) and some

research suggests that those disparities may be widening over time (Hoadley et al, 2004). In

addition, increasing budgetary pressures at the federal level and in many states are likely to pose

an increasing threat to safety net funding. The HMO findings suggest that particular attention be

paid to the uninsured living in areas where many of those insured are covered by managed care,

and especially so where little competition among managed care organizations exists. Ironically,

the “backlash” against managed care may result in improved access to care for some uninsured

(Robinson, 2004), although the salutary effects would be offset to the extent that the backlash

also results in increasing healthcare costs, greater numbers of uninsured, and more competition

for healthcare resources.

hospital characteristics on a yearly basis from nearly all 5,000+ hospitals in the U.S. irrespective

of AHA membership, and has a response rate of over 90%.

    Whether or not an uninsured individual had a usual source of care and what that source was

would have been natural other variables to analyze; however, usual source of care was not asked

in every year of the MEPS and the limited data were insufficient for analysis.

    In instances where heteroskedasticity was observed in a continuous variable (such as number of

miles to the closest emergency room), we calculated the smearing estimator separately

according to the quartile of the continuous value.
