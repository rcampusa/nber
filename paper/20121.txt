                                             ABSTRACT

The 2005 split-share reform in China mandated the conversion of nontradable stocks into tradable
status. This paper examines the effects of stock markets on corporate outcomes exploiting multiple
institutional features of the Chinese conversion program. Using a generalized propensity score matching
approach, we identify increases in corporate profitability, investment, value, and productivity as a
result of the reform. We also identify changes in firms’ likelihood to issue shares and engage in mergers,
as well as changes in dividend and capital structure policies. Our findings provide insights on the role
of stock markets in shaping corporate activity and on the impact of regulation on economic growth.

1     Introduction

Firms can issue equity to access external nancing, and evidence shows that funds raised
via primary equity issues (IPOs and SEOs) are used for investment, inventory accumulation,
and R&D spending. It is less clear, however, whether secondary equity transactions  among
market investors  a¤ect rm outcomes. It has long been argued that secondary stock market
transactions are largely a side show to real corporate activity (see, e.g., Bosworth, 1975).
At the same time, there are reasons to believe those transactions might matter. In the pres-
ence of agency problems, for example, secondary stock market transactions are important to
the extent that they allow for changes in corporate control (Stein, 1988; Shleifer and Vishny,
1990). Those transactions might also matter if market prices convey information about rms
prospects (Dow and Gorton, 1997). An active secondary market might also be relevant in
ensuring ex-post liquidity for investors wishing to nance rms in primary markets (Levine,
1991; Bencivenga et al., 1995).
    It is di¢cult to test empirically whether the trading of stocks in public markets a¤ects
corporate activity. For one thing, rms with publicly traded stocks are very di¤erent from
those with private capital. This makes it di¢cult to compare public and private rms for
drawing conclusions about the economic role of stock markets. In addition, rms choose when
they go public, and that choice is confounded with factors such as underlying rm charac-
teristics, prospects, and nancing needs. This makes it di¢cult to compare rms before and
after they go public to learn about the e¤ects of public equity trading. To gauge the e¤ects of
trades that take place in organized exchanges, one would like to compare public rms whose
stocks are traded with similar public rms whose stocks are not traded. While these types
of counterfactuals are rarely observed, recent institutional changes a¤ecting the Chinese stock
market may help us identify the e¤ect of secondary equity trading on real corporate activity.
    Stock ownership in China is divided into three classes: shares reserved for domestic in-
vestors (A-shares), shares available to foreign investors (B-shares), and shares of rms listed
overseas (H-shares, for those listed in Hong Kong). A-shares represent over 90% of the market


                                              1
and were, until recently, split into tradable and non-tradable categories. These share cate-
gories gave their owners identical cash ow and voting rights, yet the vast majority of stocks in
China (over 70% of total shares) could not be traded in the organized exchanges. This unique
structure  the cumulative outcome of past reforms  created a number of di¢culties as Chi-
nese companies expanded their operations in the early 2000s. Central planners acknowledged
the problem and in 2005 put in motion a large-scale reform.
   The split-share reform swiftly converted non-tradable shares into tradable. The reform
started with a pilot trial in May of 2005, with a set of 46 rms selected into conversion. In
September of that same year, the pilot unfolded into a fully-edged program under which all
listed rms were mandated to conclude their conversions by December 2006. In this watershed
event, a sizeable secondary market emerged within a short window dictated by a top-down
governmental program  a far cry from the kinds of endogenous, slow-moving processes in
which equity markets typically evolve.
   The 2005 market reform in China provides a setting in which to identify connections be-
tween public stock markets and corporate outcomes. From a theoretical standpoint, this inter-
vention has numerous potential implications. First, after the reform, the wealth of corporate
stockholders should become more closely tied to stock prices (previously, most stockholders
could not trade their stocks and only cared about dividends). Bolstering an observable mea-
sure of   rm performance  liquid securities priced in the marketplace  could, in turn,
create incentives to improve corporate e¢ciency. Second, the increase in liquidity and depth
of secondary markets should allow rms to raise more capital in primary equity markets, since
investors could now acquire securities that remain liquid after they are issued. As such, the
reform could facilitate corporate funding, investment, and growth, potentially a¤ecting rms
policies concerning capital structure and dividend payout. Finally, by making stocks transfer-
able and liquid, the reform could facilitate corporate merger deals, allowing for a more e¢cient
capital reallocation process and even the replacement of ine¢cient managerial structures.
   This paper gauges the impact of the split-share reform on rms real and nancial outcomes



                                               2
using quasi-experimental strategies. We do so exploiting institutional features of the reform
in conjunction with a time-varying treatment estimation approach that allows us to measure
program e¤ects in the short and long runs. Our ndings on corporate pro ts, investment,
employment, merger activity, valuation, and productivity provide a direct assessment of the
reform from a corporate wealth standpoint. More broadly, they help shed light on the role of
the stock market in the economy.
   We use a couple of di¤erent strategies to evaluate the e¤ects of the split-share reform. First,
we study the e¤ect of equity conversions on the group of rms that participated in the initial
pilot trial. Materials published by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) (the
counterpart of the U.S. SEC) and government-run media describe the criteria used for selecting
 rms into the pilot. We are able to use the same data analyzed by policy-makers  the very
data commissioned by the Chinese government to conduct the reform  to recreate the pilot
using a method of selection on observables. In doing so, we match each rm in the pilot with
a control rm that central planners could plausibly have chosen for their trial. The matching
is based on an extensive set of covariates, including regulatory, geographical, industry, and
 rm characteristics. Under this approach, we estimate a di¤erence-in-di¤erences model that
accounts for rm observables and time- xed unobservable e¤ects to gauge the impact of the
share reform.
   The main limitation of the pilot-based test is that the number of rms examined is small
and could have an idiosyncratic distribution of unobserved characteristics. This makes it dif-
 cult to generalize the ndings of the pilot. One alternative test strategy is to gauge the
impact of the reform on the hundreds of rms that entered the program right after the trial
phase. In addition to the larger number of rms in the treatment group (greater test power),
one advantage of this second approach is the reduced odds that inferences are compromised
by biases arising from selection based on expected outcomes or outcome manipulation by the
government. The disadvantage is that, after the pilot, rms have some degree of discretion
about the timing of program compliance. Moreover, as rms gradually join the reform, it be-



                                                3
comes increasingly di¢cult to identify a control match for each rm that converts its stock (as
time evolves, all rms become part of the treatment group). These challenges are interesting in
their own right and lead us to use an alternative estimation technique that is worth discussing.
   The conversion process required the approval of a super-majority of votes by both tradable
and non-tradable shareholders of the rm. Various reports point to di¢culties in reaching
such a high level of collective agreement, and additional regulatory hurdles (discussed shortly)
added noise to rms conversion timing. Another factor a¤ecting program participation was
the governments desire to promote an orderly conversion process. To avoid downward pres-
sures on stock prices, the CSRC limited the number of rms allowed to convert their shares
at any particular point of the reform window ( rms were subjected to arbitrary, time-varying
weekly conversion quotas). Notwithstanding factors that made it di¢cult for rms to time
the conversion of their shares, one could argue that rms monitored market developments
during the reform process, anticipated the potential e¤ects of share conversion, and optimally
timed their entry into the program.
   Standard xed-e¤ects and di¤erence-in-di¤erences models will not account for rm-speci c
trends or expected outcomes that a¤ect rms decisions to join the reform or the timing of
those decisions. These approaches will also fail to account for the changing economic environ-
ment in China at the time of the reform (with rising stock prices and volatility). Our analysis,
instead, utilizes a multi-valued treatment approach that minimizes concerns about these types
of problems. In particular, we use a Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) estimator (Imbens,
2000; Imai and van Dyk, 2004) that controls for heterogeneity associated with idiosyncratic
time variation (or trends) in outcomes as well as potential expected e¤ects of the reform  the
estimator is designed so as to make these potential confounders orthogonal to the entry date
decision. As we detail below, the GPS estimator uses pre-treatment rm characteristics and
outcome dynamics to create multiple counterfactuals for each rm. These counterfactuals, in
turn, allow one to compare rms that have an equal probability of complying with the program
at a particular point in time, yet enter the program at di¤erent times. Di¤erences in these



                                               4
 rms outcomes reveal the impact of the reform across time.1 Our time-varying treatment
approach not only tackles dynamic self-selection issues but also takes into account that: (1)
 rms spend di¤erent periods of time in the reform window (with earlier compliers spending
more time under the treatment status), (2) the pools of treated and control rms change as the
conversion process evolves (implying time-varying composition e¤ects), and (3) the e¤ect of
the treatment may not be constant over time, especially in a changing economic environment.
       Our estimations suggest that the split-share reform impacted corporate policies and wealth
by bolstering the market for secondary equity transactions. The papers main results can be
summarized as follows. First, we nd that conversions boosted stock liquidity and reduced
ownership concentration. Importantly, we also nd that real corporate activity is signi cantly
a¤ected by the trading reform. As an example, relative to the baseline case of no conversion,
investment in xed assets increased 27% two years after a rms outstanding stocks were al-
lowed to trade. At the same time, stock conversions did not prompt rms to employ more
workers. Following conversions, rms also experienced positive e¤ects on their pro tability,
with net operating revenues growing, on average, 13% more than in the counterfactual case of
non-compliance. Return on equity of complying rms increased up to 1.5 percentage points 18
months after conversion (33% of the sample average). Notably, gains in economic performance
were accompanied by improvements in productivity, as measured by the ratio of sales to cap-
ital. Eighteen months after conversion, sales were 35% higher given the same amount of xed
assets. In the long run, this ratio remained 26% higher than in the case of non-conversion.
       Assessing the impact of the reform even further, we nd that the e¤ect of conversions on
the ratio of market-to-book value of equity was positive and increasing up to two years after
reform compliance. That measure of corporate value almost doubled 24 months after a rms
stock started to trade freely in the organized exchanges, remaining well above the baseline in
the long run. Firms also altered their nancial policies as a result of converting their shares.
In particular, conversions prompted rms to issue more stocks, suggesting they gained greater
   1
    Under this approach, treatment is not de ned as a constant indicator variable (treated versus untreated),
but rather as the number of months since joining the reform (length of treatment exposure).



                                                     5
access to equity nancing (in primary markets) as a result of the greater liquidity in secondary
markets. At the same time, leverage ratios declined steeply following conversions. Finally, as
stocks became more liquid rms seemed to put less emphasis on dividend payments.
   In all, our base tests suggest that the more liquid, deeper market that emerged as a re-
sult of the split-share reform led to signi cant changes in rms real and nancial policies.
To better characterize the mechanism we propose, we then exploit heterogeneity in potential
treatment outcomes associated with the reform. In particular, we examine if rms that poten-
tially had the most to gain from the reform indeed observed the largest responses to the share
conversion process. Looking at pre-conversion distributions of stock liquidity and ownership
concentration, for example, we nd that rms whose stocks were less liquid and more con-
centrated prior to the reform experienced the largest gains in corporate growth, productivity,
pro tability, and value as a result of having their shares becoming tradable. Evidence of these
heterogeneous e¤ects is consistent with our hypothesis about the economic consequences of
the lifting of restrictions on equity trading.
   There are several channels by which the reform-induced increase in stock liquidity could
a¤ect rm outcomes and we investigate various explanations at the end of our analysis. We
 nd that stock prices become more informative following conversion, potentially explaining
the increases in corporate e¢ciency and value that are associated with the reform. A more
liquid stock market should allow rms to more actively engage in merger and acquisition deals,
since stocks can be used to nance these transactions. This is what we nd in the data. We
also examine the e¤ects of stock liquidity on managers. We do not nd evidence that man-
agerial compensation packages and turnover rates changed as a result of conversions. Finally,
we look at various manifestations of agency problems in Chinese rms (e.g., expropriation via
related party transactions and intercorporate loans) and nd weak support for a reduction
in agency costs associated with share conversions.
   There exists a small literature on the 2005 split-share reform in China. As we describe
below, the conversion process involved non-tradable shareholders compensating tradable share-



                                                 6
holders for the right to sell their shares. Bortolotti et al. (2008) document that in 88% of the
conversion agreements tradable shareholders received shares as a main form of compensation
from non-tradable shareholders. Firth et al. (2010) nd that rms owned by the state of-
fered larger compensation packages to non-tradable shareholders than rms owned by private
investors. Li et al. (2011) show that the size of the compensation packages paid to tradable
shareholders was negatively related to the bargaining power of non-tradable shareholders.
While these studies provide important insights on the reform process, they focus exclusively
on the negotiations that characterize the conversion schemes adopted by various rms. To
our knowledge, existing papers abstract from the real-side, long-term implications of the share
reform on corporate outcomes (such as investment, employment, or productivity).
   Our paper relates to a literature that looks at connections between stock markets and
real corporate behavior. Existing papers, however, focus on links between stock prices and
investment spending. Baker et al. (2003), for example, nd that the investment of equity-
dependent rms is more sensitive to stock prices. Chen et al. (2007) show that the sensitivity
of investment to stock prices is increasing in price informativeness. Campello and Graham
(2012) nd that constrained manufacturers increased their investment in response to market
mispricing led by technology rms in the 1990s.
   Finally, a number of studies look at the economic consequences of equity market liberaliza-
tion and our results have clear connections with their ndings (e.g., Levine and Zervos, 1998;
Bekaert et al., 2005; Gupta, 2005; Quinn and Toyoda, 2008). Bekaert et al., for example, use
country-level data from 95 countries to study the e¤ects of the openness of equity markets
to foreign investors. The authors nd that market liberalization initiatives lead, on average,
to a 1% increase in GDP growth. Our paper extends ndings in this literature by exploring
a number of di¤erent dimensions. First, our analysis consists of a rm-level, within-country
examination that builds on well-de ned institutional features of a structural reform. This,
in turn, allows us to describe in detail how economic outcomes are a¤ected by market liber-
alization (e.g., corporate investment, productivity, nancing, and merger activity). Second,



                                               7
market liberalization in our paper refers to market access that is granted to regular domestic
investors, as opposed to sophisticated foreign investors and nancial institutions. In particu-
lar, we gauge the impact of a deregulation initiative that brought into the local equity market
an estimated 25 million new domestic investors. Third, we explore various quasi-experimental
test strategies in dealing with problems of endogeneity and self-selection commonly associated
with observational data. In this way, the approach we use uniquely identi es the mechanisms
through which liberalization a¤ects markets and rms.
    Our inferences are, by design, related to the conditions of one particular economy during
one context-speci c market reform. We believe, however, that the results we report provide
perspective on the role of public stock markets in the economy. In particular, they reveal the
extent to which restrictions on secondary equity transactions can be detrimental to corporate
as well as investor wealth. More broadly, our ndings may help better understand the impact
of governmental interventions and the trend towards capital market liberalization.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the split-share re-
form, explaining the conversion process of non-tradable shares. It also discusses the potential
e¤ects of the reform on rm outcomes. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 details our
identi cation strategy and estimation methodology. Section 5 presents our empirical ndings.
Section 6 concludes the paper.



2     The 2005 Share Reform

2.1    Institutional Background

The recent moves toward market liberalization in China are seen by some observers as an
ex-post x to the unsuccessful reform of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) initiated in 1979.
Since that reform, the pro tability of SOEs declined, with many rms becoming immersed in
debt. With unclear allocation of property rights and onerous social responsibilities (provision
of employment, education, health care, child care, and other bene ts), SOEs had very few


                                               8
incentives to improve their operating e¢ciency (see Bai et al., 2006). By many accounts, the
Chinese government understood this problem.
   In the early 2000s, central planners implemented a series of Share Issue Privatizations
(SIPs) to recapitalize the SOEs. To keep some degree of control over the privatized rms,
the government established share classes based on their relationship with the state, with all
broadly-de ned state-related shares becoming non-tradable in the organized exchanges. Un-
der that arrangement, owners of non-tradable shares could only sell their shares under strict
government control. Sale prices were set by state agencies using accounting information  not
market values  and were set deliberately low to avoid transfers. Even so, the government
retained the ultimate say on any transactions involving those shares. Proposed transactions
had to be submitted in writing, with central and local governments commonly taking months
(sometimes years) before issuing a decision.
   While non-tradable and tradable shares had the same voting and cash ow rights, non-
tradable shares accounted for about two-thirds of all shares. Cross- rm variation in the pro-
portion of these share classes was determined according to interests within an intricate web
of bureaucracies, including central-government asset management committees, central nance
and industry ministries, local governments (various layers), and local-government asset man-
agement committees. All of these parties retained some power in determining which shares
would be deemed as state-related.
   A myriad of conicting forces determined the assignment of rms stock tradability status
during the privatization process. Not surprisingly, rms came out of that process displaying
a wide degree of variation in the proportion of non-tradable shares in their books. Figure
1 shows a histogram of the proportion of non-tradable stocks across A-share rms listed at
the end of 2004. Out of 1,378 rms, 1,350 (or 98%) had anywhere between 20% and 80% of
their stocks under the non-tradable category. A feature of those original tradability assign-
ments is that they could not be easily changed. In fact, rms were expected to maintain the
proportional tradability status of their stocks going forward. Among other hurdles, multiple



                                               9
layers of government had a say over issuance of new shares that could be intended to alter the
proportion of tradable and non-tradable shares in a rm. Evidence suggests that markets had
reacted negatively to past issuance programs that could alter the proportion of tradable and
non-tradable stocks (see Inoue, 2005) and tradable shareholders had been able to block large
programs since these required a high level of shareholder approval.


                                  Figure 1 About Here


   Research shows that the split-share structure created a number of governance problems
(see Claessens et al., 2002; Fan and Wong, 2002; Song and Tong, 2004). The majority of listed
 rms remained under the control of holders of non-tradable shares. Since the wealth of these
shareholders was largely insulated from changes in stock market prices, conicts between con-
trolling and minority (tradable) shareholders quickly emerged. In its worst form, non-tradable
shareholders sought to tunnel resources (often through related party transactions) out of the
listed rms at the expense of tradable shareholders (Cheung et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2008).
As top managers and directors of SOEs were often appointed by the state, political career con-
cerns and entrenchment led to an ine¢cient corporate governance system. The predominance
of non-tradable shares further made the market for corporate control virtually inexistent in
China. Tradable shareholders, in turn, became largely short-term investors. They were not
interested in participating in rm management and reluctant to provide the liquidity depth
 rms would want in the equity markets (Tenev et al., 2002).


2.2    The Timeline of the Reform

By early 2005 it was clear that the split-share structure created an illiquid stock market, with
the better Chinese companies choosing to list abroad. The issue came to the forefront of eco-
nomic policy on April 29, when the CSRC issued a document titled Circular on Issues Related




                                              10
to the Pilot Program of Non-Tradable Share Reform in Listed Companies.2 Within days, the
Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange issued the circular Operation
Instruction on Pilot Program of Non-Tradable Share Reform in Listed Companies, which
formally launched a far-reaching reform of the existing share ownership system. A rst batch
of pilot rms was announced on May 9 including four rms. On June 20, a nal batch of 42
companies was added to the pilot program.
    On September 4, the CSRC issued Administrative Measures on the Split Share Structure
Reform in Listed Companies, a document determining that the conversion of non-tradable
shares into tradable shares should be adopted by all A-share rms by December 2006. By the
end of 2005, 434 companies had complied with the reform, accounting for 37% of the total
market capitalization and 32% of listed rms at that time. About half of the listed rms
joined the reform by the rst semester of 2006. Only 2% of the rms failed to comply by the
December 2006 (most of those complied in January 2007). Figure 2 shows the number of rms
complying with the program over time.
    The pilot rms had to start their share conversion process immediately after the govern-
ment announced their selection. Materials published by the CSRC and government-run media
provide the guidelines used by central planners for selecting rms in to the pilot program. The
criteria used for selection considered four general rm attributes: pro tability, representative-
ness, geographic location, and industry of operation.
    In short, according to the governments guidelines, a pro table rm should be able to af-
ford a conversion proposal with a relatively high compensation package (explained shortly),
making it easier to receive the approval of tradable shareholders. Given that stock prices in
China were at the time hardly informative about rm performance, o¢cials measured rm
pro tability based on accounting gures, such as operating cash ows and return on equity.
Representativeness was associated with characteristics such as rm size and history (i.e., the
   2
     The directive was issued Friday night before a prolonged May 1st holiday and was interpreted by
newspapers at the time as a signal that the Chinese government intended to push the reform without
consulting companies, investors, or the organized exchanges. Peoples Daily (equivalent to Russias Soviet-era
Pravda) quotes the chairman of the CSRC as saying the following about the reform: An arrow that has left
the bow can never be taken back.

                                                     11
largest rm in a particular province, or the best-known company in an industry). Central
planners emphasized a balance in the ownership structure of the pilot rms. Accordingly,
among the batch of 46 pilot rms, 22 were private rms and 24 were SOEs. The government
also wanted to have the reform spread across various provinces from the start, avoiding a con-
centration in the large provinces (geographical balance). Accordingly, 17 of the 31 Chinese
provinces had rms selected into the pilot. Finally, the government had a preference for rms
in competitive industries, since concentrated industries were often associated with national
interests or state monopolies.
   All of the above selection criteria can be observed using publicly available data. Indeed, as
we explain below, we are able to conduct our analysis using information from the same data
provider that was commissioned by the Chinese government to implement the reform. One of
our tests builds on a matching-based strategy in which we identify a set of control rms that
planners could plausibly have chosen for the pilot trial.


2.3    Steps of the Conversion Process

Share conversions involved non-tradable shareholders proposing a compensation package to
tradable shareholders. These packages included cash, warrants, and most frequently, ad-
ditional shares. Only holders of A-shares participated in these negotiations, thus excluding
foreign investors. A typical conversion agreement worked as follows. The rm would announce
the start of negotiations on its conversion plan. Afterwards, representatives of non-tradable
shareholders would propose a compensation plan to the tradable shareholders. In case the par-
ties agreed, the board would make an announcement on the plan within a few weeks. It would
take about a week to register the plan and another one to two weeks to bring the plan to a vote
by all shareholders. If the plan was voted favorably by tradable and non-tradable shareholders,
it was formally approved. Payments to tradable shareholders were made a few days following
the vote. Afterwards, a lock-up period applied under which non-tradable shareholders could




                                              12
not immediately sell all of their shares at once.3
      Although the conversion protocol was relatively straightforward, reaching agreements on
conversions was notoriously di¢cult (see, e.g., Xiong and Yu, 2011; Firth at al., 2010). A
main reason was the CSRCs requirement that conversions had to be agreed upon by a super-
majority (two-thirds) of both tradable and non-tradable shareholders. More often than not,
there were disagreements between (and within) the two classes of shareholders regarding dif-
ferent steps of the conversion process. From an identi cation standpoint, the upshot of this
institutional feature is the noise that is added to the rms conversion timing. Another feature
of the reform that added extraneous noise to compliance timing was the fact that the CSRC
arbitrarily limited the number of rms getting approval to convert their shares at any partic-
ular point in time. Central planners feared a scenario in which stock prices would plummet if
too many rms converted their shares at once. To avoid this situation, they imposed caps on
the number of conversions, precluding rms from converting their shares at will. Speci cally,
before voting on a conversion plan, rms had to wait for their petition to be selected into
CSRCs approval lists. These lists were issued on a weekly basis and limited the number
of converting rms to about twenty per week (down to eight per week later in the reform).
Finally, calling for a vote on conversion but failing to pass it implied a cooling o¤ period of
at least three months before another vote could be called.
      In sum, various institutional elements of the reform made it di¢cult for rms to optimally
time the conversion of their shares. Additional evidence further suggests that shareholders
were unsure about the outcomes they should bargain over, making negotiations often unpre-
dictable. Indeed, the initial market reaction to the pilot program was ambiguous so it was
not clear that rms should jump into the program (see Inoue, 2005). These features of our
setting are helpful in minimizing worries about endogenous biases in our tests (in particular,
self-selection). Even so, as we explain in Section 4, we explicitly tackle potential sources of
endogeneity in our experiment.
  3
   For example, the combined sales of shares by non-tradable shareholders could not exceed 10% of the
 rms total shares within a certain number of months.



                                                 13
2.4    Share Conversions and Aggregate Stock Market Liquidity

Our empirical strategy takes advantage of the conversion program just described to look for
e¤ects of stock liquidity on rm outcomes. The working hypothesis is that share conversions
increased liquidity in secondary markets. We provide broad evidence in support of this hy-
pothesis in Figure 2, where we superimpose the time line of corporate compliance with the
conversion program (solid line) and stock market turnover (dashed line). We compute market
turnover as a 12-month moving average of the ratio of the number of shares traded on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange over the total number of shares outstanding. Inspection of Figure
2 suggests that stock turnover in the Chinese equity markets moved in tandem with rm
adherence to the share reform program. Indeed, the gure suggests that overall market liq-
uidity increased nearly three-fold from April 2005 to December 2006. Later in the analysis,
we perform detailed, rm-level estimations considering di¤erent measures of liquidity. These
estimations also show that the split-share reform lead to a sharp increase in stock liquidity.

2.5    Potential E¤ects of the Reform

The 2005 reform was designed to boost liquidity in Chinese organized stock exchanges. Gov-
ernment planners alluded  often vaguely  to easier access to capital and increases in rm
e¢ciency as likely consequences of the reform. In this section, we lay out a set of priors con-
cerning the potential consequences of the split-share reform and describe the outcome variables
we analyze in our tests (implementation details are provided in the next section).
   We hypothesize that corporate shares would become more liquid after conversion into trad-
able status. Accordingly, we consider increases in stock liquidity as a primary indicator of the
e¤ects of the reform. Liquidity may also ease rms access to external nance by enhancing
the price discovery process and reducing information asymmetries between managers and in-
vestors (Myers and Majluf, 1984). Moreover, access to primary equity markets  IPO and


                                              14
SEO activities  might be facilitated when investors expect to be able to resell their stocks
at a later date if they wish. With these priors in mind, we expect rms to issue equity more
actively after their shares become tradable.
       One could expect rms to improve their performance under better incentives and more
exible nancing opportunities potentially generated by the 2005 reform.4 Enhanced liquid-
ity brought about by the reform could also lower the cost of equity and broaden the pool of
feasible investments (Bekaert and Harvey, 2000; Amihud and Mendelson, 1988). Focusing on
real-side e¤ects of the reform, our empirical analysis considers measures of rm investment,
pro tability, productivity, and value as outcome variables. These are standard measures of
performance in corporate nance, and if the share reform was relevant these variables should
plausibly respond to the conversion process. We also look at employment as one of our real
outcome variables. Given the characteristics of the labor market in China, one would expect
 rms to lay o¤ workers after a reform that moves them closer to market-oriented objectives.
Notably, however,       rms had already implemented large lay o¤ programs in the late 1990s
(Sun and Tong, 2004). This makes it hard to predict the e¤ect of the reform on employment.
Yet, we measure the reforms impact on employment demand as an additional way to gauge
potential links between the stock markets and the real economy.
       While our estimations focus primarily on the e¤ect of the reform on real-side activities,
it is also important to look at rms nancial policies and related variables. These outcomes
are interesting in their own right, but also help us understand the mechanisms through which
equity markets a¤ect corporate activity.
       Historically, owners of non-tradable shares could only bene t from their holdings via div-
idend payments. The reform, however, could change the preferences of those investors. In
particular, after shares become tradable, all shareholders would be able to pro t from capital
gains. As a result, rms could place relatively less emphasis on dividend payments  which
were more heavily taxed  as a way to reward investors.5 In addition to equity issuance, we
   4
     Evidence consistent with these priors following previous market-oriented reforms in China can be found,
for example, in Chang and Wong (2004).
   5
     As of 2005, dividends were taxed as ordinary income at a 20% rate, while capital gains were not taxed.


                                                    15
assess changes in rms nancial policies by looking at their dividend payments. Moreover, we
study whether greater access to equity nancing has implications for capital structure policy
by looking at changes in leverage ratios.
   In China, conicts of interests between minority (tradable) and majority (non-tradable)
shareholders are known to be associated with mismanagement and even fraud. These problems
became acute in recent years, with minority shareholder expropriation conducted primarily by
way of related party transactions and intercorporate loans.6 We measure the incidence of
these fraud-laden transactions in rms converting their shares to see if market liquidity has
an impact on these activities. To the extent that market prices might more quickly respond
to expropriation and fraudulent activities by corporate controllers after stocks become liquid,
we would expect to see a decline in those transactions following share conversions. Another
mechanism through which existing governance structures could change is via the replacement
of corporate managers. Accordingly, we also examine the frequency with which rms replace
their CEOs after shares are traded in secondary markets. We also consider the e¤ects of
the reform on managerial incentives by looking at changes in CEO stock-based compensation
following conversions.
   Finally, one could conjecture that the ability to freely trade shares could boost the market
for corporate mergers. Newly-converted shares could even be used as a currency to acquire
other rms. Accordingly, a potential outcome of the reform is an increase in the number of
 rms engaging in M&As after converting their shares. Our investigation thus also looks at
corporate mergers and the use of stocks in nancing those transactions.
    6
      Deng et al. (2008) report that 90% of the SOEs that went public between 1997 and 2000 were later
involved in disadvantageous transactions with their parent rms. Those transactions averaged 13% of the
listed rms assets.

3         Data

3.1        Data Sources and Sampling

Our raw dataset comprises all A-share companies listed in the Chinese public exchanges at the
end of 2004. We exclude companies with B-/H-shares, ST/PT status,7 and companies with
previous fraud-related court cases as indicated by the CSRC. That is, we exclude companies
that were ineligible for stock conversion according to the CSRCs reform principles. We also
exclude nancial rms. Data on the share reform come from WIND Financial Information
Systems, which was commissioned by the CSRC to conduct the 2005 conversion program. The
advantage of using this dataset is that of ensuring that the econometrician and the policy-
maker use the same information. All accounting and stock price information is from Shenzhen
GTA Inc. We also manually collect data from companies annual reports if they are missing
from commercial databases. Our nal sample has 1,054 rms, representing over 80% of the
A-share rms. Our tests use detailed data for these rms from the rst quarter of 2002 through
the last quarter of 2009.


3.2        Variable Construction

We consider an extensive list of real and nancial outcomes in our analysis. We use the growth
in the log of a rms xed assets (K) to measure capital investment. To measure employment
growth, we use changes in the log number of employees (L). We use the log ratio of sales
over xed capital (Sales=K) as a measure of productivity. The log ratio of operating revenue
over operating expenses (N etIncome) and return on equity (ROE) are used as measures of
 rm pro tability. We use the market-to-book equity ratio (M=B) to gauge market valuation.
        We study a number of nancial outcomes associated with the reform. We rst look at
stock liquidity, since this is central to our identi cation. Our benchmark measure of liquidity
    7
    A rm is designated as a special treatment (ST) rm if it reports a net loss for two consecutive years.
A rm is designated a particular transfer (PT) rm if it su¤ers a net loss for three consecutive years (PT
entails virtual suspension from trading).



                                                    17
is the liquidity ratio (LiqRatio). This standard measure is computed on a monthly basis and
is de ned as the sum of daily trading volume divided by the sum of the absolute value of
daily return. The liquidity ratio measures the trading volume in dollars associated with a one
percent change in stock price, and is thus a proxy for market depth (cf. Amihud et al., 1997).
An alternative measure of liquidity is share turnover (ShareT urnover), de ned as the log
ratio of the number of shares traded divided by the number of shares outstanding. For each
of these two measures, we obtain data from 2002 to 2009. We also look at rms issuance and
dividend policies. To measure equity issuance (Issuance), we collect data on issuance activity
(including SEOs and rights o¤erings) from 2002 to 2009. Firm capital structure is assessed
through the debt-to-asset ratio (Leverage). Firm dividend policy is examined through the
ratio of cash dividends over net income (Dividend).
   We consider a number of additional outcomes that help us characterize the e¤ect of the
reform. While we detail the computation of those outcomes later in the analysis, one line of
inquiry we pursue is whether prices become more informative after stocks become tradable.
On that front, we use a proxy for price informativeness that is based on the synchronicity
of a rms stock returns and the returns on the aggregate market (PriceInfo). Relatedly,
we also measure the number of individuals trading on the rms stock (ShareHolders). In
addition, we consider proxies for managerial incentives and agency problems. On that di-
mension, we examine the e¤ect of the reform on the proportion of shares owned by the top
managers (M anagerShares) and whether rms replace their CEOs (CEOT urnover). We use
the Her ndahl index of top 5 shareholders (OwnerConcent) to gauge ownership concentra-
tion. Furthermore, we investigate activities that are known to be associated with shareholder
expropriation in China. In particular, we look at rms accounting statements and identify
related party transactions (RP T s) and intercorporate loans (InterLoans). Finally, we
measure the impact of the reform on rms propensity to initiate merger and acquisition deals
(M &A), and further examine if those deals were nanced by  now tradable  stocks.
   Besides the outcomes described above, we use a comprehensive set of control variables in



                                             18
our matching procedures. Regarding ownership structure, we account for the proportion of
non-tradable shares (N onT radable), the log of number of shares (Shares), whether a rm
is ultimately controlled by the state (StateControl), the proportion of shares owned by the
State (StateShares), and the proportion of shares held by institutions (InstShares). Other
 rm characteristics include age (Age), the log of total assets (Assets), the log of total sales
(Sales), the ratio of cash ow over assets (CF=Assets), the ratio of xed assets over number
of employees (K=L), bank loans over assets (Loans), and cash-to-assets ratio (Cash). Two
forward looking variables we use in our matching are the price-earnings ratio (P=E) and the
market-to-book asset ratio (q). The importance of rms in their industry and region is prox-
ied by the ratio of rm sales over industry sales (IndRep) and the ratio of rm sales over
provincial GDP (P rovRep). Additionally, we include characteristics associated with rms
geographical location, such as the log per capita GDP of the province in which the rm is
established (P rovGDP ), the log of industry sales (IndSales), and the industry concentration
index (IndConcent). Since the CSRC required rms to reduce their intercorporate loans prior
to the reform, we also use this variable (InterLoans) as a matching covariate.

3.3    Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics for our sample rms in 2004 are presented in Table 2. Column 1 (full sam-
ple) indicates that rms had, on average, nine years of operation under their current charter
(recall most were privatized in the 1990s). Sixty-two percent of their shares were non-tradable
in 2004 and 37% of shares were owned by the state. Firms seemed to be pro table (average
ROE of 4.5%) and with positive prospects (average M=B of 2.1). These and other summary
statistics are similar to those found in contemporary papers on Chinese rms (e.g., Li et al.,
2011; Jiang et al., 2010). We omit their discussion for brevity.
   Following the schedule of the reform process, we divide our sample into three groups: (1)


                                              19
pilot group includes 43 non- nancial rms in the May/June-2005 pilot program; (2) com-
plying before June 2006 comprises 821 non-pilot rms that converted their shares at or before
June 2006; and (3) complying after June 2006 comprises 190 rms that converted their shares
after June 2006. We detail shortly how our binary-treatment tests use these groups of rms.


                                   Table 2 About Here


    Table 2 suggests that pilot rms, as well as rms that converted their shares up to June
2006, are di¤erent from rms that joined the reform later for most observables as of 2004,
before the reform was announced. In fact, rms that complied with the reform earlier were,
among other things, bigger, more pro table, more productive, and they had more concen-
trated ownership. Moreover, these rms had grown faster than those that joined the reform
later. These di¤erences suggest that the timing of the reform compliance might be related not
only to the expected outcomes but also to their variation after conversion. Accordingly, it is
important to control for pre-treatment characteristics that might be related to both treatment
assignment and potential outcome variation. The next section presents our quasi-experimental
identi cation strategy. It adjusts our estimates for pre-treatment di¤erences in covariate and
outcome dynamics to obtain causal parameters.



4     Estimation Strategy and Methodology

We set out to estimate the e¤ects of the 2005 reform. Our goal is to compare outcomes that
accrue to rms that join the reform (at the time they join it) to the counterfactual situation of
not joining the reform or joining it at a di¤erent time. This section discusses the assumptions
we make to implement our quasi-experimental strategy.




                                              20
4.1       Strategy

Even though all A-share rms were forced to change their share structure, they did not comply
with the reform all at the same time. This is interesting for identi cation of causal e¤ects
in that, for each point in time, one can compare rms that have already joined the reform
with rms that have yet to do so. One must take into account, however, that the timing of
compliance might be endogenous. Firms could potentially choose when to join the conversion
process based on expected outcomes. Another potential concern is that idiosyncratic dynamics
in rm outcomes could confound inferences, leading one to assign causation to trend e¤ects
that coincide with reform compliance. As we detail in this section, we use a di¤erence-in-
di¤erence model combined with a time-varying propensity score matching estimator to address
these issues. Before doing so, it is worth providing intuition for our estimation problem and
methodology.
       In our setting, comparisons between treated and untreated rms can only be made for a
limited period. In particular, because rms gradually join the reform, the number of untreated
 rms decreases as we advance in the treatment window. Moreover, the treated group gradually
comprises rms with di¤erent time exposures to the reform (di¤erent treatment dosages).
If the e¤ect of the reform is not constant over time, it can be di¢cult to interpret any em-
pirical estimate due to the composition of the treated group. Accordingly, for our estimations
the treatment assignment is de ned according to the date when the rm joins the reform.8
The treatment spell is the length between the date when the rm joins the reform and the

date when the e¤ect is assessed. To calculate the average e¤ect of the reform, we estimate
a dose-response function that maps treatment spells into potential outcomes. Under this ap-
proach, the di¤erence between two points along the dose-response function measures the e¤ect
of complying with the reform in a speci c period vis-à-vis complying in a later period.
       The dose-response function is estimated using a panel model that accounts for rm- and
time-speci c e¤ects. Despite these controls, time-varying heterogeneity in outcome dynamics
   8
    The only exception is the analysis of rms in the pilot program. This is a one-time experiment where we use
the standard being in the reform (treated) versus not being in the reform (untreated) comparison approach.


                                                     21
and potential e¤ects can still be a source of endogeneity  they may inuence the timing of
program compliance and observed outcomes. We need to control for this source of bias by
making the entry date orthogonal to these time-varying e¤ects. We do so using large sets of
covariates under a Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) function. The GPS function gives, for
each rm, the probability of joining the reform at a particular point in time conditional on the
distribution of pre-treatment covariates and outcomes. After we control for the GPS, along
with rm- and time-speci c e¤ects, we can hypothesize that, for each point in time within
the reform window, a rms decision to convert its shares is a conditionally random event.
The role of the GPS is that of identifying and comparing matched rms that did not join the
reform at the same point in time, despite having similar odds of doing so. We formalize the
steps used in the implementation of the GPS approach shortly.
   In the remainder of this section we introduce the notation used in our time-varying treat-
ment e¤ect estimation. We then discuss the assumptions required to estimate the e¤ects of the
reform on rms outcomes, as well as the role of the GPS. The third part presents the empir-
ical method used to estimate the e¤ect on pilot rms. The last part presents the econometric
model used to estimate the dose-response function of non-pilot rms.


4.2    Notation

Let Yit = fYit (d) jd 2 Dg be the set of potential outcomes of rm i 2 f1; : : : ; N g at time

t 2 f0; : : : ; T g, where D = f1; 2; : : : ; Kg is the set of potential treatment values, and Yit (d)
is an ordinary variable (or vector) that maps a particular treatment, d 2 D, to a potential
outcome. In this time-varying treatment setting, d indicates when the rm may join the re-
form. For instance, d = 1 if the rm were treated since the rst period after the reform was
announced, whereas d = K if the rm joined the reform in the last period. Accordingly, a
greater d indicates less exposure to the treatment. This notation is di¤erent from the standard
treatment-e¤ects framework notation, where d = 0 in the absence of treatment and d > 0 for
some type of treatment. The notation is useful, however, in cases of time-varying treatment as-


                                                 22
signment, when the appropriate comparison is not whether one is treated but when treatment
occurs (see Brand and Xie, 2007).
   While d is the ordinary variable that indicates a potential treatment level, Di 2 D is the
random variable that indicates the actual treatment received by rm i. It is worth stressing
the di¤erence between d and Di which indicate, respectively, when the rm may be treated
and when it is factually treated. Finally, note that t refers to the period when the outcome is
assessed.
   We can simplify the notation by dropping the i subscript, letting Yit = Yt , Yit (d) = Ytd ,
and Di = D. Then each rm has a set of potential outcomes, as presented in Table 3. The
e¤ect of the reform is given by comparisons between di¤erent cells in the same column. For
example, at period T (column T ), YT2   YTT is the e¤ect of being in the reform for T   2 months
with respect to joining the reform in period T . It is worth noting that the outcomes under the
diagonal of the table (shadowed area) represent situations when the rm has not yet joined
the reform. In a more general framework, it is also important to distinguish these pre-reform
outcomes because they allow us to assess possible anticipation e¤ects (more on this below).


                                    Table 3 About Here


   Given the full set of potential outcomes, the average treatment e¤ect (ATE) and aver-
age treatment e¤ect on the treated (ATT) at period t are de ned as the expected di¤erences
between two potential outcomes (Heckman and Vytlacil, 2007):

                                               h         0
                                                           i
                            AT E :  t;k;k0  E Ytk   Ytk ;                                  (1)
                                               h         0
                                                               i
                            AT T : t;k;k0  E Ytk     Ytk D = k :                            (2)


In particular, the ATE parameter represents the expected e¤ect of randomly taking some rm
from the overall population of rms and forcing it to join the reform program at date k instead
of date k 0 . The ATT parameter represents the mean e¤ect of joining the reform at date k


                                              23
instead of k 0 on those rms that have actually complied with the reform at k.
      As the potential treatment starting time, d, can assume many values, it is di¢cult to obtain
an average estimate for each potential outcome (or each cell in Table 3).9 For this reason, Im-
bens (2000) and Hirano and Imbens (2004) consider what is called the dose-response function,
which in our case can be represented by:

                                               
                                    t (d) = E Ytd , with d 2 D:                                     (3)


Then the ATE parameter can be de ned as follows:

                                   h              0
                                                      i
                                  E Ytk     Ytk           = t (k)   t (k 0 ) :                     (4)


Similarly, we can de ne the ATT parameter as follows:

                        h           0

where t (d; D = k) = E Ytd D = k is the conditional dose-response function.
      The left graph in Figure 3 gives us an example of ATE calculated from a dose-response
function. For outcome evaluation at time t, we compare two points on this function. The
 rst point is the expected outcome at t if the rm joined the reform at the early date k.
The second point is the expected outcome at t if the rm joined the reform later, at date k 0 .
Since t (k) > t (k 0 ), the e¤ect of being under treatment for a longer period is positive in this
example. Note also that this hypothetical function is constant beyond t. This means that at
time t the reform has no e¤ect on rms that have not yet joined it.

    In our application, for example, non-pilot rms can comply with the reform at point in time during the
Sept. 2005 to Dec. 2006 window.

   To go from the multi-valued-treatment framework to a binary-treatment framework and
apply approaches commonly used in the treatment e¤ect literature, we have to assume that
the dose-response function is locally constant. Namely, the response at period t is assumed
to be constant if treatment was given up to some period k and after another period k 0 , with
k 0 > k. In practical terms, it implies that parameters (1) and (2) can be rewritten as:

                                             h                0
                                                                i
                                  t;k;k0 = E Ytdk      Ytdk ;                                       (6)
                                             h                 0
                                                                       i
                                                dk
                                   t;k;k0 = E Yt         Ytdk     Dk :                               (7)


The right graph in Figure 3 depicts the implication of the local constancy assumption. In cal-
culating the ATE, one would (separately) average the points along the dose-response function
up to k, and those beyond k 0 . One would then take the di¤erence between these two averages.
   With the basic notation in place, we can easily map our methods and empirical setting. In
our tests the threshold k is set to be June 2005, which corresponds to the pilot period. The
threshold for the control group, k 0 , is July 2006. This is to say that we extract our counter-
factuals from a pool of rms that had yet to join the reform as of June 2006. This threshold
is set so as to allow for sensible outcome comparisons between treated and control units; that
is, exposure to treatment is su¢ciently di¤erent to produce measurable potential e¤ects. Note
that if k and k 0 were too close, then one could end up comparing treatment e¤ects across
units that receive treatment almost at the same time. More concretely, if we would set k 0 in
January 2006, then our treatmentcontrol comparisons would be contrasting the behavior of
 rms complying with the reform in December 2005 (treated) and those complying in January
2006 (control). The outcomes of those rms would likely be indistinguishable at the treatment
evaluation time t, say, December 2006.10
   The baseline period, t0 , is December 2004, well before the reform was publicly discussed.
We use the following treatment evaluation assessment dates, t: December 2005, December
  10
     To check the robustness of our ndings, we have experimented with di¤erent values for k 0 . Our results
are qualitatively similar even when we set it in January 2006.

2006, and December 2007. According to this evaluation schedule, in December 2005 we assess
the short-run e¤ects of the program on rms between 6 and 7 months in the reform. In De-
cember 2006, we compare rms with 18-19 months in the program with similar rms between
0 and 5 months in the program. This allows us to gauge the existence of medium-run e¤ects.
Finally, in December 2007, we compare rms with 30-31 months in the reform with rms
between 12 and 17 months in the reform to assess longer-term e¤ects. As a falsi cation test,
we also estimate the treatment e¤ect by setting December 2003 as the baseline period, t0 , and
December 2004 as the assessment period, t. That is, we estimate the treatment e¤ect before
the share reform takes place.


4.3     Identi cation Assumption and the Role of GPS

The fundamental evaluation problem is a missing data problem. In our setting, we cannot
observe two or more potential outcomes given by di¤erent compliance dates for the same rm
                                               0
 if we observe Ytk , we cannot observe Ytk for the same rm. If D = k, the set of miss-
ing counterfactual outcomes, Yt n Ytk , must be estimated in order to obtain an estimate for
parameters (1) and (2).
   A standard assumption we rst consider is Imbens (2000) weak conditional independence
assumption, also known as Rubins (1976) missing at random assumption. It implies that,
conditional on pre-determined covariates X0 , assignment to treatment D is independent from
the potential outcome given by D, Ytd=D . The assumption can be stated as:


                                        1 (D = d) ? Ytd X0 ;


for each pair d 2 D and t 2 f0; : : : ; T g.
   Although this assumption guarantees identi cation when the treatment assignment is based
on observables, it requires that the potential outcome Ytd is (conditionally) unrelated to the
probability of D being equal to d. That is, rms did not take the time d-speci c outcome into
account when they decided for treatment at d. This condition is strong and might be violated

                                                   26
in the data. The estimation approach used for cases in which the treatment can be inuenced
by potential outcomes (due to unobserved heterogeneity) is the di¤erence-in-di¤erence/ xed-
e¤ect model. This model assumes that:


                              1 (D = d) ? Ytd        Ytd0 , with t 6= t0 :


However, this condition, too, is likely to be violated if the treatment assignment is associated
with the dynamics of the potential outcome. In our empirical setting, the past rm perfor-
mance and share valuation might inuence shareholders decision to agree on share conversion
(assignment into treatment). These performance and value dynamics may also a¤ect the
post-treatment outcomes of rms that convert their shares, confounding any causal relations.
   Similar to what is suggested by Heckman et al. (1997) and Abadie (2005) for this type of
problem, we use a more general independence assumption that allows for selection on unob-
served outcomes and variables related to outcome dynamics:


                            1 (D = d) ? Ytd     Ytd0 X0 , with t 6= t0 :                    (8)


   This assumption implies that, conditional on pre-treatment covariates (including pre-
treatment outcome dynamics), idiosyncratic shocks to rms outcomes are independent from
the date when they joined the reform. This allows us to use pre-treatment rm characteristics
and decisions to predict the part of outcome dynamics that is related to the compliance date.
With this compliance model we can then simulate a randomization of assigned dates (akin to
standard treatedcontrol matching for one-time treatment assignments).
   Conditioning on a high-dimensional X0 can be di¢cult in practice, especially in small
samples. For the case of binary treatment, Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that if both
the balancing property and the conditional independence assumption are satis ed, then it
su¢ces to adjust for a unidimensional propensity score to identify the parameter of binary
treatment e¤ect. For the case of continuous and multiple treatments, several studies de ne


                                                27
what is called Generalized Propensity Score (GPS).11 The GPS, R (X0 ), is the conditional
probability of receiving the treatment, D:


                                R (X0 )  r (D; X0 ) = Pr ( D = dj X0 ) ;                            (9)


where r (:; X0 ) is called the GPS function.
      In this context, Hirano and Imbens (2004) provide a generalization of Rosenbaum and
Rubins result. They show that it su¢ces to adjust for the GPS to identify the dose-response
function, t (d), under the weak conditional independence assumption and the following weak
balancing condition:
                               X0 ? 1 (D = d)j r (d; X0 ) , for all d 2 D.

      The GPS function is usually unknown and its parameters must be estimated. Assume
that for every X0 there exists a unique nite dimensional parameter  such that r (d; X0 ) =
r (d;  (X0 )) for all d 2 D. That is, r (d; X0 ) depends on X0 only through  (X0 ). Then, as
suggested by Imai and van Dyk (2004), all information in X0 that is contained in the GPS
function can be summarized by a unique value,  (X0 ). The question is then how to model
the GPS function in a way that naturally ts the application of interest.
      In our setting the treatment assignment, D, represents the date when the rm joins the
reform. Reform compliance must happen within a pre-determined time window. Moreover,
once the rm is treated, it cannot become untreated. As such, the probability of receiving
treatment d 2 D, r (d; X0 ), can be naturally modeled as a survival problem. This allows us to
estimate the GPS using the Coxs proportional hazard model (Cox, 1972). Note that for each
 rm the GPS can be assumed to be function of a constant parameter,  = exp (X0 ), which
does not depend on D. This parameter can then be de ned as the GPS index.
      To facilitate the balance of covariates, the GPS index, , is nonparametrically estimated
using a restricted cubic spline in which knots are selected using backward elimination of weak

4.4      Binary Treatment E¤ect Estimator (PSM)

Under the weak conditional assumption, we can estimate parameters (6) and (7) using condi-
tional versions of the di¤erence-in-di¤erences (DID) model. The traditional way to adjust for
covariates is to include them linearly in the model. Although approach controls for heterogene-
ity in outcome variation, t;t0 Y = (Yt       Yt0 ), it does not control for heterogeneity in the treat-
ment e¤ect. Namely, it assumes that the treatment e¤ect is constant across di¤erent groups of
 rms. This assumption is likely to be violated, leading to inconsistent ATE and ATT estimates.
    Another way to adjust for covariates is by propensity score matching (PSM) (Heckman et
al., 1997, 1998). From the estimated GPS function, we can calculate the propensity score,
pbk;k0 , as follows:

                                                                                    b
                                       c (d  k jX0 )
                                       Pr                                1 Sb0 (k)
               pb
                k;k0   (X0 ) =                                   =                            :    (12)
                               Pr               c (d  k 0 jX0 )
                               c (d  k jX0 ) + Pr                 1
                                                                              b             b
                                                                       Sb0 (k) + Sb0 (k 0 )

The PSM estimator is performed by matching the estimated propensity score, p^k;k0 (X0 ) ;


                                                    29
between the group of treated rms that joined the reform earlier (up to period k) and a group of
control rms that joined later (after period k 0 ). One can then compute di¤erences in outcomes,
t;t0 Y , in this matched sample. Matching methods do not assume that the treatment e¤ect is
constant over di¤erent groups of rms, so we can compute both the ATE and ATT parameters.
      Implementation of our binary treatment tests allows us to estimate only the ATT parame-
ter due to relatively small number of rms. This parameter is estimated by nearest-neighbor
matching (NNM) with the bias correction suggested by Abadie and Imbens (2006).12 Our
matching estimations use overlap regions de ned as follows (Dehejia and Wahba, 1999, 2002):

                                                                                                                           

4.5       Multi-Valued Treatment E¤ect Estimator (GPS)

Let Zit = max (0; t            Di ) be the time of exposure to treatment. Then consider the following
 xed-e¤ects model:
                                               Yit =  (Zit ) + 't +  i +  it ;                                                     (14)

where  (:) is the dose-response function of Zit on Yit ,  i is the                                  rm-speci c e¤ect, 't is
the time-speci c e¤ect, and  it is the error term. In the estimations performed for multi-
valued treatment tests, (:) is assumed to be a restricted cubic spline function with ve knots,
kn = 6; 12; 18; 24; 30. This allows us to identify nonlinear patterns in the dose-response func-
tion in a way that is less computationally intensive than alternative nonparametric methods.
      An estimate for the dose-response function,  (q), is given by the within-group estimator
for equation (14). As we have discussed, the consistency of this estimator requires that the
heterogeneity in the outcome variation,  it                   it 1 , is not related to the treatment assignment,
Di . To weaken this assumption, we can control for pre-treatment covariates, X0 , by means of
                          ^ or the GPS index, ^.
either the estimated GPS, R,

      We also estimate the ATT using kernel matching (KM) as a robustness check, but results are very similar.


                                                               30
treatment, if R (X0 ) = 1, then the compliance date, Di , can be perfectly predicted by X0 . If
R (X0 ) = 0, then Di is completely unpredictable. Giving higher weight for those rms whose
R (X0 ) ! 0 and lower weight for those whose R (X0 ) ! 1 is a way of simulating an experiment
(making Di conditionally random). A simple way to operationalize this approach is to weight
all rm observations by the inverse of their estimated GPS (Imbens, 2000; Robins et al., 2000):

                                                   1
                                             !i = p :
                                                   R^i

This method is called Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). A consistent estimator for the
dose-response function,  (q), is thus given by a weighted version of the within-group estima-
tor for equation (14) (see Wooldridge, 2007).
                                                                        ^ i , in equation
   Hirano and Imbens (2004) suggest the inclusion of the estimated GPS, R
(14), interacting it with Zit , to control for covariates. Note, however, that this regression
                                                       ^ i also depends on Di . The estimate for
cannot be interpreted as an estimate for  (:) because R
                                                         ^ i , is replaced by the GPS function
 (:) requires a second step in which the estimated GPS, R
evaluated at the treatment level of interest, r (d; X0 ). As the GPS index, ^i , does not depend
on Di , Imai and van Dyk (2004) suggest the inclusion of ^i in equation (14) in lieu of R
                                                                                         ^ i . In

this way, the estimation of the dose-response function becomes straightforward.
   Our multi-valued treatment experiments report the results from of the following equation:

                                                        
                          Yit =  (Zit ) +  (Zit )  h ^i + 't +  i +  it ;                 (15)


where h(:) is a mean-centered cubic spline function of ^i . For h(:), there are four knots placed at
equally spaced quantiles of ^i . As all components of this function are mean-centered, the second
term in the right-hand side of (15) is zero for the average rm. Thus, the within-group estima-
tor for (:) directly gives us the estimate for the average dose-response function. It is worth not-
ing that combining IPW and regression of equation (15) has a double robustness property. If
the regression model is correctly speci ed, then weighting by ! i does not a¤ect its consistency.


                                                   31
Likewise, adjusting for the GPS index as in equation (15) does not a¤ect the estimate if the
covariates have already been balanced by weighting with ! i (see Robins and Rotnitzky, 1995).
      Besides controlling for covariates, the GPS estimates are also used to delimit the overlap
sample. The overlap region is de ned as follows:

where " is the width that delimits how similar the rms are in terms of treatment. This over-
lap rule implies that for every rm on the common support, there are comparable rms with
su¢ciently distinct treatments. We let the width, ", be equal to 6 months in our estimations.13
      From any estimate for the dose-response function, we can obtain an estimate for the average
time-varying treatment e¤ect of the following form:


                                      b          b (t
                                       t;k;k0 =        k)        b (t
                                                                         k0)

In the estimations that follow, we consider q 0 = 0 and q 2 [1; 30]. In words, we will be com-
paring the e¤ects of the reform on rms treated from 1 to 30 months with the counterfactual
case of no treatment.

5.1       GPS Estimation and Its Balancing Property

Our time-varying matching approach uses a large number of control variables. They include
 rm idiosyncratic characteristics (e.g., location, industry, ownership), pre-reform policies (such
as dividend payments and capital investments), and pre-reform outcomes (e.g., rm perfor-
 13
      We also de ned a common support with " = 12, but there was no signi cant change in terms of balance.

mance and value).14 Our estimations compare rms that have similar characteristics, have fol-
lowed similar corporate policies, observed similar past outcomes, and face the same economic
conditions, but are di¤erent with respect to the date of compliance with the share reform.
      After calculating the binary propensity score and the GPS index for each rm, we can iden-
tify the relevant overlap samples that we use for our comparisons. Figure 4 shows the overlap
between pilot and control groups distributions in the binary comparison. Although treated
and control rms are unevenly distributed in the propensity score line, the gure shows that
there is a su¢cient number of treatedcontrol matches within the common support, delimited
by the dotted lines.
                                           Figure 4 About Here

      To verify the balancing property of the propensity score, we estimate the average di¤erence
in pre-treatment covariates between treated and their matched controls after matching (via
NNM). The di¤erences between pilot and control rms are shown in Table 4. Notice that,
after matching, we nd no signi cant di¤erences between these groups. This balance is ob-
tained not only for those covariates included in our model, but also for all other pre-treatment
outcomes and covariates available from our dataset. We infer that the estimated propensity
scores satisfactorily balance the pre-treatment conditions of the rms used in our contrasts.

      The de nition of overlap sample is di¤erent when the treatment is multi-valued. Figure

inside the support in terms of the binary propensity score, pbk;k0 . Di¤erently from Figure 4,

for 19 out of 1; 011 non-pilot rms, the GPS cannot nd a similar control match. For this

       Imai and van Dyk (2004) propose a procedure to test the balancing property of the GPS
function. In it, each pre-treatment covariate is regressed on the treatment assignment, D,
controlling for ^. If the coe¢cient of D is signi cantly di¤erent from zero, then the estimated
GPS does not satisfy the balancing property for that covariate.15 Table 5 reports the Imai-
van Dyk regression coe¢cients and associated p-values, before and after controlling for the
estimated GPS. Without the GPS control (under column 1), only a couple of covariates are
balanced; i.e., most of pre-treatment characteristics and outcomes are signi cantly related to
the treatment assignment. Controlling for the GPS index (column 2), in contrast, eliminates
all signi cant relations between covariates and the compliance date.

5.2        E¤ects of the Reform on Pilot Firms

This section uses a standard treatedcontrol assignment approach to measure the impact of
the share conversion program on pilot rms. For ease of exposition, we focus on tests related to
a set of real outcomes and nancial policies: corporate investment, employment, productivity,
pro tability, equity issuance, leverage, and dividend payments. Our main, fully-edged set of
results is presented in the next section, where we use a time-varying, multi-valued treatment
approach to evaluate a wide range of outcomes.
       Estimates for the e¤ects of the reform on pilot rms are shown in Table 6. To study the
  15
       More speci cally, one estimates the following equation for each x0 2 X0 :
                                                                
                                            x0 = b0 + b1 D + g ^ + ,
        
where g ^ is a cubic spline function. Then one tests whether b1 = 0.

changes brought by the reform, we consider changes in outcome variables from the end of 2004
(prior to the reform) to: (1) the end of 2005 (top panel), (2) the end of 2006 (middle panel),
and (3) the end of 2007 (bottom panel). These windows give us a glimpse at the e¤ects of the
reform over time. In addition to outcome e¤ects, we report the conditional di¤erence between
treatment and control groups in terms of months spent in the reform (Z). This allows us to
interpret our estimated e¤ects with respect to the average time of exposure to the program.
   The OLS estimates under column 1 (which lack any controls) suggest that pilot and con-
trol rms had distinct outcome variations in the reform window. For example, the growth
in xed assets (K) and number of employees (L) were disproportionately higher for pilot
 rms from 2004 to 2007. With about six months into the reform (end of 2005), we also nd
positive signi cant di¤erences in productivity (Sales=K), pro ts (N etIncome), and returns
(ROE), but these di¤erences decline over time. After 15 months, the probability of equity
issuance rises some 16 percentage points for pilot rms relative to their non-pilot counterfac-
tuals. This is a notable increase when compared to the average issuance probability of only
3% for those same pilot rms over the period that preceded the program (see Table 4). After
linearly controlling for covariates (column 2), the di¤erences in employment, xed assets, and
share turnover become smaller. In other words, part of the observed di¤erences between pilot
and control rms can be explained by pre-treatment characteristics.


                                  Table 6 About Here


   Some results become somewhat weaker when we restrict attention to estimations using
matching (column 3). The NNM estimates suggest that the reform only had an immediate
e¤ect on xed assets and return on equity. After about six months, xed assets grew 21%
more for pilot rms than for their counterfactuals (the sample average annual asset growth
for the period preceding the pilot is 19.5%). Accounting equity returns (ROE ) also increased
some 9 percentage points more for pilot rms six months after the reform (the pre-reform
sample average ROE is 4.5%). At the end of 2006, with an average 15-month di¤erence in


                                             35
exposures between pilot and control rms (Z = 14:9), xed assets in the pilot group grew by
about 69% more than in the control group. One year later, in 2007, there is still a signi cant
di¤erential increase of 58%. Market-to-book and employment were also positively a¤ected by
the reform, but results only became economically and statistically signi cant in 2006. A pilot
 rms market-to-book ratio, in particular, increased 0.9 above that of a control by the 15th
month (the sample average is 2.1). Notably, that ratio declined in the following year, which
as we explain below is due to the increase in equity issuance. By December 2007, pilot rms
employment growth was 35% higher than that of matched control rms. Share conversions
have a positive, signi cant e¤ect on equity issuance across all speci cations.
   As a robustness check, we replaced the pilot rms by non-pilot rms that joined the pro-
gram early in the reform process (sometime between September and December 2005). The
pool of counterfactual rms is similar to that used in the tests of Table 6, that is, 190 rms
that joined the reform in the second half of 2006. This gives more testing power (372 non-pilot
 rms converted their stocks in 2005) and ameliorates concerns that the government may have
manipulated the outcomes of pilot rms to showcase the reform. The results are not tabulated
to save space, but we nd that even though near pilot rms were slightly less exposed to the
reform, they observe similar growth e¤ects on investment, employment, and equity issuance.
   Finally, we perform a falsi cation test to check if our matching procedures are e¤ective in
controlling for trends in outcome variation. We do so by estimating ATT e¤ects in 2004; that
is, before the reform takes place. If the matching estimates are unbiased, outcome variation
from 2003 to 2004 should not point to signi cant treatedcontrol group di¤erences. This is
exactly what we nd in the data. Similar patterns are found when we consider longer trends
in pre-treatment variables and outcomes; e.g., using data going back to 2002 (these results are
omitted to save space, but are readily available).

5.3     Time-Varying E¤ects of the Reform

This section presents our papers central results. Because we want to describe the impact of
the reform across time we present estimated e¤ects by graphing them on a time line. These
estimates are computed from the xed-e¤ect model with IPW and regression adjustments
for the GPS (equation (15)). For ease of exposition, we report and discuss separately the
outcomes that are related to rm real performance (such as investment, employment, and
productivity), those related to nancial policy (stock issuance, leverage ratios, and dividend
payments), and other outcomes (such as merger deals, managerial compensation, and related
party transactions). We start with an evaluation of stock liquidity.


5.3.1   E¤ects on Liquidity

Figure 6 presents estimated time-varying e¤ects of stock conversions on stock liquidity. The
plots represent the expected di¤erence between being in the reform for Z months, (Z), vis-à-
vis the counterfactual case of not complying with the reform, (0). Figure 6 shows that stock
liquidity increases immediately after a rm converts its shares. For the log liquidity ratio
measure (LiqRatio), there is an immediate and persistent positive conversion e¤ect. Thirty
months after the reform, that ratio increases 30% above the baseline case of non-conversion.
The e¤ect on the share turnover measure (ShareT urnover) is less persistent, but it, too, in-
creases up to two years after conversion. In the long run, share turnover becomes about 10%
higher due to share conversion.


                                  Figure 6 About Here


   The evidence in Figure 6 con rms our basic prior that corporate shares become signi -
cantly more liquid after conversion into tradable status. In turn, we investigate the impact of
the stock trading reform on key corporate outcomes.




                                              37
5.3.2    E¤ects on Real Outcomes

Figure 7 presents time-varying e¤ects of share conversions on each of the business performance
measures examined in our pilot-based tests: K, L, Sales=K, N etIncome, ROE, and M=B.


                                  Figure 7 About Here


   The    rst panel of Figure 7 suggests that corporate investment, K (measured in log
changes), responds markedly to share conversions. Indeed, the growth in xed assets is in-
creasingly impacted by the reform. By the 24th month, the investment growth rate is almost
30% higher than in the case of non-conversion. In the longer run, the e¤ect remains at around
20%. Noteworthy, the growth in investment happens without a relative increase in the num-
ber of employees. In particular, the second panel of Figure 7 shows that labor growth, L,
remains at for complying rms over the rst 24 months and decreases somewhat afterwards.
These two results suggest that rms adjusted their capital-to-labor ratios  appearing to be
more productive  after their shares begin to trade freely in the organized exchanges.
   Gains in productivity following conversions are also implied by the third panel of Figure
7, where we plot the e¤ect of the share conversion program on the rms sales-to-capital ratio,
Sales=K. The e¤ect of conversions on Sales=K is immediate and increasing up to 20 months
after compliance, when Sales=K becomes almost 40% higher than the counterfactual case of
non-compliance. In the longer run, this ratio is about 20% higher due to conversion. These
results add to existing evidence that previous market-oriented reforms in China led to mea-
surable gains in productivity (e.g., Li, 1997; Groves et al., 1994). Improvements in corporate
e¢ciency following share conversions into tradable status are consistent with theoretical priors
presented in Section 3.
   The results just described suggest that the share reform had a positive impact on corporate
growth and productivity. Those gains to business fundamentals are consistent with the gains
in pro tability that we also observe in Figure 7. In particular, the dose-response function



                                              38
of N etIncome increases up to the 20th month of program compliance. By then, operating
revenues grow 15% above expenses. In the long run, the reform leads to an increase of 10% on
N etIncome. In a similar fashion, ROE increases up to the 18th month following conversion,
when it is about 1.5 percentage points higher than the counterfactual benchmark (this gure
represents 33% of the pre-reform average ROE). After that point, however, ROE declines.
While the initial growth is consistent with rms expanding and performing better, the subse-
quent decline can be explained by the higher proportion of rms issuing equity  the scaler
of ROE  following the reform, which we discuss below.
   As the last panel of Figure 7 shows, stock conversions also lead to signi cant increases in
corporate valuation. In particular, market-to-book, M=B, increases for about 20 months fol-
lowing conversion, when it almost doubles with respect to the baseline average of 2.1. After 30
months, M=B is 1.1 higher than in the case of no share conversion (about 50% higher than the
baseline sample average). These immediate, strong e¤ects of stock liquidity on corporate values
are notable. Arguably, equity valuation is the ultimate summary statistic of corporate wealth.
Our valuation results suggest that stock conversions were bene cial to equityholders in China.
   The ndings we report on corporate investment, employment, productivity, pro tability,
and value invite further discussion on the e¤ects of market-oriented reforms in countries like
China. More broadly, they reveal the costs of imposing restrictions on the functioning of
stock markets. By hindering investors ability to trade their claims on corporate cash ows,
the dual-share class system appears to have distorted rm policies and hurt private sector
growth. The e¤ects of the split-share reform point to sizeable gains to Chinese rms and their
shareholders, highlighting to the importance of secondary stock market transactions for real
economic activity.


5.3.3   E¤ects on Financial Policies

Figure 8 shows the estimated time-varying reform e¤ects on equity issuance (Issuance), capital
structure (Leverage), and dividend payout (Dividend). Like the results on liquidity and real



                                              39
performance, the plots represent the expected di¤erence between complying with the reform
for Z months, (Z), versus the baseline case of non-compliance, (0).


                                      Figure 8 About Here


   As discussed in Section 3, a sharp increase in stock liquidity should renew rms interest in
equity issuance as a source of funding. Accordingly, we nd that rms are more likely to issue
new shares after they join the conversion program.16 In particular, the rst panel of Figure 8
shows that the probability that a rm issues new stocks grows steadily after its shares become
tradable. Thirty months after conversion the likelihood of issuance is at least 70% higher
than the baseline case of non-conversion. Looking at the aggregate e¤ect of this shift in the
propensity to issue equity, we note that only 1% of the listed rms issued equity in 2004, while
in 2007 this gure was 13%.
   The increase in equity issues seems to be associated with a decline in corporate leverage
following conversions. In particular, the second panel of Figure 8 shows that rms reduce
their debt-to-asset ratios by 4 percentage points 24 months after their stocks become tradable
(compare to the average benchmark of 48%). Finally, the last panel of Figure 8 suggests that
the reform is responsible for a small reduction in dividend payments. Despite the larger error
bands associated with tests using nancial policy variables, we nd that payout ratios fall by
about 5 percentage points 24 months after a rms shares become tradable. This decrease is
economically signi cant if one considers that the average payout prior to conversion was 35%.


5.3.4    Characterizing the Liquidity Channel

There are several, non-exclusive ways by which greater stock liquidity may drive the e¤ects
we document in Figures 7 and 8. Increased liquidity in secondary market transactions might,
for example, help rm managers make more informed decisions. Increased liquidity might
  16
     The 12-month delay is to be expected given various CSRC policies that made it di¢cult for rms to issue
new securities during the rst few months following conversion.



                                                    40
also inuence managerial incentives and strengthen links between real and stock market per-
formance if it allows for a greater use of stock-based compensation packages. Furthermore,
liquidity could jump start the market for corporate control, reallocating capital where it can
be used most e¢ciently. Finally, higher liquidity allows minority investors to more quickly
respond  by selling their shares  to detrimental actions by controlling shareholders (a ram-
pant problem in China). In this section, we provide more direct evidence for these channels.


Price Informativeness One potential explanation for our ndings is that greater liquidity
might allow for better, more informed decisions by managers. If a price discovery channel is at
work, we would expect to see stock prices becoming more informative about rm fundamentals
after stocks start to trade. Following previous literature (e.g., Morck et al., 2000), we use stock
price synchronicity as a proxy for informativeness. To wit, when the information environment
surrounding a rm improves and more rm-relevant information is incorporated in the rms
price discovery process, market factors should explain a bigger proportion of the observed
variation in stock returns. In other words, the synchronicity between a rms stock return
and that of the overall stock market (and other indicators, such as industry-wide returns)
would reect the informativeness of the rms stock price. If increased liquidity improves the
information environment surrounding rms stocks, we would expect to see price synchronicity
to be positively associated with reform compliance.
       Following Gul et al. (2010), we measure a rms stock price synchronicity by the R2 from
a regression of the individual rm returns on market and industry returns. We also include
lagged industry and market returns to alleviate concerns about potential non-synchronous
trading biases that may arise from the use of daily returns for estimating the market model.17
As Figure 9 suggests, the reform has a positive e¤ect on price informativeness. Converting
 rms stock prices become more synchronous with the market up to the 24th month following
  17
    The A-share market return is based on the composite A-share index of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges. The industry return is created using all rms within the same industry (we use the CSRCs
industry classi cation system). To circumvent the bounded nature of R2 , we follow previous literature and
use a logistic transformation: Pri ceInf o = log(R2 =(1 R2 )):



                                                   41
conversion, when it is at least 60% higher than the case of non-conversion. To gauge the e¤ect
of this estimate, note that the pre-reform sample average R2 is about 10%, which implies that
R2 rose, on average, to 16% as rms converted their shares. Our results suggest that the stock
prices incorporate more rm-relevant information as a result of having a more liquid equity
market.
                                  Figure 9 About Here


Merger Activity A deeper, more liquid equity market should facilitate corporate control
transactions, which are often made possible through the use of shares as a means of exchange
(see Bhide, 1993; Maug, 1998). Results depicted in Figure 10 are consistent with this conjec-
ture. After converting its shares, and following the subsequent increase in issuance activity, a
 rm is more likely to engage in M&A transactions. By the 30th month after conversion, the
probability of having a M&A deal per year is 20 percentage points higher than in the case of
non-conversion. In aggregate, this e¤ect represents an increase of 60% in the number of rms
making M&A deals per year.


                                  Figure 10 About Here


   If our conjecture about the link between stock liquidity and M&A activity is correct, one
would expect that rms not only engage in more M&As, but also more often use stocks as a
payment method. The evidence we gather suggests that this is indeed the case. For the M&A
transactions for which we could collect information on payment methods (nearly half of the
total number of M&As), the percentage of deals using cash-only payments dropped from 96%
for the period before the reform, to 59% after the reform.


Managerial Incentives To assess the degree of performance-related incentives given to cor-
porate managers around the reform, we collected ownership data for the top three executives
for each rm in the sample. We also tracked down CEO departures over our sample period



                                              42
by manually checking rms annual reports. One would expect the proportion of shares held
by top managers (M anagerShares) to increase after the reform if rms are more likely to
adopt stock-based compensation packages. Likewise, CEO departures (CEOT urnover) could
increase if poor stock performance would become more relevant in the evaluation of CEO
performance and tenure. At the same time, one has to bear in mind the context in which
tests are conducted. Chinese CEOs are often politically connected to the central government
apparatus and their employment terms may be isolated from their rms outcomes.


                                  Figure 11 About Here


   Results in Figure 11 do not point to signi cant changes in the proportion of shares held by
top managers following conversion. At the same time, one observes a decline in the probability
of CEO turnover. Our results do not reveal a signi cant link between changes in managerial
incentives and reform outcomes.


Conicts of Interests and Fraudulent Activities By abolishing distinctions between
tradable and non-tradable shares, the reform could potentially ameliorate conicts between
majority and minority shareholders. In this context, the elimination of share classes relates
to a somewhat di¤erent notion of liquidity and we examine whether the reform may have
implications for conicts of interests and agency issues inside rms.
   We start with ownership concentration.       Concentrated ownership provides controlling
shareholders with the opportunity to divert rm resources at the expense of minority share-
holders (Morck et al. 2000, Claessens et al. 2002, Fan and Wong 2002). The rst panel
of Figure 12 shows that ownership concentration among top-5 shareholders (OwnerConcent)
dropped substantially after rms converted their stocks. By the 30th month into the pro-
gram, OwnerConcent is about 10 percentage points lower than in the counterfactual case of
non-conversion, which represents a reduction of 43% of the average concentration index. The




                                              43
reform thus had signi cant e¤ects on ownership concentration among large shareholders.


                                    Figure 12 About Here


       We note, however, that the e¤ect of the reform on concentration could be somewhat me-
chanical. Recall, owners of tradable shares were usually compensated with extra shares. As a
result, the fraction of the rm owned by majority (non-tradable) shareholders would mechan-
ically decline following conversion. The reform could thus appear to dilute stock ownership
of top shareholders, and yet not necessarily imply that there is greater (new) individual in-
vestor participation in ownership. While it is impossible to collect detailed information of
proportional ownership of each investor in each rm, we are able to gather data on the num-
ber of individual shareholders. The second panel of Figure 12 indicates that the number of
shareholders increases following the reform, and particularly so when the probability of new
equity issuance spikes up. Thirty months after conversion, the number of rm shareholders
is 40% higher. Not only there are more transactions on the rms stock, but also more in-
vestors participating in those transactions. This evidence is consistent with the argument that
more heterogeneous investors trade in corporate shares after the reform making stock price
formation more informative (cf. Figure 10).
       In China, conicts of interests between majority and minority shareholders are known to
be associated with corporate mismanagement and even fraud. These problems became acute
in recent years, with shareholder expropriation conducted primarily by way of related party
transactions.18 Following prior literature (Cheung et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2008), we clas-

sify as related party transactions those disclosed in the annual report under the categories of
equity transfers, goods and service related trading, assets purchase and sale, and cash
payments. Accordingly, we count the number of these transactions (RP T s) for each rm in
our sample. We also look at additional ways in which expropriation takes place in China. In
  18
     Deng et al. (2008) report that 90% of the SOEs that went public between 1997 and 2000 were later
involved in disadvantageous transactions with their parent rms. Those transactions averaged 13% of the
listed rms assets.


                                                 44
particular, controlling shareholders reportedly often make loans across di¤erent parts of their
companies (say, from a public held a¢liate to a privately controlled subdivision) as a way to
siphon o¤ resources. Following Jiang et al. (2010), we collected information on these inter-
corporate loans, which are measured by the log amount of other receivables (InterLoans).
   To test whether the reduction in agency costs is a plausible channel for our results, we
examine the e¤ect of reform on changes in related party transactions and intercorporate loans.
Our prior is that converting shares into a tradable status may make managers more account-
able for their actions and discourage them from engaging in dealings that are detrimental to
most holders of public stocks. We nd only weak support for this hypothesis. The last two
panels of Figure 12 suggest that RP T s declined slightly following conversions, and that this
decline is long-lasting. Intercorporate loans show a decline in the short run; however, this
decline does not persist in the long run.


5.3.5   Treatment Heterogeneity

Con rming our basic priors, we found evidence that the split-share reform had an immediate
and persistent positive e¤ect on stock liquidity. By the same token, equity ownership became
less concentrated. We argued that a more liquid, deeper stock market has in turn led to sig-
ni cant changes in rms real and nancial policies. While our results are consistent with this
interpretation, one would like to see that mechanism more fully characterized. One way to
better characterize our main claims is to check whether rms that had the most to gain from
the conversion program indeed observed the largest positive responses to the reform. In this
section, we identify heterogeneity in treatment outcomes by examining whether rms whose
stocks were less liquid and more concentrated prior to the reform present the largest responses
to the share conversion program.
   We operationalize our tests of the reform mechanism by entering a couple of interaction
terms in our multivariate model (equation (15)). In particular, in a rst examination, we
interact a rms pre-reform liquidity level (ShareT urnover) and the months since it joined



                                              45
the share reform (Z). This interaction term captures the product between a rms potential
to gain from the treatment (the degree to which the rm stock was liquid before the conver-
sion program) and the rms exposure to the treatment (number of months since conversion).
We expect rms with less liquid stocks prior to conversion to observe the most pronounced
responses to the conversion treatment; i.e., we expect a negative interaction term between
ShareT urnover and Z. In a similar vein, we interact a rms pre-reform concentration index
(OwnerConcent) and Z, and expect a positive interaction e¤ect. Additionally, we interact
Z with the lagged proportion of shares held by the top managers (M anagerShares), which
represents the managerial incentives previously given by the rm. Finally, we interact Z with
the pre-reform amount of intercorporate loans (InterLoans), which captures the previous level
of agency problems and tunneling.
   The results from these interactive models are in Table 7, which present the marginal in-
crease in the treatment e¤ect as a function of changes in lagged stock liquidity, ownership con-
centration, managerial incentives, and intercorporate loans for compliant rms. For brevity,
these tests focus only on the six real-side variables previously examined (K, L, Sales=K,
N etIncome, ROE, and M=B).


                                    Table 7 About Here


   Results in Table 7 suggest that the impact of stock conversions on rms investment (K)
is more pronounced for rms that were less liquid, that had more concentrated ownership,
and that provided more managerial incentives prior to share conversion. Estimates of these
marginal impacts are, however, not statistically signi cant. The same can be said about em-
ployment growth (L). The e¤ects of liquidity, concentration, managerial incentives, and
tunneling activity on productivity outcomes (captured by Sales=K) are, however, very signi -
cant and consistent with our priors. The estimate reported in the rst column implies that for
 rms whose stocks were 10% less liquid than the average prior to the reform, the e¤ect of share
conversion on Sales=K is 0.24% higher. This estimated sensitivity is sizeable if one considers


                                              46
that, at its peak, the average response of Sales=K to the conversion process is 0.30%. In a sim-
ilar fashion, the result from the second column indicates that the e¤ect of share conversion on
Sales=K is 0.28% higher when we increase the rms ownership concentration index slightly by
1 percentage point (the standard deviation of the concentration measure is 0.13). In the third
column, we see that for rms where the top managers held one percentage point less of the
shares, the e¤ect on Sales=K is 0.60% higher. The last column shows the e¤ect on Sales=K
is 0.12% higher in rms where intercorporate loans were 10% higher prior to conversion.
   The average e¤ects of the reform on rms pro tability and value also change with respect to
pre-conversion liquidity, concentration, and agency problems (tunneling activity). Consistent
with our proposed liquidity mechanism, for rms whose stocks were 10% less liquid than the
average, the e¤ects of stock conversion on N etIncome and on ROE are 0.1% higher. Likewise,
for rms whose concentration index was 1 point higher, the e¤ect of the reform on N etIncome
is 0.06% higher and the e¤ect on ROE is 0.02% higher. For rms whose intercorporate loans
were 10% higher, the e¤ect of conversion on N etIncome is 0.08% higher and the e¤ect on
ROE is 0.03% higher. All of these estimates are economically important (see corresponding
panels in Figure 7) and are statistically signi cant at better than the 10% test level.
   In all, the evidence of this section suggests that rms that had the most to gain from the
split-share reform  for example, rms whose stocks were illiquid and concentrated before
conversion  bene tted the most from the reform program. Evidence of these heterogeneous
e¤ects is consistent with our argument that the lifting of trading restrictions had positive
implications for rms in China.


5.3.6   Falsi cation Test

Finally, one could still be concerned that rm compliance might be encouraged by idiosyn-
cratic shocks or that rms who complied in a speci c period are marginally distinct from the
rest in terms of outcome variation. The types of endogeneity dynamics one could still be
concerned with imply that, if our strategy does not eliminate these sorts of selection biases,



                                              47
reform compliance in the next period would be related to current outcome variation.
    Table 8 reports estimates for the conditional relation between current outcome variation
and reform compliance in the next period for rms who have yet to comply with the reform.
That is, we test whether those rms who are about to convert their shares are di¤erent from
those who do not convert. The table contrasts the performance of a conventional xed-e¤ect
model (FE) with that of our estimation approach (GPS plus FE) in terms of the potential for
outcome dynamics endogeneity.


                                  Table 8 About Here


    Table 8 shows that the xed-e¤ect model fails to account for the fact that investment and
liquidity (K and LiqRatio) increase in the year before a rm chooses to convert its shares.
Moreover, other characteristics such as stock price synchronization (PriceInfo), number of
shareholders (ShareHolders), probability of merger and acquisition deals (M &A), and num-
ber of related party transactions (RP T s) seem to have changed just before the rm decided to
convert its shares. Our estimation model, which combines inverse GPS weighting with xed
e¤ects, weakens biases stemming from shocks to rm pro ts and ownership by making them
irrelevant for the timing of program compliance. Table 8 con rms that idiosyncratic changes
in rms behavior and performance do not a¤ect our inferences.



6     Concluding Remarks

The 2005 split-share reform allowed for stocks worth hundreds of billions of dollars to become
tradable over a short period, sharply increasing liquidity in the Chinese stock market. Our
paper uses this episode as a way to esh out links between stock market activity and real
business activity.
    We evaluate the impact of the 2005 reform exploiting various institutional features asso-
ciated with its implementation. One of such feature is a pilot experiment conducted at the


                                             48
beginning of the reform schedule. Another is the gradual, large-scale share conversion process
that took place within a 16-month window. These features are unique and present both oppor-
tunities and challenges for empirical testing. It is possible, for example, that better-managed
 rms were chosen to participate in the pilot trial because of political motivation to showcase
the reform. In addition, after the pilot stage, rms were largely free to join the reform at the
time of their choosing. As such, the treatment assignment might also be endogenous due to
self-selection. To address these concerns, our analysis employs quasi-experimental methods
that make the outcome variation before and after conversion conditionally independent from
the compliance date.
   We    nd that 2005 Chinese split-share reform had largely positive e¤ects on corporate
outcomes. Unlike previous reforms, the state loosened its control over local companies by
allowing all of their shares to be traded in organized secondary markets. The elimination of
dual-structure ownership, as well as the easier access to nancing, had signi cant e¤ects on
corporate performance and shareholder wealth. Our results suggest that sales, pro tability,
and value increase because of the reform. The increase in business performance is accompanied
by an expansion of capital investment, followed by improvements in productivity. The reform
also allowed rms to have greater access to equity nancing and prompted them to reduce
their leverage ratios and engage in more corporate acquisition deals.
   The results we report shed a unique perspective on the role of public stock markets in
the economy. In particular, they reveal the extent to which restrictions on secondary equity
transactions can be detrimental to corporate growth. While our tests build on features that
are particular to the Chinese economy, we believe our ndings have broad implications for
understanding the impact of governmental interventions and the trend towards capital market
liberalization. Our study indicates that trading in secondary equity markets have signi cant
connections with outcomes observed in the real economy. Our tests show that policies that
ease restrictions on these markets may have measurable, positive implications.

     This table shows the sample averages of the variables listed in Table 1 for all 1,054 A-share firms listed in 2004. Pilot firms, in column (1), are those that jointed the
     reform in May-June 2005. Column (2) shows statistics for non-pilot firms that jointed the reform before June 2006. Column (3) shows statistics for firms that joint
     the reform after June 2006. We also report the difference in sample average between pilot firms and firms complying after June 2006, as well as between non-pilot
     firms complying before June 2006 and firms complying after June 2006. Standard errors are in the parentheses. ∆ indicates difference between December 2003 and
     December 2004.

This table shows the potential outcomes of treatment for the time-varying approach. d represents the treatment value,
indicating when the firm may join the reform. t represents the real time horizon. Ytd is an ordinary variable (or vector)
that maps a particular treatment value, d, to a potential outcome at time t. Each cell in the matrix indicates the
potential outcome for a given firm with a particular treatment value in a specific period. For example, at period T
(column T ), YT2 − YTT is the effect of being in the reform for T − 2 months with respect to joining the reform in period
T.

This table shows the regression results for Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) Balancing Property Test based on Imai
and van Dyk (2004). In the regression, each pre-reform covariate is regressed on the treatment assignment, before
and after controlling for the estimated GPS. Regression coefficients and associated p-values are reported in separate
columns. ∆ indicates difference between December 2003 and December 2004.

This table shows the average treatment effect (ATT) estimates for pilot firms. To study the changes brought about
by the reform, we consider changes in outcome variables from the end of 2004 (prior to the reform) to: (1) the end
of 2005 (top panel); (2) the end of 2006 (middle panel); and (3) the end of 2007 (bottom panel). The estimates in
column 1 are from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression without any control variables. The estimates in column
2 are from Ordinary Least Squares regression with control variables. The estimates in column 3 are from the Nearest
Neighbor Matching (NNM) estimator. Robust standard errors are in parentheses. The symbols ∗∗∗ ,     ∗∗
                                                                                                         , and ∗ represent
statistical significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

     This table shows the estimated coefficient of the interaction between months since the reform started (Z) and the following lagged variables: share turnover
     (ShareT urnover), Herfindahl index of top 5 shareholder ownership (OwnerConcent), proportion of shares owned by the top 3 managers (M anagerShares), and
     log of intercorporate loans (InterLoans). Each row in this table comes from a different regression and the reported coefficients are multiplied by 12 to represent
     annual effects. The regressions are estimated using Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and GPS adjustment as in equation (15). Robust standard errors are in
     parentheses and p-value are reported in separate columns.

This table shows the estimated coefficient of the lead dummy that indicates whether the firm complies with the reform
in the next period or not. The sample only includes observations up to the date when the firm joined the reform, i.e.,
firm-year observations whose Z = 0. The estimates in column 1 are for a fixed-effect (FE) model as shown in equation
(14). The estimates in column 3 are obtained from the same model but controlling for the Generalized Propensity
Score (GPS). Robust standard errors are in parentheses and p-values are reported in separate columns.

The y-axis (right side) represents the number of firms in the reform. The y-axis (left side) measures the market liquidity
(turnover). We compute the market liquidity (turnover) as a 12-month moving average of the ratio of number of shares
traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange over the total number of tradable shares outstanding. The x-axis represents
the year-month from April 2004 to June 2007.

The left graph gives an example of Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimated from a dose-response function. The point
on the curve represents the expected outcome at time t if the firm joins the reform at a particular time k. The right
graph depicts the estimates for a mirrored binary-treatment framework under the assumption that the dose-response
function is locally constant.

This figure shows the overlap between pilot and control firms’ distributions in the binary comparison. We compare
these groups in terms of the estimated propensity score. The dotted lines delimit the common support of both groups
as defined in equation (13). Pilot firms are those that jointed the reform in May-June 2005. Control firms are those
that joint the reform after June 2006.

This figure shows the difference between firms outside the common support and those inside the common support in
terms of Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) index, which represents observable pre-treatment characteristics. The
common support, as defined by equation (16), is the region where each firm is always between two other firms with
sufficiently distinct treatment values.

This figure presents time-varying reform effects on liquidity measures: LiqRatio and ShareT urnover. For each of the
variables, the dose-response function is estimated using Inverse Probability Weighing (IPW) and regression adjustment
based on equation (15). All regressions are performed using annual data and estimated using a linear model. The plot
represents the expected difference between being in the reform for Z months, µ(Z), and the counter-factual case of not
joining the reform, µ(0). Dashed lines represent the 90% confidence interval for the estimates.

This figure presents time-varying reform effects on each of the business performance measures: ∆K, ∆L, Sales/K,
N etIncome, ROE, and M/B, where ∆ indicates the difference between the 12-month forward value and the current
value. The regressions for ∆K, N etIncome, Sales/K, M/B and ROE are estimated using quarterly data, while the
regression for ∆L is estimated using annual data. For each of the variables, the dose-response function is estimated
using Inverse Probability Weighing (IPW) and regression adjustment based on equation (15). The plot represents the
expected difference between being in the reform for Z months, µ(Z), and the counter-factual case of not joining the
reform, µ(0). Dashed lines represent the 90% confidence interval for the estimates.
