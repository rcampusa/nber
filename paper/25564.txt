How Does Supplemental Medicare Coverage Affect the Disabled Under-65 Population?: An
Exploratory Analysis of the Health Effects of States’ Medigap Policies for SSDI Beneficiaries

                                           ABSTRACT

A substantial portion of the costs associated with, and the value to beneficiaries of, Social
Security Disability Insurance is Medicare eligibility. However, the benefits of this eligibility can
vary due to differences in state policies on supplemental Medicare coverage, also known as
Medigap. Although Medigap policies are federally regulated to be issued to 65-and-over
Medicare beneficiaries with specific restrictions over underwriting, these policies are left to states
to regulate with regard to the under-65 SSDI population, generating substantial cross-state and
temporal variation. This paper documents the variation in availability and generosity of under-65
Medigap eligibility for the SSDI population. Furthermore, it exploits this variation to provide
initial estimates of how this eligibility affects the health status of non-Medicaid-eligible SSDI
recipients. Our main finding is that requiring Medigap plans be offered for under-65 SSDI
recipients substantially improves self-reported health of this population, with suggestive evidence
that this improvement is stronger as underwriting restrictions increase and among SSDI
beneficiaries with mental health conditions. The estimated effect is highly robust to alternative
scaling or categorizations of self-reported health, choice of data set, inclusion of fixed effects,
controls for local Medicare Advantage penetration, and falsification tests. This effect is nearly
three times the size of the estimated increase in self-reported health in the Oregon Medicaid
expansion.

Introduction

A substantial portion of the costs associated with, and the value to beneficiaries of, Social Security

Disability Insurance is Medicare eligibility. SSDI recipients are the vast majority of under-65 Medicare-

eligible population in the US, 1 and while previous work has focused on behavior and outcomes during the

two-year waiting period between cash benefit and Medicare eligibility or the effects of eliminating this

waiting period, there is much less research on the impact of differences in Medicare coverage itself,

including private supplemental coverage (Medigap) and Medicare Advantage (MA). These differences

arise from two sources: first, although the over-65 Medicare population faces federally required

guaranteed issuance and open and special enrollment periods limiting underwriting, Medigap policies for

under-65 SSDI recipients depend on state regulations; and second, the availability of managed care

options through Medicare Advantage and Special Needs Plans (SNPs), also varies dramatically from

market to market. This paper documents the variation in availability and generosity of cost-sharing

Medigap options, then uses this variation to provide new evidence of the impact of the structure of health

care coverage on health for this population.

        There is a long history of estimating the effects of health insurance coverage on a range of

outcomes, including health service usage, health status, mortality, and labor market outcomes. Measuring

these effects is of central policy interest, given that over a quarter of the US federal budget is dedicated to

Medicare and Medicaid, and numerous government programs insure or directly provide health care for

certain subpopulations. But an early and consistent finding in in this literature was a lack of evidence of a

positive effect of health insurance coverage on health outcomes on average (e.g., Newhouse et al. 1993,

Finkelstein and McKnight 2008, Baicker et al. 2013; see Levy and Meltzer 2008 and Rutledge 2016 for

reviews). Although many of these studies find a substantial monetary welfare benefit due to increased

coverage, the average newly covered individual experienced little detectable gain in health or work

capacity.


1
 End stage renal disease (ESRD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the only other two groups, and are
substantially smaller than the over 9 million SSDI Medicare beneficiaries.
        This lack of an average effect on health and work outcomes belies the potential importance of

coverage for vulnerable subpopulations, including the elderly, low-income groups, those with chronic

health conditions, and those seeking behavioral health services (Dow et al. 1997, Card, Dobkins, and

Maestas 2009, Andersen 2015). One particular subpopulation for which we would expect positive

benefits of health coverage is the long-term disabled, especially given recent quasi-experimental evidence

that larger SSDI cash benefits decrease beneficiary mortality (Gelber et al. 2018). Despite Medicare

eligibility after two years of SSDI cash benefit eligibility, there are a limited number of prior studies on

the role of Medicare in the health of this population. This prior work primarily identifies the effect of

health insurance using the two-year waiting period between Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)

cash-benefit eligibility and Medicare eligibility (Riley 2006, Livermore et al. 2009, and Michalopoulous

et al. 2011). However, limited follow-up periods and lack of variation in anything but the timing of

eligibility naturally limit the policy margins for which conclusions can be drawn. As a result, we know

little about how the disabled population’s health and work capacity is affected by health insurance

coverage, and even less about how structural differences in this coverage could translate into differential

health effects.

        This study presents a preliminary analysis of the impact in varying access to Medicare

supplemental coverage on the health of the SSDI population. It exploits cross-state and temporal variation

in these measures, most notably state-level changes in required Medigap issuance for the under-65

Medicare population, and draws on the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to estimate

the impact of such required Medigap issuance and limitations on underwriting on the self-reported health

of the long-term disabled population. Although the data in question allow for only estimation of the

impact of Medigap policies on this measure of health, self-reported health has been shown to provide an

independent explanatory component to a range of health outcomes. Most notably, those reporting poor

health have twice to four times the estimated mortality odds ratios (Idler and Benyamini 1997).

Furthermore, self-reported health is likely to be more sensitive to changes in quality of life, morbidity

severity, and functional impairments than mortality measures (Levy and Meltzer 2008).
        There are two direct policy implications for exploring the effect of the structure of Medicare

benefits on the SSDI population. First, since the role of government in the health care sector continues to

be an actively discussed area of policymaking, understanding the subpopulations most likely to be helped

or hurt by changes in government-provided insurance coverage, by how much, and by which insurance

structures, directly informs these discussions. Second, the SSDI population is large and diverse, with

approximately 9 million disabled workers and millions more dependents and survivors (SSA 2016), so

understanding the health needs and work capacity responses to the structure of health insurance coverage

can provide insight as to how to optimally design this program and its benefit structure going forward.



Social Security Disability Insurance and Medicare Eligibility

In addition to retirement benefits, the Social Security Administration provides disability coverage for

workers in the US. Coverage and benefit level is determined by prior Social Security-taxable wages, but

benefit eligibility requires a health condition or set of health conditions expected to last for at least 12

months or result in death, and which prevent earning at a Substantial Gainful Activity level ($1,180 per

month in 2018). The application process can be lengthy, with many stages of potential appeal if rejected,

and requires de facto labor force exit. If determined to be disabled, individuals are entitled to monthly

cash benefits five calendar months after their disability established onset date. Twenty-four months after

initial monthly cash benefit entitlement, SSDI beneficiaries gain eligibility for Medicare coverage.

        However, on its own, fee-for-service Medicare carries with it a range of deductibles and a 20%

coinsurance rate for physician expenditures. Additionally, there is no lifetime out-of-pocket maximum.

As such, most Medicare beneficiaries purchase or otherwise obtain supplemental coverage, via Medicaid,

Medigap, Medicare Advantage, employer-provided plans, VA health benefits, or TRICARE. However,

this supplemental coverage differs across type of Medicare beneficiary: in 2012, nearly 90% of over-65

Medicare beneficiaries had supplemental coverage, while under 80% of the under-65 Medicare

population had supplemental coverage (Cubanski 2016). Due to the relatively lower assets and income of

this population, the SSDI population has historically been substantially more likely to be eligible for
Medicaid benefits, with 35% of the under-65 Medicare population being dually enrolled in Medicaid

compared to 10% of the over-65 Medicare population.

        For the non-dual-eligible SSDI beneficiaries, the focus of this paper, the alternative sources of

supplemental coverage are employer-sponsored insurance (minimal for this group due to the work

restrictions for SSDI eligibility), Medicare Advantage, and Medigap supplemental insurance. These latter

two options, although accounting for nearly half of the over-65 Medicare population’s supplemental

insurance (31% MA and 17% Medigap in 2012), have a different structure for the disabled population;

while a similar proportion of the under-65 Medicare population have MA (27%), only 2% have Medigap

(Cubanski 2016).



Medigap

Medigap insurance arose to meet the demand for wrap‐around coverage for extra expenses not covered by

Medicare, with the plans' coverage characteristics federally standardized in 1990. Appendix Table 1

shows the standardized plan designs for plans A through N; beneficiaries pay a monthly premium to

enroll in a particular plan. An insurer need not offer every plan type, but if it offers any, it must offer a

Plan A and either a Plan C or Plan F, although these requirements apply only to plans offered to the over-

65 population. Due to its extensive coverage, Plan F is the most popular Medigap plan, accounting for

over 50% of Medigap enrollees (Starc 2014). Unlike Medicare Advantage plans, Medigap coverage is not

restricted to a network. During open enrollment and special enrollment periods (e.g., if an over-65

Medicare MA beneficiary’s MA plan is discontinued), insurers are not allowed to underwrite Medigap

policies.

        However, states have separate policies governing the availability and allowable price

discrimination of these Medigap policies for the under-65 population (Harrison 2017). Certain states have

enacted protections to ensure that Medicare enrollees under-65 can purchase Medigap plans, but there is

wide variation across states as to whether and what kinds of Medigap plans are available. These state

policies vary on a number of attributes. First, some states differentiate between Medicare enrollees
enrolled because of disability and those enrolled due to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); states may have

Medigap guaranteed issue requirements that apply to one group, both groups or neither. States that have

some form of guaranteed issue requirement for disabled enrollees under 65 also vary with respect to their

requirements for open enrollment periods, during which available policies cannot be underwritten. Lastly,

states vary on their policies related to Medigap premiums. State rules also vary with respect to their

premium rating rules (attained age, issue age, or community rating), whether insurers can charge different

premiums to those enrollees over 65 as those under 65 (or limits to the extent that premiums can vary),

and whether insurers must charge the same premium to all enrollees under 65 (or limits to the periods and

types of plans to which this applies). Further, some insurers offer Medigap plans to enrollees even if they

are not required to do so, or offer rate setting, underwriting, or premiums that exceed state requirements.

        We examined the prevalence of these laws to require Medigap insurers to offer plans to the

under-65 population over the period 2004 to 2018 using annual editions of Choosing a Medigap Policy: A

Guide to Health Insurance for People with Medicare from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services

(CMS), accessed through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. For this time period, Table 1 shows

which states never had such a requirement, which states always did, which states added the requirement,

and which ones had a requirement they then removed, along with the year that any change took place.

Although the majority of states did not change their requirement status of this time period, nine states

added the requirement and two removed it, with Kentucky having added, removed, and re-added the

requirement. Furthermore, Table 2 shows the additional regulations surrounding open enrollment periods

and underwriting restrictions. The vast majority of states requiring issuance of at least one type of

Medigap plan also require an open enrollment period. However, there is substantial variation surrounding

the premium rating rules in these states. A majority restrict underwriting to some degree, with fourteen

requiring parallel underwriting of under- and over-65 Medicare beneficiaries, and nine requiring only that

all under-65 Medicare beneficiaries be rated equally.

        As such, there is substantial variation across the country in the requirement of insurers to offer

these Medigap plans to the under-65 Medicare population. At the current time, we do not have historical
Medigap plan availability for this population over this time period; however, we do have availability of

current 2018 Medigap policies through https://www.medicare.gov/download/downloaddb.asp, which

provide which plans are available in each state and whether these plans are available for the under-65

population.

        In 2018, for states not requiring Medigap insurers to offer plans to the under-65 Medicare

population, there were an average of 24.2 Medigap total plans offered to the under-65 Medicare

beneficiaries per state. For states that did require such plans be offered for the under-65 Medicare

population in 2018, there were an average of 126.2 Medigap plans offered to this population per state.

Additionally, only 41% of non-requiring states had a Plan F offered for the under-65 population; 81% of

requiring states had such a plan available. These differences are highly statistically significant. Although

we do not have comparisons for the entire period shown, these statistics indicate that this state-level

requirement is strongly associated with greater availability of Medigap plans, especially the high-

coverage Plan F.

        Enactment of state policies related to disabled Medicare enrollees under 65 are trending toward

more protections; in 2004, 24 states had these protections, whereas in 2018, 32 do. It is not obvious that

this policy variation is related to health trends in these populations or state-level political attitudes toward

expanded health coverage. 2 However, Appendix Table 2 provides OLS estimates of state-level

characteristics on under-65 Medigap policy. When controlling for an array of sociodemographic

characteristics as well the Democratic margin in the 2008 Presidential Election, more populous states,

more rural states, and more Democratic states are more likely to required guaranteed issuance of Medigap

plans for the under-65 Medicare population. Although there are serious power concerns (N=9), there are

no statistically significant correlates of when a state chose to require this issuance. Moreover, there are no

significant correlates of the specific under-65 Medigap policies. As such, our preferred specifications

include state fixed-effects to account for any persistent confounding differences across states.


2
 For example, the correlation between 2014 Medicaid expansion states and the states which required issuance of a
Medigap policy to the under-65 Medicare population is only -0.112, with a p-value of 0.429.
        In our analysis of SIPP data below, survey respondents who experienced a change in state policy

over under-65 Medigap policy resided in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, or Tennessee, with the majority

residing in Florida or Georgia. Both Florida’s adoption of these protections in 2009 and Georgia’s

adoption in 2010 were primarily motivated by lobbying of NBA All-Star Alonzo Mourning, a former

player for the Miami Heat and ESRD survivor. Before the signing the bill, Florida Governor Charlie

Crist was quoted: “When somebody of his celebrity status ... undertakes a cause like this and really gets

behind it and really pushes it, it's hard to say no.” While many news outlets picked up the story, news

coverage of the law emphasized its implications for ESRD patients in Florida, even though they represent

only 1% of people impacted by the law, far fewer than the Floridians with Medicare coverage through

SSDIbecause of disability. The idiosyncrasy of such political motivation 3 is indicative of the plausible

exogeneity of under-65-Medigap policy changes to the underlying health of the affected population.



Medicare Advantage

        Individuals who are eligible for Medicare may opt to gain coverage through a private plan chosen

in the Medicare Advantage (MA) market, many of which charge no additional premium for enrollment.

Although they offer more supplemental coverage, like Medigap, and are underwritten only by service

area, the tradeoff faced by beneficiaries selecting an MA plan is that most of these plans are managed care

plans or bundle Part D prescription drug plans with formulary limitations. Hence, they restrict enrollees to

a particular network of doctors and require referrals for specialists, as well as potentially limit covered

prescription drugs.

        Additionally, insurers may offer Special Needs Plans (SNPs) in select counties or states; SNPs

can be one of three varieties based on the eligible population: those with chronic health conditions, those

dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare, or institutionalized populations. Although there are a range of

chronic health condition categories that chronic health condition SNPs (C-SNPs) can offer eligibility to,

insurers are free to limit eligibility to a subset of these conditions, in some cases focusing the SNP on one

specific type of health condition. Since we generally exclude Medicaid dual-eligibles in our analysis to

avoid conflation of cross-state differences and changes in Medicaid policy with Medicare coverage

options, 4 and the institutionalized population is not included in the sampling frame of our data, we focus

here on C-SNPs, which are of particular applicability to the long-term disabled SSDI population as well.

        A recent spate of research has exploited variation in the availability and generosity of Medicare

Advantage (MA) plans, private managed care plans offered by insurers to all Medicare beneficiaries in a

particular coverage area, for the over-65 Medicare population (Geruso and Layton 2015, Cabral et al.

2014). Although the original introduction of SNPs was accompanied with pilot program evaluations and

observational comparisons in plan quality (Cromwell et al. 2008; Maciejewski et al. 2011), there is no

research that we are aware of that examines the impact of MA plans, and specifically the availability and

generosity of SNPs, on the health market outcomes of the SSDI population.

        The central difficulty in estimating the impact of MA and MA SNP availability on health

outcomes is the endogeneity of these plans’ being offered. Not every county or state has every SNP, and

the introduction of a particular chronic condition SNP, for example one for diabetes, may be responding

to increasing rates of diabetes in the population. In this analysis, we do not attempt to estimate the causal

relationship between the availability of MA and MA SNPs on health outcomes, although as a robustness

check, we control for prior years’ availability of these plans in order to control for alternative

supplemental options that would affect those potentially considering purchasing a Medigap policy. We

leave for future research the implementation of a causal estimation strategy of the availability of and

enrollment in these plans on SSDI beneficiaries’ health. Appendix Figures 1 and 2 show the enrollment

and availability in MA and C-SNP plans based on cms.gov enrollment figures. Enrollment in both types

of plans have increased from 2008 to 2016, although C-SNP plans experienced a dip in enrollment in

between. Figure 2 shows the fraction of states 5 that had any enrollment in C-SNP plans in three specific

categories of chronic health conditions: cardiovascular, mental/behavioral health, or diabetes.6 It is clear

that the pronounced dip from 2010 to 2011 corresponds to a similar drop in the number of states with

cardiovascular or diabetes C-SNPs. Regardless, most states have a C-SNP plan that allows those with

cardiovascular or diabetes chronic conditions to enroll. However, there are far fewer states with C-SNP

plans for those with mental or behavioral health chronic conditions. This lack of C-SNP availability may

suggest that for those with chronic mental health issues, supplemental Medicare coverage may be less

available.



Analysis of Impact on SSDI Population

Data

In order to test the effects of Medicare supplementation policies on the health of the SSDI population, one

needs a data source that contains SSDI or Medicare coverage, age, geographic location, and health. Such

requirements are satisfied by the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a panel survey

traditionally started every four years, with approximately 100,000 respondents. These respondents are

interviewed with a core survey ever four months, eliciting information on income, work activity, public

program participation, health insurance coverage, and living situation for each of the four months since

the last interview. Topical modules are also included in each interview wave. We draw upon the 2008

SIPP, which in late 2009, 2010, and 2011 (interview waves 4, 7, and 10) fielded the same topical module:

Medical Expenses/Utilization of Health Care. This module elicited detailed information on medical costs

and usage of the health care system. In this analysis, we focus on the five-point self-reported health

measure, which varies from 1 for “Excellent” to 5 for “Poor.” In this analysis, we follow the Ware et al.


5
  C-SNPs are generally not offered at the state-level; they are offered at the county or collection of county level.
However, the empirical analysis conducted in this study is at the state level, and thus we aggregate availability of
such plans at the state level. Although not shown, we include measures of size of C-SNP plan types as well (e.g., at
least 100 enrollees or at least 1,000 enrollees), without any notable difference in our findings.
6
  Many C-SNP plans are open to multiple types of chronic conditions. We count a plan as belonging to one of these
categories if any of the conditions it covers is one of these condition types.
(2002) rescaling of this measure, 7 as these authors’ scaling analyses suggest that these categorizations do

not represent equal differences in self-rated health. Tables 6 and 7 present results using alternative

categorizations of these health variables, with broadly similar findings.

           Although there are approximately 105,000 respondents in the 2008 SIPP, we limit our analytic

sample to only those respondents in each of these interview waves who were:

           1) Current recipients of Social Security income for a disability in at least one month of the
              current wave
           2) Aged 21 to 64
           3) Currently covered by Medicare in at least one month of the current wave
           4) Not covered by Medicaid in any of the months of the current wave

These restrictions limit the sample to 1,586 unique individuals. Table 3 presents descriptive statistics of

this group. Not surprisingly given their status as SSDI beneficiaries, their health tends to be at the poor

end of the spectrum, with nearly two thirds reporting either Poor or Fair health. We construct a measure

of whether the same individual reports the same or better health as in the last topical module to allow for

comparability with Baicker et al. (2013). This measure excludes all those who reported “Poor” health in

the prior wave, since mechanically such individuals would always have an outcome of one. This measure

shows that the majority of respondents maintain or improve their health between interviews. This under-

65 Medicare population is also relatively old for this age window, with an average age of 54.44.

           Nearly two-thirds of respondents reside in a state with a requirement for insurers to issue at least

one Medigap plan for the under-65 population, whereas only a quarter require that during the open

enrollment period, such under-65 Medicare beneficiaries must not have a higher premium than over-65

Medigap beneficiaries.

           From 2009 to 2011, four states change their Medigap requirement policy: Florida, Georgia, and

Tennessee added the requirement, while Kentucky removed it. In our sample, there are 108 under-65

Medicare beneficiaries for whom we observe self-reported health before and after such a change.




7
    This rescaling assigns values as such: 5 (Excellent), 4.4 (Very Good), 3.4 (Good), 2.0 (Fair), and 1.0 (Poor).
Analysis

Our analytic approach is weighted least squares, using the person-level probability weights from the

SIPP. The most common specification we fit is:

         𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀_𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜌𝜌𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠 + 𝑿𝑿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

Where the outcome variable is SSDI-Medicare beneficiary i’s self-reported health in year t. The

coefficient of interest is β, which measures the effect of being in a state that requires Medigap insurers

provide a Medigap plan for the SSDI-Medicare population. Fixed effects for each state and year are

included, denoted by δ and ρ, while each state’s MA and C-SNP enrollment in the prior year are included

to control for general availability of such alternatives without confounding any effect of the Medigap

policy with same-year MA enrollment, although these measures, given their endogeneity, are not always

included (regardless, there is no statistically significant impact on the estimate if they are included or not).

Finally, X is a matrix of individual-level covariates, including race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Standard

errors are two-way clustered at the state and year level, given that the variation in treatment is at the state-

year level. The inclusion of state- and year-fixed effects thereby identifies the impact of Medigap policy

from states changing their under-65 Medigap policy.

           Table 4 presents linear regression results of the impact of this change on self-reported health,

where health is rescaled according to Ware et al. (2002)’s methodology, which varies from 1 to 5, but

assigns higher values to Good and Very Good health. The columns employ different specifications, with

the addition of demographic controls, state and year fixed effects, and clustering standard errors in a two-

way cluster at the state and year levels. All specifications provide statistically significant and substantial

improvements in self-reported health. Additionally, as we add more controls, the size of the effect

generally becomes larger. Column 4 is the preferred specification for estimating the impact of a state

requiring a Medigap insurer offer plans to the under-65 Medicare population, since it corresponds to a

fully saturated difference-in-differences analysis of the impact of the Medigap requirement on health. 8



8
    Note that with the limited pre- and post-periods, parallel trends assumptions cannot be tested.
There is a 0.193 increase in the five-point health measure, representing an average improvement of

approximately a fifth of a point, or one in five beneficiaries reporting a one point improvement in self-

reported health. 9 Columns 5 and 6 include measures of lagged Medicare Advantage enrollment and for

whether that state had enrollment in one of the three types of C-SNPs shown in Figure 2 in the prior year,

but this inclusion has little statistically significant impact on the estimate.

         Column 7 includes not just the overall under-65 guaranteed issue requirement, but also the

additional types of Medigap regulation; it is worth noting that changes in these types of regulation

occurred only when the guaranteed issuance requirement changed. Nevertheless, the overall coefficient

shows that guaranteed issuance improves health even more. However, having an open enrollment period

requirement mitigates this effect. This finding may initially seem counterintuitive, but such an open

enrollment period without premium rating regulations may limit the affordability of such plans to the

under-65 population. Indeed, the coefficient estimate for states with the strongest premium rating

restriction – under-65 Medicare beneficiaries must be charged the same premium as over-65 beneficiaries

– the effect on improved health is even stronger, if only marginally statistically significant. Finally,

Column 8 estimates the health impact including individual-level fixed effects, thereby absorbing many

potentially confounding selection effects. The estimate, albeit noisier, is statistically indistinguishable

from our preferred specification in Column 4.

         Our overall conclusion from these regressions is that states requiring Medigap insurers to offer at

least one Medigap plan to the under-65 Medicare population measurably and substantially improves this

population’s self-reported health. This improvement is consistent across a range of specifications and

appears even stronger in the presence of additional regulations limiting premium underwriting, although

inference of these regulations is limited by the sample window in question. But to test the robustness and

incidence of our findings, Tables 5 and 6 presents estimates by subpopulation, an alternative data set, and

over populations which should not be directly affected by under-65 Medigap policies.

         Column 1 in Table 5 presents results from our preferred specification (Column 4 in Table 4) for

the purposes of comparison. Column 2 provides a separate interacted marginal effect by sex, indicating

that the improved health effect is stronger for male SSDI beneficiaries. Column 3 provides estimates of

interactions with type of health condition reported by the SIPP respondent: the improved health effect is

even stronger among those with mental health conditions. 10 Given the relative paucity of mental or

behavioral health-specific SNPs and historical restrictions in Medicare coverage of mental-health-related

care (Donohue et al. 2009, Busch et al. 2016), affordable Medigap policies may be of particular use for

SSDI beneficiaries with mental health conditions. Column 4 provides four robustness checks: given that

the within-state variation in Medigap coverage arises from only four states, we conduct four separate

estimates dropping each of these states to determine whether the estimated effect is driven by just a single

state and potential confounding idiosyncrasies of such a state. The estimated effect remains highly

statistically significant and is statistically unchanged from the estimate shown in Column 1. Table 5

therefore shows that there is not a single state driving the estimated effect, and that this effect is strongest

among male SSDI beneficiaries and those beneficiaries reporting a mental health condition.

         Table 6 provides further robustness and falsification tests. Columns 3 through 7 all use the same

Ware-rescaled self-reported health measure from Tables 4 and 5, with Column 3 reporting the result from

the same regression as in Column 4 of Table 4 and Column 1 of Table 5. Columns 1 and 2 show estimates

based on different rescalings of the self-reported health measure: Column 1 shows the effect from a lack

of any scale, preserving the 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Poor) health metric, and providing a nearly identical effect

on health as the Ware-rescaled estimate. Column 2 provides an estimate with the Diehr et al. (2000)

rescaling, from 15 for Poor, 30 for Fair, 80 for Good, 90 for Very Good, and 95 for Excellent. Although

noisier (the Diehr rescaling leads a strongly bimodal rescaling of the self-reported health distribution), the

estimated impact is still statistically significant. Furthermore, the estimated change from our preferred

specification in Column 3 is 3.9% of the maximum health value in the Ware et al. (2002) scale, 11 while

the estimated change in Column 2 is 3.7% of the maximum health value in the Diehr et al. (2001) scale, 12

representing similar impacts on health. Although the Ware-rescaled health measure is our preferred

metric, our results are not dependent on that preference.

           Although the nature of our SIPP sample window is fortunate for its position after the large

Medicare changes of the mid-2000s and before the implementation of the ACA, having health measures

in only 2009, 2010, and 2011 precludes tests of parallel trends or other common difference-in-differences

validation tests. To provide evidence that the policy variable in question is not confounded by other

broader policy changes or effects that could differentially affect health even while controlling for state

and year fixed effects, Columns 4 and 5 report falsification tests where the same analysis is performed on

groups that are not directly affected by under-65 Medigap policies: SSDI beneficiaries who are dually

eligible for Medicaid, and 18-64 year-olds who are not Medicare beneficiaries at all. The former group,

although generally poorer than non-Dual-Eligibles, are nevertheless similar to non-Dual-Eligible

population in being covered by SSDI and having serious health conditions. Medigap insurers are

generally legally barred from selling policies to the Dual Eligible population except in certain situations,

and, in the absence of health spillovers, there should be no effect of state under-65 Medigap regulation on

this group. Although we find a positive point estimate of the Medigap guaranteed issuance requirement on

the health of this population, this estimate is markedly smaller than our prior estimate, and is not nearly

statistically significant. Furthermore, estimates of state Medigap policy on the non-Medicare adult

population are virtually zero. Both these estimates suggest that the estimated effect is due to the state

Medigap policy under question and is not being driven by other unobservable trends.

           Finally, we test whether our results are being driven specifically by the SIPP data set. We draw

upon the cross-sectional CPS Annual Social and Economic Supplement (i.e., the “March CPS” or CPS

     3.507/95 = 0.0369.
ASEC) which contains self-reported health, SSDI receipt, age, state, Medicare coverage, and Medicaid

coverage. Because it is limited in measures of disabling health conditions and is cross-sectional (and thus

does not allow for including individual fixed effects, as in Table 4, Column 8, and does not allow for

estimates of improvements in health as reported in Table 7 which enables comparison to health estimates

from other studies), we prefer the SIPP as our primary data set.

        However, it does have more years of observation, and thus more states’ changes in guaranteed

issuance policy, and Column 6 shows the estimated impact from 2004 to 2013. We find a statistically

similar improvement in health, albeit with a smaller point estimate, in states with Medigap guaranteed

issuance policies for the under-65 Medicare population, following the same state- and year-fixed-effects

approach as in our preferred SIPP specification. However, as discussed above, there were substantial

policy changes to Medicare in the mid-2000s, including the introduction of Part D (and as a result, the

removal of prescription drug coverage from Medigap plans). Column 7 presents the estimate for the same

years used in the SIPP analysis; the estimated improvement of 0.182 health points is remarkably similar

to the SIPP estimate of 0.193, and statistically indistinguishable. Table 6 suggests that our results are not

dependent on any specific SIPP-related issues, and our estimated health improvement passes the

falsification tests, providing null estimates on untreated groups over the same time period. Furthermore,

our results are not dependent on the rescaling of the self-reported health measure.

        We next turn to estimates based on the binary categorization of the self-reported health measure,

a common transformation of self-reported health (Manor, Matthews, and Power 2000). Table 7 shows

estimates on three such binary transformations: an indicator for being in poor or fair health, an indicator

for just being in poor health, and an indicator for whether the self-reported health is at least as good as in

last year’s interview. The latter definition requires limiting the analysis to under-65 Medicare

beneficiaries interviewed in two adjacent years; we also exclude individuals who reported poor health in

the first interview, since such individuals cannot have worse health. This latter measure is comparable to

the Baicker et al. (2013) measure of the impact of the Oregon Medicaid expansion on self-reported health,
wherein the estimated impact of expanded Medicaid coverage was an increased likelihood of reporting

same or better health of 7.84 percentage points.

        Although the impact on the first outcome variable – reporting poor or fair health – is small

(approximately a 3-percentage point reduction in the least squares and probit average marginal effects

specifications) and not statistically significant, the majority of SSDI beneficiaries report being in one of

these two categories, and medical recovery among this population is generally rare (SSA 2016). Limiting

the analysis on the likelihood of reporting poor health, we estimate a decline of approximately 9

percentage points across both the least squares and probit marginal effects specifications, both highly

significant. Since the sample average is 20%, this effect is sizable. These two findings – a small,

statistically insignificant reduction in reporting poor or fair health and large, highly significant reduction

in reporting poor health – suggests that much of the estimated improvement in self-reported health of the

under-65 Medigap guaranteed issuance policy is in moving respondents from poor to fair health.

        For the impact on same or improved health, the estimated effect is approximately 19-20

percentage points across the least squares and probit specifications, nearly three times the size of the

estimate from Baicker et al. (2013). Although this measure is constructed differently and limits its sample

to those not reporting poor health, who, the prior analyses suggest, likely experience the largest health

improvement, this estimate indicates that the impact of state-level Medigap policy on the health of the

under-65 Medicare population is large relative to other health insurance expansion margins, especially

given Medigap is a supplemental insurance policy.

Conclusion

This study examines the impact of state-level regulation of Medigap policies for under-65 Medicare

beneficiaries on these beneficiaries’ health. The overall finding is that when states require insurers to

issue Medigap plans to under-65 Medicare beneficiaries, their self-reported health is substantially higher.

This result is robust to alternative specifications and data sets, as well as to a range of falsification tests

and robustness checks. This effect is strongest for men, those with mental health conditions, and states

that also regulate the premiums that can be charged to under-65 Medicare beneficiaries.
         However, future analyses may provide additional detail as to relevant mechanisms. Currently, the

inclusion of recent enrollment in MA and SNP plans as controls do not statistically impact our central

findings, but policy induced variation in these plans may uncover additional margins for health impacts

(Geruso and Layton 2015, Cabral et al. 2014).

         Finally, although the SIPP data is publicly available, contains repeated health measures, elicits

SSDI, SSI, Medicare, and Medicaid coverage, and has geographic identifiers, it was not designed as a

health survey and does not elicit information on the type of Medicare supplementation beneficiaries have.

Future research will include drawing on the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to measure how state

policies and changes in MA and C-SNP availability change enrollment, utilization, and health, especially

for the populations potentially most affected by the availability and affordability of Medicare

supplementary options, such as those with chronic mental health conditions.

         Overall, the size and robustness of the estimated effect indicates that the SSDI Medicare

population’s health is very sensitive to even supplemental coverage; that is, the policy variation in

question is over the remaining 20% coinsurance and insurance products that limit this cost sharing. The

size of the impact on changes in health indicates that state-level Medigap policy has not just a

comparable, but a substantially larger effect on health for under-65 Medicare beneficiaries than Medicaid

expansion on the marginal Oregon Medicaid entrant. Although this estimated effect on self-reported

health is large and robust, additional research is required to estimate the effects of these Medigap policies

on specific morbidity and mortality outcomes, as well as functional impairments and limitations to daily

living activities.
