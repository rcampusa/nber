The Mysterious Growing Value of S&P 500 Membership

JEL No. G0



                                               ABSTRACT

        The efficient markets hypothesis implies that passive indexing should generate as high a return
as active fund management. Indexing has been a very successful strategy. We document a large value
premium in the average q ratios of firms in the S&P 500 index relative to the q ratios of other similar
firms that appears in the mid 1980s and grows in step with the growth of indexing. Passive investment
strategies that require the purchase of the particular 500 stocks in this index increase demand for those
stocks and so push up their prices. In short, indexing induces downward sloping demand curves for stocks
in the index. For reasons that are not fully clear, arbitrageurs apparently do not correct this overvaluation.

1.     Introduction

       When asked for investment advice at cocktail parties, most finance professors hesitantly

recommend a well-diversified index fund, such as one that tracks the Standard and Poor’s (S&P)

500 Index of blue chip shares. This advice may have been far sounder than its propagators ever

imagined.

       The view that investors should entrust their savings to a well-diversified index fund

follows from the semi-strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH), which states that

no publicly available information is useful in predicting stock returns. Despite a large literature

on market anomalies, behavioral studies of investors, and the like, the hypothesis that the market

is semi-strong form efficient retains its place of prominence in introductory finance textbooks,

for studies critical of it have yet to coalesce into a coherent alternative framework.

       If the semi-strong form of the EMH is valid, and it is impossible to pick stocks that will

perform better than average on a risk adjusted basis, the optimal investment strategy is to keep

transactions costs low and remain widely diversified. Index funds generally accomplish these

two goals better than other investment channels available to typical cocktail party guests.

       Increasingly, even big institutional investors ‘index’ large and growing fractions of their

portfolios. That is, they relegate large and growing pools of money to ‘passive’ investment

strategies, such as buying and holding the stocks in the S&P 500 Index. The growing importance

of indexing makes an understanding of its economic consequences an important question.

       There is now considerable evidence that the demand curves of stocks in important

indexes, such as the S&P 500, slope down. Shleifer (1986) finds that a company’s stock price

rises significantly on the news that it will be added to the S&P 500, and argues that this value

increase is permanent. Shleifer concludes that stocks, like ordinary economic goods, have


                                                  1
downward sloping demand curves and that share purchases by index funds constitute outward

shifts in these demand that generate the price increases he observes.

         Although Shleifer contends that the price increases he detects are permanent, the power

of long-term abnormal return tests is weak and subsequent evidence on this point has been

mixed. In this paper, we argue that if the increased value associated with inclusion in the S&P

index is indeed permanent, it should be detectable in average Tobin’s q ratios.

         We find that membership in the S&P 500 index is associated with significantly higher

valuation, measured by average Tobin’s q ratios, even after controlling for standard variables

known to affect q ratios. This finding is highly robust, and the S&P 500 membership value

premium rises steadily from 1978 to 1997 in step with the growth of indexing. Granger causality

tests suggest that being in the index causes the value premium; and that, while it cannot be

rejected in some specifications, reverse causation is less statistically important.

         One interpretation of this finding is that there is a presently unknown intangible asset

associated with membership in the S&P 500 that has grow steadily more valuable over time and

that assets manifests in share value premiums when (or after) the shares are included in the

index.

         Another interpretation is that the demand curves of stocks in the S&P 500 index slope do

slope downward, and that the increased demand associated with increased ‘passive’ investment

has had the fortuitous effect of pushing up the prices of S&P 500 stocks relative to those of other

similar firms, justifying that investment strategy.

         We argue that the second explanation may be the more plausible one, and that the

cocktail party advice, which adherents to the efficient markets hypothesis have promulgated,




                                                  2
may have had the perverse effect of undermining the efficiency of the stock market.

Nonetheless, it turned out to be very good advice.



1.1    Share Value Effects Associated with Index Membership

       The basic finding of Shleifer (1986) is that, when a firm is added to the S&P 500 index

between 1976 and 1983, its stock price rises by 2.79 percent. Shleifer argues that this increase is

both permanent and unrelated to any change in the fundamental value of the stock.

Consequently, Shleifer (1986, 2000) argues that this finding implies that the demand curves for

stocks in the index slope downward.

       This interpretation is illustrated in Figure 1. When a stock is added to a widely tracked

index, the added demand by passive investors shifts its demand curve to shift out, from D to D1.

This causes its price to rise from P to P1, generating the abnormal return Shleifer (1985)

documents.



[Figure 1 about here]



       As Scholes (1972) and Shleifer (2000) point out, the demand curve for any good is flat if

it has perfect substitutes that are in unlimited totally elastic supply.      The assumption that

financial assets have infinitely many such perfect substitutes underlies most asset pricing models,

in that they assume the demand for an asset to depend only on its expected return and risk. Any

other asset, or combination of assets, with the same expected return and risk is a perfect

substitute that can be arbitraged infinitely against the asset in question. It is therefore not

surprising that Shleifer’s (1986) interpretation of his findings has been controversial.




                                                 3
         Harris and Gurel (1986) challenge Shleifer’s first contention that the effect is permanent.

They argue that purchases by index funds create only a temporary spike in demand for the newly

included stock because potential sellers do not respond immediately. In their view, this delay

causes a temporary price increase that is soon reversed. They use index inclusions from 1978

through 1983 to demonstrate an announcement date abnormal return of 3.13 percent and,

critically, an offsetting -2.49 percent cumulative abnormal return of over the subsequent 29

trading days. They thus cannot reject a complete reversal. In contrast, Beneish and Whaley

(1996) and Lynch and Mendenhall (1997) find only partial reversals in the event windows they

study.

         However, Jain (1987) and Dhillon and Johnson (1991) replicate Shleifer’s (1986) finding

rejecting a complete reversal. Dhillon and Johnson (1991) also show that the prices of call

options on newly included stocks increase on the announcement date. Since corresponding put

prices do not rise, these increases are not caused by increased implied volatility. Taken together,

these findings indicate options markets expect the stock price increase to last - at least past the

maturity of the options.

         Kaul et al. (2000) study a rejigging of the weights of companies in the Toronto Stock

Exchange (TSE) 300 index, which is tracked by Canadian index funds. The index weights of

some companies rose, while those of others fell, and their share prices rose or fell in proportion

when the rejigging was implemented. Kaul et al. reject a complete reversal until long after

trading volume and spreads have returned to normal. Their tests lose power over very long

horizons, but their point estimates suggest that the abnormal returns are not reversed.

         In summary, Shleifer’s (1986) inference that the abnormal returns he detects are largely

permanent remains subject to debate, though more recent evidence tends to support his initial




                                                  4
view. In this study, we test for a statistically significant value premium in the abnormal average

Tobin’s q ratios of S&P 500 firms relative to those of other similar firms. We argue that the

effect detected by Shleifer and others is indeed permanent because we detect an unambiguous q

ratio premium in S&P 500 firms in cross-sectional regressions.

       Shleifer’s (1986) second contention that inclusion in the S&P index is unrelated to any

revision in investors’ estimate of the stocks’ fundamental values is also controversial. Dhillon

and Johnson (1991) show that included firms’ bond prices rise in step with their stock prices, and

Jain (1987) finds abnormal returns for inclusions into industry indexes that are not used as

passive investment benchmarks. These authors suggest that inclusion in the index amounts to a

“certification of quality”, and that this is the ultimate cause of the value increase. Since Standard

and Poor’s rates bonds as its core business, such a certification effect would seem plausible.

       However, more recent studies support Shleifer’s original interpretation. First, Wurgler

and Zhuravskaya (2000) find that the abnormal returns associated with inclusion in the S&P 500

are larger for stocks that are less likely to have close substitutes. Second, the Kaul et al. (2000)

result is clearly not due to a certification effect as the event studied is a mechanical

rearrangement of the weights of stocks already in a widely followed index. Since no new stocks

were added to the index, a certification effect can be ruled out categorically.

       Thus, Shleifer’s (1986) second contention, that the effect is unrelated to any change in the

included stock’s fundamental value, is also controversial, but again, more recent studies tend to

confirm his interpretation of his finding. In this study, we argue that Shleifer’s contention of an

outward shift in demand caused by index funds holdings is plausible because the q ratio premium

for S&P 500 member firms rises over time, in step with the rising popularity of indexing.




                                                 5
2.     Empirical Framework

       Our empirical analysis compares the actual market value of firm j in year t, Vt,j, with an

estimate of that value based on a vector of reported financial data, xj,t. Thus, we consider



[1]    Vt , j = f t (x t , j ) + ε t , j .



If we find that firms in the S&P Index consistently have market values higher than those we

predict, we can conclude that S&P membership is associated with higher market value. That is,

we interpret a positive εt,j as indicating a high market value. We postulate that xt,j should include

a variable representing membership in the S&P 500 index

       As a first approximation, we assume the functional form



[2]     f t (x t , j ) = β 0,t At , j + β 1,t rd t , j + β 2,t advt , j + β 3,t debt t , j + β 4,t n( At , j ) .



That is, we assume firm j’s market value to be proportional to the replacement cost of its tangible

assets, At,j, plus an additional effect associated with possession of proprietary technology, which

we assume proportional to research and development spending, rdt,j, and another effect

associated with the possession of brand names and the like, which we take to be proportional to

advertising spending, advt,j. We allow for a possible effect on value of leverage, debtt,j, and also

allow for a nonlinear relationship of market value to tangible assets replacement cost by

including an effect proportional to some function n(At,j).

       We thus consider




                                                                       6
[3]     Vt , j = β 0,t At , j + β 1,t rd t , j + β 2,t advt , j + β 3,t debt t , j + β 4,t n( At , j ) + ε t , j .




        It is plausible that the value of β0,t might differ across industries. Typical firms in

industries where certain sorts of intangible assets are important, such as newspapers, where

subscriber lists are a key asset, might have a much higher market value per dollar of tangible

replacement cost than would firms in industries such as cement manufacturing, where tangible

assets account for most of firms’ market values. This line of reasoning suggests that we replace

                              ∑
                                  I
β0,tAt,j in [3] with           i =1
                                      γ i ,t δ t ,i , j At , j where



                     0 if firm j is not in industry i in year t
[4]      δ t ,i , j ≡ 
                     1 if firm j is in industry i in year t



and the γi,t are a vector of 3-digit SIC code industry-specific estimated coefficients.

        Heteroskedasticity problems make the estimation of [3] by least squares problematic

because both positive and negative valuation errors are likely to be larger for larger firms. That

is, εt,j is likely to be proportional to measures of firm size, such as At,j. Since least squares

estimation techniques place greater weight on more extreme observations, direct estimation of

[3] risks ignoring smaller firms. To remedy this, we divide through [3] by At,j to get



         Vt , j                                        rd t , j              advt , j              debt t , j
                  = ∑i =1 γ i ,t δ t ,i , j + β 1,t
                          I
[5]                                                               + β 2 ,t              + β 3, t                + β 4,t n′( At , j ) + ζ t , j ,
         At , j                                          At , j               At , j                 At , j



where the transformed error term,



                                                                                  7
                    ε t, j
[6]     ζ t, j ≡                 ,
                     At , j



is plausibly independently and identically distributed (iid) across firms within each time period.

Note that the dependent variable in [5] is equal to firm j’s average q ratio in year t.

        Our objective is to test for a valuation effect associated with S&P 500 index membership

in each year. We therefore expect ζt,j to be larger for firms that are in the index. That is, we

expect that



[7]     ζ t , j = β 5 ,tη t , j + u t , j ,



where



                    0 if firm j is not in the index in year t
[8]     ηt , j ≡ 
                    1 if firm j is in the index in year t



and ut,j is an iid error.

        Our empirical framework is thus to estimate the regression



         Vt , j                                       rd t , j              advt , j              debt t , j
                  = ∑i =1 γ i ,t δ t ,i , j + β 1,t
                             I
[9]                                                              + β 2 ,t              + β 3, t                + β 4,t ln( At , j ) + β 5,tη t , j + u t , j
         At , j                                        At , j                At , j                 At , j




                                                                                 8
cross-sectionally in each time period t. We test directly for a valuation effect by testing the

statistical and economic significance of β5,t and observing how the value and significance of this

coefficient change over time.

           The S&P 500 index is value-weighted, so some firms make up greater parts of the index

portfolio than others. We measure the importance of a firm in the index by its value weight,



                            ηt , jVcs ,t , j
[10]       wt , j ≡
                      ∑    k∈S & P 500
                                         Vcs ,t ,k




Our second empirical test is therefore to run the regression



           Vt , j                                     rd t , j             advt , j             debtt , j
                    = ∑i =1 γ i ,tδ t ,i , j + β1,t
                           I
[11]                                                             + β 2,t              + β 3,t               + β 4,t ln( At , j ) + β 5,t wt , j + ut , j
           At , j                                      At , j               At , j                At , j



cross-sectionally in each time period t and again to note the statistical and economic significance

of β5,t.

           To test whether index membership causes higher firm values or higher firm value causes

index membership, we supplement this regression analysis with some simple Granger causality

tests (see Granger, 1969; Sims, 1972). We detrend the coefficient from (9) and (11) by taking

either first differences or first differences of logarithms (rates of growth). Durbin-Watson

statistics reject the hypotheses that the detrended series are autocorrelated.

           To test the hypothesis that indexing ‘causes’ a valuation premium for stocks in the index,

we then regress




                                                                                      9
        β 5,t = γ 0 + ∑ z =1 λz β 5,t − z + ∑z =0 κ z xt − z +zt
                          L                      L
[12]

where β 5,τ now represents the detrended coefficient from either (9) or (11), xt is now the

detrended amount of money indexes to the S&P 500 Index in year t, and zt is a roughly iid error.

That is, we regress the measures of the detrended S&P500 value premium on lagged values of

itself and on current and on the detrended value of funds indexed to the S&P500.

       We then run the restricted regression

        β 5,t = θ 0 + ∑ z =1ϑ z β 5,t − z +υ t
                           L
[13]

without current and past values of xt.

       We test the joint significance of {κ1, … κL} by testing whether the sum of squared

residuals of the restricted regression is significantly larger than that of the corresponding

unrestricted regression. If the difference in sums of squared residuals is statistically significant,

we concluded that indexing ‘Granger-causes’ the valuation premium (or, changes in indexing

Granger-cause changes in the valuation premium).

       To compare the sum of squared errors of the restricted regression [13], denoted SSE(u)

with that of the unrestricted regression [12], denoted SSE(r), we employ the statistic

               [ SSE (r ) − SSE (u)] / L
[14]    s1 ≡                             ,
                SSE (u) / (n − 2 L − 1)

which has an F distribution with one and n – 2L – 1 degrees of freedom, where L is the number

of lags and n the number of observations. An alternative approach is to use the statistic

               SSE (r ) − SSE (u)
[15]    s2 ≡                      ,
                  SSE (u) / n

which has a χ2 distribution with n degrees of freedom.




                                                                   10
       We then test for reverse causality by switching the dependent and independent variables

in [12] and [13], and repeating the whole procedure.

       We find that β5 grows steadily in magnitude through our sample period from 1978 to

1997, and that this growth roughly tracks the growth in S&P 500 indexing. Our Granger

causality tests are more consistent with the view that growth in the amount of money indexed to

the S&P 500 index causes the increased valuation effect associated with index membership or

index weight than with the reverse.




3.     Construction of Data Sample and Key Variables
       This section is a technical explanation of the construction of our data sample and key

variables.



3.1    Data Sample

       Our basic sample begins with all firms listed in Compustat in the twenty-year panel from

1978 to 1997. We do not include firms in banking and financial industries - Standard Industrial

Classification (S.I.C.) codes 6,000 through 6,999 – as accounting information for these firms is

not comparable to that of other firms. We delete observations in which sales, the share price, the

number of shares outstanding, inventories, or property plant and equipment (PPE) are missing or

negative. Where these variables are present, but entries for research and development spending,

advertising spending, short term debt, long term debt, or non-inventory short-term assets are

missing, the missing variables are assumed to be nil.          We call the resulting firm-year

observations our basic sample.




                                               11
          We define a company as being in the S&P 500 Index in year t if it is in the index on

December 31 of that year. To construct the list of S&P 500 members for each year, we begin

with the current year’s list of members and work backwards, adjusting the list for firms dropped

from and added to the index each year.1 We double-check the resulting sequence of lists by

purchasing from Standard and Poor’s Corporation its S&P 500 membership list for 1982, the

earliest year for which such data are available. Where discrepancies were found, they were

corrected using newspaper records. This procedure generates our index firms sample for each

year.

          The first column in Table 1 lists the number of S&P500 index firms we use each year.

The number is less than 500 because some firms in the index are financial firms, and so are

excluded from our basic sample.      We refer to this index subsample as I1.

          We wish to contrast S&P 500 index member firms against other comparable firms. We

do this in two ways: by using a multiple regression framework across a broad sample of non-

S&P500 firms and by constructing subsamples of matched pair firms.

          The second column of Table one lists the number of firms in the basic sample each year

that are not members of the S&P 500 index and that are at least as large as the smallest S&P 500

firm that year. Size is measured as estimated replacement cost, the construction of which

variable is described below. This subsample, denoted C, we call our control subsample. We do

not include firms smaller than the smallest S&P500 index firm for a specific year on the grounds

that very small firms may not be valued by investors in the same way as larger firms. This

subsample contains some extreme observations, which probably reflect coding errors by

Compustat.2 We therefore winsorize the data at the first and 99th percentiles for all important

variables.

       The third and fourth columns in Table 1 list the number of S&P firms for which industry

and size matched pair firms are available. We select matching firms for each index firm as

follows. We define our match candidate sample as our basic sample less S&P index firms. For

each year, we first match each index firm with a list of all candidate sample firms having the

same primary three-digit industry code. We then rank each potential match by the percentage

difference between its replacement cost and that of the index firm in question. The potential

matching firm closest to the index firm by this metric is then chosen as the industry and size

matched firm corresponding to that index firm. If there are several index firms in the same

industry, we match the smallest firm first, then delete its match from the candidate sample, and

then match the next smallest firm. This process insures that each S&P index firm has a unique

industry and size matching control firm.     In some cases, the number of index firms in an

industry exceeds the number of candidate firms. If this occurs, several S&P firms are paired

with the same control firm. The control firm observation only appears once, so the match index

subsample, denoted M1, may be smaller than I in some years.

       Some of the matched pairs of index and control firms in I and M1 are not terribly close

matches. We therefore delete match pairs where the difference in replacement cost between the

index firm and its match is greater than half that of the index firm. The remaining samples or

 We checked a randomly selected ten extreme observations in the ratios displayed in Table 2 by
comparing Compustat figures to printed annual reports. Of these, 7 observations or 70%, reflect
coding errors by Compustat, such as misplaced decimal points. A similar check of ten
observations from the central parts of the distributions characterized in Table 2 found no coding
errors. We therefore correct the 7 erroneous observations and then winsorize the resulting
sample at the first and 99th percentiles on the grounds that tail observations contain a
disproportionately high fraction of coding errors.

subsample and close match controls subsamples.

       We run our regressions first on the subsample of index firms and control firms at least as

large as the smallest index firm that year. We then repeat our regressions on the matched pairs

of index and control firms. Finally we re-estimate our regressions using the close match pairs

3.2    Construction of Key Variables

       Our key variables are constructed from Compustat data. In using this data, it is necessary

to adjust for Compustat’s fiscal year-end convention. Compustat defines the data from fiscal

years ending between June 1 of year t-1 and May 31 of year t as ‘year t data’. We redefine the

data so that year t data is the data from the fiscal year that ended during the calendar year t. This

adjustment is necessary, since we wish to explain variables constructed from calendar year-end

share prices with accounting data, and do not wish to use future information to predict the past.

Unless otherwise indicated, all data are in current dollars.

       Table 2 displays simple univariate statistics for these variables, whose construction we

now describe in detail in the remainder of this section - which can be omitted by the reader

without loss of continuity.



[Table 2 about here]




                                                 14
Market Value

        The market value of a firm is essentially a marking to market of all the components of the

liabilities and net worth side of it’s balance sheet. We take the market value, Vt,j, of firm j at time

t to be the market value of all outstanding equity plus the market value of all outstanding debts.

This subsection describes in detail the construction of each of these components of Vt,j.

        First, we take the market value of common stock, Vcs,t,j, to be the price per share on

December 31 times the number of shares outstanding.3 The market value of preferred shares,

Vps,t,j, is the net number of preferred shares outstanding in the event of involuntary liquidation

multiplied by their per share involuntary liquidating value.4 Data to construct both Vcs,t,j and

Vps,t,j are taken from Compustat.

        Second, market value of net short-term debts, Vsd,t,j, is assumed equal to their book value.

Since their short durations render the market and book values similar for short-term liabilities

and most short-term assets, we take them at book value. 5

        Third, we estimate the market value of long-term debt as



                                                            rt − a                         
                             20             t −a                                           
                                                               2                 1
[16]    Vld ,t , j ≅ Bld ,t , j ∑   f a ,t , j ∑                          +                ,
                             a =2              s =t         rt 2*( s −t )       r          
                                                     (1 +       )           (1 + t ) 2*a   
                                                            2                    2         



where Bld,t,j is the book value of the firm’s long-term debts at the end of year t, fa,t,j is the fraction

of firm j’s long-term debt that is a years old as of year t, and rt is average Moody’s BAA bond

rate for year t.6 We thus take the difference between the book value of the firm’s long-term

debts in year t-a and year t-a-1 to be the book value of it’s a-year-old debt. The book value of

vintage a debt is multiplied by the market value of BAA debt of that age per dollar of book

value, estimated using the standard formula for the price of 20-year debt issued at par a years

ago.

          We are thus simplifying by assuming all debt to be 20-year BAA coupon bonds issued at

par and that the current BAA rate is an appropriate discount rate for pricing future coupons and

final debt payments. We are also ignoring call features, security, and other factors that can cause

bond prices to deviate from the simple coupon bond formula. Thus, bond prices are year-

specific, but not firm-specific.

          Long-term debt with one year to maturity is treated as short-term debt. We take the

fraction of the firm’s debt that is a years old as



                          Bld ,t − a , j − Bld ,t − a −1, j
[17]       f a ,t , j ≅                                       .
                                     Bld ,t , j

          In some cases, it is not possible to obtain precise values for the book values of long-term

debt in all 19 previous years. We therefore use an estimated debt age structure based on the

aggregate fractional debt age structure across all firms in Compustat in that year. To do this, we

sum the book values of long-term debt outstanding for all Compustat firms in each year and then

take differences between the sums for each pair of successive years to construct an aggregate

long-term debt age profile. We divide the components of each 19-year-long age profile by the

total long-term debt outstanding in the 20th year to get an average fractional age structure for

long-term debt in each year. Thus, we take

                                                                  16

                                     j t, j




Thus, if the values of fj,a,t are missing for a < a0, we renormalize the corresponding fa,t for the

missing debt vintages to obtain approximations for the missing fractions using



                                1 − ∑ a ≥ a f a ,t , j     

                                     a < a 0 a ,t          



          Finally, we take the market value, Vt,j, of firm j at time t to be the sum of the market

values of common and preferred equity, net short-term liabilities, and long-term debts,



 [20] Vt , j ≡ Vcs ,t , j + V pf ,t , j + Vsd ,t , j + Vld ,t , j .




Replacement Cost

          The replacement cost of a firm’s tangible assets is essentially a marking to market of all

the entries on the assets side of its balance sheet.                       Ideally, we would estimate a firm’s

replacement cost by making a detailed list of all the firm’s individual assets and obtaining a

value for each from second-hand capital goods markets. In practice, this is not possible because

firms’ asset accounts are not sufficiently detailed and because appropriate second-hand capital

goods markets prices are often not available. Moreover, many of the assets that make up a

typical firm are industry-specific. Others, such as proprietary technology or reputation are



                                                                      17
intangible, and are missing from conventional accounting balance sheets. Because of these

complications, we begin by estimating the part of replacement cost that can be estimated with a

degree of confidence, and then consider a series of control variables that are plausibly related to

these missing components of true replacement cost.

         We begin by taking the replacement cost of firm j’s tangible assets at time t, At,j, to be the

sum of the market values of its property, plant and equipment (PP&E), Appe,t,j, inventories, Ainv,t,j,

‘other assets’, Aoa,t,j and net current asset Anca,t,j.            This subsection describes in detail the

construction of each of these components of At,j.

         To estimate Appe,t,j, we begin with the book value of firm j’s net PP&E in year t, denoted

Bppe,t,j.7 The Appe,t,j are estimated as



                                          pˆ t
[21]      Appe,t , j ≅ B ppe,t , j                    ,
                                       pˆ t −at , j




where p̂t is a capital goods price index (the fixed non-residential investments GDP deflator) and

at,j is the average age of firm j’s PP&E in year t.

         We estimate at,j as



                    B Gppe ,t , j − B ppe,t , j
[22]     at, j ≅                                          ,
                              Dt , j

    Compustat item 8.


                                                              18
where B Gppe,t , j and Dt,j are the ‘gross value of PP&E’ and ‘income statement depreciation’ of firm

j as reported for the fiscal year ending in year t.8 While at,j ≥ 19, at,j = 19, and if at,j ≤ 0, at,j = 0.

          To estimate Ainv,t,j, the value of firm j’s inventories in time t, we follow different

procedures depending on the inventory accounting method used by the firm.9 If the firm reports

inventories using the ‘first in first out’ (FIFO) method, the book value of inventories is likely to

be close to the market value, and no adjustment in necessary. If the firm uses ‘last in first out’

(LIFO) accounting, the book value of inventories is based on old prices, and may thus deviate

from market value – especially during and after periods of high inflation.

          Accordingly, the reported inventories value for firms using LIFO, Binv,t,j, is adjusted

recursively as



                            pt
           Ainv ,t , j =         Ainv ,t −1, j + ( Binv ,t , j − Binv ,t −1, j )        for Binv ,t , j ≥ Binv ,t −1, j
                           pt −1

[23]

                            pt
           Ainv ,t , j =          Ainv ,t −1, j * ( Binv ,t , j / Binv ,t −1, j )       for Binv ,t , j < Binv ,t −1, j
                           p t −1



where pt is PPI deflator for year t.10                             The market value of inventories is taken as equal to the

book value in the first year in which the firms is listed in Compustat.

          Some firms use several inventory accounting methods. For these firms, Compustat ranks

the methods in order of importance. We use the rules of thumb described in Table 3 to apply

[17] to fractions of these firms’ inventories.

    B Gppe,t , j is Compustat item 7.

    Firms’ inventory accounting methods are from Compustat item 59.


                                                                                   19
[Table 3 about here]



        Thus, each year, we apply the recursive formula [17] to the fraction of the firm’s

inventories listed in the third column of Table 2, and assume the market value of the remainder

of the firm’s inventories to equal their book value.

        To estimate Aoa,t,j, the market value of ‘other assets’, we consider reported ‘investments in

unconsolidated subsidiaries’, ‘other investments’, and ‘investments in intangibles’.11 Since these

assets are carried at historical cost, their book values may understate their true replacement costs.

We therefore adjust these book values using a recursive procedure identical to that described for

LIFO inventories in [17]. The only difference is that the deflator in calculating Aoa,t,j is the fixed

non-residential investment GDP deflator instead of PPI deflator in the Ainv, formula.

        The last component of tangible replacement cost is ‘net current assets’, Anca,t,j, (net of

inventories, which are adjusted to market above). Remaining current assets include ‘cash &

short term investments’, ‘receivables’, and ‘other current assets’. Since these assets are quite

liquid, their book values are reasonable estimates of their market values. We thus value ‘net

current assets’ at the total book value of current asset minus the total book value of inventories.12

        Finally, we take the tangible assets replacement cost of firm j at time t, At,j, as the sum of

the estimated replacement costs of PP&E, inventories and ‘other assets’,

Note that At,j is expressed in 1982 dollars.



Tobin’s Average q Ratio

          In this analysis, we are interested in the total market values of firms, not their investment

opportunities. That is, we are concerned with whether or not S&P membership boosts the market

value of a firm, not the value of its marginal capital investment. We therefore require an estimate

of Tobin’s average q, not Tobin’s marginal q as estimated, for example, by Durnev et al. (2001).

We take Tobin’s average q as

                     Vt , j
[25]      qt , j ≡
                     At , j



Control variables

          In this section, we describe the construction of the control variables introduced in the

Empirical Framework section above.

          We define industries dummies using three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC)

codes, as provided by Compustat. Each firm’s industry code is defined as the industry code of

the segment reporting the largest volume of sales in the relevant year.

          We take advertising, advt,j, and research and development (R&D) expense, rdj,t, as

reported in Compustat.13 If these variables are listed as ‘negligible’, they are set to zero. If they

are coded as ‘missing’, we assume they were not disclosed and therefore were judged by the

auditor to be negligible.

        We estimate each firm’s total debt in each year as the sum of the market values of long

and short-term debts,



[25]    debt t , j = Vsd ,t , j + Vld ,t , j



        Non-linear effects on market value associated with firm size are captured by the

logarithm of the replacement cost of the firm.

        We include industry fixed effects, either directly using three-digit SIC code dummies or

indirectly by adjusting our average q ratios. The adjustment is

                             nt ,i ( t , j ) qt ,i ( t , j ) − qt , j 
[26]    q$t , j ≡ qt , j −                                           
                                        nt ,i ( t , j ) − 1            

where firm j is in industry i(t,j) in period t, which industry contains nt,i firms and where qt,i(t,j) is

the mean average q of all firms in industry i(t,j). Thus, the adjusted average q is the original

average q ratio minus the mean of the average q ratios of all other firms in the same industry

(excluding the firm in question). If nt,i = 1, the observation is dropped. This second approach is

econometrically preferable to simple fixed effects if some industries contain very few firms.



S&P Membership

        Our primary measure of S&P membership is an S&P 500 membership indicator variable



                    0 if firm j is not in the index in year t
[27]    ηt , j ≡ 
                    1 if firm j is in the index in year t



The procedure for classifying firms as S&P member firms is discussed in detail above in the


                                                                            22
We measure the importance of each firm in the index each year with an S&P 500 Index weight

variable, defined as



                    η t , jVcs ,t , j
[28]    wt , j ≡
                   ∑ j ηt , jVcs,t , j


where Vcs,t,j is the market value of firm j’s common stock at the end of calendar year t. The

variable wt,j thus measures the weight of firm j in the value-weighted S&P 500 index in year t.

For firms not included in S&P500, this weight equals zero by construction.



Assets Indexed to the S&P 500

       In the Granger-Sims causality tests below, we require an estimate of the amount of

money invested in passively tracking the S&P 500 Index. Besides the numerous mutual funds

indexed to S&P 500, a huge amount of money is informally indexed to the S&P 500 by corporate

and public sector pension funds. In addition, many actively managed funds use the S&P 500 as a

benchmark. This creates an incentive for their managers to invest money in the S&P index and

then deviate from that strategy when they feel they have private information. The result is

another tier of less formally indexed investment. These considerations make measuring the total

value of assets indexed to S&P 500 a virtual impossibility.

       We therefore must employ a proxy variable that is roughly proportional to the value of

S&P indexed assets. Our primary proxy for funds indexed to S&P 500 index is the net market

capitalization of Vanguard 500 index fund, the first index fund. The Vanguard 500 fund is the

oldest and largest index fund. It was established in 1976, and its success led to the establishment

of numerous other funds. Thus, in the first years of its existence, the Vanguard 500 is a good

proxy for assets indexed to the S&P 500, but in later years, it captures a smaller share of the

action. This measure is available from Vanguard Group for the years 1976 through 1997, the last

year of our data.

       As an alternative proxy, we employ the total market capitalization of the Vanguard index

fund family, which includes not only the index funds that track the S&P 500, but also those that

track other indices. The advantage of this proxy is that it is more likely to accurately reflect the

full extent of the growth of indexing in the 1980s and 1990s. Its disadvantage is that it is not

confined to S&P 500 funds. This measure is available from S&P 500 Net Advantage for 1978

through 1997.

       Our final proxy for the value of funds indexed to the S&P 500 is the total market value of

53 selected index funds in United States. This measure is available from Grand Prix Research for

1978 through 1997.



4.     Findings

       Table 4 displays means of Tobin’s average q ratios, defined as market value per dollar of

replacement cost or Vtj/Atj, for firms in the S&P 500 index and for various control firm

subsamples. The left panel compares index firms with all control firms at least as large as the

smallest index firm in the relevant year. The middle panel contrasts index firms with size and

industry matched non-index firms for each year. The right panel repeats this, but only including

matched pairs that are close to the same size. In all three panels, no value premium is evident in

the early years of our sample window. In the first two panels, the premium is statistically

insignificant., while in the rightmost panel, a significant value discount associated with index

membership is apparent in some years. However, from 1986 on, a statistically significant



                                                24
positive value premium associated with membership in the S&P 500 index is evident. Moreover,

this premium grows steadily with time.



[Table 4 about here]



        The t-tests described in Table 4 are standard two-tail t-tests. Substituting Bonforoni t-

tests, which control for difference in the size of the two subsamples being compared, yield a

similar pattern of statistical significance.



4.1     Regression Results

        We run OLS regression of average Tobin’s average q on S&P 500 membership,

controlling for three-digit industry fixed effects, R&D spending, advertising spending, leverage

and firm size, as described in equation 9, for each year from 1978 to 1997. Table 5 presents

representative regressions for 1978, 1988, and 1997 run on the same three subsamples used in

Table 4. Consistent with typical average q regressions, we find significant positive coefficients

on R&D spending, advertising spending, and leverage, and significant negative coefficients on

firm size measures.

        The coefficients of interest in Table 5 are those of the S&P 500 membership dummy,

which are positive and significant in all three years and in all specifications. The economically

important point from Table 5 is that this coefficient is low in 1978, higher in 1988, and much

higher in 1997 in all specifications. This indicates an increasing valuation premium associated

with S&P500 membership through our observation window.




                                               25
[Tables 5 and 6 about here]



       Table 6 repeats the regressions in Table 5, but substitutes each firm’s weight in the S&P

500 index for the index membership dummy. Firms not in the index have an index weight of

zero. The weight of a firm in the index is the market value of its equity divided by that of all 500

firms in the index.    Table 6 thus tests for a relationship between average q and the importance

of a firm in the index., rather than its mere presence in the index The coefficients of index

weight are also positive and significant in all years and specifications, uniformly higher in 1988

than in 1978, and highest in 1997.

       The differences in value associated with S&P inclusion are economically as well as

statistically significant. For example, regression 5.3 shows that inclusion in the S&P 500 in 1997

is associated with a 46.6% premium in average q, - substantially larger than the 7.7% premium

for 1978. Given a 1997 average replacement cost for S&P500 firms of $8 billion, this implies an

addition to shareholder value of $3.8 billion for the typical index firm, and of about $1.9 trillion

dollars for all S&P 500 index firms.



[Table 7 about here]



       Table 7 displays the regression coefficients of S&P membership dummies and S&P

weights in regressions analogous to those in Tables 5 and 6 for all years from 1978 to 1997. The

coefficients of control variables are not shown to conserve space and enhance readability. There

is a clear and near uniform upward trend in the addition to shareholder value associated with

S&P index membership and weight. This is illustrated graphically in Figures 2 and 3.




                                                26
[Figure 2 about here]



       We conclude that a large value premium for S&P 500 member firms has developed over

the past two decades, and that this premium is proportional to the weight of the firm in the S&P

500 index.



4.2    Regression Robustness Checks

       Reasonable changes in the sample or specification of the regressions we run generate

qualitatively similar results, by which we mean that the signs, relative magnitudes, and

significance patterns of the coefficients on S&P membership or weight are similar to those

shown in the Tables.

       The results shown contrast index firms with non-index firms larger than the smallest S&P

500 firm that year. Using cutoffs of 50% or 25% the size of the smallest S&P 500 firm that year

generates qualitatively similar results.

       The regressions shown use data that is Winsorized at the first and 99th percentiles.

Winsorizing at the 5th and 95th percentiles generates qualitatively similar results. Alternative

ways of dealing with outliers include using Cook’s D statistics to delete selected observations,

deleting “obvious outliers” based on visual inspection of the distribution, and substituting ranks

for all continuous variables in the regressions.      All three alternative techniques produce

qualitatively similar results to those shown.

       The regression variables are normalized by estimated replacement cost. Any reasonable

alternative measure of firm size that maintains a fixed proportion with replacement cost can also




                                                27
be used. Normalizing all variables by sales instead of replacement cost, and using sales to

measure firm size, generates qualitatively similar results. Normalizing all variables by book

value results in the same pattern of parameters and significance levels.

       We use total debt to measure leverage.             Substituting long-term debt generates

qualitatively similar results. We use the logarithm of replacement cost to control for size in the

regressions shown. Using the dollar value of replacement cost generates qualitatively similar

findings.

       Our replacement cost estimation technique yields, as a by-product, an estimate of the

average age of a firm’s physical capital. Adding the average age of physical capital or its

logarithm generates qualitatively similar results.

       We conclude that our finding of a value premium associated with S&P 500 membership

is highly robust.



The Direction of Causality

       The regression results described above demonstrate a statistically and economically

meaningful relationship between membership in the S&P 500 index and an elevated average q

ratio. They do not, however, allow us to conclude that index membership ‘causes’ higher

average q ratios. Indeed, the causation might run the opposite way. Standard and Poor’s might

choose firms with high q ratios for inclusion in its index.

       However, the event study evidence unambiguously indicates that inclusion in the index

‘causes’ an immediate share price increase. Shleifer (1985), Harris and Gurel (1986), Jain

(1987), Beneish and Whaley (1996) and Lynch and Mendenhall (1997) Dhillon and Johnson




                                                 28
(1991), Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2000), and Kaul et al. (2000) all indicate a substantial rise in

share price upon inclusion in the index.

       Moreover, the underlying economic story proposed by Shleifer (1985) allows a more

direct test of causality. If growing demand for index member firms’ stock is responsible for the

elevated q ratios we detect, then increases in the amount of money passively tracking the S&P

500 index should ‘cause’ increases in the regression coefficient associated with index

membership (or weight) in the sense of Granger (1969) and Sims (1972).

       Table 9 presents causality tests of the form recommended by Granger and Sims, and

described in equation [11] above. These are joint significance tests of the hypothesis that past

values of xt, the total amount of money invested in S&P 500 index funds, predict the current

year’s value of β5,t, the coefficient of S&P membership (either the dummy or index weight), after

controlling for past values of β5,t.       The significance of these F-tests and χ2-tests can be

interpreted as evidence that the magnitude of funds tracking the index ‘causes’ increased share

values in index member firms.

       These tests are run using the S&P value premiums from 1978 to 1997 shown in Table 7

and the proxies for the amount of money passively tracking the S&P 500 shown in Table 8.

Note that the first index fund, the Vanguard 500 was founded in 1976. Our window thus

stretches back almost to the beginning of indexing.

       In general, the Granger-Sims tests are more consistent with indexing causing the value

premium than with the converse. Nineteen of the thirty six tests of indexing causing the

premium are statistically significant at 10% confidence levels; whereas, only five of the thirty six

tests of reverse causality are significant. While the incidence of statistical significance in the




                                                 29
direct causality tests (53%) is much higher than that expected through type two errors (10%), the

incidence of significant reverse causality (14%) is only slightly higher.

       Overall, our findings are consistent with the view that the increasing amount of money

passively tracking the S&P 500 Index “causes” the valuation premium associated with index

membership and with a member firm’s weight in the index



Causality Test Robustness Checks

       The χ2 and F tests in Table 9 are all run using S&P membership or index weight

coefficients from regressions run on the sample of firms at least as large (in terms of replacement

cost), as the smallest S&P 500 firm in each year in question. When using regression coefficients

estimated either across all available data or across firms larger than half the size of the smallest

S&P 500 firms, The tests in Table 9 are based on runs using two lags of the S&P membership or

weight coefficient and two lags of the value of funds under indexing. When we allow the data to

select the number of lags, the results are similar to those shown in Table 9.14

       In summary, our finding that the amount of money passively tracking the S&P 500 Index

‘causes’ the valuation premium associated with S&P 500 membership in the sense of Granger

(1969) and Sims (1972) appears to be quite robust.




14
   Reverse causation not evident in any specification when firms smaller than half the size of the
smallest index firm are included. When the data selects the number of lags, reverse causation is
rejected in all specifications involving the coefficient on the membership dummy. When the
regression coefficient is that of the index weight, causality appears to run in both directions.

Conclusions
        This paper documents a large value premium in the average q ratios of firms in the S&P

500 index relative to the q ratios of other similar firms. This premium appears a few years after

the founding of the first S&P 500 index fund, and grows steadily and in step with the growth of

indexing.

        One interpretation of this finding is that a mysterious intangible asset is connected with

membership in the S&P 500 index, and that the value of this asset has grown in synch with the

growth of indexing.

        A second interpretation is that the value premium is due to indexing directly. Because

index fund managers are penalized for tracking error, they must hold the stocks in the index they

are tracking. Indexing can also be accomplished with derivatives, but many institutional

investors and mutual funds bind themselves from using derivatives, so they must hold the index

stocks. Firms in the index thus do not have close substitutes insofar as far as these index fund

managers are concerned.      Consequently, index member firms’ stocks may have downward

sloping demand curves.

        This is easy to see in reductio ad absurdum. If the amount of money indexed to the S&P

500 grows without bound, index funds will come to buy and hold virtually all the shares in the

firms in the index. Obviously, if still more money is pumped into index funds, investors

squatting on the last few shares of each index member firm can demand exorbitant prices. The

downward sloping demand curves story is basically that this economic logic sets in when index

funds’ stakes are still moderate because arbitrageurs do not correct valuation gaps between index

firms and non-index firms with similar risks and expected payouts. Shleifer (2000) attributes

this to costly arbitrage.



                                               31
         Shleifer (1985) presents evidence that S&P 500 member firms’ stocks have downward

sloping demand curves, and a series of subsequent papers debated this conclusion. Recent

studies, particularly Kaul et al. (2000) and Wurgler and Zhuravskaya (2000) strongly support

Shleifer’s original interpretation of his results. Demand curves for stocks, or more precisely,

demand curves for stocks in indexes, do indeed appear to slope downwards.

         Since the Efficient Markets Hypothesis holds that active managers cannot outperform

indexes on a risk-adjusted basis, financial economists usually recommend investing in index

funds to achieve a widely diversified portfolio while minimizing management fees and avoiding

direct trading costs. This advice has proven itself, as managed investment funds have indeed

largely failed to consistently beat the S&P500 benchmark return. Consequently, more investors

adopt indexing.

         The second interpretation of our findings suggests that this upward spiral in demand for

index stocks itself pushed up their prices. This view is consistent with Masso and Goetzman

(1999), who find that the S&P index return to be positively correlated with net inflows into index

funds.

         Ironically, if this interpretation of our findings is correct, the investment advice implied

by the Efficient Markets Hypothesis may itself be undermining the efficiency of the stock

market. In an “indexing bubble”, index stock prices spiral upward due to rising demand from

index funds due to the superior past performance of indexing, which is due to the upward spiral

of index stock prices, which …. . This second interpretation of our findings is consistent with

the view that such an indexing bubble occurred in US stock markets.

         A possible response to this development is for firms whose stocks are included in widely

followed indexes, and consequently overvalued, to issue additional shares and use the funds so




                                                 32
raised to acquire productive assets or to acquire firms not in widely-followed indexes. In other

words, indexing may cause economically inefficient over-investment by index member firms and

economically inefficient M&A activity. In our view, this response is undesirable from a public

policy perspective.

       A second response is to encouraging indexing using derivative securities and to

discourage indexing accomplished by actually buying the stocks in the index. Given recent

scandals associated with derivative securities, and the consequent determination of many plan

sponsors and investors to avoid them, this option may not be realistic.

       A third response, which we advocate, is that passive investment benchmarks should be

reevaluated.   If a total market index, such as the CRSP value-weighted total return, were the

benchmark against which passive funds were judged, there would be no disproportionate demand

for the shares of the relatively few firms in a narrow and arbitrarily defined index like the S&P

500. Passive investment funds could buy and hold diversified portfolios of randomly selected

stocks, rather than all investing in the same 500 stocks. This holistic indexing would have the

salubrious effect of spreading passive demand for stocks across the market more evenly, thereby

avoiding price distortions of the sort described above.

Firms are indexed by j and time by t. Average Tobin’s q is estimated market value, Vt,j,
over estimated replacement cost, At,j. Research and development (R&D) spending and
advertising spending are expressed as fractions of replacement cost. Leverage is the
estimated market value of short and long-term debt over replacement cost, and firm size is
the logarithm of replacement cost.

Regressions of Average Tobin’s Q On a Dummy Indicating S&P 500 Membership
Controls are 3-digit industry fixed effects, R&D spending, advertising spending, leverage, and firm size. Data are for 1978, 1988, and
1997. Regressions 5.1, 5.4, and 5.7 use 1978 data, regressions; 5.2, 5.5, and 5.8 use 1988 data, and regressions 5.3, 5.6, and 5.9
use 1997 data. Average Tobin’s q is estimated market value, Vt,j, over estimated replacement cost, At,j. Research and development
(R&D) spending and advertising spending are expressed as fractions of replacement cost. Leverage is the estimated market value
of short and long-term debt over replacement cost, and firm size is the logarithm of replacement cost. S&P membership dummy is
one for firms in the index that year and zero otherwise.

Regressions of Average Tobin’s Q On S&P 500 Index Weight
Controls are 3-digit industry fixed effects, R&D spending, advertising spending, leverage, and firm size. Data are for 1978, 1988, and 1997.
Regressions 6.1, 6.4, and 6.7 use 1978 data, regressions; 6.2, 6.5, and 6.8 use 1988 data, and regressions 6.3, 6.6, and 6.9 use 1997 data.
Average Tobin’s q is estimated market value, Vt,j, over estimated replacement cost, At,j. Research and development (R&D) spending and
advertising spending are expressed as fractions of replacement cost. Leverage is the estimated market value of short and long-term debt over
replacement cost, and firm size is the logarithm of replacement cost. S&P index weight is the market value of the firm’s equity divided by the total
market value of the equity of all index firms, and is zero for non-index firms.

Table 7
How Regression Coefficients on Dummy Indicating S&P 500 Membership or on Index Weight Changed Over Time
Dependent variable is average q ratio, estimated market value, Vt,j, over estimated replacement cost, At,j.. Controls include 3-digit industry fixed
effects, R&D spending, advertising spending, leverage, and firm size. Research and development (R&D) spending and advertising spending are
expressed as fractions of replacement cost. Leverage is the estimated market value of short and long-term debt over replacement cost, and firm
size is the logarithm of replacement cost. S&P index weight is the market value of the firm’s equity divided by the total market value of the equity
of all index firms, and is zero for non-index firms. S&P membership dummy is one for firms in the index that year and zero otherwise.

Figure 1
A Downward Sloping Demand Curve For a Stock
If stocks have downward sloping demand curves, their prices reflect the interplay
of supply and demand, like the prices of other economic goods. If a stock is
added to a widely-tracked index, this shifts its demand curve to the right, from D0
to D1, and thereby increases the stock’s price from P0 to P1. For simplicity, and
without loss of generality for the topic at hand, we represent the supply curve, S,
for the stock as a vertical line. In practice, firms might issue more stock as their
stock prices rise, causing their stocks’ supply curves to slope upward.
