Can Financial Incentives Reduce the Baby Gap? Evidence from a Reform in Maternity Leave
Benefits

JEL No. J13,J16,J18

                                          ABSTRACT

To assess whether earnings-dependent maternity leave positively impacts fertility and narrows the
baby gap between high educated (high earning) and low educated (low earning) women, I exploit
a major maternity leave benefit reform in Germany that considerably increases the financial
incentives for higher educated and higher earning women to have a child. In particular, I use the
large differential changes in maternity leave benefits across education and income groups to
estimate the effects on fertility up to 5 years post reform. In addition to demonstrating an up to
22% increase in the fertility of tertiary educated versus low educated women, I find a positive,
statistically significant effect of increased benefits on fertility, driven mainly by women at the
middle and upper end of the education and income distributions. Overall, the results suggest that
earnings-dependent maternity leave benefits, which compensate women commensurate with their
opportunity cost of childbearing, could successfully reduce the fertility rate disparity related to
mothersâ€™ education and earnings.

1 Introduction
As women's educational attainment and labor market participation have increased, so

too have concerns about decreasing birth rates and below replacement fertility levels.

Among developed countries, Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Japan are all experienc-

ing total fertility rates between 1.3 and 1.4, and even the U.S. has seen its traditionally

high fertility fall to a record low well under replacement level (Table 1, Panel A).

    In an attempt to mitigate this decrease, all OECD countries except the U.S. now
                                     1
ensure paid maternity leave,             which provides employment protection and some degree of

earnings replacement, with a primary goal of facilitating family and career compatibility

and improving child welfare. Another aim of such policies, one that has received far

less research attention, however, is to encourage fertility by reducing the opportunity

costs of childbearing.       For example, according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel,

the low fertility rate among highly educated women was a motivating force behind the

2007 German reform studied here, which represents a paradigm shift in social policy
                                 2
(Bundesregierung (2006)).

    In addition to this decrease in overall birth rates (Table 1, Panel B), in many devel-

oped countries, highly educated and high earning women are also having fewer children

over a lifetime than their lower educated and lower earning peers, a competed fertil-

ity dierential that I label the baby gap. The likeliest explanation for this negative

relation between education and completed fertility is the higher opportunity costs of

childbearing for the more highly educated, who must forego a higher wage to temporar-
                                                     3
ily leave the labor market (Willis (1973)).              In Germany, this gap manifests as a stark

dierence between highly and lower educated women in both number of children borne

(1.33 vs.   2.06) and the percentage of childless women.                In fact, nearly one-third of

the 1963-1967 cohort of highly educated women in Germany have never had a child,

compared to 18% of women with no postsecondary schooling.                       Likewise, in the U.S.,

women with a college degree born in 1965-1969 gave birth to an average of 1.81 children

compared with 2.56 for women in the same cohort who did not complete high school.

In countries with traditionally generous family policies, however (e.g., Sweden), the

disparities between education groups are smaller.

    In this paper, therefore, I examine whether paid maternity leave does in fact aect

   1 Because my entire analysis focuses on the eect on mothers, I refer to the benet as maternity
leave rather than using the umbrella term parental leave, which encompasses maternal, paternal,
and adoption leave (and sometimes even family leave for other types of care).
   2 Support of families used to be support of families in need. (...). We face the problem, that 40% of
tertiary educated do not have children. A country, which calls itself highly developed, can not aord
such a situation. (Bundesregierung (2006)).
   3 See also Aaronson   et al. (2014) for recent empirical evidence. As predicted by theory, fertility has
been shown to decrease with a woman's potential wage (see e.g. Rosenzweig and Schultz (1985) and
Heckman and Walker (1990)).



                                                     2
fertility decisions by exploiting a 2007 maternity leave reform in Germany that sub-

stantially changed maternal compensation for time out of the labor market following

childbirth. Before this reform, German maternity leave benets were at means tested

transfers targeted at lower income families that paid an average benet of around 4,000

EUR for a maximum of two years irrespective of the mother's pre birth earnings. Since

2007, however, the new scheme has oered mothers a generous income replacement of

at least 67% of annual pre birth earnings, with a maximum 3,600 EUR basic transfer

for women not in the workforce pre partum. Nonetheless, although the reform means

a benet increase of up to 21,000 EUR for more highly educated and higher earning

women, the changes for very low earning (and lower educated) women are modest or

even negative.

    To measure the extent to which fertility in Germany has reacted to this reform

and add valuable new insights to the currently sparse empirical evidence on this ef-

fect, I apply a dierences-in-dierences approach exploiting the dierential changes in

leave benets across several earnings and education groups. As my primary data set,

I use novel administrative data from the German Pension Registry, which records pre-

cise information on earnings, education, and fertility for all women insured under the

statutory pension insurance scheme.     I complement this information with data from

the nationally representative German Microcensus, which employs rich demographic

measures.

    If earnings-related paid leave aects women's fertility decisions, then I should ob-

serve those who benet most to increase fertility relative to their peers who benet

less.   My empirical analysis does indeed uncover substantial pronatal eects of the

reform, as well as medium run changes in the socioeconomic structure of fertility, a

nding that matters not only for countries with low fertility rates, but also for gov-

ernments trying to mitigate the declining fertility associated with women's increased

labor market participation. First, based on vital statistics, I document discontinuous

jumps in monthly birth rates of close to 4% nine months after reform implementation,

which translates into 2.350 additional children each year born in the short term and an

increasing trend in birth rates post discontinuity. Second, by exploiting the large dier-

ential changes in maternity benets across income and education groups, I demonstrate

that the probability of having a child in a given year within the ve year post reform

period increases by up to 1.1 percentage points (22%) for highly educated relative to

low educated women. At the same time, the medium term (within ve year) fertility of

women earning above the median, who benet substantially from the reform, increases

by 18% as a result of the paid leave changes. In fact, the reform appears to be positively

aecting the fertility of women in all earnings groups beyond the median, including the

top 5th percentile, although admittedly, these intention-to-treat eects on fertility be-



                                            3
havior, being policy relevant parameters, could be driven by both increased monetary

transfers and any endogenous labor supply adjustments. Third, under the assumption

that the post reform changes in paid maternity leave only aect fertility by increasing

the nancial incentives to have a child, I can use the reform to estimate the changes

in nancial incentives on fertility.       My baseline estimate suggests that a 1,000 EUR

increase in total potential entitlement raises the birth probability by 0.78 percentage

points (2.1%) in each year post reform. Lastly, by estimating the eect of the reform

separately for dierent age groups, I nd a strong reform-induced increase in fertility

for women aged 35-39 and 40-44, who are nearing the end of their lifetime fertility

and unlikely to postpone childbearing, Such an increase in these cohorts' medium run

fertility is likely to have a permanent eect and raise their completed fertility.

      My ndings contribute to a growing body of literature on family policies and fertility,

which, in estimating nancial incentives' eect on fertility, faces the major methodolog-

ical challenge of getting exogenous variation in the cost of fertility (see Hotz                  et al.
           4
(1997)).       Similar diculties present in numerous studies in the large structural liter-

ature on how nancial incentives impact women's lifecycle fertility and labor supply

(e.g. Mott (1984), Keane and Wolpin (2010), Laroque and SalaniÃ© (2014) and Adda

et al.   (2017)). Among these latter studies on lifecycle fertility, Heckman and Walker

(1990) nd female wages to become an increasingly less accurate measure of the price

of fertility for more recent Swedish cohorts and argue that the nding might result from

the introduction of Swedish family policies, which lowered the cost of child care and
                                                                        5
oset the increasing cost of women's time for these cohorts.

      Another major investigative stream in the eld is the quasi-experimental literature,

which tends to focus on the incentive eect of child subsidies, child cash transfers,

and welfare programs, all designed to set higher nancial incentives for lower income
          6
women.         Two such studies, which exploit the variation in universal child subsidies for

the third (or higher child) relative to the rst or second child in Quebec (Milligan (2005))

and Israel (Cohen       et al. (2013)) nd a strong pronatal eect of these policies.          Another

investigation of the German context (Riphahn and Wynck (2017)) assesses the eects

   4 As government family policy which provides nancial and in-kind support for families with children
is usually universal, it sets nancial incentives to all women and does not provide a natural control
group for the counterfactual situation. Many early studies were relying on time series variation, such
as Whittington et al. (1990) who analyze responses of fertility to the personal tax exemption in the
US.
   5 They note that they fail to directly estimate the policy eect due to the inability to dene precise
measures of policy (see footnote 10 in Heckman and Walker (1990)).
   6 See for instance, the paper by GonzÃ¡lez (2013) on the positive immediate fertility eects of an
introduction of a universal cash benet in Spain. Mott (1998) provides an overview of the literature
on the eects of AFDC and concludes that the evidence is inconclusive. Baughman and Dickert-Conlin
(2003) and Brewer et al. (2011) nd positive eects on the fertility of low-income women for increases
in the EITC and the eect of UK welfare reforms respectively.




                                                   4
of a child benet reform that combines cash benets and tax deductions while raising

the transfer dierential dependent on household income and number of children. In this

study, rst births in low income households show no response to increased transfers,

although the transfers do have modest positive eects for second-order births among

highly educated women relative to low educated women.

    The literature on paid maternity leave, in contrast, focuses largely on the programs'

eects on maternal labor supply and child outcomes (see particularly Baker and Milligan

(2008, 2010), Dustmann and SchÃ¶nberg (2012) and Carneiro                       et al.   (2014)), although
                                                                                                           7
evidence on the impact on fertility is still sparse, with little consensus across studies.

One seminal investigation by Lalive and ZweimÃ¼ller (2009) does identify strong eects

of an Austrian expansion in the duration of paid job-protected maternity leave for

a rst child on the mother's (subsequent) higher order fertility.                       However, because

the maternity leave benets are at payments independent of pre birth earnings, the

extension of the leave duration inherently aects higher order fertility more strongly

for low wage mothers than for high wage mothers. An analysis of the long run eects

of a series of expansions in paid maternity leave in Norway, however, nds little eect

on completed fertility (Dahl         et al.   (2016)); however, these authors do not run their

assessments across dierent socioeconomic groups. Both Cygan-Rehm (2015) and Kluve

and Schmitz (forthcoming) analyze the eect of the German paid leave reform on higher-

order births. Cygan-Rehm (2015) identies an extension of higher order birth spacing

up to 5 years post reform that is driven by low income mothers, who the reform does

not benet. All other income groups have seemingly caught up with the initial fertility

delay after the third year, although Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming) also identify

negative eects on subsequent childbearing up to 5 years after the rst birth, driven

by young and lower-income women. All these studies adopt a regression discontinuity

design that compares the subsequent fertility of mothers who gave birth to their current

child immediately before and after the paid maternity leave reform, meaning dierent

paid leave benets for the current child but identical benets for the future child. As

a result, they all identify a specic incentive eect for the second (or higher order)

birth decision, which they label the current child eect. These eects on subsequent

childbearing have three potential drivers: changes in the benet level and duration for

the current child, a change in the return to work after the birth of the current child,
                                                                                                 8
and changes in the automatic renewal periods of benets for the future child.

   7 In his descriptive analysis, BjÃ¶rklund (2006) examines the evolution of completed fertility patterns
for Swedish cohorts who were aected by the large extension of family policies in the 60s and 70s
relative to women in neighboring countries. His results suggest that the extension of family policies
raised the level of fertility and shortened the spacing of births, but could not fully eliminate the negative
relationship between women's educational level and completed fertility.
   8 Both Cygan-Rehm (2015) and Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming) mention that it is impossible to




                                                     5
    My study adds to this literature along several important dimensions. First, the em-

pirical analysis provides causal evidence of how an increase in paid maternity leave for

a baby yet to be born, by lowering the immediate costs associated with childbearing,

can directly aect fertility decisions, especially medium run decisions, up to 5 years

post reform. To derive this evidence, rather than comparing cohorts of mothers facing

the same policy for the rst child but dierent leave duration for the future child (the

future child eect studied by Lalive and ZweimÃ¼ller (2009)), I exploit the fact that

switching from a at to an earnings-dependent maternity leave system aects higher

earning women more than lower earning women. The switch between benet systems

allows me to apply a dierences-in-dierences design, which is a tighter identication

strategy than the across-cohort comparison. Likewise, the direct incentive eect on fer-

tility decisions of a change in paid maternity leave for a future child, because it reduces

the cost of care for that child, is a potentially more policy relevant parameter than the

indirect eect on (subsequent) higher order births of leave policy changes for a baby

already born. Another limitation of the extant research on paid maternity leave (and

universal child subsidies) is that it can only identify a fertility eect along the inten-

sive margin of childbearing, which might be driven by women with high preferences for

children. I, in contrast, analyze the fertility eect of paid maternity leave programs not

only along the intensive margin but also along the extensive margin. This expansion

matters because analyzing the eect(s) on the decision to have a rst or second child

appears to be the crucial margin of interest, particularly for higher educated women,
                                                                                 9
more than half of whom have at most one child during a lifetime.                      My analysis can

thus provide a far more complete picture of how nancial incentives aect fertility deci-

sions at a time when falling fertility make it crucial to better understand the eects of

earnings-dependent leave policies on fertility behavior. My quasi-experimental evidence

is especially relevant because, unlike traditional family policies such as child subsidies,

the earnings-dependent schemes introduced in numerous countries aim to compensate

women for the opportunity costs of childbearing.

    The remainder of the article proceeds as follows.                 The next section explains how

the changes in paid maternity leave legislation in Germany came about and describes

the mechanisms through which they can aect fertility decisions.                     Sections 3 and 4,

respectively, describe the empirical strategy and data sets, after which Section 5 presents

the main results.      Section 6 then briey discusses the reform eects across age, and

   9 Among highly educated women aged 40-49 in 2012, 29% remained childless, 24.4% had one child,
34.2% two children and only 12.4% had three or more children (see BIB (2012)).

2 Background
2.1 The maternity benet reform
Government provided maternity leave, which has a long tradition in Germany, has

been expanded in a series of reforms since the late 1970s, and since 1992 has granted

mothers a maximum 36 months of very generous post birth job protection as well as
                                                10 11
publicly funded benets whilst on leave.                In 2007, however, the German government

implemented a major reform that fundamentally changed the maternity benet system.

    Under the old scheme, child-rearing money (             Erziehungsgeld ) targeted low income
families and paid out under one of two options: a maximum of 300 EUR a month for up

to 24 months or a short option monthly payment of 450 EUR over 12 months for mothers

who wanted to work in the second year after childbirth (see Table 2). Transfers under

both options were means tested on family income during benet receipt, eectively

basing them on the spouse's income, not only because most mothers did not choose

to work but because eligibility required that they not work over 30 hours a week.

In fact, only families earning below a 30,000 EUR net (40,400 EUR gross) income

threshold (after several deductibles) were eligible for any benet payments, which in
                                                        12
2006 accounted for about 74% of all mothers.                 Of the mothers eligible to choose both

options, only about 15% (predominantly East German women) chose the short run

payout, for an average 2006 benet of between 3,850 and 4,440 EUR in total (based on
                                                             13
data from from Statistisches Bundesamt (2006)).

    On January 1, 2007, a new leave benet, parental money (                  Elterngeld ),   replaced

the old scheme, for which all mothers with children born on or after that date are

eligible. In contrast to the old means tested benets based on family income, the new

transfer payments are not only more generous but provide universal coverage. More-

over, despite a primary goal of providing parents with the nancial means to care for

their child during the rst year of life, the reform also aims to increase fertility by tying

benets closely to women's net pre birth earnings so as to compensate their oppor-

tunity cost of childbearing.       This paradigm shift in family policy (Bundesregierung

(2006)) is thus aimed at preventing income drops after childbirth, (..) enhancing the

  10 During the leave period, the rm is not allowed to dismiss the mother and the mother has the
right to return to a job that is comparable to the job she held before childbirth.
  11 Since 1986, fathers have been eligible for parental leave, but very few father took any leave, so the
program was eectively a maternity leave program.
  12 Benets were restricted to a duration of six months (total payment of 1,800 EUR) for those with
an income threshold exceeding around 21,000 EUR and below 30,000 EUR, which applied to about
14% of mothers. In 2006 only about 60% of mothers were eligible for benet payments for longer than
six months.
  13 Maternal labor force participation has traditionally been low in Germany compared to other West-
ern European countries, with only 36% of mothers with a child below age three working in 2006, which
might explain the low share of mothers choosing the short run option.

nity costs of childbearing (BMFSFJ (2008)).                  Nevertheless, being born out of a newly

formed (and rather unexpected) coalition between the two largest political parties, the

Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, the new scheme was pushed rather hastily

through the legislative procedure.        Agreement on the main features occurred in May

2006, publication as a draft law in June 2006, and passing of an amended version by
                                                                                                   15
parliament and the second chamber between September 2006 and November 2006.

    The new maternity leave benet replaces about 67% of previous net labor earnings

for up to 12 months after the birth of a child, with benets calculated on the basis of

the average net earnings during the 12 months pre birth. Previously inactive mothers

receive a at minimum of 300 EUR a month, which translates into a total benet of

3,600 EUR. Lower earning women are granted a higher than 67% replacement ratio of

previous net labor earnings, which is gradually lowered from 100% to 67% for women

with monthly net earnings between 300 and 1,000 EUR. The transfer is truncated

at 1,800 EUR a month, meaning a maximum benet of 21,600 EUR for women with

average net (gross) pre birth monthly (yearly) earnings above 2,700 EUR (around 60,000

EUR). As with the old system, eligibility depends on benet recipients not working more

than 30 hours a week during transfer receipt, while the associated benet reduction

disincentivizes part-time work. As a result, in 2010, only 1.7% (less than 9%) of mothers
                                                                               16
were part-time employed in the rst (last) month of benet receipt.                 Whilst the average

total benet paid to all mothers under the new system was 7,080 EUR in 2007, the

scheme paid mothers employed prepartum a benet of 10,128 EUR in 2008, making the

new system considerably more generous than the old (see Table 2). In fact, between

2007 and 2010, take-up of the new leave payment was close to full (about 96% of all

mothers), with many taking advantage of the benet for the full eligibility period. For

instance, the average receipt duration in 2010 was 11.7 months and even those at the

top end of the pre birth earnings distributionwho qualied for a monthly transfer of

1,800 EURcontinued taking transfers for an average of 11.2 months. In fact, Figure

2A, which contrasts the simulated pre and post reform benet entitlements along the
                                                17
distribution of net yearly labor earnings,           shows an almost at total pre reform benet

  14 The reform additionally introduced two additional months of leave earmarked to the partner or
the primary leave recipient (daddy quota). Around 20% of fathers take these two additional months.
In order to not discriminate against single mothers, these are eligible to extend their leave by an
additional two months.
  15 Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming) show there was a peak in newspaper reports on the new proposed
policy as well as a rst peak in the Google search index in May 2006, which indicates that the public
became increasingly aware of the new potential policy regime from May 2006. However, there was no
certainty that the new policy would come into eect before the fall of 2006.
  16 All reported benet statistics are based on the Elterngeldstatistik for 2007-2010, which covers all
benet claims and is published by the German statistical oce.
  17 The simulated pre-reform benets are the average benets for various women's income groups



                                                     8
amount across net earnings groups, with post reform benets continuously increasing

in net earnings for most of the earnings distribution. The eective reform eect (i.e.,

the dierence between the two lines) is also continuously increasing in earnings, ranging

from -2,400 EUR for yearly incomes under 1,800 EUR to an average benets increase

of 17,100 EUR for women with net (gross) earnings over 33,000 EUR (60,000 EUR).

Figure 2B further reveals that whereas pre reform benets replaced very little of higher

income women's foregone earnings relative to those of lower income women, post reform

benets replace at least 67% of these earnings for all women. In my empirical analysis, I

am able to exploit these dierentials across socioeconomic groups to identify the policy

change's eects.



2.2 Mechanisms: The Eect of Reform on Fertility Decisions
Because a major goal of the reform is to lower the cost of potential childbearing by

increasing paid maternity leave benets, it has had a direct nancial incentive eect

on fertility decisions through increased availability of post birth family resources. In

particular, because maternal labor supply in the rst years post birth is traditionally

low in Germany, the reform is likely to have crowded out either unpaid or paid leave

with less generous benets for many women.             Moreover, unlike cash-in-hand benets

such as universal child subsidies, paid leave benets are conditional on time out of the

labor market, meaning that an increase in paid leave benets could prompt mothers

to optimally adjust their maternal labor supply following childbirth.                 For example,

mothers who wish to spend more time at home with their children (and pre reform were

potentially credit constrained to do so) may decrease their labor supply and reduce their

labor earnings under the more generous regime. Hence, dependent on the magnitude

of the maternal labor supply response, the total increase in cumulative family income
                                                                                              18
via the reform is likely to be lower than the increase in maternity leave benets.

    The extant literature already oers empirical evidence that the reform encourages

leave taking during the period of benet receipt while reducing maternal employment in

the rst year after childbirth, particularly for groups who benet strongly (e.g. Berge-

mann and Riphahn (2011), Kluve and Tamm (2013), Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming)).

Some such studies even provide tentative evidence for small employment increases in

the second year after childbirth.       Investigating the eects beyond the rst two years

post birth, the study by Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming) nds that the reform in fact

calculated on the basis of the spouse's net income.    More details on the simulation of pre-reform
benets are given in Section 4.3 and in Appendix A.
  18 Furthermore, the reform also provided two additional daddy months to the family, which may
have also changed father's labor supply. Father's take up of leave of around 18% in 2007 is however
modest, which suggests that father's responses to the reform are unlikely to be an important mechanism
through which the reform aected fertility.



                                                  9
encouraged maternal labor supply in the medium term (2 to 5 years after childbirth),

probably (at least partly) osetting the negative short run eects. The overall eect

on cumulative maternal labor supply and earnings after childbirth is thus likely to be
         19
small.        At the same time, because the reform provides universal leave benets with a

high income replacement, I expect families' cumulative income to increase in response

to the reform.




3 Empirical approach
As previously explained, I estimate the causal impact of the paid leave reform on fertility

decisions by exploiting the resulting dierential changes in benets across socioeconomic

groups. Below, I will rst describe the baseline dierences-in-dierences (DID) empirical

strategy estimating the reduced-form eect of the policy. Under the assumption that

the reform in paid parental leave aected fertility only through increasing nancial

incentives, I can then use the reform to estimate the changes in nancial incentives on

fertility in a second step.



3.1 Baseline estimation
Perhaps the most straightforward way to evaluate the reform eects on fertility is to use

a simple two-group DID strategy to compare the changes in average fertility between

cohorts of high earning versus low earning women (see Figure 3).                   Figure 3A thus

compares the 2004-2012 raw birth probabilities of women with above median earnings

of 14.800 (10.098) EUR gross (net) earnings with a control group of women below the

median. Whereas before the 2007 reform, the graphs move almost in parallel, after it,

the probability of giving birth increases sharply for women above the median but stays

roughly constant for women below it. Likewise, as shown in Figure 3B, between 2006

and 2007 maternity leave benets increase over 6,000 EUR for women above the median

but remain almost unchanged for those below. These graphics alone oer initial support

for a stronger reform eect on the fertility of higher earning women than on that of lower

earning women. I formally test this assumption across the pre (2004-2006) and post

reform (2008-2012) periods using a linear probability model that assesses the relative

  19 Kluve and Schmitz (forthcoming) are unable to provide estimates for the reform eect on maternal
earnings, since the Microcensus they use does not contain precise earnings measures. Using the full
population pension registry data and applying a similar RDD-DID estimation strategy comparing
women who give birth January 2007 and December 2006 (with January 2006 and December 2005
mothers as the comparison group), I estimate the average reform eect on total cumulative labor
earnings in the two years following childbirth to be small and statistical insignicant. The structure
of my data does not allow me to look at earnings eect beyond the two years postpartum.




                                                 10
increase in the birth probability for women with above median earnings (treatment

group) relative to those with below median earnings (control group):



             P (Child)it = Î±0 + Î±1 T reatit + Î±2 T reatit âˆ— Rt + Xit0 Î±3 + Î³t + uit ,                  (1)


   where    P (Child)it   is the probability of having a child for woman       i   in calendar year     t,
T reatit   is a dummy variable equal to 1 if woman       i   earned below the median in t-1,           Rt
is a post reform dummy, and   T reatit âˆ— Rt is the interaction between the two variables.
 0
Xit , a vector of observed women's characteristics, such as the woman's age dummies,
education group, indicator for being in vocational training, German nationality, and

region (LÃ¤nder) dummies, as well as indicators for whether the woman had a child in

t-2 or t-1; while   Î³t    denotes year dummies.      To ensure exibility of the age eects in

covariate vector   Xit0   , the model includes dummies for both the age and dierential age

of tertiary educated women. The coecient of interest,           Î±2 ,   captures the average causal

impact of the maternity leave benet reform on fertility in a given year within the ve

year post reform period for higher earning women versus lower earning women.

   As an alternative, because average earnings dier across education groups, I exploit

the variation in reform impact across three dierent levels of mother's education: (i) no

more than secondary schooling (low skilled), (ii) completed vocational training (medium

skilled), and (iii) tertiary education (high skilled). Figure 4A plots the unconditional

birth probabilities across these three groups for 2001-2011 derived from German Micro-

census data on economically active women, which allow the plotting of longer run pre

trends than the main data set (see Section 4.3). As in Figure 3A, across-group birth

probabilities move almost in parallel before 2007, while post reform birth rates increase

for higher educated women and to a smaller extent for medium educated women (who

tend to benet more from the reform than low educated women). Figure 4B, in contrast,

shows that between 2006 and 2007, economically active high skilled women enjoyed the

largest increase in available maternity leave benets, 7,136 EUR compared with around

3,527 EUR for medium skilled and only 255 EUR for low skilled women. To exploit

these dierences, I estimate the following linear probability model:




  P (Child)it = Î²0 + Î²1 Deducmedit âˆ— Rt + Î²2 Deduchighit âˆ— Rt + Xit0 Î²3 + Î³t + uit ,                   (2)



where   Deducmedit    and    Deduchighit   denote dummy variables equal to 1 if the woman is

medium or highly educated, respectively. The coecients of interest,               Î²1   and   Î²2   capture

the average eect of the reform on fertility for medium and high skilled women relative

to low educated women. The identifying assumption of the DID approach is that even

if the reform had never happened, the pre and post reform changes in fertility would be



                                                11
the same across both the treatment and control groups. Likewise, the graphic evidence

for both the earnings and education groups indeed suggests common pre trends but

no occurrence of a strong, permanent change in fertility behavior across treatment and

control groups until after reform implementation. I assess the validity of this common

time trend by running placebo-reforms on the pre reform period data, pretending that

the reform occured in the pre reform period.             I then test my results' robustness to

omitting my set of controls         X.    Deriving similar coecients from estimates with and

without controls would indicate that the sample composition does not corroborate the

estimated reform eects, which would point to reform exogeneity with respect to the

observed (and potentially unobserved) characteristics of the women.

   The DID parameters          Î±2   of equation 1 and   Î²1   and   Î²2   of equation 2 are intention-

to-treat eects (ITT), measuring the reform's reduced form impact on higher earning

and higher educated women.               A major advantage of these ITT eects is that they

capture the full reform impact on fertility decisions through increases in paid maternity

leave payments as well as potential endogenous adjustments in labor supply, which can

both aect available post birth household income. Moreover, because dierent earnings

and education groups enjoy dierential increases in postpartum nancial incentives,

these reduced form fertility eects can be scaled using variation in the intensity of the

maternity leave benet changes.



3.2 Eects of changes in maternity leave benets on fertility
Although the simplest method for measuring fertility's response to paid leave changes

is to divide the DID estimate by the reform-induced benet dierential, using a simple

Wald estimator to compare the dierential treatment of relatively broad groups does

not fully leverage the variation in expected benet intensity.                 I therefore estimate a

regression model that quanties the eects of benet changes and allows me to calcu-

late benet elasticities, thereby accounting for simulated real expected maternity leave

benets in calendar year       t, Bit , and for a exible function of real lagged net earnings,
Î¦(Eitâˆ’1 ):

                     P (Child)it = Î´0 + Î´1 B it + Xit0 Î´2 + Î¦(Eitâˆ’1 ) + Î³t + uit ,                    (3)


   where     P (Child)it   is the birth probability for woman      i                        t
                                                                       in calendar year . Because of

the policy reform, the expected maternity leave benets            Bit   vary considerably over time

for women with the same real earnings, making post reform benets                   Bit   a deterministic

function of pre birth net earnings in the preceding year,               Bit (Eitâˆ’1 ).   Prior to 2007, in

contrast,    Bit   are means tested xed rate transfers that do not vary in any systematic

way with women's pre birth earnings. Hence, I simulate expected benets in the pre



                                                  12
reform period using 2006 Micocensus data (as detailed in Section 4.3), but calculate the

post reform benets as a function of net labor earnings in t-1, the preceding calendar

year.

       In order to identify the eect of reform-induced benet changes on fertility, I must

account for a exible function of lagged net earnings in order to ensure that the varia-

tion in    Bit   comes from the reform-induced variation in benets over time and not the
                                        20
variation in net earnings levels.            Were I to restrict my analysis to the post reform

period, all the cross-sectional variation in benets would be captured by the exible

earnings controls, preventing me from separately identifying treatment eect                   Î´1 .   To do

the latter, I would need to observe the fertility decisions of observationally equivalent

women both pre and post reform. If the time invariant                Î¦(Eitâˆ’1 )   is fully exible, how-

ever, only the reform-induced cross-cohort variation in            Bit identies the treatment eect
Î´1 ;   that is, the incentive eect of an increase in the total maternity benet entitlement

based on earnings in the previous calendar year            t-1   on a woman's probability of giving

birth in calendar year .     t
       Although no woman need take the maximum maternity benet entitlement (e.g.,

some may want to return to work before the 12th postpartum month), most mothers

do in fact take advantage of the maximum paid leave (see Section 2.1), under which

condition the benet estimator measures the impact of a change in nancial incentives

on the fertility decision.        This causal interpretation of the parameter hinges on an

additional assumption not needed for the identication of the intention-to-treat eects.

That is, the paid maternity leave reform aects the costs of childbearing and in turn
                                                                                                         21
impacts fertility decisions only through increased potential leave transfers after birth.

Because receiving maternity leave benets is conditional on not working, some women

might change their labor supply because of the higher leave benets. If the reform's

impact on maternal labor supply and maternal (or family) earnings is negligible, the
                                                                                                        22
higher leave benets will fully translate into an increase in available family income.

       A similar empirical approach is adopted by Dahl and Lochner (2012), who exploit

large changes in the earned income tax credit to estimate the impact of family income

on child achievement, and by Gruber and Saez (2002), who use tax reform to estimate
                                        23
the elasticity of taxable income.

  20 I use a fth-order polynomial in lagged net earnings in my baseline specication.
  21 Using language from the Instrumental Variable literature, the exclusion restriction has to be met.
The reduced form changes in fertility across earnings or education group are solely caused by changes
in the potential paid leave benets, the rst stage.
  22 Note that even if the increase in transfers is not equivalent to an increase in available income after
the childbirth, I will still identify the impact of increasing conditonal leave benets on fertility, which
captures the optimal adjustment of labor supply. This is still a policy-relevant parameter, but is harder
to interpret.
  23 Nielsen   et al. (2010) and Rothstein and Rouse (2011) use a similar approach to study the eect of




                                                    13
    The central identifying assumption of this approach, which is equivalent to the

DID assumptions above, is that the relation between shocks aecting fertility decisions

and women's net labor earnings remains stable over time. This assumption would be

violated if, in the absence of the yreform, dierential trends in the fertility decisions

across dierent earnings groups or changes in the composition of earnings groups over

time existed that would change the relation between               uit   (or benets   Bit )   and lagged
                               24
labor earnings       Eitâˆ’1 .        In this approach, the polynomial      Î¦(Eitâˆ’1 )   can be thought

of as a (time-invariant) control function, which in my case must be exible enough

to capture the true relation between women's earnings and fertility. Although I test

the robustness of my approach in Section 5.3 and also run a placebo check for the

pre reform period, the concern may remain that the reform has motivated women

already planning to have a child to increase their labor supply in order to raise their
                         25
benet entitlement.             If so, an endogenous adjustment in earnings in response to the

reform would change the relation between earnings and fertility over time, thereby

invalidating my identifying assumption, and assumedly rendering women with the same

labor earnings incomparable over time.             Whereas the ideal solution to this problem

would be to use each woman's pre reform earnings, the data set does not provide such

information (see 4.2). Instead, in the appendix, I report several checks that address the

concern of endogenous adjustment in the labor supply of pregnant women or women of

childbearing age as a response to the reform.

    To account for the fact that the preceding year's earnings  and hence, potential

benets as a function of earnings  are potentially endogenous, I also test for robust-

ness when a grouping IV estimator is used to instrument the expected benets, the

most obvious candidate for which is education-year interactions (cf.                   Blundell    et al.
(1998)).       Using education as my grouping-instrument, I therefore exploit changes in

fertility across education groups who were dierentially aected by the benet reform.

The DID estimator in equation 2 can be seen as the Reduced-form of this IV estima-
       26
tor.        The exogeneity restriction here requires that, conditional on controls, education

must not aect fertility trends over time in the absence of the reform (the common time

trend assumption discussed in 3.1). It also implies that the composition of the educa-

tion groups (with respect to unobserved dierences in fertility) remains stable before

student aid reforms on student outcomes. My estimation strategy is also related to grouping estimators
applied to estimate the labor supply eect of tax reforms (see e.g. Feldstein (1995) and Blundell et al.
(1998)).
  24 Equivalently, I need to assume that the composition of the treated groups in the standard DID
approach in equation 1 and 2 does not change as a response to the reform.
  25 The problem of potential anticipation of treatment eects, which would change the composition of
treatment and control groups over time, has been rst identied by Abbring and Van Den Berg (2003)
for evaluation studies when decision processes are dynamic.
  26 Mott and Wilhelm (2000) and Blundell       et al. (1998) discuss the equivalence between DID esti-
mators and (grouping)-IV estimators.



                                                   14
and after the policy reform. This assumption would be violated if economic shocks or

preference shifts that aected education group dierently resulted in dierential fertil-

ity time trends across education groups. Although the 2007-2009 nancial crisis would

seem an obvious possibility, in my case, its threat is limited because, thanks to a strong

upward economic trend beginning in the mid 2000s, the German economy, unlike those
                                                                         27
of most other European countries, suered no lasting impact.                  The reform is also un-

likely to have aected the educational attainment of the cohorts studied because these

latter had made most educational decisions before the policy switch and experienced

no major educational reforms over the time span studied. Hence, endogenous switching

of education groups in order to increase benets is unlikely to pose a threat to identi-

cation. I estimate the empirical models on a restricted sample of women over 20 and
           28
under 45        and exclude 2007 data from the main empirical analysis because, the reform

legislation having been passed in Fall 2006, only individuals giving birth from Summer

2007 onward could have adjusted their fertility behavior in response.




4 Data
My analysis draws on three dierent data sources: German vital statistics, the German

Microcensus, and administrative records for insured persons from the German Pension

Registry (FDZ-RV (2014)).



4.1 Vital Statistics
To study the time trends in fertility and test for a discontinuous jump in the number of

births 9 months after announcement of the reform, I use micro data from the German

Statistical Oce's (GSO) vital statistics on all births in a given month for 2000-2011.

I supplement these data with aggregate GSO information on the female population by

age to construct monthly birth rates.



4.2 Pension Registry Data
The main analysis uses administrative data on insured persons compiled by the Ger-

man Federal Pension Insurance's (FDZ-RV) Research Data Center. This highly precise

pension registry covers all those who made any contribution in the reporting year to the

statutory pension insurance, which is mandatory for all employed persons in the private

  27 Unemployment rates have been falling between 2006 and 2011 across all education groups. For a
more detailed account on the evolution of employment rates see Weber and Weber (2013).
  28 Childbearing for women age 20 and under is relatively scarce; around 3% of all births in 2007 were
to mothers below the age of 21.   Childbearing above 44 is extremely rare as 99.8% of births are to
women age 44 or younger.



                                                  15
and public sectors, including marginal employment. Excluded from the data set are the

economically inactive, civil servants (including teachers), and most self-employed, none
                                                                29
of whom are covered by statutory pension insurance.                  Because childbearing entails a

pension contribution period, these social security data provide a fertility record for any

woman who has ever been registered with the pension insurance, which accounts for

91% of all births recorded in the vital statistics in 2007.

    For my main results, I draw on the scientic use le of the insured persons database

for 2004-2012 (FDZ-RV (2014)), which represents 1% of the full population of insured

persons and contains annual information on over 80,000 women aged 21-44. These cross-

sectional data include information on the fertility and employment on 31st December

in the reporting and two preceding years, as well as a woman's educational level and

yearly gross labor earnings for the reporting and previous year. To avoid changes in the

sample composition stemming from benet reforms in the earlier 2000s, I restrict my

sample to all women aged 21-44 who had positive labor earnings in the year preceding

the survey, thereby excluding women who lived solely on unemployment benets during
             30
that time.

    I calculate the expected post reform maternity benets using a detailed maternity

benet calculator (http://www.familien-wegweiser.de/Elterngeldrechner), which gen-

erates the expected maximum benets as the sum of monthly benets over the total

12-month entitlement period as well as a woman's net earnings based on information

on a woman's gross earning reported in the pension registry data.



4.3 Microcensus
To simulate the pre reform benets, assess pre reform trends, and estimate the DID

results by education, I employ a 70% subsample (the Scientic Use File (SUF)) of

2003-2012 data from the German Microcensus, an annual cross-sectional survey of a
                                                      31
random 1% sample of the German population.                 This survey gathers household demo-

graphics on around 70,000 women aged 21 to 44 each year, including number and ages

of children in the household, marital status, education and vocational training, labor

market participation, and receipt of various benets. Nevertheless, because the survey

is administered continuously over the year, its data on births in the current year do not

  29 Kohls (2010) reports that data on insured persons for ages 20-59 covers 84.5% of German women
and 86.1% of German men and 67.2% of non-German women and 75% of non-German men respectively
in terms of the 2006 population estimation.
  30 Around 8% of economically active women were solely receiving unemployment benets. As outlined
above, the Pension Registry data contains information on economically active (employed women as
well as unemployed women), but only contains information on inactive women if they are giving birth
in that year. Hence I can not not determine the probability to give birth for inactive women.
  31 The data used in this paper was analyzed using the remote processing tool JoSuA. JoSuA was
developed by the IDSC of IZA. See Askitas (2008) for details.



                                                 16
allow determination of birth probability in the survey year. Rather, I retrospectively
                                                                                                   32
derive this probability for the preceding year from the children's actual birth years,

although 2012 data being the most recently available, I can do so only up until 2011.

    Whereas the representativeness of this data set (whole population, including the

economically inactive, civil servants, and the self-employed) is one of its major ad-
            33
vantages,        it unfortunately means that the income measures for the survey year are

relatively broad. Nonetheless, for every household member, it does provide a measure

of net income, reported in intervals, for the month preceding the survey date. Because

expected pre reform maternity benets in essence depend solely on partner's income, I

can calculate them for each woman by applying the pre reform benet eligibility rules

to her spouse's net income and aggregating this information by income or education-age

group (from the 2006 Microcensus data) for all women aged 21-45. I then merge the

averages by a woman's observable characteristics with the pension registry data, im-

plicitly assuming that expectations of benet level are formed on the basis of partner's
                    34
current income.          For my baseline results (Section 5.3), I dene the expected benets

as the sum of monthly payments over the maximum 24-month entitlement period with

the assumption that mothers maximize their total benet entitlement (see Appendix A

for simulation details for both pre and post reform benets).

    According to the descriptive statistics for the estimation sample, which are based on

information from both data sets (Table 3, Panel A), on average, the maternity benets

for which women are eligible are less than 5,000 EUR pre reform but increase to 8,280

EUR post reform. Around 91% of the women in the sample are German nationals, with

an average age of 33.37 years  30.67 for new mothers  and a probability of giving

birth in a given year of 4.1%.         The majority has vocational training (62%), around
                                                                                35
15% are tertiary educated, and 24% have no postsecondary degree.                     Median earnings

in the preceding year are 10,114 EUR net (14,874 EUR gross), with a women in the

90th percentile of the earnings distribution taking home around 21,540 EUR net (36,091

EUR gross). According to Table 4, Panel B, 27% of the women are mothers to one child

and 25% have two children; however, close to 40% of women aged 21-44 are childless.

Given the large share of potential rst-time mothers, if my analysis is to truly capture

  32 As Brewer et al. (2010) point out, birth probabilities estimated by this approach are potentially
subject to measurement error due to infant mortality and household reconstitution, but low rates of
mortality and the fact that the overwhelming majority of children stay with their natural mother in
the event of family breakup reduce the eect of these factors in practice.
  33 According to own calculations based on the Microcensus 2010, around 8% of all (11% of working)
women between age 20-44 were self employed or civil servants.
  34 I also have to implicitly assume that assortative matching of partners is the same over time.
  35 Educational information is based on the Microcensus sample, which is representative of all women.
As mentioned earlier, the pension registry data does not include self-employed and civil servants. As
a result, the share of highly skilled in the pension registry data sample is lower (8%). Around 70%
(22%) of women in the pension registry data are medium skilled (low skilled).

the full eect of the reform, it must consider all births, including rst births, rather

than focusing on higher order births only.




5 Results
To estimate the reform's impact on fertility decisions, I rst derive DID estimates of

its reduced form eects and then conduct a benet analysis that exploits the variation

in nancial incentives across earning groups. In addition to the results using education

groups as an instrument, I also report an estimate of the benet elasticity.                    Before

turning to my main regression analysis, however, I perform a time series analysis such

as that reported by GonzÃ¡lez (2013) and present evidence for the immediate adjustment

of fertility in response to the reform announcement.



5.1 Descriptive evidence from time series
To derive the time series of monthly birth rates, I rst plot seasonality adjusted (resid-

ual) monthly number of births per 1000 women over the 2004-2011 period (Figure 2). I

additionally plot a lowess smoother separately for the months before and after August

2007 (0-cuto month in Figure 2), which is 9 months after the nal passing of the policy

change in November 2006, when it was certain to come into eect. The dotted line (-5)

denotes March 2007, 9 months after announcement of the policy change (May/June

2006). Up until the cuto date, the monthly birth rate appears to be relatively stable

but jumps discontinuously in the cuto month of August 2007 and continues to increase

thereafter. I also perform a regression test for a discontinuity around August 2007 using

a third-order polynomial in the running variable (birth months over time) to capture
                                                                                                      36
smooth fertility trends and calendar month dummies to measure birth seasonality.

This test yields an estimate of about 0.17 (standard error 0.061), equivalent to around

3.5% of the pre August 2007 average monthly birth rate of 4.87 births per 1,000 women,

implying that these latter increased a signicant 3.5% in August 2007 over the previous

month. The result hence suggests that births per 1000 women increased signicantly

in August 2007 compared to the previous month by about 3.5%. Extrapolating to the

yearly level using around 673,000 live births for 2006 (Statistisches Bundesamt (2016)),

I nd that policy implementation results in close to 2.350 additional children born each

year in the very short run. Given the three to six months needed for conception even

in a fertile couple (GonzÃ¡lez (2013)), however, the discontinuity is capturing only the

thus likely to understate the true immediate fertility response to the policy.



5.2 Dierences-in-dierences results for earnings and education
    groups
In calculating the DID estimates for the up to 5 year post reform impact for the treat-

ment group of women above median earnings (equation (1)), I address potential selec-

tion bias by estimating the eects both with and without the set of individual controls,

expressing the dependent variable as births in 1,000 women for ease of interpretation.

As Table 4, column (1) shows, over the 5-year post reform period, the reform in paid

maternity leave increases the birth probability in a given year by 7.2 births per 1,000

women. Evaluated against the corresponding pre reform birth rate of 41 births per 1,000

women, this estimate implies that the fertility of women with above median earnings

increases by 18% in response to the reform. To place this estimate in perspective, Lalive

and ZweimÃ¼ller (2009) nd that extending leave for a current (future) child increases

short run fertility (i.e., within three years) by 15% (21%) with the larger eect for a

future child most similar to the reform eect identied here. Milligan (2005) identies

similar fertility eects for child subsidies, 10.7% for the rst child and 25% for families

with two or more children, who are the most aected by child subsidy changes. The

fact that my baseline estimate is robust both to excluding all individual level control

variables (column (2)) and to including a second-order polynomial in earnings as a ner

measure of previous year earnings (column (3)) suggests that the estimate of the reform

impact is not sensitive to the composition of either the treated or control group.

    In columns (4) and (5), I apply an alternative denition of treatment and comparison

groups, whose dierential birth rate evolution is outlined in Figure A1. First, in column

(4), I compare the evolution of birth probabilities for women in the top decile of the

earnings distribution (above 36,000 EUR gross earnings) with that of women in the

bottom decile (under 3,250 EUR). This estimate indicates a reform-induced increase

in the fertility of top earning women in a given year of 1.2 percentage points (27%).

Not surprisingly, given the substantial post reform increase in maternity leave (around

14,000 EUR) for women in the top decile relative to the bottom decile, the reform

eect is larger than for the baseline treatment denition in (1). Hence, in column (5),

  37 Terminations of pregnancies in turn can immediately adjust to the policy. I nd some suggestive
evidence using quarterly numbers of abortions that the policy appears to have discouraged abortions
for married women, with no apparent trend change for single women.        I also nd a strong increase
in aggregate data on In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) between 2006 and the post-reform period which
likely reect the increase in the willingness to conceive, in particular by older women. The results are
available on request.




                                                  19
I restrict the sample to women within the interquartile range of earnings to create

treatment and control groups of women between the 50th and 75th percentile and 25th

and 50th percentiles, respectively. The estimated reform eect conrms that women

who experience a higher increase in paid leave also increase their fertility more strongly.

The last column of Table 4 then reports the estimate of a placebo test in which the

reform has already occurred in 2006 and the data are restricted to the pre reform years

of 2004-2006. Consistent with the graphic evidence of similar pre reform trends for both

treatment and comparison groups, which only diverge sharply post reform (Figure 3),

the estimated eect for the placebo reform is insignicant and the point estimate of

much smaller magnitude than the true reform eect in column (1).

   I next use the 2004-2011 Microcensus data to calculate alternative DID estimates

of the reform for medium and high skilled women (the treatment groups) relative to

low skilled women (the comparison group) from equation (2) (for more details on the

educational coding, see Appendix A). For this analysis, I estimate the reform eects

for the full population of women, including the economically inactive, self-employed,

and civil servants, to enable estimation of the reform eects for the full population of

women, again using the data on the number and age of children in the family. According

to these results (column (1)), the birth probability for high skilled women increases by

8.47 births per 1,000 women in a given year post reform, which when evaluated against

the pre reform mean, constitutes a 15% increase in fertility. Omitting the individual

level controls (column (2)) and adding measures of family composition (column (3))

yields very similar results.

   On the other hand, estimating the reform eects for all women including the inactive

yields only a small, statistically insignicant point estimate for medium skilled women,

which is hardly surprising given that (i) the reform gives inactive women no increase

in paid maternity leave on average and (ii) these DID estimates are reduced form

eects of the policy.   As a result, the corresponding rst stage coecient (i.e., the

average change in benets for education groups) is simply smaller when the inactive

are included. Conversely, because the sample of active women benets more strongly

from the reform, restricting the data to economically active women (column (4)) while

excluding civil servants and the self-employed to match the pension registry sample

(column (5)) results in the expected increase in the estimated reform eect for both

education groups.    In particular, when only active women are included, the reform

augments the fertility of highly educated active women by close to 22 births per 1000

women (see Figure 4).

   The longer timespan covered by the Microcensus data also allows estimation of

placebo reforms over a lengthier period. I thus redene my pre and post reform periods

as 2001-2003 and 2004-2006, respectively, and estimate placebo reform eects for the



                                            20
whole sample (columns (6)) and the sample of economically active women (column

(7)). In line with the pre reform trends depicted in Figure 4, the placebo estimates are

insignicant, suggesting that education groups experience no dierential time trends

prior to the reform. As a nal step, I replicate the education group analysis using the

sample of active women in the 2004-2012 pension registry data (Table A1, column (1))

and show that the results are of similar magnitude for the highly skilled, whose fertility

the reform increases by 18%, but larger for the medium skilled (a 13% increase).



5.3 Baseline results for benet estimation
Before reporting my estimation results of equation (3), I construct a discretized version

of the previously outlined continuous benet estimator by discretizing the net earnings

distribution into 10 intervals.                Each of the rst nine represents 3,000 EUR while the

last contains all real net earnings beyond 27,000 EUR (gross earnings of ca.                               47,000

EUR), which lies above the 95th percentile of the earnings distribution (25,085 EUR

net). I then estimate a linear probability model that controls for these earnings interval

dummies and their interaction with a post reform dummy, as well as controls from
                                        38
my baseline specication.                    By plotting the coecient estimates (and 95% condence

intervals) for the earnings interactions with the post reform dummies, I reveal a very

dierent fertility evolution along the earnings distribution (Figure 5A). In this evolve-

ment, no women below the earnings interval of 9,000-12,000 EUR (midpoint 10,500)

are any more likely to have a child post reform, but those with earnings below 3,000

EUR, which corresponds to the bottom 10%, actually experience a statistically signif-

icant decline in fertility. Women who are at or above the 50th percentile (median =

10,100 EUR, around 14,800 EUR gross) of the net earnings distribution, however, have

a signicantly increased probability  around 3-8 children in 1,000 women or 0.3-0.8

percentage points  of having a child in any of the 5 years post reform. Even women in

the top earnings interval who are above the 95th percentile are statistically signicantly

more likely to give birth post reform (6.4 births in 1,000 children). In fact, the rela-

tively stable post reform surge in childbearing for above-median earners (Figure 5A),

with benets steadily increasing despite increasing income (Figure 5B), implies that

the eect of paid leave benets on fertility may be stronger for the middle-upper part

of the income distribution than for the top end.

        Next, dening benets as the sum of benets in 1,000 EUR (in 2010 prices) that

a woman could expect for giving birth, I estimate the baseline for equation (3), which

   38 I estimate the following specication,                              P10                  0
                                                    P (Child)it = Î·0 + e=1 Î¸e (Rt âˆ— deit ) + Xit
                                                                                                     P10
                                                                                                 Î·1 + e=1 Î³e deit +
uit ,   where   deit   is   a dummy variable, deit = 1{ej â‰¤ Ei < ej+1 }, indicating that earnings of woman i
lie within the ten          earnings intervals (Ei âˆˆ {1, 2..., 10}) of length 3000 EUR, Rt is a post (2007)-reform
indicator.

requires the inclusion of a exible function of lagged net income. Before making the

more conservative choice of a fth-order polynomial, I explore dierently-ordered poly-

nomials but nd very similar estimates from order two onward.                  The baseline result

in column (1) implies that an increase in the total expected benets of 1,000 EUR in-

creases the probability that a woman will give birth in each of the ve post reform years

by 0.783 births per 1,000 women. In terms of the average pre reform birth probability,

this gure implies a rise in fertility in a given year of 2.1% per 1,000 EUR in total

benets, slightly smaller than reported in the extant literature.              Milligan (2005), for

example, nds that a 1,000 CAD (around 690 EUR) increase in the total sum of 5-year

benets would increase fertility on average by 2.6%. On the other hand, the estimates

by Lalive and ZweimÃ¼ller (2009), who report an estimated future child eect of 21%

(or 7% points over three years) and a maximum benet increase of 4,080 EUR, imply

around a 5% increase in fertility per 1,000 EUR increase in extended maternity leave
                                                   39
benets for the second year of a child's life.

   The fact that my baseline estimate is robust to the omission of individual level

control variables (column (2)) suggests that reform implementation is exogenous with

respect to observable characteristics. Furthermore, I check whether the fth-order poly-

nomial in lagged net earnings as my choice of control function in my baseline speci-

cation is exible enough to control for the relation between earnings and fertility. In

(column (3)), I include only a second-order polynomial in net earnings, which yields a

similar estimated reform eect. In column (4), I address the concern that the eect of

net earnings on fertility decisions might dier by women's characteristics by employing

a more general form of the control function that is allowed to vary by woman's edu-

cation level. The estimated benet eect, however, does not change. In column (5), I

then report estimates for a placebo reform, assuming earnings-dependent benets had

already been introduced in 2006, and use the pre reform data only to test the dieren-

tial changes in fertility over the 2004-2006 period. The estimated eect for this placebo

reform is insignicant and the point estimate very close to zero.

   Up this point in the analysis, I have dened pre reform benets as the simulated

sum of benets under the 24-month entitlement period option, which has a maximum

of 300 EUR monthly (7,200 EUR in total). However, the scheme also allows women to

opt for a shorter entitlement period, with a maximum 450 EUR for 12 months (5,400

EUR in total).     This option, which is more popular among East German women, is

particularly attractive for mothers wanting to return to work after 12 months. I thus

redene the pre reform benets as the expected sum of benets under the shorter 12-

  39 Lalive and ZweimÃ¼ller (2009) report on p. 1366 that extending leave for the future child increased
fertility by 21%. I combine this number with the maximum amount of additional paid leave for the
second year of a child's life (340 EUR a month*12).




                                                  22
month option (column (6)). Furthermore, I have simulated and matched the pre reform

benets by women's income. Alternatively to my baseline specication, I simulate and

match the 24-month option for women's education-age groups of 5 years (column (7)).

Both redenitions of pre reform benets have little eect on the estimated coecient,

suggesting that the results are robust to alternative benet denitions.

   I next show the robustness of the baseline results of the benet estimator when a

grouping IV estimator is used to instrument the expected benets before, followed by

evidence on the robustness of the baseline estimate to the functional form chosen.

   In the two subsections below, I demonstrate the robustness of the baseline esti-

mate(s) when (i) the expected benets are instrumented with a grouping IV estimator

and (ii) dierent functional forms are assumed.

   IV results using variation across education groups:          The estimates in Table 6 would

be biased if women adjusted their earnings in response to the reform; however, I nd

no evidence that mothers increase their pre birth earnings or working hours (Table A2,

Panel A) or that they are more likely to enter the labor market (Panel B) as a reform

response. Nor is there any evidence of employment adjustments by women of childbear-

ing age (see Table A3). Nevertheless, because education groups explain much of the

variation in benets over time, identifying them as a strong instrumental variable, in

column (8), I check the robustness of my estimates to instrumenting leave benets with

education-year interactions, exploiting the variation in education-year specic mean

benets for identication. The partial R2 of the education-year interactions in the rst

stage is 0.111 with a rst stage F-statistic of 4,859. The IV point estimate of 1.096 is

slightly larger but not statistically signicantly dierent from the baseline estimate in

column (1).        This estimate implies that a 1,000 EUR increase in expected maternity

benets raises a woman's birth probability in one of the ve post reform years by 1.096

births in 1,000 women, an increase of 2.9% relative to the pre reform mean.

   Robustness of benet estimates to functional form :           Table 7 presents several spec-

ications exploring the robustness of the baseline estimates to the functional form

chosen.   First, specication A relates maternity benets directly to the opportunity

costs of birth, proxied by the net earnings in t-1. Here, I dene benets in terms of

their replacement ratio for net earnings, which ranges between 12% for high earners and

160% for very low earners before 2007 but lies above 67% for almost all women after
              40
the reform.        The mean reform-induced increase in the replacement ratio is about 29

percentage points, with a standard deviation of 9.55 (estimated using the 2006 pension

data). More specically, I estimate that a 10 percentage point increase in the replace-

  40 Women with net earnings above about 33,000 EUR (around 59,500 EUR gross) receive the maxi-
mum monthly benet irrespective of their income, so their replacement rates lies below 67%, but this
only aects a marginal fraction of less than 2% of my sample.




                                                23
ment ratio increases the probability of having a child by 1.37 births in 1,000 women, a

3.6% increase over the average pre reform probability.

   Because the eects of additional benets may be stronger for lower income women

and thus decreasing with benet level, specication B uses the log of total expected ben-

ets (together with a polynomial in log real net earnings) as an alternative explanatory

variable, thereby enabling the calculation of the benet elasticity. Here, a 10% increase

in benets raises birth probability by 0.71 births per 1,000 women, a 1.9% increase

relative to the pre reform mean. This increase implies an average benet elasticity of

0.19,
        41
             which conforms to the existing literature. For example, Cohen       et al. (2013) and
Milligan (2005) nd benet elasticities of child subsidies of 0.19 and 0.107, respectively,

which are in the same range of estimates as those in time-series studies (see Milligan

(2005), p. 551).




6 Heterogeneity by age and birth order
As previously emphasized, because women may change the timing rather than the total

number of children borne during their fertile years, my estimates reect the medium run

impact of nancial incentives on current rather than permanent fertility. Nonetheless,

Figures 3 and 4 show a clear upward trend in the fertility behavior of higher earning

and highly educated women 5 years post reform, suggesting that the latter has had a

lasting positive impact on the fertility behavior of aected groups. In addition, although

public perceptions of the coalition-generated reform as a permanent change aecting

childbearing costs may have resulted in delayed reactions in younger women, increased

nancial incentives are likely to have led to permanent increases in the fertility of women

closer to the end of their childbearing years (cf. Cohen       et al. (2013)).   Post-reform, they

face lower costs for an additional birth under the new parental leave benet system,

which might induce them to have a(n additional) child. Facing the new benet system,

I expect older women to not postpone an additional birth for too long and adjust their

fertility fairly fast. Their remaining time to conceive is very limited with the probability

to conceive decreasing over their remaining fertile years. In other words, the lower costs

faced by these women under the new maternity leave benet system may have induced

them to add to their families.       Hence, post reform, I expect that older women, with

very limited time to conceive and decreasing fertility likelihood, will adjust their fertility

relatively quickly rather than postponing an additional birth for any length of time.

   As shown by the separate regressions of equation (3) for the ve age categories

  41 Alternatively I can use the DID estimates above to calculate benet elasticities by relating the
%-change in fertility to the %-change in benets. I calculate the benet elasticity to be around 0.2
women above median earnings and 0.15 for high-skilled women.




                                                 24
(Table 8, columns (1)-(5)), the reform does indeed appear to have aected fertility

across all age groups, even though the estimated reform eects for some falls short of

the 10% signicance level. Even women aged 25-29 (column (2)) increase their fertility

in response to the higher maternity benets oered.      Nonetheless, my estimations of

a fully interacted specication do not allow me to reject the equality of the estimated

reform eect across age groups other than for the oldest women, aged 40-44, for whom

the eect is statistically signicantly dierent compared to women aged 25-29 and 35-

39 (columns (2) and (4)). The 40-44 age group (column (5)) is of particular interest

because of the large magnitude of the eect in terms of underlying probability:       an

additional 1,000 EUR of maternity leave benets increases a women's probability of

having a child in that same year by nearly 5%. The results for this and the 35-39 age

group, both nearing the end of their fertility cycle, suggest that the increased nancial

incentives have had a permanent eect on fertility and will increase the completed

fertility of these cohorts.

   In addition, although this analysis so far only documents a reform eect on overall

birth probability, a number of studies (e.g.     Laroque and SalaniÃ© (2014) and Brewer

et al.   (2011)) show that it also tends to aect the decision on rst births (extensive

margin) dierently than that on second or higher order births (intensive margin). The

detailed information on number and age of children provided by the Microcensus allows

me to test whether the reform does indeed aect the fertility of highly educated women

at dierent parities. Estimating a DID specication which allows for dierential eects

of the reform by birth order, I nd that for highly educated women across all age groups,

the reform has strongly impacted the decision to have not only a rst but also a second

or higher order child (Table A4, Panel A). Of particular interest in terms of completed

fertility are the reform eects across parities for women aged 40-44, whose childlessness

it seems not to eect (Table A4, Panel B). Rather, the increase in permanent fertility

established previously (Table 8, column (5)) is driven by the decision to have a(n

additional) second child rather than one child as a response to the reform, with a

large gap in completed fertility across education groups at the intensive margin. That

is, in 2012, 53.4% of highly educated women aged 45-49 had at most one child, a 15

percentage point higher share than for women without any postsecondary education

(BIB (2012)).     Based on my ndings, this substantial gap in births beyond the rst

child is likely to narrow as a result of the reform.




7 Discussion and Conclusion
In this paper, I assess the ability of Germany's introduction of earnings-related paid

maternity leave to increase fertility, especially for higher earning women with high


                                            25
opportunity costs of childbearing. In particular, by taking advantage of the large dif-

ferential changes in maternity leave benets across education and income groups, I am

able to use a DID approach to identify the direct fertility eect of the changes in paid

leave for the child yet to be born. My ndings in fact suggest that the higher benets

to higher earning women  up to 21,000 EUR as an exogenous source of variation in

entitlement  have actually changed the socioeconomic structure of fertility. Not only

do my baseline estimates indicate that a 1,000 EUR increase in total leave entitlements

raises the average birth probability by 2.1%, but other results for eects along the

earnings distribution suggest that the reform has increased the fertility of women with

median earnings and above, including the top 5th percentile. The policy also induces

highly educated women to give birth to 8.5 additional children per 1,000 women in a

given year over the 5 years post reform.    Admittedly, this observed fertility response

could be transitory rather than permanent; however, the strong reform eects observed

for women aged 35-39 and 40-44 suggest that it is likely to have a permanent eect.

Especially noteworthy is the fact that under the new system, highly educated women

are more likely to have a(n additional) second (rather than rst) child at the end of

their fertility cycle, signaling a change at the extensive margin.

   Taken together, my ndings suggest not only that earnings-related maternity leave

programs are successful at increasing fertility overall, but that the policy has success-

fully raised fertility, particularly for women with higher opportunity costs of childbear-

ing who were given very low nancial incentives under the previous at benet scheme.

Such leave therefore appears to be a more eective policy than traditional schemes like

child subsidies or cash benets for incentivizing fertility in women with higher oppor-

tunity costs. The ndings thus imply that paid maternity leave could help mitigate the

general fertility declines associated with women's increasing labor market participa-

tion, thereby narrowing the existing baby gap between education and earnings groups.

Yet neither the eect of maternity leave on fertility decisions nor the socioeconomic

composition of fertility is as yet receiving adequate research attention. Rather, the ma-

ternity leave literature focuses largely on the direct eect of extending maternity leave

on mothers' labor supply and the outcomes of children already born. Hence, providing

causal evidence on how the German policy changes have aected fertility patterns is

important for all countries facing low fertility rates, which are a risk to the long-term

sustainability of public pension systems.

   In addition, the fact that my quasi-experimental approach identies only reduced-

form fertility responses under the assumption of a xed short run investment in human

capital up to 5 years post reform raises interesting possibilities for extending the work.

Thus future researchers might, for example, analyze the long run eect of the reform on

potential human capital investment and labor supply in a dynamic structural framework



                                            26
(see Adda   et al. (2017)).   Within such a long term perspective, women would face lower

expected opportunity costs of childbearing because of higher earnings replacement of

leave payments, so younger women in particular might respond by increasing their

investment in human capital.

    The narrowing of the baby gap identied in this paper is economically important
                                                                                         42
because when intergenerational mobility in education or income is limited,                    this nar-

rowing is likely to have important distributional implications for future generations. In

fact, Werding and Hofmann (2006) and Sinn (2013) predict that a child with above

average earnings (150% of the average) born in 2000 will have an almost 220,000 EUR

larger scal gain from the German social security system than the average newborn

child, whose net gain will be close to 80,000 EUR. The changes observed in the socioe-

conomic structure of fertility have similarly serious implications: in particular, if the

introduction of earnings-related maternity leave, by changing the composition of future

generations, improves their education and labor market outcomes (and with that their

taxable income), then the case for maternity leave programs is likely to be stronger.




  42 The intergenerational correlation between parental and child education is high and estimated to be
around 0.4-0.5 for the US and most Western European countries (see for instance Hertz et al. (2008) as
well as Black and Devereux (2011) who discuss the potential underlying mechanisms for the observed
correlation in education).

Appendix
Appendix A: Benet simulation and data coding
Benet calculation
Pre reform benets:   Prior to the reform, maternity leave payouts were means tested on

household income during benet receipt. I thus simulate a woman's pre reform entitle-

ment if she gave birth to a child using 2006 Microcensus data on the current net income

for the woman and her spouse, dened as either a husband or cohabitating partner. I

restrict the sample to all women aged 20-44 in the survey year and approximate net

yearly income based on the net monthly income variable, which is provided in 24 in-

tervals. The pre reform eligibility thresholds were also based on net household income

during benet receipt, excluding income from public transfers. The income variable re-

ported in the Microcensus includes social assistance and unemployment benets, which

I set to zero for individuals designated unemployed or inactive during the survey period.

Because the number of very high earners is very small, I pool all observations for net

income above 43,200 EUR. I simulate the woman's maximum potential benets based

her spouse's generated net labor income under the assumption that she has no labor

income during benet receipt.    In calculating the potential entitlement, I apply the

benet eligibility rules to the spouse's current income, assigning the maximum benet

of 7,200 EUR (5,400 EUR for option 2) to women whose spouse earns under 16,800

EUR. If the spouse's net income falls between 16,800 and 22,200 EUR, the benets

range from a minimum of 1,980 EUR to a maximum of 7,200 EUR (2,700 EUR and

5,400 EUR for the short option), so I set the potential benets equal to the midpoint of

this benet interval. Women whose spouse's net income lies between 22,200 EUR and

29,400 EUR would only have been eligible for a total benet payment of 1,800 EUR

over six months (for both options), while women with spousal net income above 29,400

EUR would have been ineligible for any maternity benets. For women with no part-

ner in the household, family income during benet receipt would lie below the income

threshold, so I assign them the maximum benet. Because some eligibility cutos fall

into an income interval, I calculate the mean simulated benet by applying the lower

and upper brackets of the income interval, respectively.

   I derive my baseline results by collapsing the simulated pre reform benets (based

on spousal income) by the respective earnings intervals of women aged 25-44. I then

merge these simulated benets with the pension data used in the main analysis.        As

an alternative, I simulate the pre birth earnings for ve age group-specic education

groups, which generates 15 distinct values for the simulated pre reform benets. I then




                                           33
merge these values with the pension data by age and education.

   Post reform benets and net earnings:   Because the post reform benets are a direct

function of women's labor earnings (independent of spousal earnings), I use a detailed

maternity benet calculator (http://www.familien-wegweiser.de/Elterngeldrechner) to

generate the expected maximum benet as the sum of monthly benets over the total

12-month entitlement period based on women's gross yearly earnings (taken from the

pension registry). Given the dierent tax class choices allowed couples under German

joint taxation rules, I assume women to be taxed under tax class IV (equivalent to tax

class I for singles), the commonest option for couples with relatively equal earnings.

Calculating these benets using alternative tax classes also has little eect on my es-

timates.   For simplicity, I further assume that the women have no children, thereby

eliminating any increase in calculated benets by a small sibling premium. I calculate

the net labor earnings for my estimation strategy using an implicit tax rate for gross

yearly labor earnings, which is provided by the benet calculator.



Education coding
The education groups, dened based on the German educational system, dierenti-

ate between low educated women without any postsecondary education (equivalent to

category 1 and 2 of ISCED97), medium educated women who have completed an ap-

prenticeship (equivalent to 3, 4 and 5b of ISCED97), and highly educated women with

tertiary education (categories 5a and 6 of ISCED97).    In a rst step, I impute miss-

ing education by replacing the unknown value with the modal value for education in

the woman's 3-digit occupational category. Furthermore, the modal education level of

about 7% of the sample in the pension data is unknown. Because these cases typically

occur in low skilled occupations, often for part-time marginal jobs for which employers

specify no education details, I include them in the low education group.

Notes : The graph in Part A shows maximum sum of benefits a woman would be entitled to against her yearly net
earnings (in EUR), pre and post-reform. In Part B the sum of benefits is expressed as the replacement ratio of net
yearly earnings. The post benefits are calculated via a benefit calculator for gross earnings. The pre-reform benefits
for the 24-months option and the shorter 12-month-option, are simulated for discrete earnings brackets using the
Microcensus 2006 (See Appendix A).

Notes : Graph in Part A shows estimates (with 95% Confidence Intervals) post-reform interaction with income interval (intervals of 3000 EUR , starting with below 3000 up to an interval
containing women with netincome >27 000 EUR) from augmented baseline regression, incl. dummies for income brackets and the controls (see e.g. notes in Table 3) in baseline regression
(omitting year fixed effect). The graph in Part B shows the estimated coefficients for the post-reform benefit increase across the earnings intervals defining pre-reform benefits by
women's income. Data Source: pension registry data (AKVS) 2004-2012, Microcensus 2006 for pre-reform benefit simulation.

Notes: Panel A reports total fertility rates across various country, information is based on
Worldbank Development indicators and information by national Statistical offices. In Panel B I
report completed fertility rates for cohorts born around 1965 for women without a secondary
schooling degree (or for UK and Sweden for women who only completed the minimum
compulsory schooling) and women with tertiary education (college degree for US). Information
is based on U.S. Census Bureau (2010), Ratcliff and Smith (2006) for the UK, Bujard (2012) and

Notes: Information on average paid and proportion covered is calculated on statistics on Elterngeld and
Erziehungsgeld provided by the German Statistical office. Note that post 2007, two additional months of benefit
entitlement are reserved for the other parent. Pre 2007, the income threshold (after deductibles) was 30,000 EUR
for couples (23,000 EUR for single parents). Benefits were restricted to a duration of 6 months for those with an
income threshold above around 21,000 EUR (and below 30,000 EUR). The income referred to the household income
during benefit receipt. See Kluve and Tamm (2013) for further reform details.

Panel B: Parity information from Microcensus (all women)
Woman does not have a child                         0.39
Woman is mother of one child                        0.27
Woman is mother of two children                     0.25
Woman is mother of three or more children           0.09
Notes: Panel A reports sample means of the probability to give birth in a given
year (outcome variable) and the average benefits a woman could receive in the
pre-reform and post-reform period (standard deviation in parantheses). It further
reports selected individual charactertics of women as well as the percentile of the
distribution of earnings in the preceding year in EUR, both in gross and net terms.
Information of education of women is based on the Micocensus sample. Panel B
reports information on the number of existing children in the household for the
sample of all women aged 21-44 of the Microcensus.

Notes: All regressions show estimates for a linear probability model of giving birth in t and are estimated for women aged 21-44 with positive earnings in t-1 for years
2004-2006 and 2008-2012. The interaction with post 2007 and earnings dummies tests for differential time trends post reform with respect to women below that
earnings threshold (control group). In (1)-(3) the treatment group consists of women above median earnings (control group: below median earnings). In (4) the
treatment group consists of women with earnings above the 90th percentile (treatment group: below 10th percentile) and in (5) of women with earnings between
median and 75th percentile (control: 25th-median earnings). In (6) I estimate the effect for a placebo reform in 2006 and restrict the sample period to 2004-2006
(N=253,668). I control for treatment group indicators. I have further controlled for year dummies, region (LÃ¤nder) dummies, age dummies and separate age dummies
for tertiary educated women, a dummy for German nationality, education dummies, social benefit and vocational training status in t-1 as well dummies whether the
woman has had a child in t-1 and t-2. In Specification (2) I drop all control variables and in (3) I additionally account for earnings and its square in t-1. Robust standard
errors reported in brackets. * indicates significance at 10%, ** indicates significance at 5%, *** indicates significance at 1% level.

Notes: All regressions show estimates for a linear probability model of giving birth in t (expressed in 1000 women) and are estimated for women aged 21-44, years 2004-2006 and
2008-2012. Benefits are defined in real (2010) 1000 EUR. All specifications include year dummies. I have further controlled for a fifth order polynomial for real net (2010 prices)
income in the past year, for region (LÃ¤nder) dummies, German nationality, age dummies and separate age dummies for tertiary educated women, education dummies, vocational
training status in t-1 and social benefits status in t-1 and whether the woman had a child in t-1 or t-2. In (2) I drop the individual control variables except the year dummies. In (3) I
account for a second order polynomial (instead of a fifth order) in real net earnings. In (3) I amend the baseline regression in (1) by interacting the control function in net earnings (of
baseline estimates) with education controls. In (5) I estimate the effects for a placebo reform on pre-reform data (2004-2006) setting the reform date to 2006. In (6) I define the pre-
reform benefit in terms of the shorter 12-months option and in (7) I merge simulated pre-reform benefits by education-age group. In (8), benefits are instrumented by education-year-
interactions. Robust standard errors reported in brackets. * indicates significance at 10%, ** indicates significance at 5%, *** indicates significance at 1% level.

Notes: All regressions show estimates for a linear probability model of giving birth in t (expressed in 1000 women) and
are estimated for women aged 25-44, years 2004-2006 and 2008-2012. in Panel A I define benefits as a replacement
rate in percentage terms of net earnings in t-1. To avoid large outliers, I restrict the sample in Panel A to women with
netincomes larger than 2000 EUR in t-1 (N=607,634). In Panel B I use log benefits instead of benefits in levels. I have
further controlled for a fifth order polynomial for real net (2010) earnings in t-1 (polynomial in log real net earnings in
B) , for LÃ¤nder dummies, German nationality, education dummies, a dummy for vocationa training status in t-1, age
dummies and separate age dummies for tertiary educated women, year dummies and social benefits status in t-1 and

Note: All regression show differences-in-differences estimates on various labor market
outcomes, comparing women above age 20 who gave birth in year t (treatment) and older
women (ages 46-59). Panel A is based on the pension registry data. The outcome in column
(1) is an increase in hours between year t and t-1 for women previously working part-time in
t-1 (measured by a binary indicator which takes the value one when a woman changed from
small to large part-time or part-time to full-time). Results in column (1) are restricted to years
2004-2010, as the coding of the part-time variable changed in 2011. The outcome in (2) are
changes in daily earnings between t-1 and t for all women who were previously employed.
Panel B is based on data from the German Microcensus and measures whether a woman is
economically active, measured by a dummy for being either active in year t or having stopped
work in the previous year. The interaction post 2007 and the indicator for giving birth tests
for differential time trends in labor market outcomes post reform of new mothers with
respect to older women (control).

Notes: All regressions show estimates for a linear probability model of giving birth in t and are estimated for years 2004-
2006 and 2008-2012. I only show results for tertiary educated women. In Panel A I look at probabilities to have a first
birth, second or third (or higher) for women aged 20-45 estimating a model with additional interactions of second as well
as third and higher order with the post 2007 dummy to test for heterogeneous reform responses for the second and
higher order births. In Panel B I restrict my sample to women at the end of their fertile cycle, age 40-44, to investigate the
effects on completed fertility along the extensive (first birth) and intensive margin (second birth). In column (1), I include
all women observed in the Microcensus. In column (2), I restrict the sample to women who have been in employment to
match the sample composition of the pension registry data. The interaction with post 2007 and education tests for
differential time trends post reform for first births with respect to low skilled women (control group, captured by post
2007 dummy). I have further controlled for LÃ¤nder dummies, age dummies and separate age dummies for tertiary
educated women, a dummy for German nationality and whether the woman has been born in Germany as well as year
dummies. I additionally account for dummies measuring that the woman has one or more than one children as well as
age dummies of existing children. Robust standard errors reported in brackets. * indicates significance at 10%, **
indicates significance at 5%, *** indicates significance at 1% level.
