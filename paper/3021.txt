         CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF WAGES: THE U.S. VERSUS JAPAN


                                  ABSTRACT

      This paper examines changes in wage differentials by educational

attainment and experience in the US. and Japan since the early l970s. While

educational earnings differentials have expanded dramatically in the U.S. in

the 1980s, the college wage premium has increased only slightly in Japan. In

contrast to the large expansion in experience differentials for high school

males in the U.S., the wages of male new entrants have risen relative to nore

experienced workers for both high school and college graduates in Japan from

1979 to 1987. Macroeconomic factors (increased openness, trade deficits, and

labor market slack) and changes in institutional structures (the decline in

unionization) are likely to have amplified each other in contributing to an

unprecedented decline in real and relative earnings of young less-skilled -

males in the U.S. in the l98Os, We further find that a sharp deceleration in

the rate of growth of college graduates as a fraction of the labor force in

the U.S. helps account for the much larger increase in the college wage

premium in the U.S. than in Japan in the l980s.

I.    Introduction

      The 1980s have witnessed a sharp change in the relative wages of skilled

and unskilled American workers. Educational wage differentials have

increased dramatically.1 Holding other characteristics constant, the average

wage of college graduates has increased by approximately 13 percent relative

to the wages of high school graduates in the 1980s. The changes in the

return to education have been particularly pronounced for those just entering

the labor force. Between 1979 and 1987 the esrninga of young male college

graduates increased by over twenty percent relative to those of young male

high school graduates. Wage differentials by experience have expanded

substantially for workers with relatively low education. Because growth in

average standards of living has been relatively slow in the United. States,

the relative decline in the wages of unskilled young people has meant large

absolute declines of as much as 20 percent in the real wages of less-educated

male new entrants since the start of the decade.

      The dramatic deterioration in the absolute and relative economic

positions of less-educated Americana in the l980s has generatad much

attention among academics, the press, policymakers. and politicians.

Arguments over whether these changes were caused by the Carter

administration, the Reagan administration, or "foreign villains" were among

the "highlights" of the "good jobs, bad jobs" debate in the 1988 U.S.

Presidential election.

     Many of the proposed explanations for the widening of skill differentials

in the U.S. have focused on international economic developments. Some have


     1Blackburn, Bloom and Freeman (1989) document that occupational earnings
differentials have also expanded tremendously in the U.S. since the late
197Cc. Handlers, service workers, and factory operatives have lost
substantial ground relative to managers, professionals, and technical workers
over the last decade,
                                        2

argued that the strong dollar of the early 1980s and tha associated large

trade deficit and Ildeindustrializationu of America have sharply reduced the

demand for less-educated workers as the manufacturing sector that intensively

employs these workers has declined.2        Others posit that the increased

integration of the world economy has sharply reduced the demand for less-

educated workers through an effective increase in the supply of unskilled

workers embodied in imports from newly industrializing nations and from the

increased ability of capital to move to where less-skilled labor is cheap

(Bluestone and Harrison, 1988) .   A third view is that technological changes

(e.g. the microcomputer revolution) that favor intellectual over physical

attributes of workers have raised the return to working with the mind rather

than the hands.

     Distinguishing between these hypotheses is important. In all

likelihood, the Us trade deficit will decline sharply in the 1990s if only

because foreigners will stop lending to the United States, and as a result

the manufacturing sector which has traditionally accounted for a lion's share

of American trade will almost certainly grow rapidly. if it is these

macroeconomic developments that account for the changing wage structure,

recent trends are likely to be reversed without policy interventions. On the

other hand, if recent changes in the earnings distribution are a consequence

of either a secular increase in the openness of the wand economy or of.

technological innovations favoring highly skilled workers, these changes are

likely to persist. In this case, the importance of formulating policies that

raise the skilled fraction of the labor force is increased.

     American time series information alone is likely to prove insufficient


     2xurphy and Welch (1988s,b) provide suggestive evidence for this view.
to distinguish between various explanations for changing skill differentials.

This paper brings to bear information on changes in the Japanese wage

structure in sn effort to illuminate the causes of changing wage structures.3

While broad technological developments may be quite similar in Japan and the

United States, the two countries are mirror images in terms of their trade

performance during the 1980s.

      In this paper, we first set out the basic facts of how wage

differentials by educational attainment and experience have changed in the

U.S. and Japan since the early 1970a. While both countrie√° exhibit a decline

in the relative earnings of college graduates and moderate increases in wage

differentials by experience in the l970s, we find that the two countries

differ sharply with reapect to changes in the structure of wages in the

1980s. In contrast to the sharp expansion of educational earnings

differentials in the U.S. in the l980s, the college wage premium has

increased only slightly in Japan.    In contrast to the large expansion in

experience differentials for high school males in the U.S. the wages of male

naw entrants have risen relative to more experienced workers for both high

school and college graduates in Japan from 1979 to 1987. Furthermore, real

wages increased moderately for new entrants at all levels of schooling in

Japan in the l980s.

     The shsrp difference between the U.S. and Japan in the change in the

economic performsnce of young, high-school males is suggestive of an



     3This paper differs from other recent literature on changes in the wage
structure in the 1980s in that it compares hQ.fJi changes between two countries
snd across time periods (the l970s vs. the 1980s) .   Recent studies
exclusively examining changes in the U.S. wage structure include Blackburn,
Bloom, and Freeman (1989), Bound and Johnson (1989), Levy (1989), and Murphy
and Welch (l988a,b).
                                        4

important role for macroeconomic factors associsted with trade performance

and the health of the manufacturing sector in shaping changea in the

distribution of earnings. If broad global changes, such as increased

international economic integration or technological changes, are the key

elements in affecting recent labor market developments, then the differences

in the U.S. snd Japanese experiences suggest that differences in labor market

institutions (e.g. the role and strength of unions, training institutions

minimum wages) are crucial in determining how these factors translate into

changes in the wage structure.

     We present a collage of evidence designed to help make a preliminary

assessment of these interpretations of changes in the wage structure as well

as to determine the importance of demographic factors (changes in the

relative number of workers by education and age). Our broad conclusion is

that there is no monocausal explanation for recent changes in wage structure.

There are elements of truth in each of several proposed hypotheses.

     More specifically, we find that:

     I. The rate of growth of college graduates as a fraction of the labor

force decreased dramatically in the U.S. and did not decrease as much in

Japan in the l9BOs. This sharp deceleration in the U.S. helps account for

the much larger increase in the college wage premium in the U.S. than in

Japan in the 1980s.   Relative supply factors do not appear to be able to

account for the sharp decline in the earnings of young less-educated

Americans relative to the more experienced workers with similar educational

attainment.

     2. Macroeconomic factors (increased openess, trade deficits, and labor

market slack) and changes in institutional structures (the decline in
                                      5

unionization) are likely to have amplified each other in contributing to an

unprecedented decline in real and relative earnings of young less-skilled

males in the U.S. in the 1980s.

     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II

documents in detail the quantitative dimenaiona of changes in wage

differentials by educational attainment and by experience in the United

Statea and Japan. Section III considers the role of demographic factors.

macroeconomic conditions, structural demand shifts, and deunionization in

explaining movements in the structure of wages. Section IV concludes.




II. Chanzes in the Structure of Wages in the U.S. and Javan

     In this section, we lay out the basic facts concerning recent changes in

the structure of wages in the U.S. and Japan. We first present a brief

comparative overview of changes in educational wage differentials and then

turn to detailed examinations of movements in the pattern of earnings in each

country.

     Figure 1 presents the time pattern of changes in the college wage

premium in both countries. It compares changes in the ratio of the income of

25-34 year old male college gradustes to those of similarly aged male high

school graduates for the U.S. and Japan from 1967 to l9S7. The figure

illustrates that the college wage premium has been substantially higher in

the U.S. than in Japan throughout the last twenty years. It further shows


     4For the U.S., we the median annual money income of full-time, year-
round workers. For Japan, we use average monthly wages (total monthly
contractual earnings plus one-twelfth of annual special payments). College
graduates are those with 4 or more years of college, and high school
graduates are those with 12 years of schooling.

that the earnings of college graduates relative to less-educated workers

declined significantly in both the U.S. and Japan from the late-1960e to the

late l970s.5   This pattern has reversed sharply in the U.S. with the

college/high school earnings ratio for 25-34 year old males increasing from a

trough of 1.15 in 1978 to 1.48 in 1986. On the other hand, the analogous

ratio for Japan fell fairly continuously until 1984 and increased moderately

froe 1984 to 1987. As we illustrate below, the contrasts between the U.S.

and Japanese experiences are even greater when one compares the relative

earnings of less-educated new entrants to college new entrants.



A.   Changes in the Stnjcture of Wages in the U.S. . 1973-87

     We focus our detailed analysis of changes in the U.S. wage structure on

the period since 1973 because this year marks the start of a period of

stagnation of real earnings growth in the U.S. that represents a strong break

from the historical pattern. To perform this analysis, we use data on

individuals from the Hay 1973 Current Population Survey (CFS) and from the

outgoing rotation groups of the 1979, 1984 end 1987 Full-Year CPSs.6 The

basic samples used for each.year consist of individuals 18 to 65 years old


     5Freeman (1981) documents that a similar pattern of the deterioration in
the relative earnings of highly-educated workers occurred in almost all OECD
economies during the 1970s.

     6A potentially important problem with earnings data froa the CPS
outgoing rotation groups is that the edited usual weekly earnings variable is
top coded at $999. This top code is relevant for a substantial fraction of
highly educated males in recent yests. We conclude from a detailed analysis
of alternative treatments of the top code that a reasonable approximation is
to recode the weekly earnings of those at the cap as $1450. This adjustment
yields results for changes in reel end relative earnings of different groups
of workers in the 1979 to 1987 period that are similar to those found when
one compares changes in group median earnings and when one uses a tobit
procedure (that explicitly treats the observations with top coded earnings ss
censored) to estimate mean earnings for each group.

who satisfied the following conditions: (1) listed working as major activity;

(2) were not self-employed; and (3) had usual hourly earnings (usual weekly

earnings divided by usual weekly hours) of at least one-half the prevailing

minimum wage and less than or equal to $50 an hour.7

     We first provide a summary of changes in the structure of earnings in

the U.S. since 1973 for young workers (those with less then 10 years of

potential experience) and for peak earners (those with 20 to 29 years of

potential experience).8   We focus on 12 separate groups for each year: three

educational splits (0-11, 12, and 16+ years of schooling), 2 potential

experience splits (0-9 and 20-29 years), and 2 gender groups.        For each of

the 12 separate groups in 1973, 1979, and 1987, we regress the log of usual

hourly earnings on potential experience, dummy variables for years of

schooling (where appropriate), and dummy variables for nonwhite, part-time,

and metropolitan area status. The resulting estimated mean log wage rates

and their estimated standard errors are reported in the top panel of Table

     The estimates are predicted values from the regressions for white1 full-

tiae, workers, residing in a metropolitan ares at three educational levels

(8-11, 12, and 16 years) and two experience levels (5 and 25 years). These

adjusted means of log hourly earnings for each group allow us to control for

changes in observed measures of group composition in making inferences



     7Our basic samples contain the following numbers of observations:
34,806 for 1973; 148,683 for 1979; 155,172 for 1984; and 158,466 for 1987.

     8We define potential experience as min(Age -   education   -

concerning changes in real and relative wages.10 Changes in real log hourly

earnings for each group from 1973-79, 1979-87, and 1973-87 are presented in

the bottom panel of the table.

     Several basic stylized facts concerning changes in the atructure of wage

emerge from the numbers preaented in the table. First, movementa in relative

wages by educational attainment differ substantially in the two subperioda.

Less-educated workers gained alightly against college graduates in all age-

gender groups during the 1973 to 1979 period. This trend more than

completely reversed between 1979 and 1987 as educational wage differentials

for all groups expanded with a vengeance. For example, from 1979 to 1987,

the mean log wsge of male college graduates with five years of experience

increased by 0.022 -   (-0.169) ‚Äî 0.191   (relative to the mean log wages of male

high school graduates with the same experience, and by 0.243 relative to the

mean log wages of high school dropouts. Thus the earnings of young college

graduates increased by over 20 percent relative to those of less-educated

males during this period. Overall, the college/high school wage differential

increased by 14 percent for men and by 12 percent for women from 1979 to 1987

after having declined by 5 percent for men and 9 percent for women from 1973

to 1979.11

     Table 1 clearly indicates that increases in educational differentials


         similar methodology is used by Bound and Johnson (1989) in an
examination of changes in relative wages over the 1979-87 period.

     1These summary changes are based on separate log hourly earnings
regressions for our entire aamples of 18 to 65 year males and females
respectively for 1973, 1979, and 1987. The regressions included 8 schooling
dummies, a spline in potential experience, 8 region dummies, a race dummy, a
metropolitan area status dummy, and a part-time work dummy. The estimated
college/high school log hourly wage differential for males (females) declined
from 0.32 (0.39) in 1973 to 0.27 (0.30) in 1979 and then increased to 0.40
(0.49) in 1987.

since 1979 are much larger for younger workers than for peak eerners.      This

is consistent with the similar larger decreases in relative earnings of

younger college workers in 1969-73 period documented by Freeman (1977).

Because of internal labor markets and firm-specific skills1 younger and older

workers are likely to be imperfect substitutes in production, and young

workers are more likely to bear the brunt of shifts in demand and supply

conditions in the external labor market.

     Second, the table highlights the stagnation of real earnings growth in

the U.S. since 1973. Most dramatically the real earnings of young males

with 12 or fewer years of schooling and of female high school dropouts fell

by tremendous amounts in a relatively short period from 1979 to 1987. In

fact, the real hourly earnings of male dropouts with 5 years of experience

fell by approximately twenty percent in this period of just eight years.

     Third, experience differentials for both males and females with 12 or

fewer years of schooling increased substantially between 1979 and 1987.

These increases in experience differentials for high school graduates

occurred despite a decline in the fraction of high school graduates with 1-3

years of experience (Murphy and Welch, l988b). This suggests that theae

changes reflect a relative demand shift against young, less-educated workers

rather than the impact of generational crowding. The increases in experience

differentials for less-educated workers reflected the tremendous real

earnings losses of young, less-educated workers rather than real earnings

growth for peak earners. In contrast, the relative earnings of peak earners

to new entrants for both male and female college graduates have remained

fairly stable since 1979.

    Finally, while gender differentials are not a focus of the current
                                      10

study, it is of interest to note that between 1979 and 1987

male/female earnings differential narrowed substantially (from 4 to 10

percent) between 1979 and 1987 for every education-experience category

represented in the Table 1. This contrasts with the small amount of change

in gender differentials apparent in the 1973-79 period.

     Table 2 provides more details on the pattern of changes in college/high

school and experience differentials for males. The table presents ratios of

relative usual weekly earning by education and experience groups for male,

full-time workers. A focus on full-time workers and weekly earnings is

useful for a comparison with changes in the wage structure in Japan since the

available data on earnings for detailed groups in Japan represent monthly

wages for regular workers. The table indicates that, after slight declines

for most groups in the 1973-79 period, college/high school wage ratios

increased dramatically for males in all experience groups from 1979 to 1984

and continued to expand through 1987. The college/high school mean weekly

wage ratio for males with less than five years of experience more than

doubled, increasing from 1.42 in 1979 to 1.86 in 1987. The table further

suggests that the growth of the college/high school wage differential cannot

be related entirely to a recent decline in the equality" of those who do not

go on to college (perhaps from a worsening of American high school

education). Older cohorts of high school graduates also experienced

substantial earnings reductions relative to college graduates in the 1979 to

1984 period as compared to analogous changes in differentials for same aged

cohorts from 1973 to 1979.12

     Panel B of Table 2 shows that earnings of less-educated male new

entrants fell dramatically relative to both peak earners end workers with 10-

14 years of experience from 1979 to 1987. The ratios also indicate that

less-educated peak earners gained substantially relative to males with the

ssme educational attainment and 10-14 years of experience in the 1980s.

Furthermore, the table shows that the well-known historical pattern of a

steeper cross-section age-earnings profile for college than for high school

workers has sharply reversed in the 1980s with the massive declines in the

earnings of younger high school graduates.

     A final major change in the structure of wages in the U.S. ia a sharp

increase in the inequality of earnings within education-experience-gender

groups. From 1973 to 1987, increases within groups in the earnings of

workers in the upper part of the earnings distribution relative to those in

the lower part hsve been of similar magnitude to increases in educational

differentials. For example, the log weekly wage differential between the

ninetieth and the tenth percentile male high school graduate with less than

ten years of experience increased from by 0.12 between 1972-4 and 1978-80 and

increased by 0.10 from 1978-80 to l9857.13 Although changes in within group

and between group earnings differentials have been of similar magnitude for

the period since the early l970s, the time patterns of the changes differ

substantially. While educational differentials fell in the 1970s and

increased sharply in the 1980s, within group inequality (whether measured by

the standard deviation of log earnings, the interquartile range, or the

     13
        These figures are for full-time workers and are based on a data from
March CPSs. Similar increases in inequality are apparent within almost all
education-experience-gender groups. More detailed analyses of within group
changes in inequality and descriptions of this data set can be found in Juhn,
Murphy, and Fierce (1989) and Katz and Murphy (1989).
                                      12

differential between the ninetieth and tenth percentile worker in a group)

has increased rather steadily throughout the period since the early 1970s

after remaining fairly stable itt the 1960s (Juhn, Murphy and Pierce 1989).

     The time pattern of increases in within group inequality suggests that

changes in the structure of the U.S. economy mitigating in favor of

increased returns to "ability" (or maybe to luck and connections) have

operated sinca the early 1970s. The different time pattern of changes in

educational wage differentials suggests that tha rapid increase in the supply

of college graduates in the early to mid- l970s may have offset factors

tending towards increased skill differentials.



B. Chanees in the Structure of Wages in Jaosn

     This section documents changes in relative wages by education and

experience in Japan since the late 1960s. We concentrate exclusively on

changes in earnings differentials for males because of data availability and

the strong segmentation between males and females in the Japanese labor

market.

     In contrast to the U.S. experience of the l9SOs, educational wage

differentials have increased only moderately in Japan since the late 1910s,

and experience differentials for both high school and college males have

narrowed. The moderate increase in educational differentials does reflect a

change from the pattern of the mid-1950s to the 1970s, in which the earnings

differential between those with md without college degrees narrowed

substantially for males. Figure 2 presents movements in the monthly regular

earnings of new college graduates relative to those of new high school

graduates from 1955-86)' The ratio of the starting wage of new college

graduates relative to high school graduates declined precipitously from 1.65

in 1959 to 1.19 in 1975. This was a period of steady expansion in the

fraction of new labor market entrants with college degrees.15 This trend has

reversed and the ratio has increased slightly in the 1980s.

     Since age-earnings profiles appear to be steeper in large firms than in

small firms in Japan, and since company status and working conditions are

better in large firms, differences in starting pay for new college and high

school graduates may not adequately measure differences in their employment

packages. An alternetive measure of changes in the entry-level educational

sarket in Japan -- suggested by Nakata and Mosk (1985) --     is   the fraction

of entering workers in different educational groups attaining jobs in large

firms (enterprises with a thousand or more employees). Nakata and Mosk find

that the fraction of college graduates entering large firms declined from the

mid-1960s to 1980. We have used data from the Prime Minister's Office,

Statistic Bureau, Emolovment Status Survey to calculate changes in the

fraction of 20-24 year old male college graduates and 15-24 year old male

high school graduates working in lsrge firms in the 1980s. We find that the

fraction of new male college graduates working in large firms increased from

0.281 in 1982 to 0.346 in 1987, while the corresponding frsction for young

male high school graduates fell slightly from 0.234 to 0,221. This indicstes

      an improvement in future career prospe-cts for college graduates relative to

      high school graduates in the 1980s that might not show up in wages for

      several years.

           For our more detailed analysis of wage .differentials in Japan we use

      data from the published tables for private industries of the Chingin Kozo

      Kihon Tokei Chosa (Basic Survey on Wage Structure)      These wage data are

      compiled from surveys of individuals in about 70,000 non-government

      establishments with ten or more regular workers taken in June of each year

      These wage statistics provide us with data on mean wages for male regular

      workers in reasonably detailed age-educational attainment categories. In our

      analysis of wage differentials, we use a reasonably comprehensive measure of

      total monthly earnings: the sum of total monthly contract earnings (regular

      earnings plus overtime payments) and one-twelfth of annual special earnings

       (bonus payments).

-   ‚Äî. -   Changes in reel monthly wages for male regular workers in selected

      educational attainment-experience groups from 1974-9 and 1979-87 are

      presented in Table 3. The pattern of real wage changes contrast sharply with

      the pattern in the United States. In particular, less-educated male new

      entrants have experienced more robust real earnings growth in the 1980s than

      in the 1974-9 period. Less-educated male new entrants have gained ground

      against workers with about 10 years of labor market experience in the 1980s.

 In contrast to the depressed market for inexperienced high school males in

 the U.S, the changes illustrated in Table 3 suggest a reasonably strong

 market for high school new entrants in Japan in the lPBQs. The table also

 illustrates that young college graduates have gained moderately on young high

 school graduates in the 1980s The changes in relative earnings by education

within experience groups are much less dramatic in Japan than in the United

 States.

      Movements in educational differentials for males in Japen since 1967 are

summarized in Table 4.   Panel (a) presents college/high school wage ratios

for males in the same age category. These ratios compare the earnings of

persons from a given high school class who went on to attain a college degree

to those who entered the labor market after high school. Panel (h) compares

the earnings of college and high school workers with the same amount of labor

market experience (i.e. those who entered the labor market at the same time).

College/high school earnings differentials fell moderately from 1967 to 1979

in both age and experience group comparisons. The decline is moat dramatic

in comparisons of new entrants and represents the continuation of the secular

decline in the entry-level differential illustrated in Figure 2. A

comparison of Tables 2 end 4 shows that, in 1979, the college/high school

wage differential was larger for young males in the U.S. but quite similar

for peak earners (those with 20 to 30 years of experience) in the two

countries. This difference reflects a greater disparity in the steepness of

the age-earnings profile for college versus high school workers in Japan.

     The comparison of college and high school workers of the same age

reveals that the college wage premium in Japan has increased substantially

since 1979 for young workers. Yet within experience groups, the increase in

The numbers are the ratios of average monthly wages (total monthly
contractual earnings plus one-twelfth of annual special earnings) for college
graduates relative to corresponding averages for high school graduates.
Experience is defined as Age minus 18 for high school graduates and as Age
minus 23 for college graduates.

the premium in the 1980s is quite small. Furthermore, the changes are small

relative to those in the ssme period for the United States. By 1987, the

college wage premium is much larger at all experience levels in the U.S. than

in Japan.

     The amaller increases in the college wage premium for experience groups

than for age groups in Japan is the exact opposite of the pattern in the

United States. The reason that the earnings of new entrants in Japan have

improved relative to those of young experienced workers for both high school

and college workers, while.the earnings of high school new entrants have

fallen relative to those of slightly more experienced workers in the United

States. Table 5 and Figure 3 illustrate in detail changes experience

differentials for males in Jspan. In the 1980s, high school new entrants

have gained against workers with S to 20 years of experience, and college new

entrants have gained against all groups of more experienced workers.

     Thus educational wage differentials have not increased nearly as

dramatically in Japan as in the United States since 1979, and experience

differentials for high school males have moved in opposite directions. The

next section examines alternative explanations for this contrast in changes

in the structure of wages in the U.S. and Japan.




III. Causes of Chanaes in the Structure of Wages

     In this section, we provide an exploratory investigation of four

potentislly complementary hypotheses for recent changes in the structure of

wages in the U.S. and Japan: changes in relative numbers of workers by age

and education; trade performance and mecroeconomic conditions; broader

  Peak earners are defined as workers from 45 to 49 years old. New entrants
are workers from 15 to 17 years old for lower secondary graduates, workers
from 18 to 20 years old for high school graduates, end workers from 20 to 24
years old for college graduates.
b Young workers are workers from 20 to 24 years old for lower secondary
graduates, workers from 25 to 29 years old for high school graduates, and
workers from 30 to 34 years old for college graduates.

structural changes affecting the relative demand for different skill groups;

and changes in union denaity.



A.   $imvlv Factors

     A first factor that many labor economists have focused on to explain

changes in the relative wages by age and education are changes in the

demographic structure of the labor force. The assumption of imperfect

substitutability between younger and older workers and between more- and

less-educated workers implies that changes in the age atructure and

educational attainment of the population and are likely to affect the

structure of wages. The degree of impact of relative numbers on the relative

earnings of two groups (in a simple two factor world) depends inversely on

the elasticity of factor substitution between the two groupsJ8



Changes jn the Relative Supply of Coflete

     A stark version of the relative supply hypothesis for educational

differentials makes the simplifying assumption that the relative demand for

college graduates grows at a relatively stable trend rate (perhaps becuase of

steady technological chagnes favoring more skilled workers). This hypothesis



     18When both factors are paid their marginal products, the elasticity of
substitution (a) between two factors can be written as -dlnRE/dlnRW, where RE
measures relative input quantities (employment) and RW measures relative
input prices (wages). Relative input demand can then be written:

         ln(RE) ‚Äî ln(DEM)   -
                                aln(RW)

where DEM is an index of properly measured demand shifts. Under market
clearing, RE equals relative supply (RSUP). This yields a wage determination
equation of the form

         In RW ‚Äî -1/a ln(RSUP) + 1/a ln(DEM).
                                       18

suggests that differences in the rate of change of the college wage premium

between   two periods should be negatively related to differences in the rate

of growth of college graduates as a share of the labor force.

    Table 6 provides summary information on changes in the fraction of the

labor force with college degrees in the U.S. and Japan since the early 1970s.

The table indicates that the rats of growth of college graduates as a

fraction of the labor force was considerably slower in the U.S. in the 1979-

87 period than in the 1973-79 period. In fact, the fraction of males aged

25-34 with college degrees declined from 1979 to 1987. The period of peak

growth for college graduates as a fraction of the U.S. workforce (1970-77)

corresponds with a period of a declining college wage premium, and the more

recent period of slow growth corresponds to a sharply increasing premium.

     The combination of a steady increase in the relative demand for college

graduates (perhaps from technical change and shifts in product market demands

related to increasing openness) and a deceleration in the growth rate of

college graduates goes some distance towards explaining increased educational

differentials in the U.5 in the 1980s. The annual rate of growth of college

graduates ss a fraction of the male labor force declined by approximately 2

percent from 1973-9 to 1979-87. while the annual rate of growth of the

college/high school wage differential for males aged 18-65 increased by 2.5

percent from -0.8 percent in the earlier period to 1.7 percent in the later

period.19 If the elasticity of substitution between college males and other

male labor is in Freeman's (1978) preferred range of I to 3, then the

observed slowdown in the rate of growth of college graduates could explain an


     19These growth rates follow from s decline im the college/high school
wage differential for all males of 5 percent from 1973-9 and an incresse in
the differential of 14 percent from 1979-87,

Source The U.S. data are from the May 1973 and Futt-Year 1979 and 1987 Current Poputation
Surveys. The data on ReguLar empLoyees for Japan era from the Basic Survey on Wage Structure,

increase in the rate of growth of the college wage premium of 0.67 to 2

percent a year.

     Table 6 further indicates a possible reason for the differences in the

Japanese and U.S. experiences in the 1980s. The rate of growth of male

college gradustes, especially as a share of those aged 25 to 34, does not

seem to have slowed down as dramatically in Japan as it has in the United

States. Data for regular employees in establishments with more than ten

employees from the Basic Survey on Wage Structure indicate a slightly faster

growth rate in the employment of college graduates in the 1980s than in the

1970s. On the other hand, data from Employment Status Survey for persons

working in establishments of all sizes indicate a moderate drop in the tate

of growth of employment of male college graduates. Neither data source

suggests a slow down as dramatic as the one that occurred for U.S. males.



Cohort Size Effects

     Changes in the relative size of entering cohorts of male high school and

of male college graduates between 1967 and 1987 for both the U.S. and Japan

are illustrated in Figure 420 The figure shows that while the fraction of

new entrants among high school graduates in the U.S. increased steadily

throughout the l9lOs, this fraction has declined sharply in the 1980s.

Thus, for the U.S., the wages of young high school graduates fell

dramatically relative to those of more experienced high school graduates in

exactly the period in which it would appear that the negative impact


     20The U.S. plots present the share of new entrants in total annual
manhours rather than the employment share of new entrants in terms of bodies
since we do not have actual employment share for the entire 1967-87 period.
The patterns of changes in the share of hours and of employment of new
entrants is virtually identical in the years for which we have both.

generational crowding on their labor market performance should have been

abating. On the hand, the decline in the position of young college graduates

relative to older graduates 1970s essentially ceased when the share of new

entrants began to decline after 1975, This contrast is strongly suggestive

of a sharp demand shift against young high school males in the 1980s that

much more than offset the benefits of smaller cohort size.

     A comparison of Figures 3 end 4 indicates that movements in the shere of

new entrants in employment appear to track the earnings of new entrants

relative to more experienced workers reasonably closely in Japan.

This suggests a possibly important factor in the improved position of new

entrants in the Japanese labor market is the rapid ageing of the Japanese

labor force. This phenomenon has sharply reduced the supply of new antrants

relative to older workers since the l960s for high school workers end since

the uiid-l9lOs for college workers. These relative supply changes create a

tendency towards raising the wages of new entrants in the labor force,

especially when firms are expanding. The oil shock and slowdown of hiring in

the mid-1970s apparently reduced the demand for new entrants enough to offset

demographic pressures towards improved earnings of new entrants through the

late 1970s (!4osk and Nakota, 1985). More experienced workers were less

affected by this slowdown since they were insulated by internal labor

markets.



B.   Macroeconomic and Structural Factors

     The U.S. and Japanese economies have differed sharply in terms of their

trade performances and the health of their manufacturing sectors since the

sharp dollar appreciation and yen depreciation of the early 1980s. Between
                                      21

1979 to 1987 real net exports declined by 3.3 percent as a share of U.S. GNP

and share of U.S. civilian employment in manufacturing fell drastically from

22.7 to 18.6 percent. Over this period Japents real net exports increased by

6.5 percent as a ahare of CNP and the manufacturing's share of employment

remained essentially constant at approximately 24.5 percent.21   These

differences may help explain the recent dramatic deterioration in the real

and relative position of young high school males in the U.S. and the moderate

improvement in the position of male high school new entrants in Japan.

     Shifts in the U.S. industrial distribution of employment by gender and

educational attainment for workers with less than ten years of experience

from 1973 to 1987 are presented in panels (a) and (b) of Table 7. The table

illustrates that less-educated young males have tended to be intensively

employed in the durable goods manufacturing sector. Less-educated females

have tended to be intensively employed in nondurable goods manufacturing.

The share of less-educated workers in U.S. manufacturing fell dramatically in

the l980s. Less-educated workers were who in previous generations gained

high-wage manufacturing sector were instead ending up in the low-wage retail

trade sector. Shifts of similar magnitude are not apparent in the 1973-9

period. In contrast to the U.S. experience, panel (c) of Table 7 shows that

young Japanese high school males have shifted dramatically into the durables

sector (metals and machinery) and have moved out of (wholesale and retail)

trade during the 1980a. Japanese high school male new entrants did well

during the period of expanded new hiring in durablas in the 1980s and did

poorly during the period of declining manufacturing employment from 1974-9.

        For the U.S. in the 1980s, the substantial improvement in earnings of

women and of college graduates relative to male dropouts and high school

workers further suggests thet shifts in product demand away from heavy

industries, which intensively employ less-educated males, end towards service

industries, which tend to employ high school and college females and male

college graduates, msy be an important factor in changing relative wages.

The data (in Tables 1 and 7) suggest a strong negative correlation (p        -



0.92)    between the frsction employed in durables at the start of the decade

and the wage performance for the different groups of young workers in the

1980s. Overall, the U.S. and Japanese experiences indicate that the

availsbility of employment opportunities in manufacturing for those without

college degrees has tended to be e strong indicator of the relative

performance of less-educated young workers.

        Table 7 also illustrates that despite the overall sharp decline in

employment in durables in the 1980s, the share of young college-educated

workers employed in durables actually increased from 1979 to 1987. This

suggests the possibility of changes in production techniques that has further

shifted demand against the unskilled in a period during which many believe

the skills of new Americsn high school graduates have been deteriorating

(e.g. Murnane, 1988). A "mismatch" between the skills demanded by employers

and skills provided by young less-educated Americans may further exacerbate

their labor market difficulties. The greater incentives for the attainment

of cognitive skills by thoae not planning to attend college in Japanese than

in American high schools suggests that Japanese high school graduates may be

better prepared to deal with recent technological innovations emphasizing

worker flexibility than are recent American high school greduates (Bishop,

1987). Furthermore, differences in employment and training practices in the

U.S. and Japan, such as the "white collarization" of (largely high-school

educated) production workers in Japan described by Koike (1988), suggest that

similar shifts in production techniques may have quite different impacts on

educational wage differentials in the U.S. and Japan. In particular, the

greater importance of on-the-job skill enhancement in Japan may also make

high school educated workers more adaptable to these changes. It is possible

that the substitutability of high school and college workers is greater in

Japan than in the United Ststes so that educational differentials may be less

responsive to market shifts in Japan.

     When the composition of product demand shifts perhaps because of changes

in international competition, it is likely that labor demand will increase in

the sectors where product demand has increased. Shifts in product demand are

likely to raise the relative demand for the labor of the demographic groups

aost concentrated in the production of the goods or services in industries

where demand has increased. Murphy and Welch (l988b) find that product

demand shifts associated with the sharp increase in U.S. net imports in the

1980s hawe shifted labor demand against males with 12 or fewer years of

schooling and against female high school drop outs. Katz and Murphy (1989)

find that overall shifts in the industrial distribution of employment in the

U.S. have worked against less-educated males and in favor of college

graduates in the 1980s although a similar pattern is apparent starting in the

early l970s. This pattern of demand shifts suggests that structural factors

such as increased openness and technological change have operated in favor of

more skilled and educated workers since the early 1970s. The rapid supply

expansion of college graduates nullified the impact of these changes on the
                                        24

college wage premium during the 1970s. On the other hand, these demand

shifts showed up in the l97Os through increases in inequality within

educational groups. The slowdown in the growth of college graduates, the

impact of trade, and the continuation of these trend shifts in demand all

operated towards increased skill and educational differentials in the l9BOs.



Changes Between and Within Industries

     The large variation across industries in wages for workers with the ssme

observed characteristics suggests that shifts in the industrial composition

of employment, whether caused by product demand shifts or changes in

production tethnologiea, msy help explain changes in the wage structure by

affecting the average industry wage premium earned by different groups. A

large body of evidence suggests that a substantial part of these inter-

industry wage differentials reflect "rents."22 For the U.S. in the lQBOa,

the shift of low-educated males from isenufacturing jobs with large wage

premiums to lowwsge jobs in retail trade and repair services combined with

the shift of college graduates out of low-wage education and welfare services

and into the more lucrative jobs in professional servicea could play a role

in explaining the increased college wage premium in the l9BOa.

     To examine the industry rents hypothesis, we compare changes in the

college/high school wage differential estimated in log hourly earnings

equations with and without detailed industry dummies. The results of this

procedure for our U.S. samples are presented in Table B. Large increases in

the college/high school differential remain even when industry dummies are

extent to which inter-industry wage differentials for workers with the same

included in the earnings regressions. Most of the increase in the college

wage premium in the l980s occurred within two-digit industries, The pure

impact of movements for low- to high-rent jobs is strongest for young female

college graduates who have shifted dramaticslly out of education and social

services over the last fifteen years. A large between industry effect (.06)

is also apparent for males with less than ten years of experience. This

effect reflects the shift of young high-school males out of high-rent

sectors. Since the between industry shifts nova in favor of college

graduates in both the 1973-9 and 1979-87 periods in which the college wage

premium moved in opposite directions the between industry effects look more

important when one examines increases in the college wage premium from 1973-

87 rather than focusing on the increase in the 1980s. Still, an explanation

for changes in the structure of wages in the 1980s must focus on the

substantial within industry increases in educational differentials during

this period.             -




Labor Market Tiahtness

     A final macroeconomic factor affecting the wage structure is the degree

of labor market tightness. A considereble body of evidence suggests that

tight labor markets raise the relative wages of less-educated, less-skilled,

and young workers (e.g. Murphy and Welch, 1988a; and Freeman, 1988). The

high average unemployment rate and sluggish growth in the U.S. economy in the

period since 1973 may play a role in reduced relative earnings of young,

less-educated workers. Furthermore, young workers at all levels of

educational attainment did psrticulerty poorly in Japan in the period from

1975-8 during which the job vacancy rate (vacant jobs over civilian
                                     26

employment) was at its lowest level over the 1967-87 period.

      Differences in changes in the earnings of young, less-skilled workers

by region in the U.S. provide further suggestive evidence for a role of

overall labor aarket tightness in affecting the wage structure. The contrast

between the experiences of New England and the East North Central region (the

Rust Belt) between 1979 and 1987 is quite illustrative.23 Over this period,

the unemployment rate declined from 5.4 to 3.3 percent in New England, while

it rose from 6.1 to 7.2 percent in the Rust Belt. The real hourly earnings

of male high school new entrants (those with less than 5 years of experience)

increased by 2.5 percent in New England and declined by 26 percent in the

Rust Belt.24 Additionally, the college/high school wage differential for new

entrants increased by approximately 3 percent in New England as opposed to 30

percent in the Rust Belt. For all nine U.S. census divisions, the

correlation in the change in the unemployment rate and the growth in earnings

of male high school new entrants for the 1979-87 period is -0.85.



C. Deunionization

    A key institutional development, emphasized by Blackburn, Bloom, and

Freeman (1989), that is likely to have adversely affected the relative

economic position of less-skilled Americans is the sharp decline in

unionization in the 1980s. The deunionization of the American private


     23The New England census division includes the states of Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, end Connecticut. The East
North Central division consists of Ohio, Indiana Illinois, Michigan, and
Wisconsin.

       These figures are based on calculations using our samples from the
Full Year 1979 and 1987 CPSs. Earnings figures were deflated by the national
personal consumption expenditures deflator.
                                       27

economy potentially removes many jobs from which less-skilled workera earned

union wage premia and also reduces the likely positive impact of the threat

of unionization on the earnings of less-skilled nonunion workers. Table 9

presents tabulations from the May 1973, May 1979, and Full Year 1987 CPSs of

the change in the extent of unionization of U.S. males by educational

attainment. The table illustrates the much sharper decline in unionization

for the less-educated in the 1979-87 period than in the 1973-79 period. For

example, between 1979 and 1987 the extent of unionization fell by over 17

percent for young high school males.

     A first cut approach to analyzing the direct impact of deunionization on

the earnings of a group is to examine changes in the estimated rents earned

by union members as a share of total compensation of the group. We take the

estimated union-nonunion wage differential from a log hourly earnings

regression with standard controls, industry dummies, and interactions of

union membership with educational attainment as our measure of the union wage

premium.25 Since the estimated union-nonunion wage differential increased

substantially for males with 12 or fewer years of schooling from 1979 to 1987

(possibly because the lower rent union jobs are the ones that tend to be

eliminated by deunionization), deunionizstion is estimated to have reduced

the earnings of the lees-educated relative to college graduates by 0.5 to 2.0

percent.26 For example, the estimated union-nonunion In wsge differential

        Each regression includes 8 dummy variables for years of schooling, a
spline in experience, a race dummy, a metropolitan ares dummy, 8 region
dummies, a pert-time work dummy, 41 industry dummies, a union membership
dummy, end three education class/union status interaction dummies.

     26Blsckburn, Bloom, and Freeman (1989) estimate larger effects of
deunionization (in the range of 3 to 5 percent) on the earnings of the
unskilled for the entire 1973-87 period under the assumption that the union
wage premium remained unchanged at its 1973 level throughout this period.

for 25-34 year old male high graduates is estimated to have increased from

0,15 to 0.22 from 1979 to 1987. This change combined with a decline in

unionization for this group from 41.8 to 24.6 percent implies that

unionization changes account for a decrease in earnings of 0.9 percent. This

approach ignores the spillover effects of a weakened union threat in the

1980a on the earnings of less-educated nonunion workers. The sharp shift in

demand against less-skilled workers associated with macroeconomic conditions

and increasing international competition in the early 1980s probably

contributed to the further weakening of the union movement in the U.S. ,    The

interaction of a bust market snd declining unionization may exacerbated the

effects of either change and contributed to the tremendous real and relative

losses of young less-educated Americans.

     The extent of unionization in Japan has also declined sharply in the

1980s (Freeman and Rebick, 1989). Since Japanese unions have traditionally

included both blue and white collar workers (high school end college workers)

in an enterprise, they are not likely to have been as important a factor in

increasing the relative earnings of less-educated workers as U.S. unions have

been. This suggests that deunionization is likely to have been a more

important force toward increasing educational differentials in the U.S. than

in Japan.



D.   Assessing the Alternative Exnlanations: Some time Series Evidencs

     We conclude this section with the presentation of some simple time

series models designed to give a some quantitative assessment of the

importance of relative supply, macroeconomic conditions, and structural

factors in explaining recent changes in the wage structure. We eetimate
                                             29

models of the form

             is   an estimate of the elasticity of the response of relative wages

to the relative numbers of workers in a group, wi is a measure of the wage

for group i, N1 is a measure of the supply of workers in group 1, and cycle

is measure of labor market tightness.27 We examine models for college/high

school wage ratios and for the ratio of the earnings of high school new

entrants to those of experienced high school workers. These models provide a

crude approach to gauging the importance of changes in demographic factors,

trade performance, labor market tightness, and trending structural demand

shifts on relative wages.

      Four estimated models of the form of equation (1) are presented in Table

10. The first line of the table examines movements in the college/high

school income ratio for U.S. males aged 25-34 from 1967-87(presented in

Figure 1). The estimates indicate that all four factors have significant

impacts in the expected direction on the college wage premium. The estimated

supply elasticity of -0.35 suggests an elasticity of substitution between

young prime aged college and high school graduates of approximately 3.

Increases in net exports as a share of ON? improve and increases in the prime

age male unemployment rate reduce the relative earnings of high school


     27For the U.S., we follow Murphy and Welch (l988a) in using the
innovations in the prime age male unemployment rate as our measure of labor
market cyclical conditions. We use the job vacancy rate for Japan. See
Freeman (1978) for a defense of the usefulness of equations of the form of
equation (1).

graduates. The trend term indicates that relative demand for college

graduates has grown at approximately an annual rate of 1 percent over this

period. This suggests that structural factors have indeed been moving

against the unskilled. An examination of the fitted values of the equation

indicates that it tracks movements in the college/high school wage ratio

quite well throughout the sample. The log college wege premium increased by

0.20 from 0.17 in 1979 to 0.37 in 1987. The combination of trend demand

shifts in favor of college graduates and a decrease in the log relative

supply of college graduates of 0.19 predicts an increase in the college wage

differential of approximately 0.15 and the sharp increase in the trade

deficit predicts a further increase in the differential of 0.055.

     Variations in the growth rate of the supply of college graduatea

combined with a steady trend increase in the demand for college graduates go

a long way toward explaining movements in the college wage premium for 25-34

year old males. In contrast, while the estimated model in line 2 of Table 10

for the college/high school new entrants is similar to that in line 1, the

movements in relative supply of college and high school new entrants have a

different time pattern from those of 25-34 years old. The lahor market

entrance of the baby bust cohorts of high school graduates has implied a

sharp increase in the ratio of college to high school inexperienced workers

in the l9BOs. An alternative interpretation of this perverse prediction is

that supply factors do matter for the improved position of young college

graduates in the 1980s, but that a measure of supply incorporating a broader

range of experience groups is appropriate.

     The estimates in line 2 suggest that most of the increase in the college

wage differential for new entrants in the l9BOs is related to the adverse
                                     31

impact of the increased trade deficit on young high school new entrants.

This is also the case in line 3 for the sharp increase in the experience wage

premium for high school graduates in the 1980s. The net export variable

could be picking up a host of other phenomena occurring in the l980s (such as

the decline in unionization).   Cohort size moves in a perverse direction to

explain the deterioration in the position of young less-educated American

males in the 1980s. On the other hand, the estimates in line 4 of Table 10

indicate that the reduction in entering cohort size and increase in labor

market tightness (as measured by the vacancy rate) in the 1980s have improved

the relative position of young high school males relative to experienced

workers in Japan.




IV. Conclusions

     Although we find no simple explanation for recent changes in the

distribution of earnings in the U.S. and Japan, we do find support for some

hypotheses. We find that a reduction in the rate of growth of college

graduates in the U.S. starting in the late l970s goes a part of the way

towards explaining differences in the U.S. and Japanese experiences.

Macroeconomic factors (labor market slack and trade deficits) and changes in

institutional structures (the decline in unionization of less-educated

workers) appear to have reinforced each other leading to an unprecedented

decline in real and relative earnings of young less-skilled males in the U.S.

in the lPBOs.

     The role of persistent structurel factors such as increased openness,

changes in the international division of labor, and technological changes
                                     32

favoring the more skilled are much more difficult to evaluate. Comparative

research examining the experiences of other developed countries is likely to

be a fruitful avenue for future research on changes in the structure of

wages.
