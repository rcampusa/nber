Recent Changes in the Gains from Delaying Social Security

                                              ABSTRACT

Social Security retirement benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with delayed claiming
resulting in larger monthly payments. In Shoven and Slavov (2013), we show that claiming later increases
the present value of lifetime benefits for most individuals. However, this has not always been the case.
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, a number of policy changes increased the gains from delay,
particularly for couples. In addition, mortality improved and real interest rates fell substantially over
this period, further increasing the attractiveness of delay. We perform simulations to examine the role
of these factors in changing the gains from delay. We find that the gains from delay increased substantially
after 2000, with changes in the interest rate playing the largest role in driving the increase. Using data
from the Health and Retirement study, we show that individuals who turned 62 after 2000 are indeed
more likely to delay than those who turned 62 before 2000. However, even in the younger cohort,
most individuals still claim benefits soon after turning 62. Moreover, we find no evidence of a relationship
between the probability of delay and the individual characteristics (e.g., gender, race, or health status)
that affect the gains from delay.

   1. Introduction

       Social Security retirement benefits can be claimed at any age between 62 and 70, with

delayed claiming resulting in larger monthly payments. These larger payments represent an

actuarial adjustment to account for the fact that an individual who claims later is likely to receive

benefits for a shorter period. In our earlier work (Shoven and Slavov 2013), we investigated the

actuarial fairness of this adjustment in light of recent low real interest rates combined with

improved mortality. We concluded that delaying Social Security is actuarially advantageous for

most individuals. Delay is particularly beneficial for the primary earner in a couple; however,

even singles with mortality rates that are substantially above average can benefit from delay at

near-zero real interest rates like those that have prevailed for much of 2013. We also

demonstrated that the gains from delay have increased substantially – particularly for couples –

since the early 1960s, when delays first became available.

       Besides falling interest rates, a number of benefit rule changes in the 1990s and early

2000s have contributed to attractiveness of delaying Social Security. For example, prior to 2000,

a non-earning spouse in a married couple could not claim a spousal benefit until the primary

earner had claimed his or her worker benefit. Thus, delaying the primary earner's benefit forced

the non-working spouse to delay as well. Since 2000, however, married individuals have been

able to claim spousal benefits when their spouse reaches full retirement age or claims benefits,

whichever is sooner. In addition, the delayed retirement credit – the adjustment for delaying

Social Security beyond full retirement age (which was 65 for those turning 62 in 1992, and has

risen to 66 for those turning 62 today) – has become substantially more generous.

       In this paper, we extend our earlier work by investigating the impact of these recent rule

changes on the gains from delay for a variety of stylized couples. We attempt to isolate the
effects of these rule changes from the effects of the interest rate and mortality changes that have

also occurred over the past two decades. We find that the rule changes by themselves have

increased the gains from delay – measured as the percent increase in the net present value of

benefits from optimal delayed claiming relative to claiming at 62 – by about 1-2 percentage

points for singles, 5-6 percentage points for two-earner couples, and 2-4 percentage points for

one-earner couples. Most of this increase is attributable to the rise in the delayed retirement

credit. Interest rate and mortality changes further increase the gains from delay for younger

cohorts relative to older ones.The combination of rule changes, mortality changes, and interest

rate changes have substantially increased the gains from delay for cohorts born in 1938 and later

(i.e., for individuals turning 62 in 2000 and later), with interest rates playing the largest role.

        In addition, our earlier conclusions about the gains from delay for two-earner couples

relied on a somewhat unusual claiming strategy: one spouse claims spousal benefits starting at

full retirement age (66 for our simulated couples), while allowing his or her own worker benefit

to grow through delay. For example, we demonstrated that a present-value maximizing claiming

strategy might involve the primary earner claiming a spousal benefit starting at age 66, then

switching to his or her own benefit at age 70, while the secondary earner claims a worker benefit

at age 62. Thus, the primary earner can effectively get paid during the delay period. The

availability of this strategy is likely unintentional, arising from a system designed with one-

earner couples in mind. It is also not well known and rarely used. Thus, we investigate how the

gains from delay are altered if this strategy is made unavailable. We find that the gains from

delay – again measured as the percent increase in net present value from optimal delay relative to

claiming at 62 – fall by about 4-5 percentage points for two earner couples if this strategy is

eliminated. However, they are still substantial.
       Finally, we utilize data from the Health and Retirement Study to investigate whether

individuals turning 62 in 2000 and later are indeed more likely to delay Social Security. To

cleanly separate the decision to claim from the decision to stop working, we restrict attention to

individuals who stopped work before age 62. Within this sample, we find that cohorts turning 62

in 2000 and later are indeed more likely to delay. However, the vast majority of individuals, even

in the younger cohorts, still claim at age 62. Moreover, we find no evidence of a relationship

between the probability of delay and the individual characteristics (e.g., gender, race, or health

status) that affect the gains from delay.

       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 places this paper in the context of the prior

research on Social Security claiming. The methodology behind our simulations is detailed in

Section 3, and the results are presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents our empirical analysis.

Finally, Section 6 concludes.



   2. Prior Research

       A number of prior studies have established that a large subset of individuals stand to gain

from delaying Social Security (Meyer and Reichenstein 2010; Munnell and Soto 2005; Sass,

Sun, and Webb 2007, 2013; Coile et al. 2002; Mahaney and Carlson 2007). The main finding is

that the gains from delay are particularly large for primary earners in married couples because

when a primary earner delays Social Security, it boosts the survivor benefit that the secondary

earner would receive in the event of widowhood. Delaying Social Security may also have tax

advantages (Mahaney and Carlson 2007), and the utility gain from delay may exceed the

expected monetary gain due to the insurance value of the Social Security annuity (Sun and Webb

2009). Our own earlier work (Shoven and Slavov 2013) revisits this issue in the context of
historically low interest rates, demonstrating that delay increases the present value of benefits for

most people. This finding applies not only to primary earners, but also to singles, even those with

mortality that is much greater than average. In addition, the gains from delay have increased

dramatically since the early 1960s, when delay first became available, as a result of interest rate

changes, and mortality improvements, and (for couples) law changes.1

         Empirical studies have shown that, while there is some evidence that those who benefit

from delay are more likely to do so (Coile et al. 2002; Munnell and Soto 2005; Beauchamp and

Wagner 2012), the vast majority of people claim as early as possible, even when it appears to be

clearly suboptimal (Sass, Sun, and Webb 2007, 2013; Hurd, Smith, and Zissimopoulos 2004).

Among those who stop working before age 62, there is not much of a relationship between

claiming age and the factors that influence the gains from delay (Hurd, Smith, and

Zissimopoulos 2004). Field experiments suggest that while providing factual information about

the gains from delay does not appear to alter claiming decisions (Liebman and Luttmer 2011),

self-reported claiming intentions are sensitive to the way in which the claiming decision is

framed (Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell 2011).

         Our current work investigates the extent to which the gains from delay have changed

since the 1990s. In doing so, we reconcile the results of studies that focus primarily on cohorts

born in the 1930s and early 1940s (e.g., Coile et al. 2002; Sass, Sun, and Webb 2007, 2013) and

find more modest gains from delay with those of studies that focus on younger cohorts (e.g.,

Meyer and Reicherstein 2010; Munnell and Soto 2005; Shoven and Slavov 2013) and find

substantial gains from delay. Together, these studies suggest that delay is more advantageous for

cohorts approaching age 62 today compared to those approaching 62 in the 1990s and early

1
  Jivan (2004) and Munnell and Sass (2012) shows that, for singles, the effect of interest rate changes and mortality
improvements have roughly offset each other in the past. Thus, most of the gains for singles have been recent, as a
result of near-zero interest rates.
2000s. We provide a detailed analysis of the factors underlying this shift, decomposing the

change in the gains from delay into the components attributable to benefit rule changes on the

one hand, and to economic (interest rate) and demographic (mortality) changes on the other.

        In addition, some prior studies of claiming (Munnell, Golub-Sass, and Karamcheva 2009;

Shoven and Slavov 2013) take into account a somewhat unusual claiming strategy for two-earner

couples. They assume that one spouse (typically the primary earner) claims a spousal benefit

starting at full retirement age, allowing his or her own worker benefit to grow through delay until

age 70. The other spouse simply claims his or her own worker benefit. Effectively, one member

of a two-earner couple can use this strategy to receive a Social Security payment during the delay

period. As spousal benefits were originally designed with one-earner couples in mind, it is

unlikely that policy makers intended for this claiming strategy to be available to two-earner

couples. Moreover, this strategy is not well known and rarely used. As a result, other studies of

the gains from delay (e.g., Sass, Sun, and Webb 2013) do not take this strategy into account. We

shed light on the importance of this assumption by providing a detailed analysis of the effect that

this strategy has on the gains from delay for two earner couples. Our calculation is

complementary to that of Munnell, Golub-Sass, and Karamcheva (2009), who compute optimal

claiming strategies both with and without the two-earner couple spousal benefit option, and

estimate that the availability of the option could cost Social Security $9.5 billion per year. Our

analysis extends their work by showing how this strategy has affected the gains from delay for

two-earner couples over the past two decades.

        Finally, we provide empirical evidence on whether the increases in the gains from delay

over the past two decades are associated with changes in actual claiming decisions.2 This

cohorts born in 1943 and later (who received the maximum possible delayed retirement credit of 8 percent), and
analysis contributes to our understanding of whether individuals respond to the incentives in the

Social Security benefit formula.



    3. Methodology

         Before describing our methodology, it is useful to review the Social Security benefit

formula. Retired worker benefits are based on an individual’s average indexed monthly earnings

(AIME), which is defined as the average of the highest 35 years of an individual’s earnings,

indexed for economy-wide wage growth. A progressive formula is then applied to the AIME,

resulting in the worker’s primary insurance amount (PIA), which is the monthly benefit the

worker can receive if he or she claims at full retirement age. The PIA is calculated in the year the

worker turns 62 and is indexed for inflation in subsequent years. Workers may claim benefits as

early as age 62, but claiming before full retirement age results in an actuarial reduction. For

individuals with a full retirement age of 65, claiming benefits at age 62 results in a monthly

benefit of 80 percent of PIA. For individuals with a full retirement age of 66, claiming benefits at

62 results in a monthly benefit of 75 percent of PIA. Workers may alternatively claim benefits as

late as age 70, receiving a delayed retirement credit for each month of delay beyond full

retirement age. The delayed retirement credit varies depending on the worker’s year of birth. In

particular, it has become substantially more generous for younger cohorts, with workers born in

1930 receiving 4.5 percent of PIA per year of delay and workers born in 1943 and later receiving

8 percent of PIA per year of delay.3



cohorts turning 62 in 2000 or later (who are eligible for file and suspend), are somewhat more likely to delay than
earlier cohorts. Our empirical work here provides an extension of those simple summary statistics. We improve on
the earlier analysis by obtaining permission to use the restricted Health and Retirement Study (HRS) earnings data to
determine which individuals are eligible for benefits. We also examine the impact of birth year on claiming within a
regression framework that controls for other observable characteristics.

       In addition to worker benefits, a married person can receive a spousal benefit equal to

half of his or her spouse’s PIA, if claimed at full retirement age. The spousal benefit is reduced

for claims made before full retirement age, but there is no delayed retirement credit. An

individual who claims both a spousal and a worker benefit is paid the higher of the two. A

spousal benefit cannot be claimed unless the worker on whose record the benefit is based has

claimed worker benefits. For example, consider a couple in which the wife is two years younger

than the husband. Assume both have a full retirement age of 66. If the husband waits until age 70

to claim his worker benefit, the wife would not be able to claim a spousal benefit until age 68

even though the spousal benefit ceases to grow through delay when the wife turns 66. However,

since 2000, a provision known as “file and suspend,” allows a worker to file for his or her own

benefit at full retirement age (or later) and then suspend the benefit. In our example, the husband

could file for his worker benefit at age 66 and then suspend his benefit until age 70. The

husband’s benefit continues to grow through delay, but the wife can now claim a spousal benefit

at age 64. Clearly, the introduction of “file and suspend” has made it less costly for a married

person to delay his or her own benefit, as doing so no longer forces the spouse to delay the

spousal benefit as well.

       A widow can also receive a benefit based on his or her deceased spouse’s record. The

widow benefit is equal to either 82.5 percent of the deceased spouse’s PIA or the deceased

spouse’s actual benefit, whichever is greater. Because the widow benefit is linked to the

deceased spouse’s actual benefit (including any reduction for early claiming or delayed

retirement credits), the widow benefit rises when the deceased spouse delays claiming. The

widow benefit is reduced if it is claimed before the widow’s full retirement age (which is not

always the same as the retirement age for worker and spousal benefits), but there are no credits
for delaying widow benefits beyond full retirement age.4 As with the spousal benefit, an

individual who claims both a worker and a widow benefit receives the higher of the two

amounts.

         To proceed with our analysis, we compute the expected net present value (NPV) of

benefits from a large number of Social Security claiming strategies for various stylized

households.5 We consider single male and female households, with birth years ranging from

1930-1951 at 3-year intervals. We also consider both one-earner and two earner couples in which

the primary earner (assumed to be the husband) has a birth year ranging from 1930-1951 at 3-

year intervals. The secondary earner (or nonearner, for one-earner couples) is alternatively

assumed to be either two years or seven years younger than the primary earner. In the two-earner

couple households, the secondary earner’s PIA is assumed to be 75 percent of the primary

earner’s PIA. Because all monthly benefit amounts are calculated as a percent of PIA, all net

present values in our analysis can be expressed as a multiple of the primary earner’s PIA. In

other words, the actual levels of the stylized workers’ PIAs do not affect the optimal claiming

strategies or the percent gain from delay.

         In calculating NPVs, we need to choose an appropriate discount rate. Because Social

Security is an inflation-indexed obligation of the U.S. government, the most appropriate discount

rate would be the interest rate on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), which are also

an inflation-indexed obligation of the U.S. government. Interest rate data are available for TIPS

4
  The reduction formula for the widow benefit is complex. A widow who claims at age 60 receives 71.5 percent of
the deceased spouse’s PIA plus any delayed retirement credits. If the deceased spouse claimed his or her own
worker benefit at full retirement age or later (or died before claiming), the widow benefit is increased linearly until it
reaches 100 percent of the deceased spouse’s PIA plus delayed retirement credits at the widow’s full retirement age.
If the deceased spouse claimed his or her own worker benefit before full retirement age, the increases in the widow
benefit proceed in the same linear fashion but stop once the benefit reaches 82.5 percent of the deceased spouse’s
PIA or the deceased spouse’s actual benefit, whichever is higher. For additional details on these provisions, see
Weaver (2002). For details on the full retirement age and actuarial reduction for widow benefits, see
http://www.ssa.gov/survivorplan/survivorchartred.htm.

  Our methodology is similar to that described in Shoven and Slavov (2013).
of varying terms, including 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years. For an individual, the appropriate time

horizon for discounting a stream of Social Security benefits is roughly 20 years. Therefore,

whenever possible, we use the average annual yield on 20-year TIPS in our analysis. For 2013,

we use the average TIPS yield in the first half of the year. Prior to mid-2004, 20-year TIPS were

not available. Thus, for 2004 and earlier, we use the difference between the average annual yield

on (nominal) 20-year Treasury bonds and the annual percent change in the consumer price index

for all urban consumers.6

        Table 1 summarizes the details of each of our stylized households. The first column of

the table is the year of birth for the single person or primary earner. For this individual, the

second and third columns provide, respectively, the full retirement age and the delayed

retirement credit (as a percentage of PIA) that is earned for each year of delay beyond full

retirement age. The next three columns provide the same information for the secondary earner

(or nonearner) in the couple households. The next column indicates whether “file and suspend”

was available when the primary earner in the household turned 62. Finally, the last column

indicates the prevailing safe real interest rate when the primary earner turned 62.

        A claiming strategy for a single person consists of an age at which to claim benefits. For

one-earner couples, a claiming strategy includes an age for the primary earner to claim worker

benefits, and an age for the secondary earner to claim spousal benefits. For two-earner couples, a

claiming strategy includes an age for each spouse to claim worker benefits. In addition, as

discussed above, we allow the possibility of an unusual claiming strategy: one member of the

couple can claim a spousal benefit before claiming the worker benefit. This strategy is available

as long as both worker and spousal benefits are delayed to full retirement age or later. If the

 All data used in calculating interest rates come from from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), available at
http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/. Since nominal 20-year Treasury bonds were not available between 1987 and
1992, we average the rates on nominal 10-year and 30-year Treasury bonds to construct the interest rate for 1992.
spousal benefit is claimed before full retirement age, Social Security’s rules require that the

worker benefit be claimed at the same time. Although delays may occur in increments of one

month, in order to reduce the number of strategies to consider, we assume all claims are made on

birthdays.7 We also do not consider strategic claiming for widow benefits: a widow is assumed to

claim the widow benefit immediately upon the death of the spouse.8

          For each claiming strategy, and for every possible age at death (or, for couples,

combination of ages at death), we compute the NPV of the household’s stream of benefits using

the applicable real interest rate. We then compute the expected NPV for the claiming strategy

across all possible ages at death. The probability distribution over ages at death is based on the

Social Security Administration’s latest cohort mortality tables, which are used for the

intermediate projections in the 2013 Trustees Report. All deaths are assumed to occur halfway

through the year. For couples, the deaths of the husband and wife are assumed to be independent

events.

          For each stylized household, we first compute the optimal claiming strategies and the

gains from delay under the actual interest rate and mortality faced by that household. For

couples, we perform this calculation both with and without “file and suspend.” (Note that the

availability of “file and suspend” is not based on birth cohort; it is available to anyone starting in

2000.) Then, we re-compute the optimal claiming strategies for each household holding mortality

and interest rates constant. In particular, we assume a real interest rate of 2.9 percent (the long-

term real interest rate assumed by the Social Security Trustees) and mortality equal to that faced



7
  In addition, we ignore a number of other unusual claiming strategies. For example, we do not allow an individual
to claim a benefit, suspend the benefit a few months or years later, then resume the benefit. We only allow “file and
suspend” in the case of one spouse filing for his or her benefit and then immediately suspending it, in order to allow
the other spouse to collect the spousal benefit. See Kotlikoff (2012) for further discussion of unusual claiming
strategies.

by the 1951 (for primary earners and singles), 1953 (for secondary earners who are two years

younger), and 1958 (for secondary earners who are seven years younger) birth cohorts. In each

case, for two-earner couples, we determine the optimal claiming strategies and gains from delay

both with and without the spousal benefit option. These alternative calculations allow us to

evaluate the relative effects of rule changes versus interest rate and mortality changes. We can

also isolate the effect of “file and suspend” compared to the other rule changes (increases in the

full retirement age and the delayed retirement credit). In addition, we can quantify the effect of

the spousal benefit claiming strategy for two-earner couples.



   4. Results

       Table 2 show the NPV-maximizing claiming ages for single males and females, as well

as the percent increase in NPV from claiming optimally versus claiming at age 62. Men born

before 1939 receive no benefit from delay, and the gains for women born in this period are small.

Starting with the 1939 birth cohort, however, the gains from delay begin to increase for both men

and women. Men born in 1951 (who turn 62 in 2013) maximize NPV by claiming at 69, and

receive a gain of 12.6 percent from following that strategy. Similarly, women born in 1951

maximizing NPV at 70 and receive a gain from delay of 17.8 percent.

       There are multiple factors underlying the changes in the gains from delay shown in Table

2, including mortality improvements, a decline in real interest rates, and benefit rule changes. To

isolate the effect of benefit rule changes, Table 3 presents the gains from delay for single men

and women using the mortality rates of the 1951 birth cohort, and a real interest rate of 2.9

percent. The increase in the gains from delay is more modest in Table 3. For male cohorts born

in 1942 and earlier, and for female cohorts born in 1939 and earlier, delay beyond full retirement
age reduces NPV. Thus, the changes in the gains from delay for these cohorts result solely from

changes in the full retirement age. For later cohorts, the increase in the delayed retirement credit

plays a role. The three most recent cohorts all face a delayed retirement credit of 8 percent and

receive gains from delay ranging from 1.7 percent (for males) to 4.9 percent (for females).

Despite the more modest gains from delay shown in Table 3, we emphasize that the gains from

delay are not trivial for these recent birth cohorts, particularly for women.

       In Table 4, we turn to two-earner couples, presenting the NPV-maximizing claiming

strategies and associated gains from delay. Again, the gains from delay have risen dramatically,

from a modest 1-2 percent for the 1930 primary earner birth cohort to more than 20 percent

today. The results in Table 4 assume the availability of “file and suspend,” but removing this

option barely alters them. In particular, “file and suspend” matters only for the couple with birth

years of 1951 and 1953. This couple relies on the husband filing and suspending his benefit at

age 68, allowing the wife to claim a spousal benefit when she is 66. Both members of the couple

then delay their own benefit to age 70. Without the “file and suspend” option, the couple’s NPV

is maximized when the secondary earner claims at 64, allowing the primary earner to claim a

spousal benefit from ages 66 through 69. Under this second-best option, the gains are only 0.3

percentage points lower.

       Just as for singles, much of the increase in the gains from delay for couples comes from

improvements in mortality and declines in the real interest rate. To isolate the effect of rule

changes, Table 5 shows the NPV-maximizing strategies for the two-earner couples assuming a

real interest rate of 2.9 percent and the mortality profile of the 1951/1953 birth cohorts (for the

top panel) and the 1951/1958 birth cohorts (for the bottom panel). The gains from delay have

still increased substantially for two-earner couples, although the increase is not as dramatic as
that shown in Table 4. Removing the availability of “file and suspend” makes no difference to

the results in Table 5.

         Tables 4 and 5 also suggest that, generally speaking, the couple with the two-year age

difference gets larger gains than the couple with the seven-year age difference. This result runs

counter to conventional wisdom, which suggests that the gains from delay increase with the age

difference between the primary and secondary earners (see, e.g., Coile et al. 2002). The intuition

behind the conventional wisdom is straightforward. When the primary earner delays his benefit,

he effectively purchases a second-to-die annuity. That is, he sacrifices his benefits today in

exchange for higher future benefits not only over his own lifetime but also over the lifetime of

the secondary earner if she is widowed.9 The value of this second-to-die annuity increases as the

age difference between the primary and secondary earners increases, as this age difference

increases the length of time to the second death (the expected payout period for the annuity). The

counterintuitive result in Table 4 comes from the availability of the spousal benefit claiming

option. When there is a seven-year age difference between the spouses, the primary earner

cannot claim the spousal benefit until he is 69 (and the secondary earner is 62), giving him only

one year of spousal benefits before switching to his own benefit. With a two-year age difference,

however, the primary earner can claim the spousal benefit age 66, giving him four years of

spousal benefits before switching to his own benefit.

         In Tables 6 and 7, we present results for two-earner couples without allowing the spousal

benefit claiming option. In Table 6, we use the actual interest rate and mortality faced by the

stylized couples; in Table 7, we hold the real interest rate constant at 2.9 percent and use the

mortality profile of the 1951/1953 cohorts (top panel) or the 1951/1958 cohorts (bottom panel).

 In contrast, when the secondary delays, however, she effectively purchases a first-to-die annuity. When she dies,
her benefits cease as her spouse continues to receive benefits on his own record. When her spouse dies, her benefits
cease because she switches to the widow benefit.
As the above discussion suggests, without the spousal benefit claiming option, a larger age

difference does indeed result in a greater gain from delay. In addition, as one might expect, the

spousal benefit option becomes increasingly valuable as various factors such as the delayed

retirement credit and mortality improvements make it more attractive to delay the primary

earner’s benefit.

       In Tables 8 and 9, we turn to one-earner couples. Table 8 shows that, under the actual

interest rate and mortality conditions facing the stylized couples, the gains from delay have

increased quite substantially for one-earner couples. Table 9 shows that with the interest rate

held constant at 2.9 percent, and assuming the mortality rates of the 1951/1953 cohorts (top

panel) or the 1951/1958 cohorts (bottom panel), the increase in the gains from delay are less

dramatic. Both Tables 8 and 9 assume the existence of “file and suspend.” The only benefit rule

changes whose effects are reflected in Table 9 include the increase in the delayed retirement

credit and the increase in the full retirement age. To determine the effect of “file and suspend,”

we recomputed the NPV-maximizing strategies for one-earner couples without this option in

Tables 10 (using actual interest rates and mortality) and Table 11 (holding the interest rate and

mortality constant). Comparing Tables 8 and 10 (both of which use the actual interest rate and

mortality), we see that “file and suspend” makes a modest difference to the gains from delay for

more recent cohorts. For earlier cohorts, delaying the primary earner’s benefit beyond full

retirement age is not optimal; thus, the unavailability of “file and suspend” does not constrain the

secondary earner’s claiming choices. But for more recent cohorts, other factors – including

mortality improvements, interest rate changes, and rule changes – make delaying beyond full

retirement age attractive. Thus, “file and suspend” provides a boost in the gains from delay by

removing a constraint on the secondary earner’s claiming age.
       For example, for the couple born in 1951 and 1953, the NPV-maximizing strategy

involves the wife claiming a spousal benefit at age 66, while the husband delays to age 70 (Table

8). Without “file and suspend,” however, the wife would not be able to claim a spousal benefit

until she is 68 and her husband is 70. If the wife wishes to claim a spousal benefit at 66 (her full

retirement age), the husband would have to claim his own benefit at 67, forgoing some of the

gains from delay. The NPV-maximizing claiming strategy without “file and suspend” represents

a compromise: the husband claims his own benefit at age 69, allowing the wife to claim her

spousal benefit at 67. This constraint reduces the gains from delay by around 3 percentage

points. The availability of “file and suspend” is less important for couples with a large age

difference: for these couples, the wife is so much younger that, even without file and suspend,

the husband can delay substantially without constraining the wife’s claiming decision.

Comparing Tables 9 and 11, we find similar results with a constant interest rate and mortality.

However, here, file and suspend makes a smaller difference to the gains from delay because

delaying the primary earner’s benefit beyond full retirement age is less attractive to begin with.



   5. Empirical Analysis

       Our simulations suggest that the gains from delay increased considerably for individuals

turning 62 around 2000. That is, cohorts born in 1938 and later experienced large gains from

delay compared to earlier cohorts. To test whether these cohorts are indeed more likely to delay,

we utilize data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a panel survey that is intended to

be representative of older Americans. We use data from all waves (1992-2010, at 2-year

intervals) of the HRS. Most of the variables used in our analysis come from the RAND version
of the HRS. However, we also obtained permission to merge in the restricted HRS datasets

containing respondents’ Social Security earnings and benefit records.

           For each HRS respondent, we define the “age-62 wave” as follows. If the respondent was

under 62 in wave t, and 62 or older in wave t+1, then wave t is defined as the respondent’s age-

62 wave. If the respondent was under 62 in wave t, but not interviewed in wave t+1 and turned

62 within two years of the wave t interview, then wave t is also defined as the respondent’s age-

62 wave. In other words, the age-62 wave is the wave immediately before the wave in which the

respondent turned 62. We collect information on the characteristics of each individual in their

age 62 wave, including marital status, labor force status, financial wealth (which we convert to

2010 dollars using the CPI-U-RS), self-reported health status, education, and race. We exclude

individuals who are not observed in their age-62 wave, individuals who report that they have

previously applied for disability or Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and individuals who

report that they claimed Social Security before age 62. In order to minimize issues arising from

the joint determination of claiming and retirement, we include only individuals who were not

working in their age-62 wave.10 We also include only individuals who are eligible for retired

worker benefits (determined based on the number of quarters of coverage in the earnings

records), and individuals who do not report a marital status of widowed in their age-62 wave or

earlier.

           We construct two dependent variables. The first dependent variable is an indicator for

whether the individual delayed benefits to age 65 or later. The second is the number of months

after age 62 that an individual claimed.11 To avoid issues of truncation, we exclude individuals


10
   It is, of course, possible that such an individual may return to work after their age-62 wave.
11
   Our dependent variables are based on self-reported claims, available in the RAND version of the HRS. An
alternative measure of claiming would come from the restricted Social Security claiming records. However, a
number of individuals who report that they have claimed benefits do not appear to have Social Security claiming
who had not yet turned 65 in the last wave in which they are observed. In addition, we set the

number of months delay since age 62 to 36 for all individuals who claimed at 65 or later, or were

not observed to have claimed within the sample period.

         Table 12 shows summary statistics for all the variables used in our analysis. On average,

individuals in our sample delay for almost 7 months beyond age 62, but only 9 percent delay to

age 65 or later. Years of birth range from 1930 to 1945. Table 13 shows that, in the full sample,

more than 80 percent claimed within a year of turning 62. However, among those who were born

in 1938 or later, only 75.3 percent claimed within a year of turning 62. There does not appear to

be much of a relationship between claiming delays and wealth, even though, in theory, wealth

can facilitate delay. In fact, individuals whose household wealth lies in the top half of the wealth

distribution are more likely to claim early than those whose wealth lies in the bottom half.

         Table 14 presents results from our regressions. Column (1) reports the marginal effects

from a probit model in which the dependent variable is equal to 1 if the individual delayed Social

Security to age 65 or later. Column (2) reports the coefficients from a Tobit model in which the

dependent variable is the number of months’ delay since age 62. In this model, the dependent

variable is left-censored at zero months and right-censored at 36 months. In both regressions,

standard errors are clustered by household. Similar to Hurd, Smith, and Zissimopolous (2004),

among this group of individuals who stopped work before age 62, we find very little relationship

between claiming age and the factors that influence the gains from delay. Because of the large

gains to delaying the primary earner’s benefit, one might expect married males to be more likely

to delay; however, this is not the case. Because mortality varies across race, one might expect to




records. We suspect the self-reported claiming information is more reliable than the administrative Social Security
information.
see difference in claiming behavior across races; however, this is again not the case. Counter to

expectation, those with greater wealth are less likely to delay.

       On the other hand, college education does appear to be associated with longer delays,

possibly because of longer life expectancy or improved financial literacy. The probability of

delaying to age 65 or later is 7.3 percentage points higher among those with some college than

among those with no college. In addition, individuals with some college delay benefits for an

additional 3.8 months compared to those with no college. Finally, as predicted, individuals who

were born before 1938 have a probability of delay that is 6.2 percentage points lower than those

who were born in 1938 and later. The older cohort’s average delay period is 3.7 months shorter

compared to the younger cohort.



   6. Conclusion

       We have shown that the gains from delaying Social Security have improved dramatically,

particularly for couples, since the 1990s. Most of the increase in the gains from delay come from

historically low interest rates and improved mortality. However, law changes since the 1990s

have also contributed. In particular, the benefit formula has been changed so that delays beyond

full retirement age are particularly attractive. Also, since 2000, one-earner couples have

benefited from a provision known as “file and suspend,” which allows the non-earner to claim a

spousal benefit even if the primary earner delays his own worker benefit.

       Throughout our analysis, we have focused on the percent gains from delay relative to

claiming at age 62. This measure of the gains from delay does not depend on the individual or

primary earner’s PIA. However, it is worth noting the substantial increase in the dollar gains

from delay as well. For any of our stylized couples, the gains from delay are less than $5,000 if
we assume that the primary earner’s PIA is $1,40012 and that he was born in 1930. In contrast, if

the primary earner was born in 1951, a one-earner couple could gain more than $85,000, and a

two-earner couple could gain more than $100,000 through optimal claiming relative to claiming

at 62. For singles born in 1930 with a PIA of $1,400, the gains from delay are less than $1,000

for women and nonexistent for men. In contrast, for singles born in 1951, the gains from delay

are more than $30,000 for men and more than $50,000 for women.13

         Consistent with these findings, our empirical analysis suggests that individuals born in

1938 and later – who face more generous terms for delaying Social Security – are more likely to

delay claiming. However, even among this younger group, the vast majority do not appear to

delay optimally. In addition, we find little relationship between delay and the other factors that

influence the gains from delay (such as primary earner status and mortality).




12
   According to the Social Security Administration’s 2012 Annual Statistical Supplement, this is roughly the average
PIA for retired workers in December 2011. For more detailed information, see the tables at
http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2012/5b.html.
13
   These calculations all assume the actual interest rates and mortality rates that the cohorts faced. In addition, the
1930 primary earner birth cohort is assumed not to have access to “file and suspend,” while the 1951 primary earner
birth cohort is.
