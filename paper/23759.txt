                                         ABSTRACT

We quantify the difference in the convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries and the bonds of near
default-free sovereigns by measuring the gap between the FX swap-implied dollar yield paid by
foreign governments and the U.S. Treasury dollar yield. We call this wedge the “U.S. Treasury
Premium.” We find that this premium was approximately 21 basis points for five-year bonds
prior to the Global Financial Crisis, increased up to 90 basis points during the crisis, and has
disappeared since the crisis with the post-crisis mean at -8 basis points. We show the decline in
the premium cannot be explained away by credit risk or FX swap market mispricings. In addition,
we present evidence that the relative supply of government bonds in the United States and foreign
countries affects the premium.

1        Introduction

Investors value the liquidity and safety of Treasury securities and are willing to forego the
so-called convenience yield to hold them over privately-issued papers (for example, see Kr-
ishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)). In this paper, we quantify the convenience yield
differential between U.S. Treasuries and foreign government bonds by taking the difference
between the FX swap market implied dollar yield paid by foreign governments and the U.S.
Treasury yield. Henceforth, we call this differential the “U.S. Treasury Premium.” A positive
premium implies the U.S. sovereign is paying less to borrow in real terms. The novelty and
advantage of this measure is that it captures how special the U.S. government is as a debt
issuer vis-a-vis comparably safe governments, not vis-a-vis large U.S. agencies or corporates.
        We measure the U.S. Treasury Premium vis-à-vis government bonds in Australia, Canada,
Denmark, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and United King-
dom, referred to as the “G10 countries.” Except for Japan, all sample countries have a AAA
or near-AAA sovereign credit rating and is perceived as near default-free by global investors.1
From 2000-2016, we find the average premium on U.S. Treasuries was 10 basis points at the
five-year horizon and 25 basis points at the three-month horizon. The premia also differ
significantly across countries, with means ranging between -26 and 61 basis points.
        Furthermore, we document a steady decline in the U.S. Treasury Premium at medium-
and long-term maturities since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The average five-year
premium is 21 basis points pre-GFC, increases up to 90 basis points during the GFC, and
declines to -8 basis points post-GFC. In contrast, the three-month premium averages 20 basis
points before the GFC, increases up to 280 basis points during the GFC, but remains at 20

     The long-term local currency bonds in seven of 11 countries are AAA-rated throughout the sample
(Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland). The other four countries (Japan,
New Zealand, United States and United Kingdom) do not have a perfect credit rating. The United States
was downgraded to AA+ in 2011 and New Zealand was downloaded to AA in 2011 and the United Kingdom
lost its AAA rating after the Brexit in 2016. Japan was downgraded several times in our sample, currently
rated A+, several notches lower than all the other sovereigns and the lowest in our sample.

basis points after the GFC. The decline in the medium- and long-term U.S. Treasury Premia
after the GFC is accompanied by a sharp inversion of the term structure of the premia.
   To investigate the drivers of the convenience yield differential, we decompose our U.S.
Treasury Premium into three components: (1) sovereign credit risk differential between the
foreign country and the United States; (2) swap market mispricing given by deviations from
covered interest rate parity (CIP) for interbank funding instruments (Du et al. (Forthcom-
ing)); and (3) a residual term, which we attribute to differences in broadly-defined liquidity,
which can include market liquidity, collateral value, near-money features of Treasuries, and
so forth.
   We show that in the pre-GFC period, measured credit spread differentials and CIP de-
viations were both negligible; thus the positive U.S. Treasury Premium is almost entirely
driven by the liquidity component. In the post-GFC period, both the CIP deviations for
interbank rates and sovereign CDS spread differentials tend to increase the U.S. Treasury
Premium because the U.S. has lower sovereign CDS spreads than the average G10 country
and swap market mispricing on average makes the swap-implied dollar yield higher than the
direct dollar yield. Therefore, the secular decline in the medium- to long-term U.S. Treasury
Premium is mostly driven by the decline in the residual liquidity component.
   We then examine the behavior of our U.S. Treasury Premium measure against other
measures of the liquidity and safety value of U.S. Treasury yields. At the short horizon, the
general collateral (GC) repo-Treasury bill (repo-Tbill) spread is considered a measure of the
liquidity premium in Treasury bill yields, as the GC repo is secured by Treasury collateral
and has very little credit risk, but is not as liquid as Treasury bills (Nagel (2016)). We find
that variations in the average 3-month premium of U.S. Treasury bills are strongly correlated
with the U.S. repo-Tbill spread. When the repo-Tbill spread is high, our average 3-month
U.S. Treasury Premium is also high. Furthermore, we find that a higher repo-Tbill spread in
foreign countries is correlated with a reduction in the U.S. Treasury Premium at the 3-month




                                              2
horizon, which supports the notion that our premium measures the relative liquidity of U.S.
Treasury bills vis-a-vis foreign Treasury bills.
   However, at medium to long maturities, our U.S. Treasury Premium behaves differently
from conventional measures of liquidity and safety that are constructed by taking the yield
spread between near risk-free agencies and Treasuries. In the United States, a commonly
used long-term liquidity premium measure is the yield difference between Resolution Funding
Corporation (Refcorp) coupon strips and Treasury strips (Fleckenstein et al. (2014) and
Negro et al. (2017)). Refcorp strips are fully guaranteed by U.S. Treasuries and thus have
the same credit risk as Treasuries. We note that contrary to the secular decline of our U.S.
Treasury Premium, the Refcorp-Treasury premium increases after the GFC. Our results show
that U.S. Treasuries have lost their specialness vis-a-vis other developed sovereigns at the
medium-to-long horizon, even as it increases vis-a-vis domestic safe agency debt of the same
currency.
   Finally, we examine how the relative supply of U.S. Treasuries over foreign government
bonds affects the U.S. Treasury Premium. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012)
show that the U.S. public debt to GDP ratio is inversely related to the convenience yield
on U.S. Treasuries. When the debt to GDP ratio is low, Treasuries are more scarce and
therefore commands a higher premium compared to private paper. Consistent with their
results, we find that an increase in the supply of foreign government bonds relative to U.S.
Treasuries is associated with a higher U.S. Treasury Premium.
   Our U.S. Treasury Premium measure is related to a number of papers that examine the
convenience yields of U.S. Treasuries, in particular Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen
(2012), Nagel (2016) and Greenwood et al. (2015). Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen
(2012) examine the effect of the amount of debt outstanding on the liquidity and safety
premia of U.S. Treasuries. The authors estimate the premium at 73 basis points, which
they identify off of the effect of Treasury issuance on AAA-Treasury spreads. While our
benchmark estimates are lower than those in Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012),


                                                   3
this should not be surprising as we are measuring a different concept. We are considering the
U.S. Treasury’s liquidity and safety premia relative to other governments rather than relative
to safe agencies and corporates. Therefore, one way to interpret our results is to say that the
US earns a premium relative to developed sovereigns that is smaller than that earned relative
to its own agencies and corporates. Greenwood et al. (2015) estimate the convenience yield
of T-bills using the differential between the actual T-bill yield and the fitted yield based on
the estimated yield curve, and find a premium of 40 basis points for one-week bills. Nagel
(2016) measures the liquidity premium on T-bills as their spread relative to a three-month
general collateral repo with the mean premium equal to about 24 basis points.
   The question of how much less the U.S. government pays on its debt because of its
“specialness” is also related to the question of the “Exorbitant Privilege” and the source of
the return differentials between the United States and the rest of the world. This question is
examined by Gourinchas and Rey (2007b), Gourinchas and Rey (2007a), Gourinchas et al.
(2010), and Curcuru et al. (2008). By converting all foreign government bond yields into
U.S. dollars, we contribute to this literature by quantifying the degree to which the U.S.
government pays less than foreigners, above and beyond differences in the currency risk
premia. By focusing on the specialness of government bonds within a currency, this measure
is largely distinct from the question of why the U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency
(Maggiori (Forthcoming), Maggiori (Forthcoming)) and attempts to measure premium on
U.S. dollar-denominated assets (Maggiori et al. (2013)).
   Recently, a number of papers in international finance have examined how changes in the
relative convenience yield of government bonds across countries can help resolve a number of
exchange rate puzzles. Engel (2016) and Valchev (2016) argue that time variation in bond
convenience yields can explain the term structure of violations of uncovered interest rate
parity. Itskhoki and Mukhin (2017) looks at how a similar shock can generate exchange rate
disconnect. Our measure U.S. Treasury Premium provides an empirical counterpart to the
shocks in these papers.


                                              4
      In terms of the construction of the U.S. Treasury Premium measure itself, this paper
build on the earlier work of Du and Schreger (2016a) and Du and Schreger (2016b). Du
and Schreger (2016a) construct the “local currency credit spread” in an identical way as
the measure used in this paper and argue that it largely captures sovereign default risk on
nominal debt in emerging markets.2 The “U.S. Treasury Premium” is constructed in the same
way as the “local currency credit spread” in these earlier papers but is given a very different
interpretation. This is because sovereign default risk is very low in G10 countries, and
therefore, it is likely that the factors such as the liquidity premium differential and financial
market frictions play more important roles than default risk in explaining the U.S. Treasury
Premium vis-à-vis G10 government bonds. We discuss the difference in the behavior of this
measure between emerging and developed countries in Section 3.2. The measure in this
paper is closely related to the analysis of “Relative Swap Spreads” in Codogno et al. (2003).
Codogno et al. (2003) decompose yield spreads in euro area countries into international
risk factors, default, and liquidity, while accounting for the fact that bonds are in different
currencies by using interest rate swaps. Our measure differs from the measure in that paper
by including the cross-currency basis swap, but would be the same if this basis was close to
zero as was generally the case prior to the GFC. Our analysis is also related to Feldhütter
and Lando (2008) and Jermann (2016) which analyze the sources of variations in U.S. asset
swap spreads. Our paper could be recast as analyzing the difference between the U.S. asset
swap spread and foreign swap spreads, net the cross currency basis swap. Finally, as our
measure is defined as the size of the failure of CIP between government bond yields, it also
relates to the recent literature studying CIP deviations in context of the behavior of banks
and corporate issuers (such as Ivashina et al. (2015), Liao (2016), Du et al. (Forthcoming),
and Avdjiev et al. (2016)).
      The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the methodology behind
calculating the premium and our data sources. In Section 3, we present the main results
  2
      Hofmann et al. (2016) studies this same measure in connection to currency appreciation.

on the behavior of the U.S. Treasury Premium across time, currency, and maturity. In
Section 4, we compare this premium to existing measures of the safety and liquidity of U.S.
Treasuries. In Section 5, we examine the relationship between the relative bond supply and
the premium. Section 6 concludes.



2     Methodology and Data

2.1    Definition of the U.S. Treasury Premium

In this section, we present the methodology for comparing yields in different currencies.
We follow Du and Schreger (2016a) and use cross-currency swap rates to swap sovereign
yields in different currencies into synthetic dollar yields. Then the U.S. Treasury Premium
is defined as the difference between the synthetic dollar yields paid by foreign governments
and the yield on U.S. Treasuries. A positive U.S. Treasury Premium suggests that the U.S.
government is paying less in real terms than foreign governments. We keep the discussion
of currency hedging brief here, but more details and discussions can be found in Du and
Schreger (2016a).
    We illustrate the construction of our synthetic dollar yields by taking the Japanese yen
(JPY) as an example. The fixed-for-fixed cross-currency swap, or the market-implied forward
premium, can be constructed in the following way. First, an investor pays the yen interest
rate swap rate, irsJP
                   t
                      Y
                        , to swap the fixed yen cash flow into floating yen Libor, and then the
                                                     U SD/JP Y
investor pays the cross-currency basis swap, bst                 to swap yen Libor into dollar Libor,
and finally the investor receives the dollar interest rate swap, irsUt SD , to swap the floating
dollar Libor into fixed dollar cash flows. Therefore, the fixed-for-fixed cross-currency swap
rate from JPY to USD is equal to


                          JP Y /U SD                   JP Y /U SD
                         ρnt           = irsJP
                                            nt
                                               Y
                                                 + bsnt             − irsUntSD ,                  (1)




                                                 6
where t denotes time, and n denotes tenor. Given the nominal yield on the Japanese gov-
               JP Y
ernment bond, ynt   , the synthetic dollar yield is equal to


                                         JP Y,$    JP Y     JP Y /U SD
                                        ynt     = ynt   − ρnt            .


             JP Y,$
We refer to ynt     as the synthetic dollar yield on a Japanese government bond because it
is equal to the dollar yield that an investor would receive by purchasing a yen bond and
swapping all promised yen cash flow into dollars, conditional on the Japanese government
                                                     U SD
not defaulting. Subtracting the U.S. Treasury yield ynt   from both sides, we can decompose
the nominal yield differential between Japan and the US into two components:


            JP Y    U SD         JP Y /U SD       JP Y,$    U SD         JP Y /U SD         JP Y /U SD
           ynt   − ynt   = ρnt                − (ynt     − ynt   ) ≡ ρnt              + Φit              .   (2)


                          JP Y /U SD
The first component ρnt                reflects the currency risk between JPY and USD. The second
             JP Y /U SD
component Φit             measures the synthetic dollar yield differential between Japan and the
                  JP Y /U SD
US. We refer to Φit             as the “U.S. Treasury Premium” vis-à-vis Japan, or


                                                                 JP Y /U SD
                                  ΦJP
                                   it
                                      Y    JP Y
                                        ≡ ynt      U SD
                                                − ynt   − ρnt                 .


   More generally, the U.S. Treasury Premium vis-à-vis country i is defined as


                                                                i/U SD
                                        Φiit ≡ ynt
                                                i     U SD
                                                   − ynt   − ρnt         ,                                   (3)


       i                                                                          i/U SD
where ynt is the n-year government bond yield in country i and ρnt                         is the n-year forward
premium (or the fixed-for-fixed cross-currency swap rate) for currency i against the dollar.
In order to further decompose this premium, we need to begin by outlining the factors than
can affect the prices of U.S. Treasuries and foreign government bonds.

2.2     Decomposition of the U.S. Treasury Premium

In this subsection, we provide a simple theoretical decomposition of the U.S. Treasury Pre-
mium defined in Equation 3 to three components: credit risk, swap market mispricing, and
liquidity. The underlying assumption is that government bond markets and FX markets
are integrated and priced by a global investor, which is a reasonable assumption for G10
countries. In this framework, the U.S. Treasury premium can exist for three reasons. First,
the government bond yield can be higher than the hypothetical risk-free rate if the govern-
ment bond is not default-free, so the U.S. Treasury premium can be affected by the safety
differential between the foreign country and the United States. Second, swap market fric-
tions introduce a wedge between the observed swap rate and the difference in hypothetical
risk-free rates, and this wedge directly enters into the U.S. Treasury premium calculation as
the observed swap rate is the price of hedging currency risk. Third, since the government
bond yield can be lower than the hypothetical risk-free rate if there are positive liquidity
benefits to holding the government bond, the U.S. Treasury Premium is also affected by
the liquidity premium differential between government bonds in the foreign country and the
United States.


2.2.1   Price of a U.S. Treasury Bond

Given a U.S. Treasury bond, let L∗t+1 denote the default loss and Λ∗t+1 , the liquidity benefit
at time t+1, where the star denotes that these are U.S. variables. E∗t denotes the risk-neutral
expectation at time t using the U.S. dollar numeraire. Then the price of a one-period U.S.
Treasury bond is given by


                          Pt∗ = exp(−ỹt∗ )E∗t [(1 − L∗t+1 )(1 + Λ∗t+1 )],




                                                 8
and the yield on the U.S. Treasury is


    yt∗ = ỹt∗ − ln E∗t [(1 − L∗t+1 )(1 + Λ∗t+1 )]

         = ỹt∗ − ln[E∗t (1 − L∗t+1 )E∗t (1 + Λ∗t+1 ) + Covt∗ (1 − L∗t+1 , 1 + Λ∗t+1 )]
                                                                       Covt∗ (1 − L∗t+1 , 1 + Λ∗t+1 )
                                                                                                     
              ∗       ∗        ∗             ∗        ∗
         = ỹt − ln Et (1 − Lt+1 ) − ln Et (1 + Λt+1 ) − ln 1 + ∗
                                                                      Et (1 − L∗t+1 )E∗t (1 + Λ∗t+1 )
         = ỹt∗ + lt∗ − λ∗t − ξt∗ ,                                                                       (4)


where ỹt∗ is the hypothetical dollar risk-free rate, lt∗ is the default premium, λ∗t is the liquidity
premium, and ξt is the covariance between liquidity and default risk.
   If the U.S. Treasury bond is default-free, we have lt∗ = 0 and ξt∗ = 0, and then yt∗ = ỹt∗ −λ∗t .
In other words, the Treasury yield can be lower than the hypothetical dollar risk-free rate if
it has liquidity benefits over the risk-free rate.


2.2.2   Price of a Foreign Government Bond

Now we price a one-period foreign government bond in an analogous way. Let Li,t+1 denote
the default loss at t + 1 on a government bond of country i, and Λi,t+1 be the liquidity benefit
at t + 1 for holding the bond. Let ỹit be the hypothetical risk-free rate for currency i.


                              Pit = exp(−ỹit )Et [(1 − Li,t+1 )(1 + Λi,t+1 )]


Based on the derivation for the U.S. Treasury yield, we have


                                       yit = ỹi,t + lit − λit − ξit .


The hypothetical risk-free rate in currency i, ỹit , is connected to the hypothetical U.S. risk-
free rate as follows
                                              ỹit = ỹt∗ + ρ̃it ,                                        (5)



                                                       9
where ρ̃it is the hypothetical forward premium in a frictionless market given by the CIP
relationship for the risk-free rates ỹit and ỹit∗ .
    Therefore, we can write the foreign bond yield as


                                     yit = ỹt∗ + ρ̃it + lit − λit − ξit .                       (6)


Once again, if the foreign government bond is default-free, we have lit = 0 and ξit = 0, so
yit = ỹt∗ + ρ̃it − λit . The foreign yield can differ from the dollar risk-free rate due to currency
risk and the liquidity benefit.


2.2.3    Swap Market Frictions

In practice, the hypothetical frictionless forward premium, ρ̃it , is not observed. As shown in
Equation 1, the observed forward premium is a combination of interest rate swaps and the
cross-currency basis swap,
                                                           i/$
                                        ρit = irsit + bst − irs$t ,                              (7)

where irsit and irs$t stand for the fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps in currency i and the
                                     i/$
U.S. dollar, respectively, and bst         stands for the cross-currency basis swap exchanging the
floating rate in currency i for the U.S. floating rate (U.S. dollar Libor). Frictions in these
swap rates can potentially create a wedge between the observed forward premium and the
hypothetical forward premium.
    We let the hypothetical forward premium in a frictionless market ρ̃it be the sum of the
observed ρit and a wedge due to swap market frictions, τt :


                                              ρ̃it = ρit + τit .                                 (8)


By Equation 5, we note that


                                    τit = ρ̃it − ρit = (ỹt − ỹt∗ ) − ρit

                                                      10
so τit is equal to the deviation from the CIP condition.
    In lieu of the unobserved hypothetical risk-free rates, ỹt and ỹt∗ , interbank rates have
long been used as benchmark interest rates to test the CIP condition. Before the GFC,
the CIP relationship held very closely for benchmark interbank rates, the swap rate implied
by interbank rate differentials were equal to the observed forward premium. However, as
documented in Du et al. (Forthcoming), large CIP deviations emerged during the GFC and
persisted after the GFC for benchmark interbank rates. Du et al. (Forthcoming) argue the
CIP deviations exist due to constraints on the balance sheet capacity of financial intermedi-
aries, and CIP deviations can be viewed as an intermediation fee that financial intermediaries
are earning to justify the marginal cost of balance sheet capacity while providing currency
hedging. Furthermore, characteristics of CIP deviations remain if we use other interest rate
instruments, such as repo rates and overnight index swap rates. In the rest of the paper,
we use CIP deviations based on interbank rates to measure τit , which is equal to the cross-
currency basis swap rate bsit . In terms of the directions of the CIP deviations, as shown in
Du et al. (Forthcoming), τit > 0 for the most G10 currencies, except the Australian and New
Zealand dollar. Therefore, swap market frictions implied by CIP deviations suggest that
the observed forward premium is generally lower than the hypothetical forward premium
(ρit < ρ̃it ).
    We note that in addition to the CIP deviations, the “negative swap spread” is another
fixed-income anomaly that emerged after the GFC (for example, Jermann (2016)). The
swap spread is defined as the difference between the the U.S. interest rate swap yield and
Treasury yield. The swap spread turned negative at the 30-year tenor during the GFC and
has since remained negative. The 5-year and 10-year U.S. swap spread also turned negative




                                              11
in 2015. A negative swap spread implies an arbitrage opportunity,3 which suggests that the
observed U.S. interest rate swap market is higher than the hypothetical swap rate. As can
be seen in Equation 7, this mispricing alone tends to push the observed forward premium ρ
higher than the hypothetical forward premium ρ̃, which works in the opposite direction of
the overall bias in the forward premium implied by CIP deviations. Since the overall bias
in the forward premium is what matters for our U.S. Treasury Premium calculation, we do
not separately identify mispricing in U.S. interest rate swap markets.


2.2.4    Decomposition

By substituting Equation 8 into Equation 6, we can write the foreign government bond yield
as4
                                yit = ỹt∗ + (ρit + τt ) + lit − λit − ξit .

The U.S. Treasury Premium, denoted by Φ, can be decomposed as follows:


               Φit = yit − ρit − yit∗

                    = [ỹt∗ + (ρit + τt ) + lit − λit − ξit ] − ρit − (ỹt∗ + lt∗ − λ∗t − ξt∗ )

                    = τt − ˆlit + λ̂it + ξˆit

                    ≈ τt − ˆlit + λ̂it ,                                                              (9)


where x̂ ≡ x∗ − x. We assume that the difference in the covariances between currency
and liquidity risk is negligible, i.e., ξˆ = 0. Therefore, the U.S. Treasury Premium can be
   3
     To see this, the arbitrageur can purchase a 30-year Treasury bond and finance the purchase by rolling
over a three-month repo with the Treasury bond being the collateral. Meanwhile, the arbitrageur can pay
the fixed 30-year interest rate swap rate, and receive the floating three-month U.S. Libor. The net cash
flow of the arbitrageur is to receive the three-month Libor and to pay the three-month repo rate backed
by Treasuries. Since the three-month Libor-repo spread is always positive, the trade involves zero upfront
investment and has positive carry throughout the trading horizon, which is a violation of the no-arbitrage
condition.
   4
     Our theoretical decomposition focuses on the pricing of one-period bonds. We assume the intermediate
spread τt is known ex ante and do not consider the covariance between the τt and λit entering the spread.
However, once we extend to multi-period bond, the covariance between τt and λit could matter for bond
pricing.


                                                     12
decomposed into (1) an intermediation spread arising from frictions in the swap market, (2)
difference in default risk, and (3) difference in liquidity premium.
       To illustrate the effects of each component on the unadjusted premium given by Equation
9, we present two adjusted versions of the U.S. Treasury Premium,


                                    Φ̄it ≡ Φit − τt = −ˆlit + λ̂it                                   (10)

                                    Φ̃it ≡ Φit − τt + ˆlit = λ̂it ,                                  (11)


where Φ̄it is the premium adjusted for swap market frictions, and Φ̃it is the premium adjusted
for both swap market frictions and the credit quality differential between foreign and U.S.
Treasuries.
                                                                                                 
       In the absence of CIP deviations (τt = 0) or differences in default risk           ˆlit = 0 , the

unadjusted premium Φit in Equation 9 caputres the liquidity premium differential λ̂it . If we
aim to capture λ̂it but we are concerned about time variation in frictions in the swap market
(τt > 0), but assume that sovereign bonds in all developed countries are free from default
            
risk ˆlit = 0 , then Φ̄it in Equation 10 will specifically capture the liquidity component of
the U.S. Treasury premium. To measure τt , we use CIP deviations based on interbank rates
as in in Du et al. (Forthcoming). Finally, if we adjust for time variation in the swap market
                                       
                                ˆ
and differences in default risk lit 6= 0 as measured by CDS spreads,5 then Φ̃it in Equation
11 captures the liquidity premium differential λ̂it .


2.3       Data Sources

We briefly discuss our data sources. We use Bloomberg BFV curves for government bond
yields in the United States and G10 countries; BFV curves are fitted par yield curves based
   5
     There is the question of what exactly sovereign CDS spreads capture. G10 Sovereign CDS markets for
are not very liquid and Klingler and Lando (2016) show that CDS premium for safe sovereigns are primarily
driven by regulatory demand. One alternative assumption is to assume that all sovereigns in the sample are
risk-free and therefore, ˆlt = 0.




                                                   13
on secondary market bond prices estimated by Bloomberg. We also use Bloomberg data for
yields on interest rate swaps and cross-currency basis swaps.
    Credit default swap spreads data are from Mark.it and are on senior unsecured credit-
default swap contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. They were obtained for the six-month,
and one to 10-year contracts. Because data on the 3-month contract is unavailable, we used
the six-month contract for the three-month contract instead.
    We use two measures of the scarcity of government paper. The first is the ratio of nominal
federal debt outstanding to nominal GDP, and the second is the ratio of nominal debt
outstanding, net central bank purchases, to nominal GDP. Data on federal debt outstanding
and seasonally adjusted nominal GDP are from Haver Analytics. Data on central bank
holdings of domestic sovereign debt were hand collected from individual country websites.
    We obtain data on policy rates and the CBOE VIX Index from Bloomberg, which we used
as regression controls when studying bond supply effects. Finally, we obtain GC repo rates
from Thomson Reuters Eikon and BFV curves of government agency bonds from Bloomberg
to reconstruct well known convenience yield proxies. Bloomberg and Eikon tickers used in
the paper can be found in the Appendix B.



3     The U.S. Treasury Premium: 2000-2016

3.1    Main Results

In this section, we present summary statistics and a few stylized facts about the U.S. Treasury
Premium.
    In Figure 1a, we plot currency-specific nominal yields of our ten country sample at the
5-year horizon. The variation across country is wide. In Figure 1b, we report the swap-
                                        i,$    i     i/U SD
implied dollar yields for each country ynt  = ynt − ρnt       from combining the five-year bond
of country i in its own currency with a fixed-for-fixed cross currency swap to hedge the
promised cash-flows from currency i into USD. It is immediately clear that these swap-


                                              14
implied dollar yields track the yield on U.S. treasuries very closely, with significantly less
dispersion than currency-specific yields. Our unadjusted U.S. Treasury Premium can be
visualized as the spread between these swap-implied dollar yields and the U.S. Treasury
yield.

Notes: Figure 1a plots currency-specific yield on five-year government bonds in G10 countries and the United
States. Figure 1b plots the five-year synthetic dollar yields on these government bonds after hedging foreign
currency risk. Series are seven-day moving averages. EUR refers to Germany.


              Figure 2 plots the cross-country mean of the five-year unadjusted premium and two
versions of the adjusted premium, as defined in Equations 9-11, respectively. It is easiest
to interpret the measures from 2000-2006. During that time, CIP held for interbank rates
and sovereign CDS spreads between U.S. and foreign countries were approximately zero.
Therefore, the unadjusted and adjusted premia were all equal with the cross-country averages
of about 21 basis points. During the GFC (2007-2009), the U.S. Treasury premia generally
widened. The unadjusted premium widened most significantly. This, however, is the period
in which CIP for interbank rates broke down, and U.S. and foreign sovereign CDS spreads
diverged. The two adjusted premia also widened during the GFC, but by significantly less
than the unadjusted premium.
              In the post-GFC sample (2010-2016), we document a steady decline in the U.S. Treasury
Premium. The unadjusted premium trended down to the negative territory in 2010 with the


                                                                                15
cross-country average at -8 basis points for the 2010-2016 period. The adjusted premium is
more negative over that period once we adjust for CIP deviations for interbank rates with
an average equal -22 basis points. In other words, if the swap rate was such that the CIP
condition for interbank rates held, the U.S. Treasury Premium would be lower. In addition,
since the U.S. sovereign CDS spread is lower than the average G10 sovereign CDS spread,
the CDS differential adjustment brings down the premium even further to an average -38
basis points in the post-GFC period. Therefore, the decline in the average unadjusted U.S.
Treasury Premium post-GFC cannot be attributed to swap market frictions nor to perceived
credit quality differentials between the U.S. and foreign sovereigns. Instead, the decline in
the premium is driven by a sharp decline in the relative liquidity premium of U.S. Treasuries
vis-a-vis foreign Treasuries.

Notes: This figure plots the 5-year U.S. Treasury Premium, averaged across countries. The unadjusted
premium (in solid green), the premium adjusted for CIP deviations (in dotted red), and the premium
adjusted for CIP deviations and CDS differentials (in dashed blue) are shown from 2000-2016. Series are
seven-day moving averages.




                                                               16
      Figure 3 shows the three measures by country and Table 1 reports the mean and standard
deviations of the unadjusted U.S. Treasury Premium by country.6 As shown in Table 1,
cross-country heterogeneity is large: the U.S. Treasury Premium is highest for Japan with
the average equal to 61 basis points and lowest for Australia and New Zealand at about -25
basis points. It also increases in the post-GFC period with the mean increasing to 70 basis
points for Japan and -58 basis points for Australia.
      In terms of the time variations by country, pre-GFC, the unadjusted premium and ad-
justed premia are nearly identical for all countries. Broadly, this remains true for Australia,
Canada, Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand during and after the GFC, suggesting that
for this subset of countries, variations to the unadjusted premia are largely independent of
swap market frictions, or credit spread differentials. For Switzerland, Denmark, Europe, and
Great Britain, outside the GFC and the European Debt Crisis, the unadjusted premia are
generally higher than premia adjusted for CIP deviations. With the adjustment, the pre-
mia vis-a-vis this subset of countries falls more precipitously in the post-GFC period, more
so when adjusting for both CIP deviations and the CDS spreads. Notably, outside crises,
the two adjusted series are very similar; this is unsurprising as CDS spreads are narrow in
tranquil periods.

      Summary statistics by country of the adjusted premia can be found in Appendix Tables A1 and A2.

   Finally, we examine the explanatory power of credit differentials, swap market frictions,
and the residual liquidity factor in explaining the total variation in the unadjusted premium.

Table 2 shows panel regression results of changes in the unadjusted premium on changes in
swap market frictions and changes in the CDS differential at the daily, weekly, and monthly
frequency. The coefficient on the swap market friction, as measured by CIP deviations for
the interbank rates, is very close to 1. However, the coefficient on the CDS differential is
small and slightly negative, which suggests CDS differentials have a limited role in driving
the unadjusted premium. The R2 of the regressions with both CIP deviations and the CDS
spread is 5% at the daily frequency and 25% at the monthly frequency. This implies a large
fraction of total variations in the unadjusted premium can be attributed to the residual
liquidity factor. To take into account dynamic interactions among these factors, we present
results from individual country vector autoregressions (VAR) in the Appendix C.

frequency, 13 lags at the weekly frequency, and 3 lags at the monthly frequency. The variable ∆τ is changes
in LIBOR CIP deviations; and the variable ∆lˆi is changes in the CDS differential, defined as the foreign
sovereign’s CDS spread on a 5-year senior, unsecured contract. Data range from 2005-2016. The unadjusted
treasury premium is from the authors’ calculations using data from Bloomberg. Data on CIP deviations are

3.2       G10 vs. EM Comparison

To better understand drivers of the U.S. Treasury Premium, we now compare the measure
averaged across G10 currencies to the measure averaged across a set of 13 emerging markets
(EMs). Figure 4 plots the U.S. Treasury Premium vis-à-vis G10 countries and the U.S.
Treasury Premium vis-a-vis EMs. Unsurprisingly, the average U.S. Treasury Premium vis-
à-vis G10 countries is significantly lower than the U.S. Treasury Premium vis-à-vis EMs.7
       Du and Schreger (2016a) call the U.S. Treasury Premium the “Local Currency Credit
Spread” because they argue that it constitutes a credit spread on local currency sovereign
debt, and measures the risk that governments explicitly default on debt denominated in
their own currency. In the context of G10 currencies, however, we argue that the measure
is more akin to a convenience yield. The reason for this significantly different interpretation
can be seen in Figure 5. The left panel plots the (unadjusted) mean U.S. Treasury Premium
and CDS differential for G10 countries. Other than at the peak of the GFC, we see limited
correlation between the measures.8 Pre-GFC, the CDS differential is approximately zero for
G10 countries, but the the U.S. Treasury Premium is positive and sizable. Post-GFC, the
average CDS differential between G10 countries and the United States is positive, but the
U.S. Treasury Premium is negative. By contrast, in the right panel, we make the same figure
for a sample of emerging markets and see very strong co-movement between the unadjusted
U.S. Treasury Premium and the CDS Differential, indicating that the premium is capturing
fluctuations in default risk.
   7
     The included countries are Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Mexico, Malaysia, Peru, Poland,
Thailand, Turkey South Africa, and South Korea.
   8
     Japan is an interesting exception, as can be seen in Appendix Figure A1. The pattern of the strong
comovement between the premium and the CDS differential is quite similar to the pattern documented for
individual emerging markets in Du and Schreger (2016a). Notably, the credit rating of Japan is the lowest
in our sample of sovereigns.

3.3       Term Structure of the U.S. Treasury Premium

Next, we turn our attention to the term structure of the U.S. Treasury Premium. Table
3 presents summary statistics of the unadjusted and adjusted U.S. Treasury Premium by
tenors and subsamples. Figure 6 plots the unadjusted premium by maturity. As we can
see from Table 3 and Figure 6, before the GFC, the term structure of the U.S. Treasury
Premium is upward sloping and the premia are positive across all maturities.
   During times of financial stress, such as the Global Financial Crisis, we would expect to
see the “flight to safety” phenomenon increase the U.S. Treasury Premium across maturities,
with the increase concentrated at shorter maturities as these instruments are seen as closer
to cash than long-dated instruments. This is what we observe. During the GFC, the premia
increases for all maturities, with the largest increases at short maturities. The cross-country
average for the 3-month premium peaks close to 300 basis points during the height of the
crisis. The increase in the 10-year premium during the GFC is much more subdued with the
highest level only around 50 basis points.
   After the GFC, the term structure remains inverted and the 3-month, 1-year, 5-year,
and 10-year premia are no longer strongly correlated, nor of the same sign. Post-GFC, the
3-month and 1-year premia are positive and have been trending up; meanwhile, the 5-year
and 10-year premia have been negative and approximately flat. Strikingly, the 3-month and
1-year premia begin their upward trend in 2014, rising from nearly 0 basis points to 70 basis
points.
   The inversion of the term structure of the U.S. Treasury Premium also holds for the
premia adjusted for swap market frictions and credit spread differentials. Figure 7 plots the
term spread of the U.S. Treasury Premium, which we define as the 10-year premium minus
the 1-year premium, for the unadjusted premium and the adjusted premia. The term spread
becomes negative for all three premium measures post-GFC.
   Therefore, we find that even though medium- to-long-term U.S. Treasuries have lost
their specialness relative to other near-default-free government bonds since the GFC, short-


                                              23
dated U.S. Treasury bills still command a sizable premium. The liquidity premium of U.S.
Treasuries has shifted from long to short maturities. This “liquidity shift” is consistent with
the increased demand for high-quality liquid assets particularly in U.S. dollars, following the
GFC.

4     Relationship with Other Convenience Yield Measures

In this section, we examine the relationship between U.S. Treasury Premium and existing
measures of the safety and liquidity component of the convenience yield.


4.1     Short-term premium comparison

A measure of convenience in the 3-month market for Treasuries is the General Collateral
(GC) Repo-Treasury Bill spread, defined as the spread between the 3-month Treasury GC
Repo rate and a 3-month T-Bill yield. Like a Treasury security, a Treasury GC repo is free
of credit risk as it is secured by Treasuries. However, repos are not as liquid as Treasury
bills because the money is always lent for term (Nagel (2016)); thus, the GC Repo-Treasury
Bill spread mainly captures the liquidity premium of Treasury bills.
    Since our unadjusted U.S. Treasury Premium is vis-a-vis another country, if it is being
driven by a liquidity component, that component should be a relative measure of the U.S.

                                                                     26
Treasury market vis-a-vis the Treasury market of a foreign sovereign. The closest approx-
imation of this is the difference in the 3-month GC Repo rate-TBill spread for the United
States Treasuries, and the foreign country’s Treasuries.
       This motivates the following set of regressions to estimate the liquidity component of the
3-month Treasury premium:9


                 Φ3M,t = α + β · RTU SD,3M,t + t

                Φi,3M,t = α + β · RTU SD,3M,t + γ · RTi,3M,t + t , i ∈ {EU R, JP Y } ,


where Φ3M,t denotes the cross-country average of the 3-month unadjusted U.S. Treasury
Premium; RTU SD,3M is the 3-month GC repo-TBill spread for the United States; RTEU R,3M
is the 3-month GC repo-TBill spread for Germany ; RTJP Y,3M is the 3-month GC repo-TBill
spread for Japan. We run these regressions in levels and changes at the weekly frequency
in Table 4 with changes denoted as ∆ . This exercise is restricted to Germany andJapan
because of lack of good data on GC repo rates in other countries in our sample.
       Regression results in levels are reported in the first three columns of Table 4 whereas
regression results in differences are reported in the next three columns. In the first regression
in levels, RTU SD,3M enters with a highly significant coefficient of 1.726 and with the constant,
explains 75% of the variation in the Treasury Premium. In the second and third regressions
in levels, RTU SD,3M enters with a highly significant coefficient of 1.635 and 2.362, respectively.
This supports our hypothesis that when the liquidity of the U.S. Treasuries market is high,
so is the U.S. Treasury Premium. The country-specific liquidity variables enter in as negative
and insignificant in the levels regression for Japan and Germany. The regressions in first
differences are broadly consistent with the regressions in levels, and supports the notion that
our U.S. Treasury Premium is, at the 3-month horizon, a relative measure of the liquidity
of U.S. Treasury bills vis-a-vis foreign Treasury bills. When estimated in first differences,

however, increases the EUR and JPY GC-Repo are associated with statistically significant
declines in the bilateral U.S Treasury Premium. Figure 6 plots the average U.S. Treasury
Premium and the GC-repo-Tbill spread at the three-month maturity to make clear just how
closely the two measures co-move.

4.2       Long-term Premium

At medium to long maturities, a conventional measure of convenience for U.S. Treasuries
is the spread between yields on near risk-free agency debt and Treasuries from the same
country. For the United States, this is the spread between yields on Refcorp coupon strips
and Treasury strips, which are both guaranteed by the U.S. government and subject to
the same taxation (Negro et al., 2017; Fleckenstein et al., 2014). The time series behavior
of the Refcorp-Treasury spread differs substantially from the cross-country average U.S.
Treasury Premium as can be seen in Figure 9. Most strikingly, during and after the GFC,
the two measures have opposite signs. This difference highlights how our measure is different
from those in the literature. Our measure is an inter -sovereign measure that measures the
specialness of U.S. Treasuries relative to other sovereigns whereas the Refco-Treasury spread
is an intra-sovereign measure that measures the Treasury spread relative to government-
guaranteed debt.10
       We conduct an exercise similar to the Repo-Tbill regressions at the 3-month tenor, but
-for long-term bonds. In addition to looking at the Refcorp-Treasury spread, we look at the
comparable analogues for European and Japan with their agency-sovereign spread. We run
the following set of regressions:


                  Φ5Y,t = α + β · ATU SD,5Y,t + t

                 Φi,5Y,t = α + β · ATU SD,5Y,t + γ · ATi,5M,t + t , i ∈ {EU R, JP Y } ,


where Φ5Y,t denotes the cross-country average of the 5-year unadjusted premium and ATi,5Y,t
denotes the 5-year agency-Treasury spread for country i.
       We run the specifications in both levels and first differences, using ∆ to indicate weekly
changes. Table 5 presents the results. The regression in levels suggests thats higher Agency-
  10
    Treasury premia measures used by Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) and Negro et al. (2017)
are similarly intra-sovereign measures. The former uses the spread between Aaa-rated corporate bonds and
U.S. Treasuries of similar maturity; the latter, a transform of the first principal component of 18 different
financial market spreads between U.S. assets).


                                                     30
Treasury spreads in the US are associated with a higher average U.S. Treasury Premium
and a higher bilateral premium with Japan. However, the country-specific Agency-Treasury
spreads enter insignificantly. In first differences, changes in the US Agency-Treasury spread
always enters insignificantly, although increases in the EUR Agency-Treasury spread is as-
sociated with a reduction in the bilateral U.S. Treasury Premium with respect to EUR.
Another important takeaway from these regressions is the much lower R2 in these latter 3
regressions relative to those at the 3-month horizon in Table 4. Whereas changes in the US
and country-specific repo spreads explained 32% of the change in the average premium and
1% and 45% of the Euro and Japanese Yen premia respectively, in this case the R2 fall to
0.4%, 5.1% and 0.1%. In other words, while standard Treasury convenience yield measures
appear to capture a large fraction of the U.S. Treasury Premium at short tenors, similar
measures explain very little of the variation in the long-term premia.

5         Bond Supply and the U.S. Treasury Premium

In this section, we test for a relationship between our measure of the U.S. Treasury Premium
and the relative scarcity of sovereign debt in the U.S. vis-a-vis the countries in our sample. We
proxy for the scarcity of sovereign debt by taking the ratio of the quantity of outstanding
federal debt excluding central bank holdings to seasonally-adjusted nominal GDP.11 This
analysis builds on the work of Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) that finds that
the U.S. public debt to GDP ratio is inversely related to the convenience yield on U.S.
Treasuries. Because our measure is intended to capture the premium of U.S. Treasuries
relative to other safe sovereign debt, we will look at the supply of debt for both the U.S. and
other countries.
         Our general regression framework is given by:

                                                 U S                         

                debt U S                                                                               debt
                                                                                                            
where log       GDP t
                           is the log of the U.S. debt to GDP ratio at time t, log                     GDP it
                                                                                                                 is the log
of country i’s debt to GDP ratio at time t, and Xit is a set of additional covariates motivated
by Nagel (2016). In particular, Xit includes the U.S. Policy Rate (the Federal Funds rate),
the country i policy rate, and the VIX, which is the CBOE Volatility Index and measures
the market expectation of 30-day volatility in the S&P 500. In columns 1-4, we estimate
the regressions in levels, and in columns 5-8 we estimate the regressions in changes at the
quarterly freuqency. In the even numbered columns, we include country fixed effects and in
the odd number columns we omit these fixed effects.
         In column 1 of Table 6, we omit country fixed effects and any controls and include only
the debt variables. We find that a 1 log point increase in the U.S. debt to GDP ratio is
associated with a 0.72 basis point fall in the U.S. Treasury Premium. By contrast, a 1 log
point increase in the foreign country debt-to-GDP ratio is associated with a 0.29 basis point
    11
    We conduct the same analysis without netting out central bank holdings in Appendix Table A3 and find
similar results.

higher U.S. Treasury Premium. Therefore, the initial specification is consistent with the idea
that the relative supply of government debt affects the U.S. Treasury Premium. In column
2, we include country fixed effects and the effect of the individual country debt/GDP ratio
disappears. In other words, the coefficient in column 1 is driven by differences in between
country means. In columns 3 and 4, we rerun the regressions in columns 1 and 2 but include
the additional covariates. The U.S. policy rate and VIX enter statistically significantly–the
latter result being consistent with “flight to safety” to U.S. Treasuries during times of high
global risk aversion. The coefficient on the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is quantitatively similar
across specifications. In columns 5-8, we estimate the same regressions in first differences
and examine whether changes in the debt GDP levels are associated with changes in the U.S.
Treasury Premium. One potential concern with these regressions is that quarterly changes
in debt ratios can be quite noisy. Indeed, the results of these regression are qualitatively
similar to columns 1-4, but the standard errors are much larger and many of the coefficients
lose statistical significance.
   Taken together, these regressions show that the U.S. Treasury Premium co-moves with
the relative supply of government debt, which suggests downward sloping demand functions
for these debt securities. When the supply of U.S. Treasuries becomes higher or the supply
of foreign government bonds becomes lower, the value that investors assign to the liquidity
and safety premia of U.S. Treasuries relative to foreign bonds decreases.12
  12
     However, our results should be cautiously interpreted. Our debt-to-gdp ratio is of total outstanding
federal debt to nominal debt, and is not maturity specific. However, our convenience yield measure is. We
do not find a significant effect of relative bond supply on the 3-month Treasury Premium.

6    Conclusion

We construct a new measure of the the convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries relative to other
near default-free foreign government bonds. We find that prior to the Global Financial
Crisis, U.S. Treasuries were quite special and earned a 21 basis point premium at the five-
year horizon. Following the crisis, medium and long-term U.S. Treasuries have lost their
specialness relative to the government bonds of sovereigns of comparable credit. This change
has occurred even as U.S. Treasuries have become more special relative to safe U.S. corporates
and agencies, as measured by the widening of spreads like the U.S. Agency-Treasury spread.
In contrast, short-term U.S. Treasury bills have retained their specialness after the Great
Financial Crisis.

    Formal lag selection procedures (the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Hannan and
Quinn criterion, (HQ) and the Schwarz Criterion (SC)) suggest one to four lags. Given our
relatively small sample of quarterly observations (34 to 53 quarters), we used the Edgerton
and Shukur test to test the null hypothesis of residual autocorrelation. Across currencies,
only a model with four lags rejects the null hypothesis for all currencies. We therefore choose
four lags. For model stability, we want eigenvalues to be less than one; a formal test confirms
all eigenvalues lie inside a unit circle. We triangularize the shocks using an upper triangular
Cholesky decomposition, calling the first shock a CDS shock; the second, a CIP shock; and
the third, a residual liquidity shock. We then use the estimated VAR system to analyze the
dynamic effect of the shocks via a historical decomposition and variance decomposition.
    We find the contribution of the liquidity shock to the forecast error to be sizeable across
countries despite some variation in the exact percentage. Table A6 shows variance decom-
position results based on the 8-quarter forecasting horizon. The average contribution across
countries is 20% for the CDS shock, 33% for the CIP shock, and 47% for the residual liquidity
shock. The historical decompositions of the five-year unadjusted premium by country are
shown in Figure A6. We can see that the residual liquidity shocks (in red) play an important
role in all countries, especially in Denmark, Europe, Norway, and Germany.

Notes: This figure plots the cumulative contribution of each structural shock to the evolution of the 5-year
unadjusted premium over time. Structural shocks were obtained by taking the upper triangular Cholesky
decomposition of residuals from a four-lag, reduced form VAR of three variables: the CDS differential, CIP
deviations, and the 5-year unadjusted premium, in that order. Bars in red represent the contribution of a
liquidity shock; bars in blue, a CIP shock; bars in gold, a CDS shock. The black line is the demeaned, and
detrended undjusted premium.
