                                          ABSTRACT

This study exploits a randomized school health intervention that provided deworming treatment
to Kenyan children and utilizes longitudinal data to estimate impacts on economic outcomes up to
20 years later. The effective respondent tracking rate was 84%. Individuals who received 2 to 3
additional years of childhood deworming experience an increase of 14% in consumption
expenditure, 13% in hourly earnings, 9% in non-agricultural work hours, and are 9% more likely
to live in urban areas. Most effects are concentrated among males and older individuals. Given
deworming's low cost, a conservative annualized social internal rate of return estimate is 37%.

    The belief that investing in child health and nutrition can generate improvements in
individuals’ future quality of life is the rationale for many policy initiatives around the world.
Yet there remains limited evidence on the causal impacts of child health gains on adult living
standards, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). While there has been
some recent progress in wealthy countries (Almond, Currie, and Duque 2018, Hendren and
Sprung-Keyser 2020), few studies in LMICs are able to exploit credibly exogenous variation in
child health status, combined with long-term participant tracking and detailed adult outcome
measures. This is in part due to the lack of high-quality administrative data on workers, as
well as widespread participation in the informal sector and subsistence agriculture.1
    This study contributes new evidence that addresses leading methodological concerns.
First, we exploit exogenous variation in child health via a randomized health intervention
(the Primary School Deworming Project, PSDP) that provided deworming treatment to
Kenyan children. Starting in 1998, 50 schools that we term the treatment group received
2 to 3 years of additional deworming relative to the 25 control group schools. Second, we
estimate impacts on individual living standards up to 20 years later, using data from the
Kenya Life Panel Survey (KLPS), which we designed to follow a representative sample of
PSDP participants. Specifically, we utilize a detailed consumption questionnaire, considered
the gold-standard of living standards measurement in LMICs, and gather rich information
on adult labor and earnings, including in the informal sector and subsistence agriculture.
Third, we successfully survey respondents over time: at the 20 year follow-up (round 4,
2017-19), the effective respondent survey rate was 84% among those still alive, with rates
balanced across treatment arms; rates were similarly high in the 10-year (round 2, 2007-09)
and 15-year (round 3, 2011-14) rounds. This is in part due to the decision to track migrants
beyond the original study region, to other parts of Kenya, East Africa, and beyond.
    In our main analysis, we find those in the deworming treatment group experience a 14%
gain in consumption expenditures (p-value ă 0.10), 7% increase in total earnings, and an
13% gain in hourly earnings (p-value ă 0.10) during the period 10 to 20 years after the start
of treatment. There are also shifts in sectors of residence and employment: treatment group
individuals are 9% more likely to live in urban areas (p-value ă 0.05), and experience an 9%
increase in non-agricultural work hours (p-value ă 0.05). Effects are concentrated among
males (though we typically cannot reject equal effects across genders), and impacts are also
typically larger for individuals who are older (those above age 12 at baseline); below we
return to interpretation of these patterns. The observed consumption and earnings benefits,
  1. A notable exception is the 35-year follow-up (Martorell et al. 2010) of the four villages in the Guatemala
INCAP nutritional intervention for pregnant women and young children (63% respondent tracking rate).
Bouguen et al. (2019) finds few studies of development interventions with more than a 7 year follow-up.

together with deworming’s low cost when distributed at scale, imply that a conservative
estimate of its annualized social internal rate of return is 37%, a high return by any standard.
    As background, intestinal helminth infections are widespread, infecting one in five people
worldwide (Pullan et al. 2014), and have adverse health and nutritional consequences for
children, including stunted growth, weakness, and anemia (Stephenson et al. 1993; Stoltzfus
et al. 1997; Guyatt et al. 2001; Silva et al. 2004; Disease Control Priorities Project 2008). The
infections also may have broader immunological effects, for instance, by making individuals
more prone to other infections such as malaria (Kirwan et al. 2010; Wammes et al. 2016) and
altering the gut microbiome (Guernier et al. 2017; Zaiss and Harris 2016); worm infections in
pregnant mothers may also reduce child birthweight (Larocque et al. 2006). These adverse
health effects form the basis for the World Health Organization’s (WHO) long-standing rec-
ommendation to provide mass school-based treatment in regions with infection prevalence
above 20% (WHO 1992; 2017). Mass treatment is attractive because common deworm-
ing drugs are safe and cost less than US$1 per year per child, while diagnosing infections
(through stool sample analysis) is imprecise and far more expensive (Ahuja et al. 2015).
The appropriateness of this recommendation has been actively debated following a survey
article that claimed few population-wide child gains from mass treatment (Taylor-Robinson
et al. 2012). However, a recent meta-analysis incorporating more studies finds larger positive
and significant impacts on child weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference (Croke et
al. 2016). There is little evidence regarding long-run economic impacts, with the exception
of Bleakley (2007), which finds that deworming in the U.S. South in the early 20th century
led to higher adult educational attainment and income.2
    Several studies analyze the PSDP experiment. Miguel and Kremer (2004) find improve-
ments in child school participation in treatment schools over the first two years of the pro-
gram, with absenteeism falling by one quarter. They also estimate sizeable treatment exter-
nalities, presumably as treatment kills off worms already in the body, reducing transmission
to others in the community; in particular, they document reductions in worm infection rates
among both untreated children attending treatment schools, and children attending other
schools located within 4 km of the treatment schools.3 Ozier (2018) provides further evidence
on externalities, showing that young children living in the treatment communities – who were
not yet school aged and thus did not themselves receive deworming – experienced gains in
learning outcomes up to ten years later, equivalent to 0.5 years of schooling on average. The
current study most directly builds on Baird et al. (2016), which documented deworming

al. (2015), Davey et al. (2015), Miguel and Kremer (2014), Clemens and Sandefur (2015), and Miguel,

impacts 10 years later, including improved self-reported health, educational attainment (by
0.3 years on average), test scores and secondary schooling attainment (concentrated among
females), as well as higher incomes among wage earners (20% gains), more meals eaten,
hours worked and manufacturing employment (concentrated among males).
    Baird et al. (2016) was subject to several limitations that the current study was designed
to address. First, because many respondents were still in school at the 10 year follow-up,
estimation of some labor market effects was necessarily conducted on selected samples. Sec-
ond, only partial information was collected on subsistence agricultural production. Third,
consumption data was not available for that round, leading to a reliance on a proxy (meals
eaten). The current paper makes several novel contributions. The analysis utilizes two ad-
ditional survey rounds to estimate impacts at 15 and 20 years after deworming treatment
– an unusually long timeframe for experimental studies (Bouguen et al. 2019) – when most
respondents were between 29 to 35 years old, allowing us to estimate impacts during indi-
viduals’ prime working years. The measurement of economic outcomes was also improved:
KLPS round 4 incorporates a detailed consumption expenditure questionnaire (modeled on
the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Survey, LSMS, see Grosh and Glewwe 2000)
for all respondents, and round 3 collected this for a representative subsample. Both KLPS
rounds 3 and 4 also contain improved measures of agricultural productivity, including in
subsistence agriculture, which, combined with other measures, provides a measure of total
household earnings. Finally, while earlier PSDP deworming cost-benefit analyses were nec-
essarily speculative, our use of long-run follow-up data means the calculations here are based
almost entirely on observed outcomes.


1     Data and Estimation Strategy

1.1    Program Background and Data Collection
The PSDP study area is Busia District (since renamed Busia County), a largely agrarian
region in western Kenya that is fairly representative of rural Kenya in terms of living stan-
dards. At the start of the program in 1998, the vast majority of children attended primary
school, but dropout rates were high in grades 6, 7 and 8 (the final three years) and fewer
than half went on to secondary school. Secondary schooling rates increased dramatically in
the region over the next decade. Among adults, occupational and family roles continue to
differ markedly by gender. This segmentation makes it plausible that the impacts of a health
intervention could differ by gender, for instance, as hypothesized in Pitt, Rosenzweig, and
Hassan (2012), who argue that child health gains in low-income, “brawn-based” economies


                                              4
may translate into greater labor market gains for males.
    In 1998 a non-governmental organization (NGO) launched the PSDP in two geographic
divisions of Busia, in 75 schools enrolling over 32,000 pupils. Baseline parasitological surveys
indicated that helminth infection rates were over 90%, and over a third had a moderate-heavy
infection according to a modified WHO infection criteria (Miguel and Kremer 2004).4 The
75 schools were experimentally divided into three groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3) of 25 schools
each: the schools were first stratified by administrative sub-unit (zone), zones were listed
alphabetically within each geographic division, and schools were then listed in order of pupil
enrollment within each zone, with every third school assigned to a given program group.
The three treatment groups were well-balanced along baseline characteristics (see Miguel
and Kremer 2004, Baird et al. 2016 and Appendix Figure A.1 for project details).
    Due to the NGO’s administrative and financial constraints, the schools were phased into
deworming treatment during 1998-2001: Group 1 schools began receiving free deworming
and health education in 1998, Group 2 schools in 1999, and Group 3 in 2001. Children in
Group 1 and 2 schools were thus on average assigned 2.41 more years of deworming than
Group 3 children; these two early beneficiary groups are denoted the treatment group here,
following Baird et al. (2016). Drug take-up rates were high, at approximately 75% in the
treatment group, and under 5% in the control group (Miguel and Kremer 2004).
    The Kenya Life Panel Survey was launched in 2003 to track a representative sample of
approximately 7,500 respondents enrolled in grades 2-7 in the PSDP schools at baseline.
During round 1 (2003-2005), sample respondents were still mainly teenagers and few were
active in the labor market; the subsequent survey rounds collected between 2007 and 2019
are the focus of this study. From the start, KLPS enumerators have traveled throughout
Kenya and beyond to interview respondents (Appendix Figure A.2). The spread of mobile
phones in Kenya during the study period has greatly facilitated tracking, and as a result,
the effective tracking rate has remained high across KLPS rounds (Appendix Table A.1).5
In KLPS-4, 87% were found and 83.9% surveyed among those still alive (Panel A, column
1). Rates are similar and not statistically significantly different across the treatment and
control groups, and the same holds by gender (columns 4-6) and among those above and
below median age (specifically, baseline age 12, Table A.2). Notably, rates are similarly high
and balanced in earlier rounds.6 In all, 86% of the KLPS sample was surveyed at least once
   4. Rates this high are also found in some other African settings (Pullan et al. 2014).
   5. The effective tracking rate is calculated as a fraction of those found, or not found but searched for during
intensive tracking, with weights adjusted appropriately, in a manner analogous to the approach in the U.S.
Moving To Opportunity study (Orr et al. 2003; Kling, Liebman, and Katz 2007), and Baird et al. (2016).
   6. A representative subsample of respondents were visited again in KLPS-3 for the consumption expen-
ditures module; the effective tracking rate is lower in this subsample (74.7%, Panel C), though rates are
balanced across treatment arms. The survey rate among those still alive in KLPS-2 is 83.9% (Panel D).

during the 10, 15 or 20 year rounds.
    Two other cross-cutting experiments are relevant for the analysis. First, in 2001 the NGO
required cost-sharing contributions from parents in a randomly selected half of the Group 1
and Group 2 schools, reducing deworming drug take-up from 75% to 18% (Appendix Figure
A.1); Group 3 schools received free deworming treatment in 2001. In 2002-2003, the NGO
again provided free deworming in all 75 schools (Kremer and Miguel 2007). We estimate the
effect of this temporary reduction in deworming on later outcomes. Second, in early 2009,
approximately 1,500 individuals in the KLPS sample additionally took part in a vocational
training voucher RCT prior to the start of the KLPS-3, and a subset of these also took
part in a randomized cash grant program prior to KLPS-4; 1,070 of these individuals were
randomly selected to receive a training voucher and/or cash grant. To focus the present
analysis on deworming impacts, and avoid possible interactions with other programs, these
individuals are dropped from the analysis for survey rounds after their assignment to the
other treatments.7 The randomly assigned voucher and cash control group (non-recipient)
individuals are retained throughout, and given greater weight in the econometric analysis to
maintain the representativeness of the original PSDP sample.


1.2     Estimation strategy
The analytical approach builds on Baird et al. (2016) and follows our pre-analysis plan
(PAP) (Baird et al. 2017). We exploit the PSDP’s experimental research design, namely,
that the program exogenously provided individuals in treatment schools (Groups 1 and 2)
two to three additional years of deworming. We focus on intention-to-treat (ITT) estimates
for two main reasons: first, since treatment compliance was relatively high, and second,
because previous research shows that untreated individuals within treatment communities
experienced gains (Miguel and Kremer 2004), complicating estimation of treatment effects
on the treated (TOT) within schools.
    The analysis focuses on two main approaches, namely: i) pooled regressions that use
data from KLPS rounds 2, 3 and 4 to estimate the overall long-run deworming effects 10 to
20 years after treatment, and ii) regressions using only KLPS-4, the longest-term follow-up.
These two approaches, as well as the main outcome measures, were pre-specified in Baird
et al. (2017) prior to conducting any analyses on the KLPS-4 data. The first approach has
the advantage of utilizing all possible data, including information on the vocational training
and cash grant recipients (who are dropped from the later rounds, as noted above), and is
  7. Specifically, vocational training voucher winners are dropped from both the KLPS rounds 3 and 4
analysis, and cash grant winners dropped from round 4; those interventions are studied in separate work.
The results below are robust to including these voucher and grant winners in the analysis, see Appendix A.


                                                    6
our focus here, with the KLPS-4 only results presented in the Appendix.
   The dependent variable Yijt is an outcome for individual i in original PSDP school j as
measured in survey round t:

                                                               1
                           Yijt “ α ` λ1 Tj ` λ2 Cj ` λ3 Pj ` Xij,0 β ` εijt .                             (1)

The outcome is a function of Tj P t0, 1u, the assigned deworming program treatment status
of the individual’s school. The pre-specified main coefficient of interest is λ1 , which captures
gains accruing to individuals in the 50 treatment schools relative to the 25 control schools.
Since deworming was assigned by school rather than at the individual level, some of the
gains in treatment schools are likely due to within-school externalities. This is an attractive
coefficient to focus on since it is a lower bound on the overall effect of deworming in the
presence of cross-school treatment externalities, as shown in Baird et al. (2016).8
    The vector Xij,0 of individual and school covariates includes baseline school character-
istics (average test score, population, number of students within 6 km, and administrative
zone indicators), baseline individual characteristics (gender and grade), indicators for the
KLPS survey calendar month, wave and round, and an indicator for the vocational training
and cash grant control group. Estimates are weighted to maintain representativeness with
the baseline PSDP population, taking into account the sampling for KLPS, the two-stage
tracking methodology, and inclusion in the vocational training and cash grant program. Fi-
nally, εijt is the error term clustered at the school level, allowing for correlation in outcomes
both across individuals in those schools and across survey rounds.
    We consider two secondary sources of exogenous variation in exposure to deworming,
namely, the 2001 cost-sharing school indicator, Cj P t0, 1u, and the proportion of students
in neighboring schools within 6 km that received deworming, Pj P r0, 1s, which we call local
deworming saturation. While not the main focus, Appendix B presents evidence on their
effects on outcomes. Conceptually, we expect (and find) λ2 to generally have a sign opposite
to that estimated for λ1 (since cost-sharing reduced treatment). While we expect λ3 to have
the same sign as λ1 , in practice few estimates are significant, and we cannot reject that there
is no relationship between the sign of the local saturation effect and the direct deworming
effect. Baird et al. (2016) analyzed interactions between treatment and local saturation, and
non-linearities in saturation, but cannot reject that Tj and Pj are additively separable and
enter linearly; we thus use a similarly parsimonious specification here.9
   8. In the presence of within-school epidemiological externalities, we cannot separately identify the effects
of individual treatment versus schoolmates’ deworming status. We can, however, identify the aggregate
school-level effect, and thus classify all individuals in treatment schools as “treated” in the analysis.
   9. Note that the bound proven in Baird et al. (2016) is still valid, albeit looser, if the geographic spread



                                                      7
    We present results for the entire sample and broken out by gender and respondent age
(namely, baseline age greater than 12), as mentioned in the pre-analysis plan.10 We interact
an indicator for females (baseline age ą 12) with the main explanatory variables in equation
1, and use the resulting estimates to construct gender-specific (cohort-specific) effects.


2      Main Results
Here we present treatment effect estimates on adult living standards, earnings, labor market
outcomes, and residential choice.11


2.1     Impacts on living standards
All KLPS round 4 (20 year follow-up) respondents and a representative subset of one sixth of
round 3 (15 year) respondents were administered a detailed consumption expenditure module
featuring questions on over 150 distinct items. It is often argued that the resulting measure
of consumption may more accurately capture total household income (and living standards)
than direct income measures in settings like rural Kenya. In the PAP, we specified that per
capita household consumption expenditures would be one of two main outcomes; the other
is total respondent earnings (presented in the next subsection). We present results for both
in constant 2017 USD PPP, and trim the top 1% of observations (as pre-specified) to reduce
the influence of outliers. We present real values below that account for urban-rural price
differences, based on regular price surveys we collected in multiple Kenyan regions and cities
(including Nairobi and Mombasa).
    Deworming treatment has a positive impact on total household per capita consumption
expenditures between 15 to 20 years after treatment: pooling KLPS rounds 3 and 4, the
estimated effect is USD PPP 305 (s.e. 159, p-value ă 0.10), a 14% increase relative to
of epidemiological externalities over time means that even “pure control” (i.e., Tj “ 0, Pj “ 0) schools are
subject to some spillovers. In particular, those whose infection intensity falls due to cross-school externalities
could themselves generate positive spillovers for other nearby schools, and so on. While such effects may
fade over time, no school in the study area of roughly 15 by 40 km can definitively be considered a “pure
control”, making meaningful long-run cross-school spillover effects less likely.
  10. Baird et al. (2016) show that those older than 12 at baseline experienced larger gains in terms of hours
worked, meals eaten, and non-agricultural earnings, a finding they attribute to the fact that these individuals
– who were at least 22 by KLPS-2 – had largely completed their schooling while younger individuals had not.
The hypothesis that differential age effects were driven by school enrollment patterns led us to postulate in
the PAP that there would be only minimal age differences in impacts by KLPS-4, as only 3% of the sample
was still enrolled in school then. We show that there remain meaningful cohort differences in treatment
effects in rounds 3 and 4, and discuss explanations below.
  11. Baird et al. (2019) pre-specifies other outcome domains that are the subject of ongoing data collection,
e.g., health, marriage, fertility, etc., and will be the focus of future research.



                                                        8
the control mean of USD PPP 2156 (Table 1, Panel A, column 1). A shift to the right
in the distribution of consumption is visually apparent (Appendix Figure A.3, Panel A).
Estimated effects by round are presented in Appendix Figure A.4 (Panel A). In the 20 year
data, treatment group individuals report a 10% increase in consumption (USD PPP 199,
s.e. 130, Table A.3, column 1). We find positive point estimates on sub-categories, including
both food and non-food consumption (see Layvant, Miguel, and Walker (2020)).
    Effects on consumption are larger in magnitude for male (USD PPP 513, p-value ă 0.10)
than female respondents (USD PPP 89) in both absolute and percentage terms (Panel A,
cols. 2 and 3), although the gender difference is not significant at traditional levels. Women
also have far lower average consumption, a pattern mirrored for all living standards and labor
market measures, and likely indicative of the limited economic opportunities open to many
women in Kenya.12 Consumption effects are also far larger for older individuals (those older
than 12 at baseline, who were typically 32 to 36 years old by KLPS-4), at USD PPP 886 (col.
4, p-valueă 0.01), an effect that remains significant at traditional levels accounting for the
false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment (Anderson 2008). Note that average living standards
(in the control group) are considerably higher for younger than older individuals (col. 5),
which likely at least partially reflects rapidly rising schooling levels in western Kenya in the
years following the launch of the PSDP (Appendix Table A.10, Panel C).


2.2    Impacts on earnings and other labor outcomes
The second pre-specified main outcome measure, total individual earnings, includes the
sum of earnings in the past year in wage employment (across all jobs), non-agricultural
self-employment profits (for all businesses), and farming profits, including in subsistence
agriculture. Note that those without any reported earnings in the last year are included in
the analysis as zeros. To be sure we are focusing on individual labor productivity, we first only
include farming profits in activities (e.g., growing a particular crop) for which the respondent
reported providing all household labor hours. This measure thus misses agricultural profits
derived from activities to which the respondent contributed jointly with other household
members. The data indicate that 70% of agricultural activities are in fact conducted jointly
with others, making it challenging to confidently assess individual agricultural productivity;
this is a well-known concern in development economics. We later present a measure of
total household income per capita that includes all household agricultural profits as well as
earnings generated by the respondent and other adult household members.
    Across the 10 to 20 year follow-up rounds, individual earnings are USD PPP 80 (s.e.
 12. Gender differences in reporting or household structure could also potentially contribute to these gaps.



                                                     9
76) higher in the deworming treatment group (Table 1, Panel B, column 1). This estimate
corresponds to a 6.5% increase in earnings. The estimated treatment effect is quite stable
across across survey round 2 (USD PPP 87), round 3 (USD PPP 83) and round 4 (USD
PPP 85, see Appendix Figure A.4), although none are statistically significant. The effect
falls as a percentage of the control mean across rounds, as average earnings rise over time.
The increase in the confidence interval surrounding estimates from rounds 2 through 4 also
appear likely to be driven by the growth in both the mean and variability of earnings as
individuals move into their prime working years.
    As with consumption, estimated effects are larger for males (USD PPP 118) than females
(USD PPP 41, cols. 2 and 3), though this difference is also not significant. Average individual
earnings are nearly three times larger for males than females, again highlighting women’s
labor market disadvantages. Earnings gains are far larger for older (USD PPP 258, p-
valueă 0.05) than younger (USD PPP -75) individuals, and once again the effect for the
older group remains significant when the FDR multiple testing adjustment is applied.
    Effects on the narrow measure of individual reported farming profits are close to zero, but
as noted above, these exclude most household agricultural activity. In contrast, there is a
sizeable deworming effect on total household earnings per capita (only collected in KLPS-4),
at USD PPP 239 (p-value ă 0.10, Panel C, col. 1), and this effect is reassuringly similar in
magnitude to the estimated impact on total household consumption per capita in round 4
(USD PPP 199, Appendix Table A.3). Total household earnings gains are again concentrated
among males (USD PPP 439, p-value ă 0.10, col. 3) and older individuals (USD PPP 565,
p-value ă 0.05, col. 4).13
    There are meaningful changes in other labor market outcomes. Log annual earnings
increase by 9 log points among those with non-zero earnings, and the likelihood that indi-
viduals have non-zero earnings rises by 2 percentage points (p-value ă 0.10, Table 2, Panel
A, col. 1). Gains in both wage earnings and self-employed profits appear to be contribut-
ing to the overall effect, and individual earnings per hour also increases, by USD PPP 0.14
(p-value ă 0.10), or 13%. Patterns are similar in the KLPS round 4 data (Appendix Table
A.4). Treatment individuals live in households with roughly 13% greater wealth per capita
(collected in KLPS-4), although this effect is not significant at traditional levels. For most
measures, gains are meaningfully larger among males and older individuals (cols. 2-3).
    There are also shifts in the nature and sector of employment. While total labor supply
(hours worked) increases only slightly, if at all, in the treatment group (1.04 hours, s.e. 0.66,
  13. The FDR adjustment is not presented in Panel C since the total household earnings measure was not
one of the two pre-specified primary outcomes. If the FDR adjustment is carried out across the six λ1
coefficient estimates in columns 4-5 across the three panels, all three estimates for the older subgroup are
significant with q-value ă 0.05.


                                                    10
Table 2, Panel B, col. 1), there is a significant increase in hours worked in non-agricultural
employment (1.99 hours, p-value ă 0.01), concentrated among males (2.77 hours, p-value
ă 0.01, col. 2) and older individuals (2.24 hours, p-value ă 0.05, col. 3). Some of this shift
is likely related to the substantial increase in urban residence, which rises by 4 percentage
points on a base of 45 percent (p-value ă 0.05), or 9%; note that roughly one third of urban
migrants live in Nairobi, and many others live in Mombasa or other large cities.14 In contrast
to Baird et al. (2016), there is no significant change in employment in manufacturing or other
broad job categories (among wage workers) overall or for males or older individuals when
pooling rounds 2, 3 and 4 (Panel B) or round 4 alone (Appendix Table A.4).


2.3     Heterogeneous effects and mechanisms
The concentration of deworming effects among males and those older than 12 at baseline is
notable. Here we briefly discuss potential explanations for this heterogeneity, and what it
suggests about the mechanisms underlying long-run impacts.
    It is puzzling that females show fewer economic benefits than males since they experience
larger gains in schooling attainment, test scores, and self-reported health than males (Baird
et al. 2016 and Appendix Table A.11, Panel B). A possible explanation is that these human
capital gains alone may be insufficient in a context where many women face important
constraints and fewer economic opportunities than men (USAID 2020). For instance, KLPS
sample women spend roughly three times more hours than men doing household chores
and more than twice as much time providing childcare, and their participation in the non-
agricultural labor force is far lower (Appendix Table A.10, Panel C).
    The larger estimated gains among older participants may also be surprising at first given
an intuitive sense that younger children might gain more from human capital investments,
but note that all sample individuals are already outside of hypothesized “critical” windows
of early childhood development (Appendix Table A.10, Panel A). One piece of evidence
that could help explain the age pattern is the finding that deworming led to larger human
capital gains among older individuals. Older individuals in the control group have lower
levels of schooling than younger individuals (Appendix Table A.10, Panel C),15 but the
deworming effect for the older group is +0.45 years of schooling (s.e. 0.18, p-value ă 0.05,
Appendix Table A.11, Panel B), while for younger individuals it is closer to zero (+0.04
years). While schooling gains alone are not sufficient to guarantee later labor market benefits
– as demonstrated by the experience of females – they are plausibly driving some of the long-
 14. Urban residence was included as an outcome in the later Baird et al. (2019) PAP, as we collect more a
more detailed migration history as part of ongoing survey modules relative to the data utilized in this paper.
 15. This reflects the rapid increase in schooling over the decade following the start of PSDP.


                                                     11
run gains in the older group.
    Since deworming was assigned at the school level, changes in social networks could also
be a channel. We find that older individuals in the treatment group are indeed more likely
to learn of a job through a primary school classmate (+6 percentage points on a base of 13%,
p-value ă 0.05, Appendix Table A.11), suggesting this could also be a partial explanation.
    A more speculative explanation is that the level of deworming treatment is playing a role.
While the average difference in assigned years of deworming between treatment and control
schools is the same for younger and older cohorts (Appendix Table A.10), the distributions
are different, and in particular the average years of assigned treatment in the control group
is far higher among younger individuals (Appendix Table A.11), as many older control group
students graduate from (or leave) primary school before receiving any deworming (Appendix
Figure A.5, Panels B and C). If the marginal benefit of deworming is declining with each
additional year of treatment (leading to a concave functional form), this could lead treatment
effects to be larger among the older subgroup. For the primary consumption per-capita
outcome, treatment effects are (reassuringly) monotonically increasing with additional years
of deworming treatment assignment, and there is some evidence of concavity, especially at
greater than 4 years (Panel A). While promising, this explanation remains tentative given
limited epidemiological evidence on the deworming dose response function.
    We are also able to rule out several alternative explanations for differential treatment
effects, see Appendix C. The most obvious explanation for heterogeneous effects would be
differential baseline worm infection levels across subgroups, or varying degrees of infection
reduction, but we do not find meaningful differences along these lines by gender or age
(Appendix Tables A.10, A.11). Nor did Baird et al. (2016) estimate significant differences
in impacts as a function of baseline local area infection levels, although this latter analysis
is somewhat statistically under-powered. The differential gains by age do not appear to
be due to life cycle or age-at-survey explanations, but instead are driven by cohort effects
(Appendix Table A.9). There are differences in average levels of parental education across
older and younger cohorts, but little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects by level of
parental education (Appendix Table A.8).


3    Rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming
Here we present deworming cost-effectiveness estimates (see Appendix D for details).
   The social net present value (NPV) of providing free deworming treatment takes into
account the cost of deworming medication, the cost of additional schooling resulting from
deworming (Baird et al. 2016), and economic gains measured via consumption or earnings.

                                              12
Figure 1 displays these components graphically, where the direct costs are illustrated in
the darkest gray in the first years. We use 2018 deworming drug costs, while schooling
costs come from multiplying secondary schooling rate increases (Baird et al. 2016) by recent
Kenyan teacher salary figures (Nyanchama 2018; Oduor 2017). On the benefit side, we use
λ1t estimates for consumption and earnings generated from our pooled specification across
KLPS rounds 2, 3, and 4. For earnings, we assume these gains start 10 years after deworming
treatment, roughly coinciding with entry into adulthood and KLPS round 2. Since we do not
have consumption data until KLPS-3, we conservatively assume that the average estimated
effect from KLPS 3 and 4 only pertains during the period from 15 to 25 years after treatment.
We also make the conservative assumption, presented graphically in Figure 1, that effects last
for five years, roughly the time between survey rounds, and fall to zero five years after round
4 (at t “ 25).16 The main estimates use an annual discount rate of 10%, the median real
interest rate in Kenya during 1998-2018, which is conservative if other potential funders (e.g.,
international donors) face lower rates. We also compute the internal rate of return (IRR).
The dotted horizontal line in Figure 1 shows the magnitude of average annual treatment
effects needed to attain an annualized IRR of 10% is USD PPP 7.99. We also calculate the
NPV and IRR of additional government tax revenue generated by deworming by multiplying
earnings or consumption gains by the average Kenyan tax rate.
    The estimated deworming consumption and earnings gains are both an order of magni-
tude larger than the USD PPP 7.99 needed to attain the social IRR of 10% noted above
(Figure 1, Appendix Table A.12), and are also far larger than the gains needed to attain
a fiscal IRR of 10% (USD PPP 29.12 and 48.21, respectively, Appendix Table A.12). The
social and fiscal NPV estimates are positive for both the consumption and earnings effects,
and for annual discount rates of 10%. In the most conservative scenario, focusing on earnings
gains and the 10% discount over 25 years, the social NPV is USD PPP 230.71 and the fiscal
NPV is USD PPP 16.74 (Panel B). The implied social and fiscal IRR estimates in this case
are 40.7% and 15.5%, with values higher if we allow gains to persist beyond year 25 (Panel
C). If we focus on consumption and consider gains out to 25 years, the social and fiscal IRR
estimates are 36.7% and 19.6%, respectively.
 16. This calculation is also conservative by not including direct child health benefits or any persistent health
gains, and ignoring cross-school externalities among sample individuals and other community members (Ozier
2018).

4     Discussion
This study provides novel causal evidence on the long-run effects of child health investments
on adult living standards and labor market outcomes. Individuals who received deworming
as children experience substantial increases in adult consumption, hourly earnings, non-
agricultural employment, and urban residence. These findings add to growing evidence that
the Primary School Deworming Project had meaningful positive effects on recipients (Miguel
and Kremer 2004; Baird et al. 2016). Even ignoring spillovers and making other conservative
assumptions, the social rate of return appears to be very high.
    From a policy perspective, it is important to consider external validity. Intestinal worm
infections are widespread globally, with high infection rates in many parts of Africa, South
Asia, and Latin America, and even a possible (and unfortunate) resurgence in the rural
U.S. South (McKenna et al. 2017). The ubiquity of the infections suggests that this study’s
findings have relevance for many other settings. At the same time, the degree to which
school-based mass deworming generates positive long-run benefits is plausibly linked to the
extent of infection. The study setting featured high baseline infection prevalence, at over
90%, and a large share of children with intense infections. The PSDP intervention also began
during the strong 1997-1998 El Niño–Southern Oscillation event, which brought torrential
rains to the region, and the related deterioration in hygiene and sanitation likely contributed
to elevated worm infection levels. Deworming treatment impacts would presumably have
been smaller had worm infection levels been lower.
    The analysis does not resolve the issue of exactly why and through what channels de-
worming affected adult outcomes. Since changes to health, education, social activity among
schoolmates, marital choices, and income levels may all affect each other in various direc-
tions, the impacts should not be interpreted strictly as all reflecting deworming’s direct
health effects, but rather are likely to be the result of a cumulative process of interaction
among these factors.17 Our examination of heterogeneous treatment effects by gender and
age sheds some light on the importance of certain factors, but cannot definitively adjudicate
between channels. Further research is needed to understand how institutional and contextual
factors interact with child health investments, to better understand mechanisms (Almond,
Currie, and Duque 2018). Another area of ongoing debate is whether child health and nu-
trition investments must fall within a “critical” early period of development for long-term
gains to accrue (Bundy et al. 2018). Our findings indicate that even health programs fo-
cused on school-age children can yield substantial benefits, consistent with recent US findings
 17. To be clear, we do not expect that child deworming treatment would have a direct impact on respon-
dents’ adult worm loads decades later, given worms’ relatively short average lifespan in the human body.

(Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2020).
    As most study participants have already also become parents themselves, another inter-
esting future direction will be to investigate possible deworming effects on the next genera-
tion. The economic impacts we document suggest that such effects are plausible; it is also
possible that the education gains experienced by women could improve life outcomes for their
children. The existence of any inter-generational benefits would further bolster deworming’s
cost-effectiveness.

   Notes: Panel A reports annual per-capita total consumption, calculated as the sum of the monetary value of goods consumed
  by the household through purchase, gift, barter, or home production in the last 12 months, divided by the number of household
  members. The consumption/expenditure module was administered to a subset of the sample during round 3 and the full
  sample during round 4. Consumption is adjusted for urban-rural price differences for respondents living in Nairobi and
  Mombasa. Panel B reports annual individual earnings, calculated as the sum of wage employment across all jobs; non-
  agricultural self-employment profit across all business; and individual farming profit, defined as net profit generated from
  non-crop and crop farming activities for which the respondent provided all reported household labor hours and was the main
  decision-maker within the last 12 months. Wage earnings and self-employment profits were collected in KLPS rounds 2, 3
  and 4; agricultural profits were collected in KLPS 3 and 4. Panel C reports annual per-capita household earnings, calculated
  as the sum of wage employment earnings, self-employment profits, and agricultural profits across all household members,
  divided by the number of household members. Household earnings are only available in KLPS-4. All outcomes are converted
  to constant 2017 USD at PPP rates, and the top 1% of observations are trimmed. Treatment is an indicator variable equal
  to 1 for PSDP Worm Groups 1 and 2, which received an additional 2.4 years of deworming on average compared to Group 3.
  Columns (2) through (5) report estimates separately by gender and age at baseline (older than 12, 12 or younger). Columns
  (2) and (3) report estimates for Female and Male are constructed from a single regression including treatment-female, cost-
  sharing-female, and saturation-female interaction terms. Columns (4) and (5) also report results from a single regression,
  using an indicator for those older than 12 at baseline and analagous interaction terms to Columns (2) and (3). The pre-
  analysis plan (PAP) specified annual per-capita consumption and annual individual earnings as primary outcomes. Following
  the PAP, the FDR adjustment in column (1) is carried out across the two λ1 coefficient estimates from Panels A and B of
  column (1). The FDR adjustment in columns (2) and (3) are carried out across the four λ1 coefficient estimates from Panels
  A and B of columns (2) and (3). Similarly, the FDR adjustment in columns (4) and (5) are carried out across the four λ1
  coefficient estimates from Panels A and B of columns (4) and (5). Covariates follow Baird et al. (2016) and include controls
  for baseline 1998 primary school population, geographic zone of the school, survey wave and month of interview, a female
  indicator variable, baseline 1998 school grade fixed effects, the average school test score on the 1996 Busia District mock
  exams, total primary school pupils within 6 km, and a cost-sharing school indicator. Those treated in a separate vocational
  training intervention (VocEd) which occurred prior to KLPS-3 are dropped from the KLPS-3 and KLPS-4 sample. Those
  treated in a separate small grant intervention (SCY) which occurred after KLPS-3 are dropped from the KLPS-4 sample.
  Observations are weighted to be representative of the original PSDP population, and include KLPS population weights, SCY
  and VocEd control group weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights. Standard errors are clustered at the 1998 school
  level. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct.

 Notes: This table reports treatment effects for numerous outcomes, using data pooled across KLPS-2, KLPS-3, and KLPS-4 unless otherwise
indicated. Column (1) reports the overall treatment effect (λ1 from Equation (1)) for the full sample, while columns (2) and (3) report
estimated treatment effects for males and those older than 12 at baseline, respectively. Columns (4) and (5) report the full sample control
mean and number of observations for each outcome, respectively. Variables in Panel A are converted to 2017 USD at PPP and trimmed at
the top 1%. Log annual individual earnings is based on annual individual earnings from Table 1. Wage earnings, self-employment profits and
farming profits are annual amounts. Hourly earnings is calculated by dividing annual individual earnings by 52, divided by the total hours
worked across all activities during the last week, among those with at least 10 work hours across all activities. Per-capita household wealth
is calculated as the sum of total household durable asset ownership and livestock ownership, divided by the number of household members.
Urban residence is an indicator variable coded as ”1” for living in a non-rural area, which includes both towns and cities. Hours worked
variables are based on the total hours worked within the last 7 days; hours worked in each job, within job categories (i.e., wage-earning,
self-employment, and farming), and across all jobs are top-coded at 100 hours per week. Employed variables are indicator variables coded
as ”1” for those with wage employment in a given sector. See the PAP report (Layvant, Miguel, and Walker 2020) for additional details on
variable construction, results for female and younger respondents, and statistical significance levels. Weights and control variables included
in the regression are defined in the notes for Table 1. Standard errors are clustered at the 1998 school level. * denotes significance at 10
pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct.

     Notes: This figure presents the costs and benefits of deworming over time, and calculated social internal rate of return (IRR). Costs and benefits in
     the figure are reported in 2017 USD PPP terms. For additional details and alternative assumptions, see Table A.12 and Appendix D.
     Costs: Total costs include the direct cost of providing mass school-based deworming from the NGO Deworm the World plus the costs of additional
     teachers, based on documented educational gains and the approach of Baird et al. (2016). We calculate teacher costs as average educational gains
     per student per year as a result of deworming (from Baird et al. (2016)) times annual teacher salary costs per pupil (USD PPP 267.88, based on an
     estimate of annual teacher salary (USD PPP $12,055) from the upper tier of monthly teacher salaries from (Nyanchama 2018) and (Oduor 2017) of
     and a pupil-teacher ratio of 45, as in Baird et al. (2016)). On average, from 1999 to 2007, students attended school for an additional 0.15 years.
     Benefits: We assume no earnings gains in the first 10 years after receiving deworming medication. We use the estimate of treatment effects for an-
     nual individual earnings measured 10, 15 and 20 years after the start of deworming and pooled across rounds (λ1t from Table 1, Panel B). We as-
     sume no per-capita consumption gains in the first 15 years after receiving deworming medication. As for earnings, we use the estimate of annual
     per-capita consumption expenditures measured 15 and 20 years after the start of deworming and pooled across rounds from Table 1, Panel A. For
     both earnings and per-capita consumption, we assume zero gains after the last observed five-year period (25 years after receiving treatment).
     Calculations: The dotted line at USD PPP 7.99 shows the average treatment effect (λ1t ) needed from year 10 to year 25 in order to generate a
     Social IRR of 10%. A return of 10% represents the median real interest rate from 1998 to 2018 (based on Kenyan government bond rates and infla-
     tion rates). The annualized Social IRR for earnings gains is 40.7% and for consumption gains is 36.7%. Assuming a discount rate of 10%, the net
     present value (NPV) from observed earnings gains is USD PPP 230.71, and for consumption gains is USD PPP 467.90.

Notes: This figure plots treatment effects by survey round for annual per-capita consumption and annual
individual earnings. Consumption expenditures were not collected in KLPS-2, and are only collected for
a representative subset of the KLPS-3 sample. See Table 1 for full details on construction of consumption
and earnings. Observations are weighted to be representative of the original PSDP population, and ac-
count for KLPS population weights, SCY and VocEd control group weights, and KLPS intensive weights.

      Notes: Panel A plots the estimated treatment effects for annual per-capita consumption by years of assigned deworming. Years of assigned de-
      worming is constructed as the total number of years the respondent would be expected to attend a school with free deworming medication, based
      on the PSDP group (Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3), the standard at baseline (1998), and assuming normal grade progression. Years in which
      schools were assigned to cost-sharing for deworming medicine are not counted due to the limited take-up (see Kremer and Miguel (2007) for ad-
      ditional details on take-up in cost-sharing schools). See Table 1 for full details on construction of annual per-capita consumption. Panels B and C
      plot the years of free deworming by treatment and control groups for those who are older than 12 at baseline and those 12 or younger at baseline,
      respectively. The light grey are those in the treatment group and the dark grey are those in the control group.

 Notes: Columns (1) to (3) present control means for indicator variables for respondent found, deceased, or surveyed,
respectively. Column (4) presents regression results of these indicator variables regressed on an indicator for PSDP
treatment. Columns (5) and (6) present regression results for female and male subsamples, respectively. The
sample includes all PSDP individuals found in initial tracking or placed under intensive tracking (known as the
attrition sample), and only includes individuals in the PSDP sample. Those treated in a separate vocational training
intervention (VocEd) which occurred prior to KLPS-3 are dropped from the KLPS-3 and KLPS-4 attrition samples.
Those treated in a separate small grant intervention (SCY) which occurred during KLPS-3 are dropped from the
KLPS-4 attrition sample. Observations are weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and
include KLPS population weights, SCY and VocEd control group weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights.

   Notes: Columns (1) to (3) present control means for indicator variables for respondent found, deceased, or surveyed,
  respectively restricted to those with available data on the individual’s age at baseline. Column (4) presents regression
  results of these indicator variables regressed on an indicator for PSDP treatment. Columns (5) and (6) present
  regression results for older and younger subsamples, respectively. Older includes those that are older than 12 years
  at baseline and younger includes those that are 12 or younger years at baseline. Age at baseline is missing for 173
  individuals in the KLPS-4 attrition sample, 114 individuals in the KLPS-3 I Module attrition sample, 14 individuals
  in the KLPS-3 E Module attrition sample, and 119 individuals in the KLPS-2 attrition sample. The sample includes
  all PSDP individuals found in initial tracking or placed under intensive tracking (known as the attrition sample), and
  only includes individuals in the PSDP sample. Those treated in a separate vocational training intervention (VocEd)
  which occurred prior to KLPS-3 are dropped from the KLPS-3 and KLPS-4 attrition samples. Those treated in a
  separate small grant intervention (SCY) which occurred during KLPS-3 are dropped from the KLPS-4 attrition sample.
  Observations are weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and include KLPS population weights,
  SCY and VocEd control group weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights. Standard errors are clustered at the
  1998 school level. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct.

        Notes: This table shows the treatment, cost sharing, and saturation effect from Equation 1 when including a continuous variable on the parents’ average education and interaction terms
       with parents’ average education on annual per-capita consumption, annual individual earnings, and annual per-capita household earnings (separately for the full sample, subsample of males,
       and subsample of those older than 12 at baseline). Parents’ average education is the average of the highest years of schooling attained by the parents of the KLPS respondent. Parents’
       highest educational attainment is first taken from KLPS-1 and then supplemented with KLPS-2, KLPS-3, and finally KLPS-4 I-Module Wave 1 data when unavailable from a previous round.
       Parents’ average education is demeaned across the full sample. See Table 1 and the PAP report (Layvant, Miguel, and Walker 2020) for notes on covariates. The Joint F-Test (p-value) gives
       the p-value associated with an F-test on the joint significance of the treatment, cost-sharing, and saturation interaction coefficients against the null hypothesis that all three coefficients are
       jointly equal to zero. Observations are weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and include KLPS population weights, SCY and VocEd control group weights, and
       KLPS intensive tracking weights. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct.

         Notes: This table shows the treatment, cost sharing, and saturation effect from Equation 1 when interacting with the age of the
        KLPS respondent at the time of the survey. Columns (2), (4), and (6) include interaction terms with an indicator for being older than
        12 years at baseline. See Table 1 and the PAP report (Layvant, Miguel, and Walker 2020) for notes on covariates. Observations are
        weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and include KLPS population weights, SCY and VocEd control group
        weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights. * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and *** at 1 pct.

 Notes: Panel A shows the full KLPS sample mean (unless otherwise stated) of baseline summary statistics and Panels B and C show the control
mean for health outcomes and education and labor market outcomes, respectively. Columns (3) and (6) show the difference between females
and males, and older than 12 and 12 or younger at baseline, respectively. We define moderate-heavy infection according to the World Health
Organization (WHO) cutoffs for moderate to heavy worm infections, which are 100 eggs per gram (epg) for S. mansoni, 5000 epg for Roundworm,
                                                                                                                         ř4
2000 epg for Hookworm and 1000 epg for Whipworm. We denote mean intensity of infection for individual j as Infj “ k“1 ωk eggsjk in which
ωk is the inverse of the threshold for moderate to heavy infections for worm k, and EPG in the Kato-Katz test. The Z-intensity measure for
                                                                                                                          Infj ´µInf,1998
individual j is then computed by normalizing intensity of infection by the 1998 mean and standard deviation, that is Zj “    σInf,1998    . Average
Years of Parents’ Education is the average of the highest years of schooling attained by the parents of the KLPS respondent. Parents’ highest
educational attainment is first taken from KLPS-1 and then supplemented with KLPS-2, KLPS-3, and finally KLPS-4 I-Module Wave 1 data
when unavailable from a previous round. Years of Assigned Deworming is constructed as the total number of years the respondent would be
expected to attend a school with free deworming medication, based on the PSDP group (Group 1, Group 2, or Group 3), the standard at baseline
(1998), and assuming normal grade progression for KLPS-4 respondents. Years in which schools were assigned to cost-sharing for deworming
medicine are not counted due to the limited take-up (see Kremer and Miguel (2007) for additional details on take-up in cost-sharing schools).
Indicator for Self-Perceived Health Very Good uses KLPS-2 and KLPS-3 data. Years of Education by 2011 and Indicator for Any Secondary
School by 2011 uses KLPS-3 data. Learned of Any Job Through Primary Classmate, Indicator for Urban Residence, and Childcare Hours uses
KLPS-4 cross-sectional data. Learned of Any Job Through Primary Classmate is an indicator variable for whether a primary schoolmate ever
informed the respondent of a job opening, helped the respondent search for a job, or helped the respondent find a job and only includes data
from KLPS-4 E+ Wave 2. Childcare hours includes total hours spent doing childcare in the last 7 days even if overlapped with other tasks.
Chore Hours uses data from KLPS-3 and KLPS-4 and includes total hours spent doing household chores in the last 7 days excluding time spent
on childcare. Hours Worked - Non-Agriculture uses data from KLPS-2-4 and includes total hours worked in wage and self-employment in the
last 7 days. Observations are weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and include KLPS population weights, SCY and
VocEd control group weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights (where applicable). * denotes significance at 10 pct., ** at 5 pct., and ***
at 1 pct.

 Notes: Panel A reports heterogeneous treatment effects for various health outcomes, and Panel B reports heterogeneous treatment effects for
various education and labor market outcomes. See Table A.10 for full details on the construction of these outcomes. Treatment is an indicator
variable which equals 1 for PSDP Groups 1 and 2. Reported estimates for Female and Male are constructed from a single regression including
treatment-female, cost-sharing-female, and saturation-female interaction terms for all education and labor market outcomes, Years of Assigned
Deworming, and Indicator for Self-Perceived Health Very Good. Similarly, reported estimates for Older and Younger are calculated from a
single regression including an indicator for those older than 12 at baseline and interaction terms for treatment-older, cost-sharing-older, and
saturation-older for all education and labor market outcomes, Years of Assigned Deworming, and Indicator for Self-Perceived Health Very Good.
Any Moderate-Heavy Infections and Z-Score of Mean Intensity outcomes include treatment-female and treatment-older interaction terms for the
gender and age columns, respectively. See Table 1 and the PAP report (Layvant, Miguel, and Walker 2020) for notes on covariates. Covariates for
Any Moderate-Heavy Infections and Z-Score Mean Intensity outcomes exclude survey wave and month variables, as well the cost-sharing school
indicator. Observations are weighted to be representative of the original KLPS population, and include KLPS population weights, SCY and VocEd
control group weights, and KLPS intensive tracking weights. Standard errors clustered at the 1998 school level. * denotes significance at 10 pct.,

 Notes: This table presents results related to calculations of the costs and benefits of deworming following
Equation (2) in 2017 USD PPP. The social net present value (NPV) / internal rate of return (IRR) includes
the full earnings/consumption expenditure benefits, while the fiscal NPV/IRR includes only government tax
revenue benefits. Panel A calculates the minimum average gains (λ1t ) required to achieve a desired internal
rate of return r for alternative assumptions about the treatment effect timeframe. Panel B calculates the
social and fiscal NPV of observed labor market and living standard gains under varying assumptions of the
treatment effect timeframe and discount rates. Panel C calculates the social and fiscal IRR under using
observed earnings and consumption gains under each assumption of treatment effect timeframes. Deworming
costs include the direct cost of deworming medicine and the cost of additional schooling. See Figure 1
for additional details on the construction of the additional schooling costs. The benefits of deworming are
measured via annual per-capita consumption and annual individual earnings. Consumption expenditures are
measured 15 years (KLPS-3) and 20 years (KLPS-4) after the start of deworming and the effects are pooled
across rounds. For consumption, we assume no gains in the first 15 years after receiving the deworming
medication. Earnings are measured 10, 15 and 20 years after the start of deworming and effects are pooled
across rounds. We assume no gains in the first 10 years after receiving deworming medication. We consider
two cases for earnings and consumption gains after 20 years: gains disappear after the last observed five-year
period (25 years after receiving treatment, columns 1 and 3), or persist through the end of one’s working life
(50 years after receiving treatment, columns 2 and 4).

B    Secondary sources of variation in deworming

We present results for the effect of the two secondary sources of variation, cost-sharing and
local treatment saturation, on the same outcomes reported in this paper (Appendix Table
A.7). There is ample evidence that cost-sharing had a negative effect on later outcomes: the
estimated λ2t effect has the opposite sign of the direct λ1t effect for 19 of the 21 outcomes
in this paper (and 43 of the 54 pre-specified outcomes), as predicted; this is extremely
unlikely to occur by chance (p-value ă 0.001). To illustrate, for the primary consumption per
capita measure, the coefficient estimate on the cost-sharing indicator is sizeable although not
significant, at USD PPP -136 (s.e., 144), or -6.3%. We further explore the extent of the cost-
sharing effect, as well as the additional variation induced across Groups 1 and 2, in Appendix
Figure A.5. There is a large and visually apparent marginal effect of each additional year of
subsidized deworming treatment assignment for the per-capita consumption measure (Panel
A).
    In terms of the effect of local spillovers, few estimates are statistically significant, and we
cannot reject that there is no relationship between the sign of the local deworming saturation
effect (λ3t ) and the direct deworming effect: the two coefficient estimates have the same sign
(as predicted) for roughly half of all outcomes, providing little evidence that local treatment
spillovers generated long-run economic impacts. When estimating saturation effects of the
proportion of treatment schools within 4 km (as opposed to 6 km), saturation terms largely
remain insignificant, while treatment effects remain robust.


C    Discussion of heterogeneous effects and mechanisms

This section expands on the discussion of heterogeneity in deworming treatment effects in
Section 2.3, namely that effects are concentrated among males and those older than 12 at
baseline. Constraints on women’s labor market participation may play an important role in
the lack of labor market effects for females, despite larger schooling attainment and test score
gains than males. In addition to the childcare and chore work hours patterns highlighted in
our data, the 2020 USAID Kenya Gender Fact Sheet writes: “Limited control over benefits
from land and other resources constrains women’s successful participation in the economy,
particularly as producers and market actors. Women’s unpaid childcare and domestic work
limits women’s contribution in and benefit from productive activities, constrain their mo-
bility, and limit their access to market resources and information while participating in the
economy.” These challenges may be particularly stark for young women in a relatively poor
agrarian region like Busia given expectations around household work and childcare. While


                                              A-19
these are prime labor market years, they are also a period in which young women may have
high rates of childcare responsibilities; labor market participation could occur later, once all
children have reached primary school age. Ongoing research will further study marriage and
fertility patterns, parenting strategies and intergenerational effects.
    In terms of larger estimated gains among older participants (those older than 12 at
baseline), we are able to rule out that this is simply a life cycle or timing issue: as noted
above, by KLPS rounds 3 and 4, fewer than 3% of sample individuals are still enrolled in
school, and by that time even the younger sample individuals are prime-age workers in their
20’s or early 30’s. In addition, the data suggest differences are driven by cohort, rather
than age-at-survey, effects. In Appendix Table A.9, we use the data pooled across survey
rounds, and generate indicators for 5-year age bins corresponding to the respondent’s age
at the time of the survey round. We interact these with the treatment, cost-sharing and
saturation variables, and estimate two specifications: one including only the age at time
of survey variables (cols 1, 3 and 5), and the second bringing in interaction terms with
being older than 12 at baseline (a cohort effect, cols 2, 4 and 6). None of the treatment-
survey age interactions are significant for per-capita consumption, individual earnings and
per-capita household earnings when bringing in the cohort terms, while effects for per-capita
consumption and individual earnings are statistically significant. Only one treatment-survey
age coefficient is significant in the absence of the cohort terms.
    As noted in the main text, treatment group older individuals appear to have experienced
larger human capital gains. As background, by the time of the KLPS round 3 (15 year)
follow-up, when nearly all individuals had completed their schooling, older individuals had
attained substantially less schooling on average (8.7 years) than younger individuals (9.9
years). This reflects the rapid increase in schooling over the decade following the start
of PSDP, and especially in terms of increase secondary school enrollment: 31% of older
individuals had attained at least some secondary schooling, compared to a much higher 56%
among the younger group, again with pronounced gender gaps (see Appendix Table A.10,
Panel C). While schooling gains alone are not sufficient to drive later labor market benefits,
as demonstrated by the experience of sample females, they are plausibly playing some role
in driving long-run gains, at least for males in the older group. Another way of stating this
is that the pattern for younger individuals indicates that the deworming health investment
did not translate into additional human capital gains for the younger cohorts that were
already experiencing rapidly improving educational outcomes, highlighting the importance
of context in determining program treatment effects.
    Another dimension of heterogeneity that appears to be a promising explanation, at least
at first glance, is the difference in parental education between older individuals (whose par-


                                             A-20
ents received 6.7 years of school on average) and younger individuals (whose parents received
7.7). Yet there appears to be little evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects across chil-
dren with different levels of parental education across our main outcome measures, and this
holds overall and for age and gender subgroups (see Appendix Table A.8).


D    Rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming details

The estimated impacts of deworming on labor market outcomes, combined with other data,
allow us to estimate the internal financial rate of return and fiscal impacts of deworming
subsidies. The social net present value (NPV) of providing deworming subsidies takes into
account the cost of deworming medication, the cost of additional schooling resulting from
deworming (Baird et al. 2016), and economic gains measured via consumption or earnings.
We calculate the social NPV as follows:
                  t“2           ˆ         ˙t        t“9              ˆ         ˙t       t“50         ˆ         ˙t
                  ÿ                  1              ÿ                     1              ÿ                1
       NP V “ ´         SQpSq                  ´K         ∆Ēt pSq                  `          λ1t                  .   (2)
                  t“0
                                    1`r             t“0
                                                                         1`r            t“10
                                                                                                         1`r

    The first term captures the upfront cost of providing a deworming subsidy at level S ą 0
(relative to the case of no subsidies), calculated as the subsidy cost (S) times the take-up
at that subsidy level, QpSq. We focus on the free treatment case, and use PSDP project
data to compute this take-up level (Miguel and Kremer 2004; Kremer and Miguel 2007),
together with current estimates of per pupil mass deworming treatment costs (based on
2018 data provided by Deworm The World) of USD PPP 0.83 per year. Costs and benefits
are discounted at rate r per year. Figure 1 displays components of this equation graphically,
where the direct costs are illustrated in the darkest gray in the first years.
    The second term accounts for the fact that improved child health may lead the govern-
ment to accrue additional educational expenditures, for instance, if secondary schooling rates
increase, which Baird et al. (2016) find up to nine years after the start of treatment. Let K
capture the cost of an additional unit of schooling, and ∆Ēt pSq denote the average increase
in schooling due to deworming. These costs are represented by the dark gray section labeled
as teacher costs in Figure 1. We use recent figures on Kenyan secondary school teacher
salaries as estimates of K (Nyanchama 2018; Oduor 2017).
    The third term captures adult consumption or earnings gains, making use of the λ1t
estimates generated from the pooled specification using data for KLPS rounds 2, 3, and
4. For earnings, We assume these gains start 10 years after deworming treatment, roughly
coinciding with entry into adulthood and the KLPS round 2 data. For the consumption
measure, where we lack data for KLPS round 2, we conservatively assume that the average


                                                    A-21
estimated effect from KLPS 3 and 4 (pooled) only pertains during the period from 15 to 25
years after treatment. By ignoring the time before KLPS-2 (or KLPS-3 for consumption)
was collected, it underestimates gains due to any increased earnings prior to the survey.
Yet it misses any reduction in work hours due to substitution of school for work; however,
existing estimates of child labor productivity suggest these foregone earnings are likely to be
small (Udry 1996), nor are there significant effects on measured earnings in KLPS round 1.
     While we observe effects at 10, 15 and 20 years after deworming, we must make assump-
tions about the persistence of any earnings effects during the rest of individuals’ working
lives (to year t “ 50, which is roughly retirement age), as well as between rounds. A conser-
vative assumption, presented graphically in Figure 1, assumes that effects pertain during the
roughly five years between rounds, so that KLPS round 4 effects persist for another five years
through t “ 25, before falling to zero for all remaining working years (see columns 1 and 3 of
Table A.12). An alternative assumption allows for deworming treatment effects on earnings
to persist throughout individuals’ careers (t “ 50, columns 2 and 4). We focus on the more
conservative case, although it turns out that conclusions are similar under reasonable time
discount rates r in the range of 5 to 10% per year.
     This calculation is conservative in several ways: one could also include the direct health
benefits to children (in money-metric terms) that accrue during the deworming treatment
period. To be conservative, the main calculations below do not include these direct short-run
child health benefits, nor any persistent health gains, and thus are likely to underestimate
program returns. The analysis makes other conservative assumptions by ignoring benefits
from cross-school externalities for both sample individuals and other community members
(Ozier 2018).
     We also calculate the fiscal NPV, the NPV of additional government tax revenue. To
do so, we multiply the earnings gains by the the tax rate, τ . Kenyan taxes (mainly on
consumption) absorb roughly 16.6% of GDP so we set τ to 16.6%. Following Baird et
al. (2016), government expenditures are roughly 19.5% of GDP, and about 15% of government
expenditure is financed from donors, thus 0.195*0.85=0.166.
     The estimated λ1t effects, combined with these assumptions, below allow us to compute
the social internal rate of return (IRR), namely, the value of r that equates discounted costs
and benefits such that social N P V “ 0. The equation above also implies the magnitude
of deworming treatment effects needed to attain a given rate of return. As illustrated by
the dotted line in Figure 1, an average adult deworming treatment effect on yearly earnings
of USD PPP $7.99 is needed to attain an annualized internal rate of return of 10% (Table
A.12, Panel A). Ten percent corresponds to the median real interest rate in Kenya during
the 1998 to 2018 period (calculated based on Kenyan government bond and inflation rates),


                                             A-22
and thus larger gains would indicate that deworming is likely to be cost effective in Kenya;
see http://www.centralbank.go.ke/securities/bonds/manualresults.aspx and World
Bank Development Indicators for sources. This is a conservative assumption if other potential
funders of deworming subsidies (e.g., international organizations or private donors) face lower
interest rates; to attain an IRR of 5%, the annual earnings or consumption gain would need
to be just USD PPP 4.83 (Panel A).
    We next present cost-effectiveness results for the main outcome measures of consumption
and earnings, in Figure 1. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, the estimated deworming
consumption and earnings gains are both an order of magnitude larger than the USD PPP
7.99 needed to attain the social internal rate of return of 10% noted above. The estimated
consumption and earnings effects are both also far larger than the gains needed to attain a
fiscal IRR of 5 or 10% (USD PPP 29.12 and 48.21, respectively, Table A.12, Panel A). The
social and fiscal NPV estimates are positive for both the consumption and earnings effect
estimates, and for annual discount rates of both 5 and 10%. In the most conservative scenario,
focusing on earnings gains and the 10% discount over 25 years, the social NPV is USD PPP
230.71 and the fiscal NPV is USD PPP 16.74 (Panel B). The implied social and fiscal IRR
estimates in this case are 40.7% and 15.5%, with values higher if we allow deworming gains
to persist beyond year 25 (Panel C). If we focus on consumption and consider gains out to
25 years, the social and fiscal IRR estimates are 36.7% and 19.6%, respectively.
    The results imply that even miniscule earnings or consumption gains far smaller than
those observed in KLPS could justify subsidies for mass deworming given its very low cost.
