                                                ABSTRACT

This paper explores the power of personality traits both as predictors and as causes of academic and
economic success, health, and criminal activity. Measured personality is interpreted as a construct
derived from an economic model of preferences, constraints, and information. Evidence is reviewed
about the “situational specificity” of personality traits and preferences. An extreme version of the situationist
view claims that there are no stable personality traits or preference parameters that persons carry across
different situations. Those who hold this view claim that personality psychology has little relevance
for economics. The biological and evolutionary origins of personality traits are explored. Personality
measurement systems and relationships among the measures used by psychologists are examined.
The predictive power of personality measures is compared with the predictive power of measures of
cognition captured by IQ and achievement tests. For many outcomes, personality measures are just
as predictive as cognitive measures, even after controlling for family background and cognition. Moreover,
standard measures of cognition are heavily influenced by personality traits and incentives. Measured
personality traits are positively correlated over the life cycle. However, they are not fixed and can
be altered by experience and investment. Intervention studies, along with studies in biology and neuroscience,
establish a causal basis for the observed effect of personality traits on economic and social outcomes.
Personality traits are more malleable over the life cycle compared to cognition, which becomes highly
rank stable around age 10. Interventions that change personality are promising avenues for addressing
poverty and disadvantage.

1.   Introduction

 The power of cognitive ability in predicting social and economic success is well documented.2

 Economists, psychologists, and sociologists now actively examine determinants of social and

 economic success beyond those captured by cognitive ability.3 However, there remains a

 substantial imbalance in the scholarly and policy literatures in the emphasis placed on cognitive

 ability compared to other traits. This chapter aims to correct this imbalance. It considers how

 personality psychology informs economics and how economics can inform personality

 psychology.

         A recent analysis of the Perry Preschool Program shows that traits other than those

 measured by IQ and achievement tests causally determine life outcomes.4 This experimental

 intervention enriched the early social and emotional environments of disadvantaged children

 ages 3 and 4 with subnormal IQs. It primarily focused on fostering the ability of participants to

 plan tasks, to execute their plans, and to review their work in social groups.5 In addition, it

 taught reading and math skills, although this was not its main focus. Both treatment and control

 group members were followed into their 40s.6

   See, e.g., the studies cited in Becker [1964] and the discussion of ability bias in Griliches [1977].
 3
   See Bowles, Gintis and Osborne [2001a] and Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] for reviews of the
 literature in economics. Marxist economists and sociologists (e.g., Bowles and Gintis [1976] and Mueser [1979],
 respectively) pioneered the analysis of the impact of personality on earnings. Mueller and Plug [2006] estimate
 empirical relationships between personality traits and earnings, schooling and occupational attainment. Hartog
 [1980; 2001] relates the Big Five personality factors to earnings. van Praag [1985] draws on the psychology
 literature to analyze economic preferences. van Praag and van Weeren [1988] and Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman
 et al. [2008] link economics with psychology.

   We draw on the research of Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]. See Weikart, Epstein, Schweinhart et al.
 [1978], Sylva [1997], Schweinhart, Montie, Xiang et al. [2005] and Heckman, Moon, Pinto et al. [2010a] for
 descriptions of the Perry program.

   Sylva [1997] shows that the Perry Program has important features that are shared with programs designed to foster
 self-control in children, for example, Tools of the Mind (Bodrova and Leong [2001]).

   Plans are underway to follow the Perry sample through age 50.

                                                                                                    7
         Figure 1 shows that, by age ten, treatment group mean IQs were the same as control

group mean IQs. Many critics of early childhood programs seize on this and related evidence to

dismiss the value of early intervention studies.7 Yet on a variety of measures of socioeconomic

achievement, the treatment group was far more successful than the control group.8 The annual

rate of return to the Perry Program was in the range 6-10% for boys and girls separately.9 These

rates of return are statistically significant and above the returns to the US stock market over the

post-war period.10 The intervention changed something other than IQ, and that something

produced strong treatment effects. Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010] show that the

personality traits of the participants were beneficially improved in a lasting way.11 This chapter

is about those traits.

   We discuss this evidence in Section 8. The traits changed were related to self-control and social behavior.
Participants of both genders had better “externalizing behavior” while girls also had improved “internalizing
behavior.” See Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]. Duncan and Magnuson [2010b] offer a different
interpretation of the traits changed by the Perry experiment, but both analyses agree that it was not a boost in IQ that
improved the life outcomes of Perry treatment group members.

          Personality psychologists mainly focus on empirical associations between their measures

of personality traits and a variety of life outcomes. Yet for policy purposes, it is important to

know mechanisms of causation to explore the viability of alternative policies.12 We use

economic theory to formalize the insights of personality psychology and to craft models that are

useful for exploring the causal mechanisms that are needed for policy analysis.

          We interpret personality as a strategy function for responding to life situations.

Personality traits, along with other influences, produce measured personality as the output of

personality strategy functions. We discuss how psychologists use measurements of the

performance of persons on tasks or in taking actions to identify personality traits and cognitive

                                                                                               9
traits. We discuss fundamental identification problems that arise in applying their procedures to

infer traits.

        Many economists, especially behavioral economists, are not convinced about the

predictive validity, stability, or causal status of economic preference parameters or personality

traits. They believe, instead, that the constraints and incentives in situations almost entirely

determine behavior.13 This once popular, extreme situationist view is no longer generally

accepted in psychology. Most psychologists now accept the notion of a stable personality as

defined in this chapter.14 Measured personality exhibits both stability and variation across

situations.15

        Although personality traits are not merely situation-driven ephemera, they are also not set

in stone. We present evidence that both cognitive and personality traits evolve over the life

cycle—but at different rates at different stages. Recently developed economic models of

parental and environmental investment in children help to explain the evolution of these traits.

        This chapter addresses the following specific questions, which we pose here and answer

in the concluding section:

(1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework? Can

conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in personality

psychology?

(2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality and

personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to each other?

What is the relationship between standard measures of personality and measures of

psychopathology and child temperament?

(3) What is the relationship between economic preference parameters and psychological

measurements?

(4) How stable across situations and over the life cycle are preference parameters and

personality traits?

(5) What is the evidence on the predictive power of cognitive and personality traits?

(6) What is the evidence on the causal power of personality on behavioral outcomes?

(7) Can personality be altered across the life cycle? Are interventions that change personality

traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?

(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be

enriched?

        The plan of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents a definition of personality that

captures central ideas in the literature on personality psychology. It also presents a brief history

of personality psychology and the person-situation debate that paralyzed the field for 20 years

and that still influences behavioral economics. Section 3 defines measured personality as a

response function using an economic model of preferences, expectations, and constraints. Our

model distinguishes measured personality from personality traits. We interpret personality as a

response function mapping variables that characterize traits and situations to manifest

(measured) personality. Our definition formalizes various definitions of personality used in the

literature on personality psychology and facilitates the analysis of personality using the tools of

economics. We also sketch a dynamic model of trait formation.

        Section 4 discusses alternative criteria that psychologists use to define traits. It examines

the strengths and limitations of each approach. We link our abstract definition to linear factor

models that are commonly used to identify personality and cognitive traits.

        Section 5 presents the main systems used to measure personality and cognition and

discusses the relationship among the systems. We illustrate a nonidentification result developed

in Section 3 by showing how scores on IQ tests are greatly affected by incentives and context.

We present additional evidence showing that the scores on achievement tests depend on

cognitive and personality measurements, with a substantial predictive role for personality

measures. Measures of “IQ” commonly used in economics and social science conflate measures

of cognition and personality.

        Section 6 discusses economic preferences and examines the evidence relating economic

preference parameters to psychological parameters. Section 7 surveys the evidence on the

predictive validity of personality measures for education, crime, health, and labor market

outcomes. The material presented in the main text summarizes a large and growing empirical

literature. A Web Appendix presents additional detail on the literature relating cognition and

personality in each of these areas of economic and social life.16

        Section 8 presents evidence on the causal impact of personality on outcomes, as well as

evidence on the stability and malleability of personality traits and preferences. We extend the

theoretical framework for trait formation introduced in Section 3 and discuss a corresponding

measurement system. We discuss the evidence from intervention studies. Section 9 concludes

with provisional answers to the eight questions.

2.    Personality and Personality Traits: Definitions and a Brief History of

      Personality Psychology

 Personality psychology attempts to describe the whole person.17 It considers both universal traits

 and individual differences. It examines the ways in which people are unique. As a sign of its

 breadth, personality psychology considers cognitive functioning as one aspect of personality.

          In considering the content of personality psychology, it is helpful to distinguish

 personality traits, personality as a response function, and measured personality. Personality

 is a response function that maps personality traits to measured (manifest) personality.

          One leading personality psychologist defines personality traits in the following way:

          “Personality traits are the relatively enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and

          behaviors that reflect the tendency to respond in certain ways under certain

          circumstances.” (Roberts [2009, p. 140])

 This definition, or closely related versions, are used throughout personality psychology.18 We

 formalize these notions in Section 3.

          Roberts’ definition of personality traits refers to the stability of certain patterns of

 behavior—actions or responses to situations that people take, including patterns of thoughts or

 feelings. Perceptions, expectations of future events and preferences may shape behavior,

 feelings and thoughts. In this way, cognitive activities help to determine measured personality.

 17
   Cervone and Pervin [2009] provide a clear introduction to personality psychology.
 18
   However, some personality psychologists use this or a very similar definition to define personality and not
 personality traits. Thus Cervone and Pervin [2009] define personality as
           “psychological qualities that contribute to an individual’s enduring and distinctive patterns of
           thinking, feeling and behaving” (p. 8).
 Another definition in a graduate text on personality by McAdams emphasizes context more strongly:
           “Personality is a patterning of dispositional traits, characteristic adaptations, and integrative life
           stories set in culture and shaped by human nature” McAdams [2006].
 In this chapter, we define personality as a property of a system of equations and measured personality is the
 output of those equations.

                                                                                                 13
        There are many different models of personality.19 A prototypical model that captures

many features of a wide class of models in personality psychology is one due to Roberts [2006].

He presents the schematic displayed in Figure 2 to relate personality traits to behavior.20 He

distinguishes mental abilities from personality traits (the items in the boxes will be discussed in

later sections of this chapter). These, along with preferences (motives, interests, and values) and

narratives (the stories people tell themselves in organizing their lives and making meanings of

them), shape one’s identity and reputation, including the views of the person by others and the

person’s perception of how others perceive him. Identity and reputation in turn shape the roles

of individuals in the economy and the society and the larger culture to which they belong.

Personality is the system of relationships that map traits and other determinants of behavior into

measured actions.

        In Roberts' vision of personality, feedback processes operate among all components of

Figure 2. Thus his broad conception of personality includes the possibility that identity shapes

traits and abilities, perhaps through a mechanism such as epigenetics, in which environment

affects gene expression.21 Measured personality results from interactions among components of

the system. Personality traits are one determinant of personality and need to be carefully

distinguished from the full expression of personality, which is generated by the traits interacting

with other factors. Personality is seen as a system of behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that

emerge from the interacting components.

        In Section 3, we formalize aspects of Roberts’ framework for personality within an

economic model of production, choice, and information. Figure 2 presages our discussion of a

basic identification problem discussed in Section 3. Measurements and behaviors that arise from

responses to incentives and interactions with culture are used to infer personality traits and

abilities. Personality traits and cognitive abilities, along with the other “units of analysis” in

Figure 2, produce the observed behaviors that are used to infer the generating traits. To infer

traits from behaviors requires “parsing out” or standardizing for all of the other contributing

factors that produce the observed behavior—a challenging task. The inability to parse and

localize behaviors that depend on a single trait or ability gives rise to a fundamental

identification problem. Behavior depends on incentives created by situations. Accurately

measuring personality traits requires standardizing for situation.


2.A.    A Brief History of Personality Psychology22
Interest in how individual behavior differs in common situations is as old as human history. The

importance of personality traits for determining educational outcomes was recognized by the

creators of the first IQ tests. Alfred Binet, architect of the first modern intelligence test that

became the Stanford-Binet IQ test, noted that performance in school

        “...admits of other things than intelligence; to succeed in his studies, one must have

        qualities which depend on attention, will, and character; for example a certain docility, a

        regularity of habits, and especially continuity of effort. A child, even if intelligent, will

        learn little in class if he never listens, if he spends his time in playing tricks, in giggling,

        is playing truant.” (Binet [1916, p. 254])

        At about the same time that Binet was writing, Charles Spearman, best known for his

work on “ g ”—a unitary factor that is claimed to capture the structure of intelligence—along

with his student, Edward Webb, undertook studies of “character” because of “the urgency of its

practical application to all the business of life” (Webb [1915, p. 1]). Spearman and Webb

concluded that many positive aspects of character shared a relation to what modern personality

psychologists term “Conscientiousness.”23 This general factor, which Spearman and Webb

chose to call “persistence of motives,” meaning “consistency of action resulting from deliberate

volition, or will,” was distinct from a general intelligence factor (Webb [1915, p. 60]).24

        Arthur Jensen, an intellectual heir of Spearman who is widely regarded as a proponent of

g as an explanatory factor of success and failure in many domains of life, writes:

        “What are the chief personality traits which, interacting with g , relate to individual

        differences in achievement and vocational success? The most universal personality trait

        is conscientiousness, that is, being responsible, dependable, caring, organized and

        persistent” Jensen [1998, p. 575].



The Pioneers of Personality Psychology

Over the past century, interest in personality among psychologists has fluctuated dramatically.

During the first half of the twentieth century, many of the most prominent psychologists (e.g.,

Gordon Allport, Raymond Cattell, Hans Eysenck, Charles Spearman, Lewis Terman) were

vigorously engaged in the study of individual differences in behaviors and traits. Psychologists

studied personality traits along with intelligence, interests, and motivation and measured

differences and similarities within and across individuals.

        A systematic approach to the study of personality was conceived by early psychologists

who believed that the most important dimensions on which human beings differed would be

captured in natural language. These personality pioneers extracted words from the (English)

dictionary that characterized individual differences between people (e.g., irritable, proud), after

eliminating synonyms and words not associated with traits. They designed and administered

studies of trait inventories to large samples of individuals and applied the same factor analytic

methods developed by Galton, Spearman, Binet, Pearson, Cattell, and Thorndike to these

assessments in order to isolate “ g ” to identify the structure of cognitive abilities.
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                17
        The fruits of several decades of research in this tradition beginning in the 1970s have

produced a widely (but not universally) shared consensus taxonomy of traits, known as the Big

Five, that is arrived at through factor analysis of observer and self-reports of behaviors.25 The

Big Five posits a hierarchical organization for personality traits, with five factors at the highest

level and progressively more narrowly defined traits (or facets) at lower and lower levels.

                 I. Openness to Experience (Intellect)   The tendency to be open to new

                 II. Conscientiousness                   The tendency to be organized,
                                                         responsible, and hardworking.

                 III. Extraversion                       An orientation of one’s interests and
                                                         energies toward the outer world of

                                                         characterized by positive affect and

                 IV. Agreeableness                       The tendency to act in a cooperative,

                 V. Neuroticism (Emotional Stability)    Neuroticism is a chronic level of

called Emotional Stability).26 The Big Five factors represent personality traits at the broadest

level of abstraction. They summarize a large number of distinct, more specific, personality

facets.

           The Big Five are defined without reference to any context (i.e., situation). This practice

gives rise to an identification problem that we discuss in Section 3. The behaviors used to

measure the traits are also determined by factors other than the Big Five traits. John [1990],

Goldberg [1993], and Costa and McCrae [1992a] present evidence that most of the variables

used to assess personality traits in academic research in the field of personality psychology can

be mapped into one or more of the dimensions of the Big Five. They argue that the Big Five are

the longitude and latitude of personality traits, by which all more narrowly defined traits may be

categorized (see also Costa and McCrae [1992a]). We discuss the Big Five further in Section 5,

where we also consider alternative measurement systems.



The Person-Situation Debate, Its Lingering Influence in Economics, and the Subsequent

Flourishing of Personality Psychology

In 1968, Walter Mischel published a monograph entitled Personality and Assessment,

challenging the most important theoretical assumptions and empirical findings of personality

psychology. An acrimonious “person-situation” debate ensued, which pitted those who favored

situational factors as explaining behavior against those who considered personality traits as more

consequential. During this time, considered by many to be a dark age in the history of personality

psychology, the general Zeitgeist favored experimental social psychological approaches which




26
     The acronym OCEAN is sometimes used to summarize these traits.
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                  19
focused on the importance of the situation compared to the individual traits featured in

personality psychology.

         Mischel noted that correlations between behavioral task measures of personality and

questionnaire measures seldom, if ever, exceeded 0.3.27,28 The implication of such within-

individual behavioral heterogeneity suggested to Mischel that “the behaviors which are often

construed as stable personality trait indicators are highly specific and depend on the details of the

evoking situations and the response mode employed to measure them” (p. 37). Mischel wrote

         “…with the possible exception of intelligence, highly generalized behavioral

         consistencies have not been demonstrated, and the concept of personality traits as broad

         dispositions is thus untenable” – Mischel [1968, p. 146]

Mischel went on to write that global (i.e., domain-general) traits (e.g., “impulsive”, “confident”)

measured in one situation did not predict future behavior and outcomes in other situations. His

view was that global traits, in attempting to summarize behavioral dispositions without regard to

situational contingencies, were “excessively crude, gross units to encompass adequately the

extraordinary complexity and subtlety of the discriminations that people constantly make” (p.

301).

         Mischel now suggests [2004] that behaviors can be consistent across time, but that the

locus of consistency is to be found in highly contextualized if-situation/then-behavior

contingencies (e.g., “If I feel threatened, then I am aggressive”). Variance across situations was,




27
   There is great irony in the fact that none of the correlations of cognitive measures with outcomes that are reported
in Table A1 in the Web Appendix are as high as 0.3, but no one questions the power of cognition in predicting
outcomes in social life. Few studies in social psychology show correlations as high as 0.2 (see Richard, Bond and
Stokes-Zoota [2003]).
28
   Psychologists often work with standardized variables (variables normalized by standard deviations). They report
correlations between standardized variables as “effect sizes.”
                                              Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                            20
in Mischel’s view, improperly treated by most personality psychologists as “error.”29 Indeed, in

his view, the systematic variation of behavior across situations points to underlying motivations,

beliefs, schemas, strategies, and other factors that collectively and interactively give rise to

coherence in any individual’s measured personality. His revised view of personality is broadly

consistent with Robert’s Figure 2.

           In Section 3, we formalize the “if-then” relationship using an economic model. We show

that the person-situation debate boils down to an empirical question about the relative

importance of person, situation, and their interaction in explaining behaviors. Although Mischel

may have intended otherwise, proponents of the situationist view have used his monograph as

ammunition in the battle against accepting evidence from personality psychology into

economics. Like most heated debates in social science, this one occurred in the absence of much

data. In Section 5, we discuss the body of evidence that has emerged over the past four decades

on the existence of stable personality traits.

           The debate over the relative importance of person and situation in the 1960s and 1970s

reflected deeper currents in psychology and social science more generally, that still run strong.

Behaviorism, associated with B. F. Skinner was influential. It posited that experience explains

all aspects of behavior. There was the widely held notion that situation and experience were all

powerful—that people were born as blank slates.30 This captured the interventionist spirit of the

times. Inter-individual heterogeneity in traits was ignored. Ross and Nisbett [1991] summarize

the position of many social psychologists:

                                                                                               21
        “Manipulations of the immediate social situation can overwhelm in importance the type

        of individual differences in personal traits or dispositions that people normally think of

        as being determinative of social behavior” (p. xiv).

Many behavioral economists hold a similar view and they often appeal to Mischel as a guiding

influence. For example, in a recent round table discussion, Richard Thaler noted that

        “The great contribution to psychology by Walter Mischel [...] is to show that there is no

        such thing as a stable personality trait” (Thaler [2008]).

Many studies in behavioral economics attempt to establish inconsistency in behavior across

situations, in violation of standard assumptions of stable preferences used in mainstream

economics. For instance, several studies find very low correlations in risk-taking behavior across

situations.31

        Personality psychology survived the Behaviorist assault and is a prospering field. A rich

body of correlational evidence, which we summarize in Section 7, shows that for many

outcomes, measured personality traits are as predictive, and are sometimes more predictive than

standard measures of cognition, that traits are stable across situations, and situations also matter.

        Mounting evidence that behavior has a biological basis suggests that personality is an

important determinant of behavior. The evidence from behavioral genetics shows that measured

personality traits are as heritable as cognitive traits. Studies in neuroscience show that

alterations in brain structure and function through accidents, disease and by experiments affect

measured personality. They reinforce the evidence from heritability studies. This evidence and

other evidence shows that something about measured personality is real. We review this

evidence in Section 8.

3.    Conceptualizing Personality and Personality Traits Within Economic

      Models

 Personality psychologists rarely use formal models to define or measure their constructs. In

 order to introduce their knowledge to economists, we formalize their frameworks. Doing so

 makes the concepts of personality psychology more precise and provides a basis for

 measurement and policy analysis.

         We introduce a series of progressively more comprehensive models to integrate concepts

 from personality psychology into economics.32 Roberts’ framework (Figure 2) captures the main

 features of the influential models used in personality psychology. We use it as a point of

 departure. Psychology adds new and often more nuanced descriptions of human behavior to the

 standard descriptions used in economics.

         In the nineteenth century, economics and psychology were closely aligned. Economists

 then spoke of the “hedonic calculus” used by people weighing choices.33 One of the advances

 made in neoclassical economics in the first half of the twentieth century was to focus on choices

 and the objective (easily measured) factors (like prices and incomes) that determine choices.

 Revealed preference became a central tool of economics and was implemented using the

 marginal rate of substitution between choices—a key parameter that emerged from the

 neoclassical revolution.34 This parameter did not require measurable utility or knowledge of the




 32
    Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop a variety of economic models for integrating personality
 psychology into economic models. We build on their analysis. We review these frameworks in Section A3 of the
 Web Appendix.

    See Hicks [1946].
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 23
mental states of the agents making choices. Mental states and measureable utility, once the

province of economists, were eliminated by Occam’s Razor.

        Measurable utility was used in utilitarian economics but fell out of favor (see Samuelson

[1956], Foster and Sen [1997]). Preferences that fulfilled criteria for rationality were consistent

with utility functions that were determined up to monotonic transformations. Measurable utility

returned in a specific fashion with analyses of decision-making under uncertainty (see Savage

[1954]).

        Most economists view mental states as unnecessary baggage except insofar as they affect

choices. Thus, the traits, abilities, and narratives used by Roberts in Figure 2 are of interest to

most economists only if they affect choices through preferences, constraints, and effects on

information processing capabilities. Motives and values are captured in part by economic

preference parameters. Until recently, “happiness,” and “aggregate utility,” as well as other

subjective mental states that do not affect behavior (choices) were considered uninteresting to

most economists.35

        Preferences, constraints, and expectations provide the most direct way to introduce

psychological variables into economic models. We begin our analysis with a barebones

approach that focuses on constraints. For example, cognitive and personality traits affect

earnings capacity because they enhance productivity (see, e.g., Bowles, Gintis and Osborne

[2001a]), and, at least up to a point, more of a trait can generate more resources which enlarge

choice sets and hence directly affect behavior.




35
  See, however, the revival of utility measurement in the happiness literature (see Layard [2005]). Perceptions on
which one does not act, included in the domain of psychology, have recently entered economic studies through the
happiness literature.

3.A.       An Approach Based on Comparative Advantage
The Roy model [1951] of comparative advantage provides a useful starting point. Heckman,

Stixrud and Urzua [2006] use the Roy model to introduce psychological variables into the study

of social and economic outcomes.36 Personality traits are treated as endowments, and choices are

determined by personality traits and other factors as they affect productivity in skills.

(1)                          Pj   j ( , e j ),     j  = 1, , J  , e j   ,   .

The traits are the endowments of agents that govern behavior. Examples of traits include height,

personality characteristics, problem solving ability, and strength.  is a public good as it is

available in the same amount for all tasks. Productivity also depends on effort e j . Effort is

assumed to be divisible and fixed in supply.

           In much applied research, effort and traits are often assumed to be measured so that over

the relevant range, assuming differentiability with respects to e j and  ,

                                                j                 j

but neither condition is strictly required. Excess effort (over-exertion; too much attention to

detail) may be counterproductive so that function j need not be monotonic in e j , contrary to

what is assumed here. Indeed, as discussed in Section 5, certain psychopathologies are

associated with extreme levels of traits that are quite productive at normal levels. Different traits

variety of intermediate cases might exist where some effort-trait relationships are complementary

and others are substitution relationships. Some people may solve complex math problems with

no effort, while others may have to allocate considerable time and effort to achieve the same

result. Effort can be a vector (time, mental energy, attention), and it is assumed to be a divisible

private good with the feature that the more that is applied to task j, the less is available for all

                                            J
other tasks at any point in time.          e

                                                   j    e , where e is the endowment of total effort.


Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven et al. [1998] interpret self-control as a component of e that is

fixed over given time periods. A person who exerts more self-control in one task may be less

self-controlled in another task.

           Let R j be the reward per unit productivity in task j . In the first case we analyze, agents

can productively engage in only one of the J tasks at any time. This restriction can be

interpreted as a case where effort can only be applied to a single task. A reward maximizing

agent with trait  and endowment e faces the problem of picking the maximal task to perform,

 ĵ where

     Cattan [2010] shows that sociability has negative returns in some sectors but positive returns in other sectors.

                                                                                                      26
In this case,  and e play the same role. People with different effort and capability

endowments will generally choose different tasks.38,39 Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] show

how persons with different endowments of personality and intelligence sort into different

occupations and levels of schooling. People low in certain traits may have better endowments of

effort and may compensate for their shortfall in ability by exerting effort. For certain tasks (e.g.,

creating new branches of mathematics), there may be threshold levels of  such that for    j ,

 j  , e j   0 for all e j  e . (The person needs a given level of trait  no matter how hard they

try.) The higher R j , the more likely will the person choose to perform task j . The particular

choice of which j to perform depends on the productivity of traits in different tasks.



3.B.        Allowing for Multiple Tasking
More generally, at a point in time, people may perform multiple tasks.40 A less discrete version

of the Roy model builds on the same foundations, allows people to perform multiple tasks at any

                                          
time and postulates that  j  , e j is concave and increasing in e j .41 The agent chooses effort

levels e j across the J tasks to maximize total rewards:




38
     A straightforward extension works with utilities and not rewards so we define utility U  P1 , , PJ  and the agents
picks the j that maximizes utility, with the other arguments zeroed out. Formally, define d P  1 if a person
                                                                                                   j



chooses to perform task j . Array the d P into a vector d P . Array the Pj into a vector P . Realized utility is thus
                                               j



     
U dP  P       where  is a Hadamard (component-wise) product, i.e. a product of two vectors of the same length
where the operation is such that the result is the product of the first element of one vector with the first element of
the second vector and so forth for each component.
39
   See Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Cattan [2010], and the evidence in Section 7.
40
   This, of course, depends on the time unit. Agents may be able to do only one task at one time if the time unit is
defined finely enough.
41
   Failure of concavity can take us back to case I.

               As the reward for activity j , R j , increases, everything else constant, the effort devoted

to j will increase.43,44 This model is consistent with effort that compensates for shortfalls in

endowments as well as effort that reinforces initial endowments. The choice of effort depends

on the pattern of complementarity and substitutability. Different situations may be associated

with different rewards for the same task. Such variation can produce differences in performance

across tasks of the sort featured in the person-situation debate discussed in Section 2. One needs

to standardize for the incentives to exert effort across tasks and differences in the endowments of

effort in order to use measurements of performance on tasks to identify traits,  .


3.C.           Identifying Personality Traits
Before considering more general models, it is useful to discuss basic identification problems that

arise in simple settings and that also arise in more general models. At the current level of

generality, all traits can potentially affect productivity in all tasks. However, some tasks may




                                                                        j
42
     The first order conditions for this problem are standard: R j              , and e j  0 , j  1,  , J , where  is the
                                                                       e j
vector of multipliers associated with the effort constraint. Some people may allocate no effort in some tasks. Pj
may be zero if e j  0 , but this is not strictly required. Again, it is straightforward to generalize this reward function
to a general utility function U  P1 ,, PJ  .
       2 j
43
                0 is a force toward devoting more effort to task j . If effort is complementary with traits in all tasks, as
     ej
traits expand, more effort will be expended in those tasks that are relatively more complementary in effort.
44
   In case I, agents will pick j .
                                                     Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                   28
require only a single trait or a subset of all of the traits. Following a traditional dichotomy in

psychology that is explicit in Roberts’ Figure 2, divide  into “mental,”  , and “personality,”

 , traits:   and  , each of which may in turn be a vector.45

           Psychological measurement systems sometimes use productivity measured in different

tasks to identify   and  .46 This is the way Carroll [1993] defines mental ability where the

task is performance on “mental” tests. To use performance on a task (or on multiple measures of

the task) to identify a trait requires that performance on certain tasks (performance on a test,

performance in an interpersonal situation, etc.) depends exclusively on one component of  , say

1, j . In that case

                                                  Pj   j 1, j , e j  .

Even if we can measure productivity Pj in task j , and only one component of  affects Pj , to

identify the level of a trait one must control for the level of effort applied to j in order to use Pj

to infer the level of 1, j . That is, one must standardize for the effort at a benchmark level, say e

, to use P j to identify a measure of the trait that is uniform across different situations that elicit

different levels of effort.47

           The activity of picking a task (or a collection of tasks) to measure a particular trait (  1, j

in our example) is called operationalization in psychology. Construct validity refers to whether

or not a purported measure of the trait constructed in the stage of operationalization correlates

45
                                                                    
     Effort endowment might also be divided in the same fashion e , e        , but we do not explicitly develop this
possibility.
46
   They also use observer reports and tests which can be interpreted as observation on performance of tasks and
psychometric tasks.
47
   A weaker notion is to achieve relative ranks of a trait. One can define the rank of a trait holding fixed the ranks of
all other influences.
                                              Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                            29
with measures deemed to represent the trait. Considerable judgment is required to operationalize

a trait and independently validate it. There is clear danger of circularity. Economists should

carefully scrutinize how the measures they borrow from psychology are operationalized and

validated in that literature. We should not necessarily assume that the measures created in that

field have been rigorously established. We discuss how major constructs are validated in

Section 5.

        Assuming that construct validity has been established, if effort is involved in the

performance of a task used to uniquely define a trait, the measurement of performance must be

standardized in order to use measured productivity Pj to identify the trait. Otherwise, the

endowment of effort, and all of the factors that contribute to the exertion of effort, including the

reward to the task, R j , will contaminate the estimate of the trait. Failure to adjust for effort

produces the kind of variability across situations with different rewards that was much discussed

in the person-situation debate. We present examples of such contamination of measurement by

the operation of incentives on effort in Section 5.

        Operationalization and construct validation clearly require heroic assumptions. Even if

one adjusts for effort in a task, and thus adjusts for situational specificity, productivity in a task

may depend on multiple traits. Thus two components of  (say 1,  , 1, ) may determine

productivity in task j . Without further information, one cannot infer which of the two traits

produces the productivity in j . But in general, even having two (or more) measures of

productivity that depend on 1,  ,1,  is not enough to identify the separate components.

        Consider the following case of two productivity measurements on tasks j and j  :
                                                              Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                            30

                                            Pj   j 1,  , 1, , e j 
                                            Pj    j  1,  , 1, , e j   ,       j  j .

One might have such measurements if data are available on the productivity of the same person

performing two different tasks. Standardize measurements at a common level of effort

e j  e j   e .48 If the functional forms of the  j ·  and  j ·  are known, and the system of

equations satisfies a local rank condition, then one can solve for the pair 1,  , 1,  at e .49

            The rank condition might not be satisfied, and the functional forms  j and  j  might not

be known. The productivity functions need not be monotone in 1,  or 1, . Interacting systems

might produce multiple equilibria so that the same values of  produce different values of

( Pj , Pj ) .50 Interacting systems might also have no solution.

            Note that even if these problems do not arise, only the pair 1,  , 1,  is identified. One

cannot (without further information) determine which component of the pair is 1,  or 1, . In

Section 5, we present an example where scores on achievement tests depend on both IQ and

personality traits. In the absence of dedicated constructs (constructs that are generated by only

one component of  ), an intrinsic identification problem arises in using measures of productivity




48
     Note that if the support of e j and e j  is disjoint, no e exists and so no such standardization is possible.
49
                      
     Let   1,  , 1, . Assume that the functional forms of  j · and  j  ·  are known. Formally, a solution from

Pj and Pj  for 1,  and 1, requires that the Jacobian of the system of equations for Pj and Pj 

be non-vanishing in open neighborhoods around any point of solutions for  (see, e.g., Buck [2003]).
50
  Thus there is a correspondence between  Pj , Pj   and  , but no unique functional relationship.

in tasks to infer traits.51 A dedicated measurement for at least one component is an essential

requirement for identification. Other components can be defined relative to that

measurement.52,53


3.D.     Extensions of the Roy Model
Many empirical economists use the simple gross income maximizing framework of the Roy

model to study the effects of personality on outcomes. The model is amended in many papers by

including a cost C j  , e j  for obtaining rewards so that instead of criterion (2), the agent picks ˆj

that maximizes the net reward

                                         ˆj  arg max  R j j  , e   C j  , e  .
                                               j1., J 



In the analogous extension for criterion (3), the agent maximizes

                                                 J

                                                R   , e   C  , e 
                                                j 1
                                                        j    j   j     j       j




51
   There are various ways around this identification problem. For example, one might be able to choose
configurations of data with low (or zero) values of one component. At high levels of effort, induced by a change in
the reward, the effect of one component on productivity might vanish, etc.
52
   This problem arises in linear factor models, but it is a more general problem. See, e.g., Anderson and Rubin
[1956] for a definitive treatment of linear factor models. The scales in any factor model are arbitrary and are always
defined with respect to a normalization (i.e. a dedicated measurement that defines the factor). The more general
nonlinear model considered in the text faces the same problem.
53
   In general, without knowledge of the functional forms of the  j ·  , j  1,, J , the problem of solving for two
measurements Pj , Pj  to infer 1,  and 1, at a common level of e j  e j  is intractable. Many alternative solutions
are possible. The traditional factor analysis literature reviewed in Section 5 below assumes linearity of the  j · ,
 j  1,, J . But even in that literature, attention focuses primarily on identifying the distribution of 1,  , 1,  not
individual values 1, ,1,  when Pj , j  1,, J is measured with error, although methods for solving for
individual values of 1,  , 1,  and correcting for measurement error of the resulting estimates are available in the
literature and are widely applied. (See, e.g., Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010], Savelyev [2010], Heckman
and Williams [2011].) Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] establish conditions under which it is possible to
nonparametrically identify the functional form of  j · , j  1,, J and the distributions of 1,  , 1,  in the

with respect to the choice of e j . This extension creates a further identification problem—

whether the trait identified arises from its role in costs, productivity, or both. The identification

problem deepens when we allow the costs to be psychic costs as in Heckman and Sedlacek

[1985], Cunha, Heckman and Navarro [2005], or Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], and

attempt to separate out productivity traits from preference traits.54

        The framework of the Roy model is widely used in recent analyses of the role of

personality and cognition.55 It has precedents in the work of Mandelbrot [1962], Heckman and

Sedlacek [1985], and Heckman and Honoré [1990]. In most applications, the  j  , e j  and


C j  , e j  (or their logarithms) are assumed to be linear or log linear in  and e j :

                                                Pj      e e j
                                                C j      e e j .

The analyst models both the choice of the task and the output from the chosen task. A third

(mixed) case can arise in which some clusters of tasks are mutually exclusive so the agent can

perform only one task within each cluster of tasks, but the agent can simultaneously engage in

tasks across clusters.


3.E.    Adding Preferences and Goals
Preferences and goals (see Figure 2) may also shape effort.56 This takes us to a fourth and more

general case. There may be direct utility benefits or costs associated with exerting effort in each



54
  Heckman and Navarro [2007] and Abbring and Heckman [2007] present conditions that allow identification of
productivity and costs when there are direct measures of gross productivity, at least when there are measurements on
Pj for individuals who select j .

   See, e.g., Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010], Báron and Cobb-Clark
[2010], and Cattan [2010].
56
   In some versions of the preceding models with costs, preferences can be embodied in psychic costs.

value to the productivity in tasks arrayed in vector P   P1 ,  , PJ  with reward R j .

with associated prices W . A utility function can be specified over X , P , and e with preference

parameter vector   .57 Thus, we write

where Y is a flow of unearned income available to the agent in addition to his earnings from his

productive activities, and

Preference specification (4) captures the notions that (a) agents have preferences over goods, (b)

agents may value the output of tasks in their own right, and (c) agents may value the effort

devoted to tasks.58

         The parameter  determines the tradeoffs in preferences among X , P , and e . In one

interpretation, subjective measures of well-being (Layard [2005]) attempt to directly measure

parameters.

   Goods might also be direct arguments of the productivity functions, but, for simplicity, we do not analyze that
case.

measures of well-being, but not from choices.60




3.F.       Adding Learning and Uncertainty
All of the preceding models can be extended to account for learning and uncertainty. Let  be

the information possessed by the agent, and let “ E ” denote mathematical expectations. An

agent can be interpreted as making decisions based on

(7)                                            E[U ( X , P, e ∣  ) ∣  ],

where  may be in the agent’s information set (i.e. the agent knows his preferences).

           Different theories specify different amounts of information available to agents. They

might be uncertain about their preferences,  , traits,  , the prices they face, W , the rewards to

productivity, R , the outcomes of purchase decisions, X , and their endowments of effort, e , and

the theory can be suitably modified to account for this uncertainty.

           The use of the expectations operator begs the question of how agents construct the

information set and how subjective expectations are formed. Psychological traits  may affect

information perception and processing. Several recent studies that apply personality traits to

search economics suggest that agents with a higher perception of the control they have over their

lives have greater confidence in the arrival of job offers.61 Overconfidence may be a trait that

59
   However, the happiness literature is not strictly wedded to the notion that happiness is the same as our U , which
is used only to characterize choice behavior.
60
   The model can readily be extended to cover more general cases. There is no need to impose the linear reward
structure (RP) . The resources raised from productive tasks can be a nonlinear in P . Another simple extension of
the model is the case where there is no financial gain from engaging in tasks, but the agent receives a direct utility
benefit from doing so. In this case, constraint (5) is redefined as Y  W  X , but P remains as an argument of the
utility function. One might also introduce goods as inputs into the  j functions.

causes persons to inflate their perceived productivity.62 A production function for information

may depend on components of  ,  , and the effort devoted to acquire information e .

Intelligent people may acquire information more readily than dull people. People more open to

experience likely acquire more knowledge. Aggressive people may reduce their social

interactions and impair their ability to learn from others. We discuss the evidence on how

psychological traits affect information updating in Section 6.

        One might object to the rationality and self perception implicit in this formulation. As in

Freud [1909, reprinted 1990], decision making might be made by a subconscious mind lacking

self perception. Decision making may be unconscious and agents may not recognize their

desired goals. Nonetheless, constraints limit their revealed choice behavior. Borghans,

Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop a model in which agents have random preferences

and make choices at random within their feasible set. Variations in constraints drive the

measured behavior of group averages but do not predict the behavior of any individual.


3.G.    Definition of Personality Within an Economic Model
Personality traits are the components of e ,  and  that affect behavior. One might define

measured personality as the performance  the Pj  and effort  the e j  that arise from solutions

to any of the optimization problems previously discussed. Thus, the derived productivity and

effort functions would constitute the systems generating measured personality as a response to




62
   See, e.g., Akerlof and Dickens [1982] Caplin and Leahy [2001], Köszegi [2006], and Möbius, Niederle, Niehaus
et al. [2010].
                                                      Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                    36
constraints, information, and preferences, i.e. as a system of functions that solve out for the Pj

and e j that agents choose in terms of their choice parameters.63

          This approach to defining personality would not capture the full range of behaviors or

actions considered by personality psychologists as constituting manifestations of personality.

The actions considered by psychologists include a variety of activities that economists normally

do not study, e.g., cajoling, beguiling, bewitching, charming, etc. Thus, in selling a house,

various actions might be taken, e.g., smiling, persuading people by reason, threatening, scowling,

showing affection, etc. Actions also include emotions, feelings, and thoughts, and are not

restricted to be activities that promote physical productivity. Colloquially, “there are many ways

to skin a cat,” and the choice of which way to do so in any task defines the action taken.

          To capture these more general notions, we introduce the concept of “actions” that are

broader than what is captured by e . Actions are styles of behavior that affect how tasks are

accomplished. They include aspects of behavior that go beyond effort as we have defined it.

          Any task can be accomplished by taking various actions. We denote the i th possible

action to perform task              j by a i , j , i  1,...K j  .                Array the actions in a vector


                     
a j  a1, j ,  , a K j , j  . The actions may be the same or different across the tasks. Thus one


can smile in executing all tasks or one may smile in only some. The productivity of the agent in

task j depends on the actions taken in that task:

(8)                                                                            
                                             Pj   j a1, j , a2, j , ...aK j , j .

The actions themselves depend on traits  and “effort” e i , j :


63
  As previously noted in a simpler setting, no solutions may exist or multiple solutions may exist (so there is a
system of correspondences) between traits and personality outcomes.

                                                                   j 1

Less effort may be required to perform a given action if a person has endowment  that favors

performance of the action. For example, a naturally gregarious person may find it easier to

engage in social interactions than others. Stated this way, actions generalize the notion of effort

to a broader class of behavior. Analytically, they play the same role as effort, and some actions

may be components of effort. There may be utility costs or benefits of effort exerted. A special

case arises when there are increasing returns to effort in each action. In that case, the agent will

simply apply all of his effort e j in task j to the action which gives him the highest productivity,

and the other possible actions are not taken.

        Agents may have utility over actions beyond the utility derived from consuming the

outputs of tasks. For example, an agent may prefer accomplishing a task by working hard rather

than by cheating. Different beliefs, thoughts, and feelings may have different effects on

outcomes. Introducing actions in this fashion allows for the possibility that some actions are

valued in their own right and do not directly contribute to productivity in any of the J tasks. Let

 be the set of actions, including actions that do not directly contribute to productivity. In this

more general formulation

where    .
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                38
        We define utility over actions. Let a denote the choice of actions, some of which may

not be associated with any particular task. Using the same information as used to characterize

(7), the agent solves

                                     max E U  a, X , P, e ∣   ∣  

with respect to X and e given the stated constraints. Actions may also directly affect  , so the

production of information can depend on  , e and a . The choice of which actions to take

depends on goals and values (captured by  ) and on the available information. Part of learning

may consist of agents learning about the set of actions that are available to them,  (  ) .

        One can extend the framework to introduce the effects of the situation in the person-

situation debate, by considering specific situations represented by h   . These situations are

assumed to affect productivity by affecting the set of possible actions and hence the action taken.

Thus for a person with traits  and effort vector e j with action a i , j , using the specification (9),

the action function can be expanded to be dependent on situation h :

(10)                                       ai , j , h   i , j ( , ei , j , h),

and productivity on a task can be specified as a function of the action taken to perform the task in

situation h :

(11)                                    Pj ,h   j (a1, j ,h ,..., aK j , j ,h )

or by a more general specification where situation h , along with traits, has a direct effect on

productivity in addition to their effects on actions taken:
                                                        Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                      39
(12)                                     Pj ,h   j ( , a1, j ,h ,..., aK j , j ,h , h). 64

         Situations could include physical aspects of the environment in which the agent is located

or the network (and other social situations) in which the agent is embodied. The situation can

include social factors such as peer effects.65 Persons taking an achievement test sometimes

perform much worse if they are told that their scores will influence social perceptions of their

group as is found in the stereotype threat literature.66

         The situation represents a key notion in the “person-situation” debate discussed in

Section 2. Equations (10)-(12) capture the “if-then” notion of Mischel and Shoda [1995]. Under

specification (12), agents with the same actions, the same efforts, and the same traits may have

different productivities. Failure to control for situation h , just like failure to control for effort,

will contaminate identification of traits using measures of actions or productivities. Situations

may be forced on the agents or may be chosen.67

         Let T be the vector of traits  , , e  . At any point in time, traits are endowments.

In the general case, the solution to the constrained maximization problem involves choosing

goods X , the situation h , the actions ai, j , and efforts e j , j  1,  , J  subject to the constraints.

h is fixed if agents cannot choose the situation. For simplicity, we analyze this case. Relaxing

this assumption is straightforward but is notationally more cumbersome.




64
  A more general formulation would treat h   as mutually exclusive descriptions of situations and not claim to
represent all situations by a base set of characteristics and would index all of the  functions by h .
                                                                                                i, j

   Included in situation h might be the act of being observed by third parties and other possible sources of social
interactions.

           For the case of fixed h , the solution to the maximization problem produces a set of

response functions.68 Preference parameters   characterize the tradeoffs and goals that help

shape manifest behavior. The agent’s response functions (assumed to exist) are

(13)                                          X  X  R,W , T , h, Y ,  

Productivity P across tasks is derived from the actions, efforts, and traits of the agents.69

           The behaviors that constitute personality are defined as a pattern of actions in response to

the constraints, endowments, and incentives facing agents given their goals and preferences.

This interpretation incorporates the notion that personality is a system of functions. People may

have different personalities depending on their trait endowments, constraints, and situations.

Their actions—not the traits—constitute the data used to identify the traits.

           Introducing actions widens the set of data from which one might infer the components of

T. Personality psychologists often use actions (e.g., “dispositions”) to infer traits. The same

identification issues previously discussed continue to arise but now apply to a broader set of

measurements.

           As noted in the introduction to Section 2, many personality psychologists define

personality as “enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviors” that reflect tendencies of

persons to respond in certain ways under certain circumstances. Our notion of action a , is broad

enough to encompass the wide array of behaviors considered by the personality psychologists.

We previously defined personality traits T as generators of behavior.
68
     The same warnings as previously issued apply. No solutions may exist or they may be multiple valued.

     For the case of h chosen, we get a system of derived demands for X , h, ai , j , e j .

         One way to capture the notion of enduring actions is to average the a functions (15) for a

person with a given trait vector T  t over situations and efforts. Thus for a given task j and

trait vector t , the average action for information set  can be defined as

the density of (h, ei , j ) given T  ( , , e ) and information set  . aT , j ,  is the “enduring

action” of agents across situations in task j with information  , i.e., the average personality.

Notice that if  i , j is separable in T , the marginal effect of personality trait vector  is the same

in all situations. One can define the “enduring traits” in a variety of ways, say by averaging over

tasks, j , situations, h , or both. Only under separability will one obtain the same marginal effect

of  . Epstein [1979] and a subsequent literature present evidence against nonseparability and in

favor of an “enduring trait” that is common across situations.



3.H.     Life Cycle Dynamics
The analysis in the preceding subsection was for a particular point in time (e.g., a period). Traits

are not set in stone. In a dynamic setting, one can think of traits, T , information,  , situations,

h , and actions, a , as state variables that evolve through aging, experience, and investment. As a

result of experience (including social interactions), situations, biology (ontogeny), and

investment, traits may change over the life cycle. We briefly discuss the dynamics of trait and

state formation, leaving a more complete discussion to Section 8.
                                                             Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                           42
         To capture the evidence from a large and growing literature, we consider the dynamic

evolution of traits.70 Let T v be traits at age v , v  1,,V   . Traits may change through

family and self investment (Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]), through schooling, through

biology or through experience. Information  v may be updated through various channels of

learning. All task outputs, actions and goods inputs may be time dated.

         Investment in period v is an action or set of actions that an individual (or a person or

group acting for the individual) may take in period v . Investments have dynamic effects. The

technology of skill formation (Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]) captures the notion that traits

may evolve in response to the inputs of a vector of investments ( IN v ), and through aspects of the

situation in which the agent is found, h v , where h v is the vector of attributes of the situation:

(16)                         T v 1   v (        Tv         , IN v , h v ),   v  0, , V  1
                                                               
                                              self-productivity investment



where the first set of arguments arises from self and cross productivity (skill begets skill; traits

beget other traits and traits cross-foster each other; see Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]). The

second set of arguments arises from investment. Investment is a broad concept and includes

parental nurturance, schooling, learning by doing, and learning by imitation, etc. The third set of

arguments arises from the situation in which the person is placed.71

         Notice that if elements of T v are augmented over the life cycle through investment and

practice, the actions and efforts required to achieve a given task can change. Thus, if  v , is

enhanced over time, the amount of effort required to perform a task may be reduced. In this



70
   We survey the evidence on the life cycle dynamics of traits in Section 8, focusing primarily on the traits  that
affect measured productivity.
71
   The actions taken by agents might also enter as arguments to this technology.

                                                                                                     43
way, we can model habit formation and capture the notion of arete, effortless performance of

actions, discussed in Aristotle [1956].72

         As emphasized by Mischel and Shoda [1995] and Roberts and Jackson [2008], situations

may change over time as a function of past actions, past situations, investment, information, and

the like. We present this possibility by the following equation of motion:

(17)                                           h v1   v  h v , IN v , a v  .

Past actions may serve to determine the set of present situations. Those situations in turn may

influence current actions.

         Information  v may change over the life cycle through experimentation as well as

through exogenous learning:

(18)                                       v 1   v   v , a v , T v , IN v , h v  .

This learning mechanism incorporates the beliefs of agents about the available data. Thus people

may learn about their environments and themselves in part as a consequence of their own actions

and in part as a consequence of the exogenous arrival of information. Equations of motion (16)-

(18) are very general. We consider special cases of them used in the empirical literature in

Section 8.

         A rich and evolving literature investigates dynamic preferences when agents do not

possess full knowledge of their future environments (see, for example, Hansen [2005], Hansen

and Sargent [2008], Rust [2008], Epstein and Zin [1989], Epstein and Schneider [2003], and

Skiadas [1998]). That literature is too large to summarize in this paper. Preferences need not be




72
   See Lear [2004]. A habit can be defined as effortless performance of a task, i.e., an action that requires no effort.
It is possible to build a stock of traits to sufficient level that one achieves actions effortlessly.

separable over time, and there may be time inconsistency of choices associated with hyperbolic

discounting.73 We discuss commonly used dynamic preference specifications in Section 6.


3.I.       Relationship of the Model in This Section to Existing Models in Personality
           Psychology
Personality psychologists generally do not present formal models. The formalization in this

section is, to our knowledge, the first mathematically precise definition of personality traits and

measured personality. The models we have sketched in this section capture central features of

the major models in personality psychology.

           By its authors’ own admission, the McCrae-Costa [2008] Five Factor Theory is not a

fully articulated model. Their model emphasizes the role of traits T  and, in particular, the Big

Five factors, in producing outcomes and agent actions, and is sketchy about other details. Agents

are assumed to learn about their own traits, but precise learning mechanisms are not discussed.

Expression of traits is affected by the external environment and through social interactions in a

not fully specified fashion. The concept of an evolving information set  v plays a central role in

Five Factor Theory. People learn about their traits through actions and experience, but the exact

mechanisms are not precisely formulated. Equation (18) captures these notions. Situations may

also evolve as a function of actions and experience, but no role is assigned to investment in Five

Factor Theory.

           Thus, a restricted version of (17) formalizes aspects of the Five Factor Theory. The

theory features “characteristic adaptations,” which correspond to the actions and efforts of our

model that also affect the productivity in tasks. The role of preferences is left unspecified.

However, McCrae and Costa explicitly feature rationality (McCrae and Costa [2008, p. 161])

73
     See Kirby and Herrnstein [1995] and Gul and Pesendorfer [2004].
                                               Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                             45
and reject the characterization of flawed human decision making that dominates social

psychology and the field of behavioral economics that was spawned from social psychology.

They explicitly reject a purely situationist explanation of the origin of actions, but they allow for

situations to affect actions. Traits evolve through biological processes (ontogeny), but

investment or experience do not affect the evolution of traits. Thus, the arguments of equation

(16) are shut down, but traits may still exogenously evolve as a function of age and the biology

of the individual. Even though traits evolve as part of an exogeneous maturation process,

persons may learn about themselves (their traits) by taking actions and by being acted on by the

external environment.

           “Social cognitive” theories are rivals to trait theories based on the Big Five.74 Albert

Bandura, Daniel Cervone, and Walter Mischel are central figures in this literature. Roberts’

diagram (Figure 2) captures key aspects of this theory, and Roberts himself can be viewed as a

member of both camps. This line of thinking stresses the role of cognition in shaping personality

and the role of social context in shaping actions and self-knowledge. Authors writing in this

school of thought reject the “cognitive-noncognitive” distinction that is often used in economics.

They view manifest personality as an outcome of cognitive processes. A major role is assigned

to agency—individual goals and motives that produce actions. Their goals and motives are

captured by our  . The arrival of information is captured by  . Although the literature in

personality psychology often contrasts these two schools of thought, to us the lines are not

distinct. Only in one extreme version of the social-cognitive theory are traits are entirely absent.

In that version, agent behavior is entirely shaped by situations. For example, Mischel and Shoda

[2008] focus on the role of situation in shaping actions, efforts, and productivities, but also allow

74
     See Cervone and Pervin [2009].
                                                     Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                   46
for traits to influence actions. The “sociogenomic” model of Roberts and Jackson [2008] also

considers the dynamics of personality formation.

           Thus, both schools of thought accept specification (9) or its extension (10), and both

would be comfortable with response systems (13)-(15). The relative importance of the factors

emphasized by the two schools of thought can only be settled by empirical research. The social-

cognitive theorists tolerate deviations from rationality in their theories, while trait theorists

typically do not.

           Both schools of thought entertain the possibility of learning about oneself. A major

difference between the two groups comes in the role of investment in producing traits. The

social-cognitive theorists feature investment and social interactions as direct determinants of

traits that are assumed to evolve as a function of the experiences of agents. The trait theorists do

not consider this possibility. Instead they emphasize self-learning about traits that evolve by

fixed biological principles unrelated to the experiences of individuals.75

     Cervone [2004] contrasts the two schools of thought.

4.    Measuring Personality

 Unlike other personal traits, like height or weight, personality traits cannot be directly measured.

 Observed productivities, efforts, and actions are used to infer traits. This leads directly to the

 analysis of latent variables and to factor models that underlie much of the analysis of trait

 psychology. This is an area where psychology and the econometrics of measurement error, and

 latent variables more generally, fruitfully interact. Factor models underlie the concepts of

 validity of measurements that are used in psychology.



 4.A.    Linear Factor Models
 Linear factor models are widely used in personality psychology and in psychometric models for

 mental test scores. We review the use of these models in psychology. Versions are already in

 widespread use in economics.76 To capture essential points, we abstract from a lot of the issues

 discussed in Section 3. We consider measurements arising from productivity in tasks. We thus

 focus solely on outputs of tasks, abstracting from actions, efforts, and situations. With suitable

 extensions of the notation used here, we can extend the factor model to the more general models

 discussed in Section 3.

         We assume additive separability of the arguments of equation (1). The stripped down

 model writes task performance of person n on task j , Pn , j , based on traits Tn in the following

 manner:

 (19)                          Pn , j   j   jTn   n , j , n  1,, N , j  1, , J ,




 76
   See, e.g., Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006], Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010], Piatek and Pinger
 [2010], Cattan [2010], and Cunha and Heckman [2008].
                                                       Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                     48
where  j is the mean productivity in the jth task,  j is a vector of factor loadings, and n, j is

other determinants of measured performance, including measurement errors. The number of

components in Tn , L, has to be small relative to J ( L  J ) for the factor model to have any

explanatory power. Otherwise for each task one can create a unique factor and the model

becomes tautological. A purely cognitive task would be associated with zero values of the

components of vector  j on elements of Tn that are associated with personality traits. Factor

model (19) captures the notions that: (a) latent traits Tn generate a variety of outcomes, (b) task

outputs are imperfect measures of the traits Tn  because n, j also determines task output, and

(c) tasks other than tests or observer reports may also proxy the underlying traits, i.e., latent traits

generate both test scores and behaviors. A correlation of outcomes across tasks can arise

because tasks depend on the same vector of traits.77 Outcomes across tasks may be correlated

even if the components of Tn are not.78


4.B.       Discriminant and Convergent Validity
In this simplified framework, most personality psychologists focus on observer- and self-reports

as measures of Pn , j . The measurements are designed to capture a particular trait. As discussed

in Section 3, the choice of which collection of tasks is used to measure a capability

(“operationalization and construct validity”) is an inherently subjective activity. Many

psychologists take a pragmatic, empirical point of view. Traits are what the measurements used


77
     The strength of the correlation depends on the magnitudes of  j and  j  across the two tasks, j and j .
78
  Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] present a nonparametric identification analysis for a general nonseparable
model allowing for measurement error in measures of performance. In the notation of equation (19), they
nonparametrically identify the distribution of Tn and the distribution of n, j , j  1,, J , the latter without
assuming full independence among the measurement errors.
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 49
capture.79 The danger with this empiricist definition is that it offers no guide to the choice of

measurements, which are usually settled by conventions or intuitions.

        The concept of “discriminant validity” of a collection of tasks (e.g., a set of test scores or

a set of observer reports or measurements of productivities) is commonly used to test for

construct validity. This approach exploits the notion that a particular battery of measurements

captures a component of Tn , for example, Tn , l , and not other components. Many measurements

may be taken on Tn , l , and having multiple measurements helps to control for measurement error.

        All measurements are really just outcomes on a type of task although the effort applied

may vary greatly across tasks. The literature in psychology usually assigns a special status to

tests, self-reports, and observer-reports of latent traits, but also uses direct measures of

productivity, such as supervisor ratings.80 Behaviors, tests, observer reports, and self reports all

can be used to proxy the underlying traits. These include repeated measurements on the same

types of assessment mechanisms as well as measurements on different behaviors and

assessments that are assumed to be generated by common traits.81

         A standard approach to defining constructs in personality psychology is based on factor

analysis. This approach takes a set of measurements that are designed to capture a construct, and

measures within-cluster and across-cluster correlations of the measurements to isolate latent

factors Tn ,l , l  1, , L or their distributions. The measurements and clusters of tests are selected

on intuitive grounds or a priori grounds, and not on the basis of any predictive validity in terms

of real-world outcomes (for example, success in college, performance on the job, earnings). This

79
   Borsboom, Mellenbergh and van Heerden [2003] compare the approach taken in Section 3 of defining traits a
priori within a model with the operationalist approach (Bridgman [1959]) of defining a trait by whatever
measurements are available on it. Operationalism begs the question of operationalization and construct validity.
80
   See Groth-Marnat [2009].
81
   Different measurements may load onto different traits.
                                                     Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                   50
process gave rise to the taxonomy of traits that became the Big Five. Because of the somewhat

arbitrary basis of these taxonomies, there is some controversy in psychology about competing

construct systems which we discuss in Section 5. In practice, as we document below, the

requirement of independence of the latent factors across constructs (lack of correlation of tests

across clusters) is not easily satisfied.82 This fuels controversy among psychologists advocating

competing taxonomies.

        To state these issues more formally, let Pnq,l be the qth measurement on trait l for person

n . Using a linear factor representation, the qth measurement of factor l for person n can be

represented as

                                 Pnq,l  lq  lqTn ,l  nq,l ,
(20)
                                 q  1,..., Ql ,      n  1,..., N ,     l  1,..., L .

The factor Tn , l is assumed to be statistically independent of the “measurement errors,” nq,l ,

q  1,..., Ql . Different factors are assumed to be independent ( Tn ,l independent of Tn ,l  for

l  l  ). The measurement errors (or “uniquenesses”) are usually assumed to be mutually

independent within and across constructs.83

        In fact, measurement Pnq,l may depend on other components of Tn , so that the

measurement captures a composite of latent traits. A more general case is

                                  Pnq,l  lq    q  Tn  nq,l ,
                                                        
(21)                                                                   q  1,..., Ql ,




82
   Indeed, as documented in Section 7, the factors associated with personality are also correlated with some
measures of cognitive factors but not all.
83
   The literature in economics relaxes the independence assumptions. See Cunha and Heckman [2008] and Cunha,
Heckman and Schennach [2010] and the literature they cite. They present conditions under which independence is
substantially weakened and identification of factors is still possible.
                                                      Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                    51

where  q is a vector with possibly as many as L nonzero components. The nq,l are assumed to

be independent of Tn and mutually independent within and across constructs ( l and l  are two

constructs). The task has discriminant validity for trait l if the only nonzero component of  q is

                                                                                  84
 lq . The  lq and  lq can depend on measured characteristics of the agent, Qn . The task has

convergent validity if measures within the construct are highly correlated.

           More precisely, conventional psychometric validity of a collection of items or test scores

for different constructs has three aspects. (a) Factor Tl for construct l is statistically

independent of factor Tl  for construct l   l , discriminant validity.85 (b) A factor Tl is assumed

to account for the intercorrelations among the items or tests within a construct l . (c) Item-

specific and random error variance are low (intercorrelations among items are high within a

cluster).86 Criteria (b) and (c) define convergent validity.87


4.C.       Predictive Validity
An alternative criterion for validating measurement systems is based on the predictive power of

the tests for real world outcomes, that is, on behaviors measured outside of the exam room or

observer system. The Hogan Personality Inventory,88 the California Personality Inventory, and

the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were all developed with the specific purpose of



84
     Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004] show how to allow Qn to depend on Tl and still identify the model
85
     This is sometimes weakened to a condition of zero correlation.
86
     Cronbach’s alpha is a widely used measure of intercorrelation among test scores, that is, a measure of importance
                          q
of the variance of the n,l uniquenesses relative to the variance of the factors. See Hogan, Hogan and Roberts
[1996] for a precise definition. Sijtsma [2009] discusses the severe limitations of Cronbach’s alpha.
87
   Nothing in these standard testing procedures guarantees that the measurements that satisfy convergent and
discriminant validity identify a single trait. Multiple traits operating in the same fashion across many outcomes
would produce outcomes and factors that satisfy the criteria. The multiple traits would be captured into a single
factor. Only if different traits differentially affect different outcomes can one identify different traits.

                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                  52
predicting real-world outcomes. Decisions to retain or drop items during the development of

these inventories were based, at least in part, upon the ability of items to predict such outcomes.

This approach has an appealing concreteness about it. Instead of relying on abstract a priori

notions about domains of personality and subjectively defined latent factors generated from test

scores and self and observer personality assessments, it anchors measurements in tangible, real-

world outcomes and constructs explicit tests with predictive power. Yet this approach has its

own problems.

         First, all measurements of factor T n , l can claim incremental predictive validity as long as

each measurement is subject to error  nq, l  0  . Proxies for Tn , l can appear to be separate

determinants (or “causes”) instead of surrogates for an underlying one-dimensional construct or

factor. Thus suppose that measurement system (20) is the correct specification and that a set of

measurements display both convergent and discriminant validity. As long as there are

measurement errors for construct l , there is no limit to the number of proxies for Tn , l that will

show up as statistically significant predictors of an outcome.89 For this reason, it is necessary to

correct for measurement error in using predictive validity to identify and measure traits.

         A second problem with this approach to validation is reverse causality. This is especially

problematic when interpreting correlations between personality measurements and outcomes.

Outcomes may influence personality measures as well as the other way around. For example,

self-esteem might increase income, and income might increase self-esteem. Measuring

personality traits prior to measuring predicted outcomes does not necessarily solve this problem.

For example, the anticipation of a future pay raise may increase present self-esteem.

89
  This is a standard result in the econometrics of measurement error. See, e.g., Aigner, Hsiao, Kapteyn et al.
[1984].

         Psychologists sometimes address the problem of reverse causality by using early

measures of traits determined well before the outcomes are measured to predict later outcomes.90

This approach is problematic if the traits the analyst seeks to identify evolve over time and the

contemporary values of traits drive behavior. This practice trades a reverse causality problem

with a version of an errors in variables problem. Early measures of the traits may be poor

proxies for the traits that drive measured current behavior. In our review of the literature in

Section 7, we distinguish studies that attempt to control for reverse causality and those that do

not.

         Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Urzua [2008] demonstrate the importance of

correcting for reverse causality arising from schooling affecting traits and traits affecting

schooling in interpreting the effects of personality tests on a variety of socioeconomic outcomes.

Application of econometric techniques for determining the causal effects of factors on outcomes

makes a distinctive contribution to psychology.

         Many psychologists focus on prediction, not causality.91 Establishing predictive validity

will often be enough to achieve the goal of making personnel assignment and student placement

decisions.92 However, for policy analysis, including analyses of new programs designed to

augment the skills of the disadvantaged, causal models are required in order to generate policy

counterfactuals.93

         The papers of Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Cunha and Heckman [2008],

develop frameworks for circumventing the problems that arise in using predictive validity to

90
   This approach is based on the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy.
91
   There is a long tradition in psychology of conducting predictive analysis based on factor analysis (see, for
example, the essays in Cudeck and MacCullum [2007]), but there is no systematic treatment of the problem of
reverse causality in that field.

                                                                                                 54
define and measure personality constructs. These frameworks recognize the problem of

measurement error in the proxies for constructs. Constructs are created on the basis of how well

latent factors predict outcomes not direct measures. They develop frameworks for testing

discriminant validity. They allow the factors across different clusters of constructs to be

correlated and show how to test for the presence of correlations across the factors.

         They use an extension of factor analysis to represent proxies for low-dimensional factors.

They test for the number of latent factors required to fit the data and rationalize the proxies.94

Generalizing the analysis of Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004], Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua

[2006] allow for lifetime experiences and investments to determine, in part, the coefficients of

the factor model and to affect the factor itself. Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] and

Cunha and Heckman [2008] allow for the latent factor to determine investment and experience.

They correct estimates of latent factors on outcomes for the effects of spurious feedback, and

separate proxies from factors. The factors are estimated to change over the life cycle as a

consequence of experience and investment. We review these studies in Sections 7 and 8.


4.D.     Faking
“Faking” may corrupt measurements designed to proxy latent factors. There are at least two

types of false responses: those arising from impression management and those arising from self-

deception (Paulhus [1984]). For example, individuals who know that their responses on a

personality questionnaire will be used to make hiring decisions may deliberately exaggerate their

strengths and downplay their weaknesses.95 Subconscious motives to see themselves as virtuous

may produce the same faking behavior, even when responses are anonymous. It is possible to

94
   Conti, Heckman, Lopes et al. [2010] discuss alternative approaches to selecting the number of latent factors. See
also Cragg and Donald [1997].

   See Viswesvaran and Ones [1999]; and Sternberg [2001; Sternberg, Forsythe, Hedlund et al. [2000].

                                                                                               55
fake Conscientiousness on a self-report questionnaire, whereas it is impossible to fake superior

reasoning ability on an IQ test. To a lesser degree, a similar bias may also operate in cognitive

tests. Persons who know that their test scores will affect personnel or admissions decisions may

try harder. The literature on “stereotype threat” shows that the framing of an achievement test

can affect the performance of the test taker.96 Some evidence suggests that faking has a

surprisingly minimal effect on predicting job performance.97 Correcting for faking using scales

designed to measure deliberate lying does not seem to improve predictive validity.98

Nevertheless, when measuring cognitive and personality traits, as noted in Section 3, one should

standardize for incentives and environment.

        The linear factor model does not capture a variety of interesting interactions among traits.

Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] and the papers they cite develop a nonlinear non-normal

factor analysis that allows for measurement errors to be correlated across measures and over

time. We report estimates based on their nonlinear factor analyses in Section 8.


4.E.    The Causal Status of Latent Variables
Some psychologists question the causal status of latent variables extracted from factor analyses

of measurements across individuals.99 Such factor analytic studies summarize interindividual

variation but do not necessarily inform analysts about the effects of exogenously changing the

factor in producing outcomes across individuals. In addition, variations of traits within persons

may have very different effects than variations across persons.

        The distinction between the effects of changing traits within and across persons is

traditional in econometrics.100 Econometric models that capture this distinction could be

fruitfully applied to psychology. So can hierarchical linear models.101

        These methods do not address the deeper problem that most of the estimates of “the

effects” of psychological traits on outcomes (either from “within” or “across” studies) have no

causal status. Structural equation methods have been used to estimate causal relationships using

cross-person variation. They rely on the usual toolkit of simultaneous equations exclusion

restrictions to secure identification.102 Standard experimental and econometric techniques for

inferring causality from within person changes have only recently been applied to generate

causal effects of personality.103 We review this literature in Section 8.

5.     Implementing the Measurement Systems


 How do psychologists measure individual differences? In this section we analyze the major

 measurement systems for cognition and personality. We examine the relative performance of

 cognition and personality in predicting a variety of outcomes. For cognition, there is a fairly

 well-established set of terminologies and conventions. Aptitude tests are designed to measure

 differences in the rates at which individuals learn (i.e., fluid intelligence). Achievement tests are

 designed to measure acquired knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence). For personality, a

 variety of alternative measurement systems are proposed, and this is a source of confusion. We

 attempt to compare and equate these systems of measurement. We link them to measures of

 childhood temperament and psychopathology which are also used to describe individual

 differences. We note that the problems of operationalization and construct validity are present in

 analyzing any measures of traits.



 5.A.     Cognition
 Intelligence (also called cognitive ability and general mental ability) is defined by psychologists

 to include the “ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to

 learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking

 thought” (Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard et al. [1996, p. 77]).104 These are clearly distinct traits,

 and the literature distinguishes more finely among them. The term “IQ” is often used

 synonymously with intelligence but in fact refers specifically to scores on intelligence tests.


 104
    Psychologists have attempted to broaden the concept of intelligence beyond this list. Most notably, Gardner
 [2004] suggests that the notion of intelligence should also include creativity and the ability to solve practical, real-
 world problems. He includes in his theory of multiple intelligences, musical intelligence, kinaesthetic intelligence,
 and interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligence, among others.
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                58
Notwithstanding a century of active study and general agreement about the sorts of tasks on

which more intelligent individuals perform better, the construct of intelligence “resists a

consensual definition.”105

        Scores on different tests of cognitive ability tend to be highly correlated, with half or

more of the variance of diverse tests accounted for by a single general factor labeled “g” and

more specific mental abilities loading on other factors.106 g is widely interpreted as general

mental ability.107 An extreme version of g-theory that is no longer widely accepted is that g

accounts for all the correlation among different tests of cognition.108

        Psychometricians have expanded this notion to create a hierarchy of “orders.” The order

of a factor indicates its generality in explaining a variety of tests of cognitive ability deemed to

satisfy construct validity. Tests have different emphases (for example, verbal ability, numeracy,

coding speed, and other tasks). A first-order factor is predictive in all cognitive tasks, j=1,..., J

in equation (19). In modern parlance this general correlation is called “ g ,” but it is no longer

viewed as the sole predictor of cognitive test scores. A lower-order factor is predictive of

performance in only some tasks. Lower-order factors can be correlated with the higher-order

factors and may be correlated with each other. They have independent predictive power from the

higher-order factors. Figure 3 reports one possible partition of general intelligence due to

Ackerman and Heggestad [1997], who summarize the work of Carroll [1993] on the multiple

facets of intelligence.109

Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence

There is less agreement about the number and identity of lower-order factors.110 Carroll [1993]

proposed a general intelligence factor g and several more specific second-order factors,

including, but not limited to, what Cattell [1971; 1987] dubbed crystallized and fluid

intelligence. Crystallized intelligence, Cattell proposed, comprises acquired skills and knowledge

and thus is partly dependent upon educational opportunity and motivation. Fluid intelligence, by

contrast, is a general “relation-perceiving ability” (p. 138). Cattell’s student Rindermann [2007]

elaborates:

         “Fluid intelligence is the ability to perceive complex relations, educe complex

         correlates, form concepts, develop aids, reason, abstract, and maintain span of

         immediate apprehension in solving novel problems in which advanced elements of

         the collective intelligence of the culture were not required for solution” (p. 462).

In contrast, crystallized intelligence is the same class of skills, “but in materials in which past

appropriation of the collective intelligence of the culture would give one a distinct advantage in

solving the problems involved” (p. 462).

         Carroll [1993] and Horn and McArdle [2007] summarize the large body of evidence

against the claim that a single factor g is sufficient to explain the correlation structure of

achievement and intelligence tests. 111 Two pieces of evidence are worth highlighting. First,

crystallized intelligence tends to increase monotonically for most of the life cycle, whereas fluid

110
    Carroll [1993] analyzed 477 data sets and estimated a structure with g as the highest-order factor, eight second-
order ability clusters, and over 70 more narrowly defined third-order abilities on a variety of different tests.
Alternative hierarchical models, also with g as the highest-order factor, have been proposed (for example, Lubinski
[2004]; Horn [1970]).
111
    Recent research by Ardila, Pineda and Rosselli [2000] shows that more than one factor is required to summarize
the predictive power of cognitive tests in economic data. This could be due to the existence of multiple intellective
factors or because personality factors affect the measurement of cognitive factors as we discuss later on in this
section.
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                  61
intelligence tends to peak in very early adulthood then to decline.112 Second, the well-known

Flynn effect, which documents the population-wide increase in performance on intelligence tests

over the past half-century, is particularly dramatic for measures of fluid intelligence but much

smaller for measures of crystallized intelligence.113 SAT scores have declined rather than

increased over the same period, requiring a renorming in the 1990s.

         The relative weighting of fluid versus crystallized intelligence varies among tests

according to the degree to which prior experience is crucial to performance. These second order

factors are correlated with the first-order factor g but also contribute additional explanatory

power to predicting some clusters of test score outcomes. Achievement tests, like the Armed

Forces Qualifying Test used by economists and psychologists alike, are heavily weighted

towards crystallized intelligence,114 whereas tests like the Raven Progressive Matrices [1962] are

heavily weighted towards fluid intelligence.115 Several studies have shown that fluid intelligence

is much more strongly related to g than are measures of crystallized intelligence.116 Moreover,

lay intuitions of intelligence (i.e., what most people mean by “being smart”) correspond more

closely with the ability to learn than with possession of already acquired knowledge.117 Thus, it

seems to us useful to reserve the term “intelligence tests” for tests that primarily measure fluid

intelligence, and the term “achievement tests” for tests that primarily measure crystallized

intelligence. Some would argue that g has been usurped by fluid intelligence. A closer reading

    Raven, Raven and Court [1988 ]. Conti and Pudney [2007] uses data on intelligence and achievement tests
across nations to show that a single factor accounts for 94-95 percent of the variance across both kinds of tests. The
high correlation between intelligence and achievement tests is in part due to the fact that both require cognitive
ability and knowledge, even if to different degrees, that common developmental factors may affect both of these
traits, and that fluid intelligence promotes the acquisition of crystallized intelligence.

Predictive Validity of Tests of Cognition

How well do IQ and achievement tests predict success in life? This is a hard question to answer.

Many different skills are required to achieve success in any task.118 Different tasks in life require

different skills in different degrees.119 Table 2 shows the domains of validation and the

estimated validities of a number of widely used tests of cognition. Notice that the domains of

validation differ greatly. For IQ tests, the validities are usually established by comparing test

scores with other test scores or with grades in school and not success in life. Nevertheless, it is

well-established that standardized tests of ability and achievement predict objectively measured

academic, occupational, and life outcomes.120

        The SAT college entrance exam is moderately successful in predicting grades in

college—which was what the SAT was designed to do.121 However, high school grades are

better predictors of college performance.122 The rival American College Test (ACT) is validated

in a similar fashion but uses somewhat broader measures of college performance, such as grades

in higher years of college rather than just freshman year grades.123 The Graduate Record Exam

is validated by performance in graduate school.124 The Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) is

validated by performance in the military. Performance is measured by success in military

5.B.    Personality Traits
We have noted in Sections 2 and 3 that sharp contrasts between cognition and personality are not

easy to make. Consider, for example, the so-called “quasi-cognitive” traits (Kyllonen, Walters

and Kaufman [2005]). These include creativity (Csikszentmihalyi [1996]), emotional intelligence

(Mayer and Salovey [1997]), cognitive style (Stanovich [1999]; Perkins and Tishman [2001]),

typical intellectual engagement (Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]), and practical intelligence

(Sternberg, Forsythe, Hedlund et al. [2000]). Furthermore, the Big Five factor of Openness to

Experience has as facets curiosity (“ideas”) and imagination (“fantasy”) that are often associated

with intellect and measured intelligence.127 (See the entries under Openness in Table 3.) We

note in Section 5.C that personality can affect performance on tests of fluid intelligence.

Personality traits also affect acquired skills and knowledge (i.e., crystallized intelligence).128 A

general pattern is higher correlation of personality tests with tests of crystallized knowledge (e.g.,

achievement tests).129 For many personality traits and for measures of cognition that are based

on fluid intelligence, the correlations are close to zero, as we note below.

        Finally, consider the construct of executive function. “Cognitive control” and “executive

function” are terms used interchangeably, primarily in the neuroscience literature. Both have

been defined as the voluntary, effortful blocking of a habitual behavior in order to execute a less

familiar behavior.130 Some authors (e.g., Gray [2004]) also use the terms “cognitive control” and

“self-control” interchangeably, though self-control is traditionally considered a personality trait

rather than an aspect of cognition. While tasks requiring executive function are related to

questionnaire measures of self-control, the size of these associations is only about

r  0.11 to 0.14 .(Duckworth and Schulze [2009]).

        A region of the brain called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), in conjunction with

the nearby region called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), are now understood as responsible

for “executive control” over lower order processes.131 That is, executive control entails top-

down, intentional control of behavior and is not necessary for the performance of simple,

automatic tasks (Miller and Cohen [2001]). The PFC achieves structural and functional maturity

later than other (e.g., sensorimotor) brain regions (Casey, Tottenham, Liston et al. [2005]).

Specific executive functions attributed to the PFC include abstract reasoning, planning, decision

making, working memory (the ability to keep the facts of a problem at hand), attention, conflict

monitoring, task switching, and inhibition of prepotent (i.e., dominant, habitual) impulses. While

many functions have been attributed to the PFC, Miller [2000] notes that “there is little

agreement on the cardinal prefrontal functions” (p. 449). Nevertheless, there is some consensus

that one can distinguish between working memory on the one hand, and response inhibition and

task switching on the other (Garon, Bryson and Smith [2008], Miyake, Friedman, Emerson et al.

[2000]). This distinction is important because working memory is highly related to performance

on measures of fluid intelligence.132 Being able to access to all of the data about a problem is

helpful in solving it. Thus, working memory is a common component of the constructs of both

executive function and general intelligence.133

        While the construct of executive function demonstrates the inadequacy of terms such as

“cognitive” and “non-cognitive”, many personality traits nevertheless are conceptually and

empirically easily distinguished from general cognitive ability. Most personality traits are in fact

very weakly correlated with IQ (Webb [1915]; McCrae and Costa [1994]; Stankov [2005];

Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]). Thus, regardless of the terms used to describe individual

differences that determine life outcomes, one thing is clear: human ability entails more than

intelligence. Personality traits, however defined, do matter, and they have independent predictive

power from standard measures of intelligence.


5.C.    Operationalizing the Concepts
Intelligence tests are routinely used in a variety of settings including business, education, civil

service, and the military.134 Psychometricians attempt to use test scores to measure a factor (a

component of T in the notation of Section 4). The working hypothesis in the intelligence testing

business is that specific tests measure only a single component of T , and that tests with different

“content domains” measure different components. We first discuss the origins of the

measurement systems for intelligence and we then discuss their validity.135



IQ Tests

Modern intelligence tests have been used for just over a century, beginning with the decision of a

French minister of public instruction to identify retarded pupils in need of specialized education

programs. In response, Alfred Binet created the first IQ test.136 Other pioneers in intelligence

testing include Cattell [1890] and Galton [1883], both of whom developed tests of basic

cognitive functions (for example, discriminating between objects of different weights). These

135
    See Roberts, Markham, Matthews et al. [2005] for a more complete history of intelligence testing.
136
    In 1904, La Société Libre pour l’Etude Psychologique de l’Enfant appointed a commission to create a mechanism
for identifying these pupils in need of alternative education led by Binet. See Herrnstein and Murray [1994] for an
overview of Binet’s life and work.

                                                                                                    68
early tests were eventually rejected in favor of tests that attempt to tap higher mental processes.

Terman [1916] adapted Binet’s IQ test for use with American populations. Known as the

Stanford-Binet IQ test, Terman’s adaptation was, like the original French test, used primarily to

predict academic performance. Stanford-Binet test scores were presented as ratios of mental age

to chronological age multiplied by 100. IQ scores centered at 100 as the average are now

conventional for most intelligence tests.

           Wechsler [1939] noted two major limitations of the Stanford-Binet test. First, it was

overly reliant on verbal skills and, therefore, dependent upon formal education and cultural

exposure. Second, the ratio of mental to chronological age was an inappropriate metric for adults

(Boake [2002]). Wechsler created a new intelligence test battery divided into verbal subtests

(e.g., similarities) and performance subtests (e.g., block design, matrix reasoning). He also

replaced the ratio IQ score with deviation scores that have the same normal distribution at each

age. This test, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)—and, later, the Wechsler

Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)—produces two different IQ subscores, verbal IQ and

performance IQ, which sum to a full-scale IQ score. The WAIS and the WISC have for the past

several decades been by far the most commonly used IQ tests.

           Similar to Wechsler’s Matrix Reasoning subtest, the Raven Progressive Matrices test is a

so-called “culture-free” IQ test because it does not depend heavily on verbal skills or other

knowledge explicitly taught during formal education. Each matrix test item presents a pattern of

abstract figures.137 The test taker must choose the missing part.138 If subjects have not had

exposure to such visual puzzles, the Raven test is an almost pure measure of fluid intelligence.

However, the assumption that subjects are unfamiliar with such puzzles is not typically tested. It

                                                                                                    69
is likely that children from more educated families or from more developed countries have more

exposure to such abstract puzzles (Blair [2006]). Our view is that to varying degrees, IQ and

achievement tests reflect fluid intelligence, crystallized intelligence, and personality factors, such

as motivation, to succeed on the test. We offer evidence on the effect of motivation on test

scores below in Section 5.E.


5.D.       Personality Constructs
Dominant theories of personality assume a hierarchical structure analogous to that found for

intelligence. However, despite early efforts to identify a g for personality (for example, Webb

[1915]), even the most parsimonious personality models incorporate more than one factor. The

most widely accepted taxonomy of personality traits is the Big Five.139 The Big Five factors are

obtained from conventional factor analysis using a version of (19) where the “tests” are measures

of different domains of personality based on observer reports or self reports.

           The five-factor model has its origins in Allport and Odbert’s [1936] lexical hypothesis,

which posits that the most important individual differences are encoded in language. Allport and

Odbert combed English dictionaries and found 17,953 personality-describing words, which were

later reduced to 4,504 personality-describing adjectives. Subsequently, several different

psychologists working independently and on different samples concluded that personality traits

can be organized into five superordinate factors.

           Table 3 presents the Big Five factors that were discussed in Section 2. It summarizes the

30 lower-level facets (six facets for each of five factors) identified in the Revised NEO

Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R, Costa and McCrae [1992b]). The acronym is shorthand for

Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness to Experience—Personality Inventory—Revised. Of

course, these lower-level facets (e.g., “impulsive”) can be further subdivided into even more

narrow traits (“impulsive about junk food,” “impulsive about smoking”). The more narrowly

defined a trait, the more specific are the contexts in which the trait is predictive. In parentheses in

the third column of Table 3, we have included a strongly related trait adjective. In the fourth

column of Table 3, we present other traits in each family. In the fifth column, we relate the Big

Five to children’s temperament traits studied by developmental psychologists.

         Temperament is the term used by developmental psychologists to describe the behavioral

tendencies of infants and children.140 Because individual differences in temperament emerge so

early in life, these traits have traditionally been assumed to be biological (as opposed to

environmental) in origin.141 However, findings in behavioral genetics suggest that, like adult

personality, temperament is only partly heritable, and as discussed in Section 8, both adult and

child measured traits are affected by the environment.

         Temperament is studied primarily by child and developmental psychologists, while

personality is studied by adult personality psychologists. The past decade has seen some

convergence of these two research traditions, however, and there is evidence that temperamental

differences observed during the preschool years anticipate adult personality and interpersonal

functioning decades later (for example, Caspi [2000]; Newman, Caspi, Moffitt et al. [1997];

Shiner and Caspi [2003]). Column 5 of Table 3 displays temperament traits that have been

associated both theoretically and empirically with adult personality traits.

         Historically, many temperament researchers examined specific lower-order traits rather

than broader, higher-level factors that characterize studies of adult intelligence and

personality.142 Shiner [1998] suggests that “there is therefore a great need to bring order to this

vast array of studies of single lower-level traits” (p. 320). Recently, taxonomies of temperament


140
    See Caspi and Shiner [2006] and Zentner and Bates [2008] for a discussion of varying perspectives on
temperament, including a summary of points where major theorists converge.
141
    Indeed, some psychologists use the term “temperament” to indicate all aspects of personality that are biological
in origin. They study temperament in both children and adults.
142
    Measuring temperament presents unique methodological challenges. Self-report measures, by far the most widely
used measure for adult personality, are not appropriate for young children for obvious reasons. One strategy is to ask
parents and teachers to rate the child’s overt behavior (for example, California Child Q-sort), but informants can
only guess what a child might be thinking and feeling. Infants present a special challenge because their behavioral
repertoire is so limited. One strategy is to place infants in a standard situation and code reactions under a
standardized scenario (for example, the Strange Situation, which is used to distinguish infants who are securely
attached to their caregiver versus insecurely attached). Young children can be interviewed using puppets or stories.
For obvious reasons, all measures of temperament are more difficult and more expensive to collect than adult self-
report measures. This may explain the absence of large-sample studies of child temperament.

have been proposed that group lower-order traits into higher-order dimensions; several of these

taxonomies resemble the Big Five (for example, John, Caspi, Robins et al. [1994]; Putnam, Ellis

and Rothbart [2001]; Rothbart, Ahadi and Evans [2000]; Shiner and Caspi [2003]). However,

compared to adults, there seem to be fewer ways that young children can differ from one another.

Child psychologists often refer to the “elaboration” or “differentiation” of childhood

temperament into the full flower of complex, adult personality. The lack of direct

correspondence between measures of temperament and measures of adult personality presents a

challenge to researchers interested in documenting changes in personality over the full life cycle.

Developing the required measures is an active area of research.



Alternatives to the Big Five

The Five-Factor model is not without its critics. Alternative systems have been proposed. For

example, Eysenck [1991] offers a model with just three factors (i.e., Neuroticism, Extraversion,

and Psychoticism). Cloninger [1987] and Tellegen [1985] offer different three-factor models.

Figure 4 shows the commonalities across some competing taxonomies and also areas of

divergence. Solutions with more factors can increase the prediction of outcomes including job

performance, income, and change in psychiatric status (Mershon and Gorsuch [1988]). On the

other hand, more parsimonious models in which the five factors are reduced to two “metatraits”

have also been suggested (Digman [1997]). In addition to these controversies, the facet-level

organization of any given Big Five factor is subject to debate and controversy.

        Recent research suggests that the rush to accept the Big Five may be premature.143 The

first studies of the Big Five were based primarily on English speaking samples. And, although

the Big Five structure appears to replicate across many cultures (McCrae and Costa [1997b]),

studies of more diverse cultures show that taxonomies known as the Big Six (Ashton, Lee,

Perugini et al. [2004]) or the Multi-Language Seven (ML7; Saucier [2003]), may better represent

the personality domain. While they add one or two dimensions to the Big Five and shift the

meaning of the Big Five slightly, they are, however, not very different from the Big Five.144

        One of the most stinging criticisms of the Five-Factor model is that it is atheoretical

(Block [1995]). It is derived from factor analysis of a variety of measures without any firm

biological underpinnings. While research is under way on determining the neural substrates of

the Big Five (see Canli [2006] and DeYoung, Hirsh, Shane et al. [2010]), the finding that

descriptions of behavior as measured by tests, self-reports, and reports of observers cluster

reliably into five groups has not so far been satisfactorily explained by any scientifically

grounded theory.

        Some psychologists suggest that the categories are too crude to be useful. Estimates

based on the Big Five factors obscure relationships between specific facets of the Big Five and

outcomes.145 Given that each Big Five factor is a composite of distinct facets, the predictive

validities are diluted when analyses consider only factor-level aggregate scores. For instance,

Paunonen and Ashton [2001] compared Big Five Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience

with two related facets, need for achievement and need for understanding. In each comparison,

the lower-level facet predicted course grades among undergraduates better than its higher-level

factor measure.

            The Five-Factor model is largely silent about motivation. In the notation of Section 3, 

parameterizes preferences and goals. The omission of motivation (that is, what people value or

desire) from measures of Big Five traits is not complete, however. The NEO-PI-R, for example,

includes as a facet “achievement striving”. Individual differences in motivation were more

prominent in older (now rarely used) measures of personality. The starting point for Jackson’s

Personality Research Form (PRF; Jackson [1974]), for example, was Murray’s [1938] theory of

basic human drives. Included in the PRF are scales for (need for) play, order, autonomy,

achievement, affiliation, social recognition, and safety. The Schwartz Values Survey (Schwartz

[1992]) is another self-report measure of motivation which yields scores on ten different

motivations including power, achievement, benevolence, and conformity. Some motivation

theorists believe that one’s deepest desires are unconscious and, therefore, may dispute the

practice of measuring motivation using self-report questionnaires (see McClelland, Koestner and

Weinberger [1989]). For a brief review of this debate and an overview of how motivation and

personality trait measures differ, see Roberts, Harms, Smith et al. [2006].

            A practical problem facing the analyst who wishes to measure personality is the

multiplicity of personality questionnaires. The proliferation of personality measures reflects, in

part, the more heterogeneous nature of personality in comparison to cognitive ability, although,

as we have seen, various types of cognitive ability have been distinguished in the literature.146

The panoply of measures and constructs also points to the relatively recent and incomplete

convergence of personality psychologists on the Big Five model, as well as the lack of consensus

146
      See, for example, Carroll [1993].

among researchers about identifying and organizing lower-order facets of the Big Five factors

(see DeYoung, Quilty and Peterson [2007] and Hofstee, de Raad and Goldberg [1992]). For

example, some theorists argue that impulsivity is a facet of Neuroticism (Costa and McCrae

[1992b]), others claim that it is a facet of Conscientiousness (Roberts, Chernyshenko, Stark et al.

[2005]), and still others suggest that it is a blend of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and perhaps

Neuroticism (Revelle [1997]). Figure 4 shows in italics facets of the Big Five whose

classifications are under question. One reason for the proliferation of measures is the variety of

alternative methodologies for verifying tests discussed in Section 4 which are not guaranteed to

produce the same taxonomies.


 5.D.1.      Self-Esteem and Locus of Control Are Related to Big Five Emotional Stability
The traits of self-esteem and locus of control deserve special attention since they are collected in

large-sample longitudinal studies used by economists.147 They are not part of the traditional Big

Five typology. However, they can be related to it.

        Self-esteem refers to an individual’s subjective estimation of his or her own worth. An

example item from the widely-used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg [1989]) asks

respondents to indicate their agreement with the statement, “I feel that I am a person of worth, at

least on an equal plane with others.” Locus of control refers to one’s belief about whether the

determinants of one’s life events are largely internal or external. Those with an internal (as

opposed to external) locus of control believe that life events are typically caused by their own

actions. An example item from the widely-used Rotter Locus of Control Scale (Rotter [1966])




147
   See, e.g., NLSY79 based studies Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al.
[2010]. The German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP) also collects these measures.
                                             Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                           78
requires respondents to choose between “Many of the unhappy things in people’s lives are partly

due to bad luck” and “People’s misfortunes result from the mistakes they make.”

       For the most part, researchers who study self-esteem and locus of control have carried out

their work in isolation of each other and without reference to the Big Five taxonomy. However,

Judge and colleagues (Judge, Bono, Erez et al. [2005]; Judge, Erez, Bono et al. [2002]; Judge

and Hurst [2007]) have proposed that locus of control, self-esteem, and Big Five Emotional

Stability are indicators of a common construct, termed core self-evaluations. They point out that

measures of these three traits, as well as generalized self-efficacy (the belief that one can act

effectively to bring about desired results) demonstrate high convergent validity, poor

discriminant validity, and poor incremental predictive validity. Positive core self-evaluations

indicate a generally positive and proactive view of oneself and one’s relationship to the world.

Accordingly, we have, in Table 3, associated aspects of core self-evaluations with the Big Five

factors of Neuroticism and Emotional Stability.


 5.D.2.       Relating the Big Five to Measures of Psychopathology
Extreme manifestations of personality traits may be a form of mental illness. Thus, a very

conscientious person may be viewed as an obsessive compulsive person. It is of interest to

consider how psychopathology may be characterized using the Big Five.

          Psychopathology is defined by the APA dictionary as “patterns of behavior or thought

processes that are abnormal or maladaptive.” Used interchangeably with the terms mental illness

and mental disorder, psychopathology is primarily studied by psychiatrists and clinical

psychologists. Historically, the study of psychopathology was carried out in near complete

isolation from the study of “normal” variation in personality. Very recently, however, several

attempts have been made to integrate taxonomies of psychopathology and normal personality
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                79
into a single framework. In particular, a compelling argument can be made for conceptualizing of

and measuring mental disorders as extreme variants of personality traits (see Krueger and Eaton

[2010] and ensuing commentary). This approach is quite revolutionary in the study of

psychopathology in at least two ways. First, it takes a dimensional as opposed to categorical

characterization of mental disorders. By a dimensional approach, psychologists mean that traits

lie on an underlying continuum and are not discrete valued. Second, the recent research relies

upon structural validity (e.g., evidence of convergent and discriminant validity) rather than

historical path dependency (e.g., diagnoses that persist because they are familiar to clinicians

who learned about them during their training).

            The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association

distinguishes between Axis I disorders, which are acute disorders requiring clinical attention

(e.g., depression, schizophrenia) and Axis II disorders148, 10 personality disorders that are more

chronic and, generally, less impairing of overall functioning. Research has documented that Big

Five Neuroticism is a non-specific correlate of various Axis I disorders, and that various other

reliable associations can be documented (e.g., the positive emotionality facet of Extraversion is

associated with bipolar disorder); however, the direction of causality is difficult to ascertain in

what have typically been cross-sectional studies (Bagby, Bindseil, Schuller et al. [1997;

Cloninger, Svrakic, Bayon et al. [1999; Gunderson, Triebwasser, Phillips et al. [1999]). Twin

studies demonstrate that the shared variance in mental disorders and personality traits is

predominantly genetic – that is, common genetic antecedents give rise to certain mental disorders

and personality traits.




148
      Axis II also includes mental retardation.
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                          80
          More research has examined relations between Axis II disorders and normal personality

variation. Several authors have proposed a Big Four taxonomy (the Big Five minus Openness to

Experience). Watson, Clark and Chmielewski [2008] proposed that a fifth factor called Oddity is

needed to model traits related to eccentricity. Others have argued that the Big Five structure

itself, without modification, can account for Axis II personality disorders (Widiger and Costa Jr.

[2002]; Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]). For instance, Widiger, Trull, Clarkin et al. [2002]

suggest that all Axis II personality disorders can be “translated as maladaptively extreme variants

of the 30 facets” of the NEO-PI-R, a widely used Big Five personality inventory. More

recently, Samuel and Widiger [2008] completed a meta-analytic review of the relationships

between facets of the NEO-PI-R and Axis II personality disorders which we reproduce in Table

4. Notably, personality disorders relate to multiple facets spanning more than one Big Five

factor.

5.E.       IQ and Achievement Test Scores Reflect Incentives and Capture Both Cognitive and
           Personality Traits
We now elaborate on the discussion of Section 3 on the difficulty of isolating a pure measure of

intelligence. Performance on intelligence and achievement tests depends in part on personality

traits of the test taker, as well as their motivation to perform.149 A smart child unable to sit still

during an exam or uninterested in exerting much effort can produce spuriously low scores on an

IQ test.

           It is sometimes claimed that IQ tests measure maximal performance, i.e. that IQ scores

reflect the application of the maximal capacity of the person to the test.150 The analysis of

Section 3 suggests that IQ scores should be standardized for effort. A series of studies conducted

over the past 40 years support this concern.

           These studies show that among individuals with low IQ scores, performance on IQ tests

could be increased up to a full standard deviation by offering incentives such as money or candy,

particularly on group-administered tests and particularly with individuals at the low-end of the

IQ spectrum.151 Engaging in complex thinking is effortful, not automatic (Schmeichel, Vohs and

Baumeister [2003]), and therefore motivation to exert effort affects performance. Zigler and

Butterfield [1968] found that early intervention (nursery school, for example) for low-SES kids

may have a beneficial effect on motivation, not on cognitive ability per se. In their study, the

benefits of intervention (in comparison to a no-treatment control group) on IQ were not apparent

under testing conditions where motivation to perform well was maximal. Raver and Zigler


149
    It is likely that performance on personality tests can also depend on cognitive ability, but that is less well
documented. For example, it is likely that more intelligent people can ascertain the rewards to performance on a
personality inventory test. Motivation is sometimes, but not usually, counted as a personality trait.
150
    A leading psychometrician, Carroll [1993], does not accept the notion that IQ captures maximal effort.
151
    The incentives for invoking effort vary across studies.

[1997] present further evidence on this point. Table 5 summarizes evidence that extrinsic

incentives can substantially improve performance on tests of cognitive ability, especially among

low-IQ individuals.152




152
      The studies do not include direct measures of personality traits.

           Segal [2008] shows that introducing performance-based cash incentives in a low-stakes

administration of the coding speed test of the Armed Services Vocational Battery (ASVAB)

increases performance substantially among roughly one-third of participants. Men with lower

levels of Conscientiousness are particularly affected by incentives. Segal’s work and a large

body of related work emphasize heterogeneity in the motivations that affect human performance.
                                                       Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                     87
Borghans, Meijers and ter Weel [2008] show that adults spend substantially more time answering

IQ questions when rewards are higher, but subjects high in Emotional Stability and

Conscientiousness are less affected by these incentives. They already operate at a high level

even without these incentives. Similarly, Pailing and Segalowitz [2004] find that an event-

related potential (ERP) indexing the emotional response to making an error increases in

amplitude when incentives are offered for superior test performance. 153 This effect is smaller for

individuals high in Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability. Thus, IQ scores do not accurately

reflect maximal intellectual performance for individuals who are low in Conscientiousness and

Emotional Stability. Performance on IQ tests encodes, in part, how effective persons may be in

application of their intelligence, that is, how people are likely to perform in a real-world setting.

However, it is far from obvious that motivation on an exam and motivation in a real-world

situation are the same.

            Like low motivation, test anxiety can significantly impair performance (Hembree

[1988]). That is, subjects do worse when they worry excessively about how they are performing

and when their autonomic nervous system over-reacts by increasing perspiration, heart rate, and

so on. Because individuals who are higher in Big Five Neuroticism are more likely to experience

test anxiety, there is another reason, beyond incentives, why Emotional Stability can impact IQ

scores (Moutafi, Furnham and Tsaousis [2006]).

            Many IQ tests require factual knowledge acquired through schooling and life experience,

which are, in part, determined by the motivation, curiosity, and persistence of the test taker.

Thus, personality traits can also affect IQ scores indirectly through the knowledge acquired by

individuals who are higher in Big Five Openness to Experience and Big Five Conscientiousness.

      An ERP is an electrophysiological response of characteristic form and timing to a particular category of stimuli.

                                                                                                88
Cunha and Heckman [2008] show a correlation between cognitive and personality factors of the

order of r  0.3 . Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004], and Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua

[2006] show how schooling and other acquired traits substantially causally affect measured

cognitive and personality test scores. We discuss this research in Section 8. Cattell’s investment

theory [1971] anticipates recent findings that knowledge and specific complex skills depend not

only on fluid intelligence but also on the cumulative investment of effort and exposure to

learning opportunities.

        How, then, should one interpret a low IQ score? Collectively, the evidence surveyed here

suggests that IQ test performance reflects not only pure intelligence, but also personality traits

(including anxiety), intrinsic motivation, and reactions to extrinsic incentives to perform well, as

indicated in our discussion of Section 3. It also reflects the knowledge acquired up to the date of

the test, which reflects personality and motivational traits that affect the acquisition of

knowledge. The relative impurity of IQ tests likely varies from test to test and individual to

individual. Little effort to date has been made to standardize the context and incentives of tests.

To capture pure intelligence, it is necessary to adjust for incentives, motivations, and context in

which the measurements are taken, using the framework discussed in Section 3.

        Just as personality traits and incentives can affect IQ scores, they can also affect

standardized achievement tests that are commonly used as proxies for pure intelligence. Figure 5

and Figure 6, below, show how scores on two achievement tests, the Armed Forces Qualifying

Test (AFQT) and the Differential Aptitudes Test (DAT), are decomposed into IQ and personality

measures.154 We adjust by Rotter and Rosenberg in Figure 5 and by the Big Five in Figure 6.155


154
    AFQT and DAT scores are highly correlated ( r  0.76 ). See Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2010],
Kilburn, Hanser and Klerman [1998], Sticht [1995], and Wang [1993].
155
    The Big Five are not available in the NLSY79 data that have AFQT scores.

                                                                                               89
A substantial portion of the variance in both the AFQT score and DAT scores is explained by

personality factors.156 The variance explained is less than the variance independently explained

by IQ scores, but it is still substantial. Furthermore, the facets are incrementally valid in that

they explain the variance above and beyond the variance that IQ explains when all three are

included in a regression. These findings caution the interpretation that these commonly used tests

proxy mental ability. They likely proxy aspects of personality as well. Ironically, the measure

of intelligence used by Herrnstein and Murray in The Bell Curve to predict a variety of social and

economic outcomes is substantially affected by personality measures. We discuss evidence

about personality and standardized achievement tests further in Section 7.




156
   The lower explained variance in the sample with DAT is likely a consequence of restriction on range. The DAT
data come from a single school, whereas the AFQT data come from a national sample.

Notes: The data come from the NLSY79. Rotter was administered 1979. The ASVAB and Rosenberg were
administered in 1980.To account for varying levels of schooling at the time of the test, scores have been adjusted
for schooling at the time of the test conditional on final schooling using the method developed in Hansen, Heckman
and Mullen [2004]. AFQT is constructed from the Arithmetic Reasoning, Word Knowledge, Mathematical
Knowledge, and Paragraph Comprehension ASVAB subtests. IQ, and GPA are from high school transcript data. IQ
is pooled across several IQ tests using IQ percentiles. GPA is the individual's core-subject GPA from 9th grade.
Sample excludes the military over-sample. Background variables include race and sex dummies, mother's

5.F.       The Evidence on the Situational Specificity Hypothesis
Since the publication of Mischel’s [1968] book, psychologists have addressed the situational

specificity hypothesis, i.e. the hypothesis that situations help explain variations across people in

actions, effort and behavior.157 Boiled down to its essence, this hypothesis says little more than

that situations affect actions and efforts in a nonlinear fashion, i.e., that in equations (13)-(15),

situational variables enter in a nonlinear fashion. This interaction effect gives rise to the

Mischel-Shoda [1995] “if-then” relationship.

           An important paper by Epstein [1979] defines stability of personality generated by traits

across situations using measurements that average across tasks. He notes that in the presence of

nonlinearities, agents with the same traits will take different actions in different situations. In

four different studies, he presents compelling empirical evidence that, averaging over tasks and

situations at a point in time, persons act in a predictable fashion with a high level of reliability

( R2 of 0.6-0.8) of average behavior (“measured personality”) across situations. He uses a

variety of measures based on objective behavior, self ratings, and ratings by others. He also

establishes consistency (high levels of correlation) across the different types of measures. In any

given situation, personality may not play a particularly powerful role but averaging over many

situations, stable patterns emerge. Fleeson [2001] and Moskowitz [1982] present additional

evidence on this question. Fleeson and Noftle [2008] summarize a substantial body of evidence

on the stability of behaviors across tasks and situations, and the evidence of consistency of

different measurements of personality (e.g., self reports, observer reports).

           In one of the most ambitious recent studies of this question, Borkenau, Mauer, Riemann

et al. [2004] establish a correlation of 0.43 of personality traits measured by the Big Five (self

0.51.158 Wood and Roberts [2006] present further evidence on the persistence of traits across a

variety of situations. Roberts [2009] provides a valuable overview of the latest research. Funder

[2008] provides another useful overview of the debate and the evidence on the existence of a

stable personality trait that at a point in time predicts behavior in a variety of different situations.

Mischel’s [1968] claim that there is no stable personality trait across situations does not hold up

against a large array of data.

         A recent summary of the evidence on the person-situation debate is provided in a series

of papers in the Journal of Research in Personality [January, 2009, Vol. 43] that offer a

retrospective on the controversy. Virtually all papers in that special issue acknowledge the

existence of stable personality traits whose manifestations are tempered by situations and

incentives. The editors summarize the main message of the collected papers with the following

words:

         “All personality psychologists should be unified when it comes to asserting that

         personality differences are worthy of scientific study, that individual differences

         are more than just error variance and that not all behavior is simply a function of

         the situation” – Lucas and Donnellan [2009, p. 147]

    Achenbach, McConaughy and Howell [1987] summarize correlations between children’s problem behavior
ratings by parents and teachers. Their meta-analysis produces an estimate of r  0.28 and suggests consistency and
variation in behavior and assessment across home and school situations. Whether this arises from parental bias or
from situational specificity is not clear.

6.      Personality and Preference Parameters

 Measures of personality predict a wide range of life outcomes that economists study. However,

 with our current knowledge, it is difficult to relate them to economic preference parameters

 except, of course, when the traits are the parameters. Since personality psychologists define

 traits as “relatively” stable, person-specific determinants of behavior, preferences are the natural

 counterpart of these traits in economics. Preferences are unaffected by changes in constraints.

 While personality might relate to preferences, the exact link is unclear. Do preferences generate

 measured personality? Does personality generate preferences? Or are both generated from other,

 deeper, parameters that are as yet unknown? The model in Section 3 links preferences to

 measured personality. This section reviews the empirical evidence linking preferences and

 personality and discusses the conceptual differences between the two.

            Overall, the links between measures of personality and preferences are largely

 unexplored. However, some evidence suggests that social preferences can be linked to the Big

 Five. The link between traditional preferences, such as risk aversion and time discounting, and

 personality, remain largely unknown. Personality measures might allow economists to broaden

 the dimensions of preferences and could potentially resolve some apparent inconsistencies in

 observed choices that arise from commonly used preference specifications in economics.


 6.A.       Evidence on Preference Parameters and Corresponding Personality Measures
 The features of preferences that receive the most attention in the economics literature—time

 discounting, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social preferences159—appear to have

 analogues in the literature in psychology. Table 6 presents the definitions of commonly used

 preferences, some tasks and survey questions that have been used to measure them, and an

                                                                                            99
           Since the 1960s, psychologists have used experiments to elicit time preference and risk

preference here, see, e.g., Mischel, Ayduk, Berman et al. [2010] and Slovic [1962]. A recent

example is the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) (Lejuez, Read, Kahler et al. [2002]), a

computer game in which participants make repeated choices between keeping a certain smaller

monetary reward and taking a chance on an incrementally larger reward. In addition to the

experimental measures, it is tempting to try to map preferences to more vaguely defined traits,

but the precise mapping has not yet been made. Still, some speculation is useful. Time

preference likely relates to Conscientiousness, Self-control, and Consideration of Future

Consequences. Risk Aversion is likely related to Openness to Experience and impulsive

sensation seeking, a trait proposed by Zuckerman, Kolin, Price et al. [1964], defined as “the

tendency to seek novel, varied, complex, and intense sensations and experiences and the

willingness to take risks for the sake of such experience.”160

           Preferences for leisure may be related to several personality measures. The Big Five

includes an Achievement Striving subscale of Conscientiousness, which describes ambition, the

capacity for hard work, and an inclination toward purposeful behavior. Jackson’s Personality

Research Form [1974] includes an achievement scale measuring the aspiration to accomplish

difficult tasks and to put forth effort to attain excellence, as well as an endurance scale,

measuring willingness to work long hours and perseverance in the face of difficulty, and a play

scale, measuring the inclination to participate in games, sports, and social activities “just for

fun.” Industriousness has been proposed as one of six facets of Conscientiousness (Roberts,

Chernyshenko, Stark et al. [2005]) and is plausibly related to the preference for leisure.

                                                                                                100
           Social preferences also have conceptual analogues in the personality literature. Warmth

and Gregariousness are facets of Extraversion; Trust, Altruism, and Tender-Mindedness are

facets of Agreeableness; and Hostility is a facet of Neuroticism.

           Despite this intuitive mapping of preferences to traits, the empirical evidence supporting

such mappings is weak. The few studies investigating empirical links typically report only

simple regressions or correlations without discussing any underlying model. Some use survey

and self-report measures similar to those used by psychologists rather than elicited preferences.

The last column of Table 6 gives an overview of papers investigating the links.

           The evidence relating personality to time preferences is mixed. Using data from an

experiment involving college students, Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009] find that a factor that

loads heavily on self-control, consideration of future consequences, elaboration of consequences,

affective mindfulness, and Conscientiousness, is negatively associated with the discount rate.

Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010] measure time preferences experimentally, and while time

preference is related to cognition, Openness to Experience is the only Big Five trait that explains

any variation in time preference. Figure 7 reports correlations between experimental measures of

time preference, Big Five factors and measures of cognition. Here only cognitive measures are

correlated with time preference.161

      They do not use a measure of Openness to Experience to separate out its influence from that of cognitive ability.

            When they separately regress delay acceptance on Neuroticism, Agreeableness,

Extraversion, Conscientiousness , cognitive skill, race, marital status, age, and education, none of

the personality traits are statistically significant at the 10% level. However, when they split

Conscientiousness into an inhibitive side (moral scrupulousness and cautiousness) and a

proactive side (the need for achievement), they find that the inhibitive side is positively

associated with delay acceptance (   0.13, p  0.10) . This result highlights the importance of

examining facets of the Big Five when considering the relationship between preferences and

personality.

            Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010] find that Openness to Experience and

Agreeableness are related to risk aversion. Figure 7 reports correlations between risk aversion,

Big Five and measures of cognition for a sample of Germans. Of the Big Five, Openness to

Experience and Agreeableness are correlated with risk aversion. There is little evidence

connecting risk aversion and sensation seeking, but Eckel and Grossman [2002] include it as a

control in a study of risk aversion and find no statistically significant effect. However, Bibby and

Ferguson [2011] find that sensation seeking is associated with a lottery measure of risk

tolerance.163 They also find that people who are better at processing emotional information and

who are less extraverted are more susceptible to framing effects when making risky decisions.

Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009] show that risk-aversion is positively associated with

Neuroticism, which contains measures of fear and strong emotional responses to bad outcomes.

They also find that risk aversion is negatively associated with ambition, a trait which may

involve investment in uncertain opportunities. Further, Agreeableness is positively associated

with risk aversion. As shown in Figure 8, Anderson, Burks, DeYoung et al. [2011] find that of

      Bibby and Ferguson report this as a measure of loss aversion, but it is more akin to a measure of risk tolerance.

the Big Five, only Neuroticism is positively associated with risk aversion but only for lotteries

over gains not losses. In separate a regression controlling for cognitive skill, Neuroticism,

Agreeableness, Extraversion, Conscientiousness , cognitive skill, race, marital status, age, and

education , risk aversion is positively associated with both Neuroticism (   0.15, p  0.01) and

the inhibitive side of Conscientiousness (   0.10, p  0.10) .

       The links between social preferences and the Big Five traits are better established. The

links between social preferences and the Big Five traits is better established. Ben-Ner and

Kramer [2011]find that Extraversion is associated with higher giving in a dictator game.

Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008] use an experimentally validated survey measure of trust

and find that Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are negatively associated with trust, whereas

Agreeableness and Openness to Experiences are positively associated with trust. Agreeableness

and Conscientiousness are associated with more positive reciprocity and less negative

reciprocity, whereas Neuroticism is associated with more negative reciprocity.

       In sum, while many measures of personality and preferences seem conceptually related,

the empirical associations are not uniform across studies, and often the measures of preference

are uncorrelated with intuitively similar personality traits. Nevertheless, in several studies

Neuroticism is associated with risk aversion and facets of Conscientiousness are associated with

delay acceptance. Some evidence suggests that considering facets of the Big Five might help

establish a mapping between personality and preferences. However, the empirical links between

preference parameters and personality traits depend on the data used.



6.B.   Mapping Preferences into Personality
Despite some plausible empirical and conceptual links between preferences and traits, a precise

mapping between the measures is not yet available. In Section 3, we argued that measured
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         105
personality is generated by underlying preference parameters and constraints. However, the

preferences measured by economists are often chosen to ensure identification on particular types

of data on choices and may be misspecified. Further, studies documenting relationships between

preferences and traits typically only study correlations without being motivated by an underlying

model. Hence causal claims are, at this stage, largely premature. There are two main reasons for

the disconnection between measures of personality and measures of preferences.

       First, economists typically study marginal rates of substitution, measured over relevant

ranges via observed choices. Personality psychologists typically do not study these tradeoffs and

often do not measure choices. Most approaches to measuring preferences in economics, whether

observational or experimental, use some variation of revealed preference given observed choices.

In contrast, psychologists typically use surveys to elicit preferences, information, or "typical"

actions. Some questions elicit how respondents would feel about a given outcome, without

presenting an alternative outcome. While such questions may elicit some (unspecified) feature of

preferences, it is not clear what is being measured. The difference in approach makes it

intrinsically difficult to compare economic and psychological measures.

       Second, traditional preference parameters may not span the entire space of human

decisions measured by psychologists. Time, risk, social, and leisure preferences do not capture

the only tradeoffs in life. While time preference, risk aversion, leisure preference, and social

preference have analogues in psychology, many personality psychologists do not perceive self-

control and delay of gratification, risk-taking behavior and sensation-seeking, and motivation

and ambition as the most important aspects of human decision making.

       Economists typically make strong simplifying assumptions to make their models tractable

and to secure identification. The estimated parameters are used to build models, evaluate policy,
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         106
and create counterfactuals. The most widely used specifications of tradeoffs are through

parameterizations assuming separability, and assume that marginal rates of substitution are

summarized by one or two parameters. Personality psychologists do not have the same incentives

as economists to describe behavior by simple specifications as they are often content to stop with

rich descriptions and do not use their estimated relationships in subsequent policy analyses.

Thus, they allow for a more complex range of behaviors. The choice of measured traits is large

and often defies a simple, tractable, explanation. As discussed in the previous sections, to

economists these often appear to be arbitrary.


6.C.   Do Measured Parameters Predict Real World Behavior?
One test of the stability of measured preferences is whether they predict behavior in other

contexts. Several recent studies have investigated whether risk preference predict behavior. For

example, Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011], use an experimentally validated measure of risk

preference in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and find that it predicts self-reported

risky behaviors, such as holding stocks, being self-employed, participating in sports, and

smoking, but it does not predict as well as a survey question about ‘willingness to take risks in

general.’ However, the observed relationship might arise because both the self-reported

behaviors and questions about willingness to take risk are noisy contemporaneous survey

measures. Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997] measure risk tolerance, time preference, and the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution and find that risk tolerance predicts smoking and drinking,

holding insurance and stock, and decisions to immigrate and be self-employed. However,

measures of risk tolerance only explain a small fraction of the variation in risky behaviors.

       Benz and Meier [2008] compare measures of social preferences with charitable giving in

a field experiment and find that experimental measures do not predict real life behavior well.
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         107
Levitt and List [2007] and List [2009] discuss the more general discrepancy between results from

the lab and the field and argue that this is not necessarily because people behave inconsistently,

but because experimenters are not controlling for relevant aspects of the choice situation. This is

just a rehash of the old person-situation debate. Falk and Heckman [2009] present a different

interpretation of the value of experiments. We discuss the evidence below.


6.D.   Integrating Traits into Economic Models
Behavioral economics has incorporated some aspects of personality psychology to investigate

how standard models of preferences can be improved to better reflect reality. Behavioral

economics has highlighted many so-called anomalies, ways in which standard preferences do not

accurately describe human behavior. We can divide these attempts into two main approaches.

       First, behavioral economists have tried to improve models of behavior by developing

more flexible functional forms for preferences. Below we discuss some of the now standard

examples, such as loss aversion, hyperbolic discounting, and reciprocity. These are not

anomalies with respect to rationality, but are examples that challenge standard models of

preferences. For example, the time inconsistent actions induced by hyperbolic discounting

(defined below), are often described as "errors", but they are not. The agent is simply optimizing

non-standard preferences.

       Second, behavioral economists have introduced the concept of bounded rationality. These

are behaviors for which there is no reasonable preference specification that can rationalize a

behavior. They are called anomalies or biases relative to conventional economic choice

frameworks. Examples include failure to predict the winner's curse, mental accounting, framing

effects, failure to apply Bayesian updating, and default effects. We think of these as mental

constraints, or traits, along the lines of the models discussed in Section 3. However, these
                                             Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                          108
examples are consistent with evidence reviewed below on the interaction between cognitive

ability and preference parameters.

       Note that while some of the nonstandard features of preferences may seem compelling,

the higher level of generality tends to make it difficult to identify the parameters in the data

commonly used by economists. See the discussion in Hansen [2005].


 6.D.1.       Traits as Constraints
Preference measurements that do not account for all of the constraints that agents face might be

biased. In the model of personality in Section 3, we describe how agents act based on both

preference parameters and productive traits that embody constraints. The marginal rate of

substitution is typically identified through price variation. However, the true price ratio might

also depend partly on the unobserved traits of the individual. Failure to account for the traits that

reflect constraints could lead to bias.

          The empirical literature has focused on the interaction between cognition and preference

parameters. Virtually all methods of estimating time preference assume that respondents are

equally numerate, but Peters, Vastfjall, Slovic et al. [2006] show that this assumption is often

untrue. Furthermore, more numerate individuals are less susceptible to framing effects and draw

stronger and more precise affective meaning from numbers and comparisons using numbers. The

confound with numeracy may explain why more intelligent (or educated) individuals often

display lower discount rates when decisions require complex calculations to compare subtly

different delays or reward amounts (for example, de Wit, Flory, Acheson et al. [2007]; Dohmen,

Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]), but it does not shed light on why smarter individuals also have

lower discount rates when choosing between relatively simple cash sums (Funder and Block

[1989]) and between non-cash rewards (such as smaller vs. larger candy bars in Mischel and
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                               109
Metzner [1962]).164 A meta-analysis by Shamosh and Gray [2007] of 24 studies in which both IQ

and discount rates were measured shows the two traits are inversely related (r  0.23) . The

complexity entailed by comparing the present and future values of rewards suggests that the

inverse relationship between discount rates and intelligence is not just an artifact of

measurement. One explanation for this could be that cognitive ability is related to the ability to

direct attention. Daly, Delaney and Harmon [2009] find that lower discount rates are associated

with cognitive mindfulness, which includes the ability to control attention. Further, an individual

with poor working memory and low intelligence may not be capable of accurately calculating or

even perceiving the value of a deferred reward. At the least, making such calculations is more

effortful (that is, costly) for individuals of low cognitive ability. If the cost of making

calculations exceeds the expected benefit of such deliberation, the individual may choose by

default the immediate, certain reward. However, it is important to be aware of reverse causality,

since more patient individuals may also invest more in cognitive ability.

        Measures of cognitive constraints also relate to measured risk preference. There is an

inverse relationship between cognitive ability and risk aversion, where higher-IQ people have

higher risk tolerance (Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2010]).165 Reference dependence can lead

subjects to be susceptible to framing, because they will perceive two identical lotteries

differentially when one is framed as a loss and the other is framed as a gain. Some evidence

suggests that individuals with higher cognitive ability and education are less risk averse. Burks,

Carpenter, Goette et al. [2009] find that higher IQ individuals are more consistent in their

choices between a lottery and fixed sums. They hypothesize that agents with higher cognitive

ability can better translate their preferences into choices between lotteries.

           Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2010] find that while risk aversion is related to

personality traits, ambiguity is not. In particular, IQ does not explain how subjects choose

between a risky and an ambiguous urn.


 6.D.2.         Traits as Preferences
Some aspects of traits may be more naturally thought of as aspects of preferences than as

constraints. For example, Openness to Experience might relate to a preference for learning, and

Extraversion might reflect a preference for social interactions. The distinction between

preferences and constraints often seems tautological. One way of incorporating personality into

preferences is by modifying functional forms, which fall into two broad and sometimes

overlapping categories. First, some of the domains which are traditionally treated as

fundamentally different, such as risk and time preference, social and risk preference, and leisure

and time preference, may be closely related and generated from a common set of psychological

traits. Second, nonseparabilities could confound measures of tradeoffs. The literature on

addiction presents an interesting class of nonseparable models.166 So does the literature on

exotic preferences in economics.167



Multidimensionality

Marginal rates of substitution are often assumed to be generated by only one or two parameters,

for example the discount factor and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. This facilitates

identification given sparse data, and, if it is a sensible specification of preferences, it gives a

convenient description of behaviour. However, one or two parameters may not describe

behaviour well. Conversely, some of the concepts analyzed separately in the literature may be

governed by the same parameters.

        In discussing the concept of time discounting, Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue

[2002] argue that time preference has three dimensions: impulsivity, the tendency to act

spontaneously and without planning; compulsivity, the tendency to stick with plans; and

inhibition, the ability to override automatic responses to urges or emotions. There may be

multiple interpretations of this assertion.

        First, the tradeoff between different time periods might be described by several

parameters. Second, impulsivity, inhibition, and compulsivity might reflect constraints, i.e.,

something that affects shadow prices of consumption in different time periods. Third, the

relevant tradeoff might not be between different time periods but, for example in the case of

impulsivity, might be between various levels of sensation seeking, a behavior which is also

related to risk seeking.

        Like time preference, risk preference may depend on multiple parameters. As noted by

Rabin [2000], the simple expected utility framework does not explain risk aversion over small

stakes, since it would imply an implausibly high curvature of the utility function. See Starmer

[2000] for a review of the literature on departures from expected utility. When psychologists

started measuring risk-taking behavior, they were puzzled by the large variance across domains

(see the discussion of situational specificity in Section 2). More recently, Weber [2001] shows

that risk preference varies by domain, and a scale that assesses risk taking in five different

domains shows low correlations across these domains (Weber, Blais and Betz [2002]). One can

                                                                                                        112
be quite risk-averse when it comes to financial decisions but risk-loving when it comes to health

decisions (Hanoch, Johnson and Wilke [2006]). Weber’s risk-return model of risk taking (Weber

and Milliman [1997]; Weber and Hsee [1998]) finds that low correlations among risk-taking

preference across domains can be explained by domain-specific perceptions of riskiness and

return. Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2011] find that a survey question on willingness to take

risks within a domain predicts self-reported behaviors within each domain. Einav, Finkelstein,

Pascu et al. [2010] also find that there are domain-specific components of risk-taking behavior.

Domain specificity might arise because sensation-seeking, enjoyment of risk per se, is an

important aspect of risk preferences.168

         Ambiguity aversion, the disutility from model uncertainty, might help explain some

apparent inconsistencies. Ambiguity aversion is measured as the tradeoff between lower

expected return and higher model uncertainty. Ambiguity aversion explains Ellsberg’s paradox:

people tend to prefer an urn with a 0.5 probability of winning to an urn with an unknown

probability where they are allowed to choose which side to bet on. One version of preferences

over ambiguity is due to Gilboa and Schmeidler [1989]. They specify max-min preferences,

where the agent maximizes an expected utility function which has been minimized with respect

to the prior probabilities, i.e.

                 U  X 1 , X 2 ,..., X K   min  1 , 2 ... K   1u  X 1    2 u  X 2   ...   K u  X K  .

Borghans, Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009] measure ambiguity aversion and risk aversion in a

group of Dutch high school students and show that this aspect of choice is distinct from risk

aversion.

168
   Zuckerman [2007] suggests that sensation seeking is related more closely to Big Five Conscientiousness
(inversely), but there is obvious conceptual overlap with excitement seeking, a facet of Big Five Extraversion on the
NEO-PI-R questionnaire, as well as with Big Five Openness to Experience.

                                                                                          113
          There is no consensus on how social preferences govern choices. Social preferences refer

to any explanation for non-selfish behavior, usually as measured in a dictator game where people

have to divide a sum between themselves and another person. Typically, more than 60 percent of

proposers give positive amounts, averaging 20 percent of the sum. A variation of this game is the

classic ultimatum game in which a giver divides a sum between himself and another subject, the

receiver, and the other subject can accept or decline the sum. If he declines, both will lose their

money. Studies typically find that receivers decline if offered less than 20 percent. These results

cannot be explained by pure selfishness. In the dictator game, the giver is willing to forgo his

own consumption in order to increase another person’s consumption, and in the ultimatum game,

the receiver is willing to forgo his own consumption in order to decrease the giver’s consumption

if he pays him too little. Many studies seek to find deeper traits that govern these behaviors, such

as preferences over the utility of oneself compared to others, efficiency, and fairness. The notion

of fairness covers various concepts, including equality and rewards in proportion to talent, effort,

kindness, or intentions. For reviews of this literature, see List [2009], and Camerer and Fehr

[2004].

          In the linear, separable model, where each good Xi is the consumption of person i , we

can think of the weights as caring or altruism, the fact that people often care about other people’s

utility or consumption. See Meier [2007] for a review. Fehr and Schmidt [1999] analyze

inequality aversion in which people dislike inequality rather than valuing the consumption or

utility of agents per se.

          Caring and altruism have been shown to decrease with social distance. People typically

care more about themselves than about others, and they are less altruistic the less well they know

other people.

       The social preference of reciprocity has been studied. Fehr and Gächter [2000], and Falk

and Fischbacher [2006] present evidence on reciprocity and conditional cooperation, in which

agents act in a pro-social or antisocial manner depending on the behavior of others with whom

they interact. People exert positive reciprocity if they tend to reward others for kindness but

negative reciprocity if they tend to punish others for unkindness. More precisely, they are willing

to incur a cost in order to reward or punish others. Falk and Fischbacher [2006] develop a theory

of reciprocity where utility depends on the kindness of others, which is a function not only of the

outcome from the another person’s action, but also of the perceived intentions. Reciprocity then

reflects how much value a person puts on rewarding kindness. Economists could model these

features by letting the person-specific weights on the subutilities depend on social distance and

past actions of others. Reciprocity is often measured using a gift-giving game where the

proposer offers a wage to a responder, who then subsequently chooses a level of effort. However,

List [2009] argues that the importance of fairness preferences may have been overstated in the

literature, that many of the observed results are due to concerns over either reputation or scrutiny

by experimenters. Several studies have shown that observed reciprocity fades over a longer time

frame than the short duration of lab experiments (Gneezy and List [2006], Hennig-Schmidt,

Rockenbach and Sadrieh [2010], Kube, Maréchal and Puppe [2006]). Andreoni’s [1995] warm

glow model of altruism suggests that people do not care about others, but value the act of giving.

       Inequality aversion is distinct from caring in the sense that A’s utility may be decreasing

in B’s consumption if it is higher than A’s. (See Fehr and Schmidt [2006] for a review.) Fehr

and Schmidt [1999] suggest the following asymmetric specification for the utility of agent n :

where the weights satisfy  n   n and 0  n  1. In this case, the MRS changes from 1 to -1 at

X A  X B . People place a higher weight on own consumption compared to others’, but when

asked about the distribution of rewards in games where subjects do not have any interest in the

outcome, preferences vary greatly.

       People seem to be more accepting of inequality if they believe that it represents a

difference earned through effort rather than from differences in exogenously given talent. (See

Tausch, Potters and Riedl [2010] for a review.) This finding may be related to the notion of

reciprocity. The distinction may be whether the preference is for people who have earned their

reward for doing something “for me” or something admirable in general.

       Some aspects of preferences seem to be multidimensional. However, many preference

parameters are correlated. For example, the social preference of “trust” relates to risk aversion

and reciprocity. Altmann, Dohmen and Wibral [2008] measure trust as the willingness to give

money to an investor in a trust game where he will only be repaid if the investor decides to return

the favor. In this game, one can think of trust as the belief about how own actions affect those of

others. They find that trust and positive reciprocity are positively related. Using the German

Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008] find that most people

exert positive reciprocity; positive reciprocity and negative reciprocity are only weakly

correlated; and people who are negatively reciprocal are less willing to trust others. In situations

involving trust, it seems natural that trust is closely related to risk and ambiguity aversion, that a

person who is more prone to accept uncertainty is also more likely to trust others. Altmann,
                                                      Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                   116
Dohmen and Wibral [2008] also find that people who are less risk averse are also more willing to

trust. However, they do not measure which beliefs the agents hold.

           Care has to be taken in distinguishing trust from risk aversion. We demonstrate below

how additively separable specifications of preferences impose observational equivalence

between risk and social preferences. Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al. [2005] find that people who

receive oxytocin exhibit more trusting behavior in a real-stakes trust game. Oxytocin, however,

does not make subjects more generous, suggesting that trust is not simply altruism. Additionally,

oxytocin does not affect people's decision over risky outcomes when playing against a computer

rather than a human. Combined, these findings suggest that there is a unique characteristic that

affects willingness to trust, distinct from altruism and risk aversion. Fehr [2009] posits that this

missing element might be “betrayal aversion.” Using survey data from Germany, Fehr [2009]

finds that risk preferences, betrayal aversion, and altruism (as expressed through volunteering)

predict people's self-reported willingness to trust others.



Preference Specifications and Their Consequences

The most restrictive version of the additively separable model suggests that the marginal rate of

substitution between two goods does not depend on the consumption of other goods. Browning,

Hansen and Heckman [1999] present ample evidence against this assumption. Apparent

inconsistencies can arise if nonseparability is ignored. Further, estimates will suffer from

omitted variable bias.169

           The additively separable intertemporal model imposes the requirement that the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution is the same as the relative risk aversion parameter.


169
      See Section A6.D. in the Web Appendix for a discussion of additive separability and its implications.
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                117
However, Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al. [1997] find no evidence that the intertemporal elasticity

of substitution is correlated with risk tolerance. However, the sample on which they measure

these parameters is small. Green and Myerson [2004] argue that risk and time belong to different

underlying psychological processes. As evidence, they point out that the two constructs react

differently to the same effect: for example, an increase in the size of reward generally decreases

the discount on time but increases the discount rate when rewards are probabilistic.170 This is

evidence against the standard intertemporally separable model of risk aversion.

        One type of nonseparability is between goods and the state or time period. The additively

separable model allows for this type of dependence, represented by the subscript v on the utility

function. While exponential discounting is still the most common representation of time

preferences, experiments show that people tend to put higher weight on the present than on

future periods than would be predicted by exponential discounting. This is the motive for

hyperbolic discounting. The most often used specification is   ,   -preferences, where  is the

usual discount factor while δ is an additional discounting of all future periods, is

                                         
                        Uv X v , X v1,...  u  X v    u  X v1    2u  X v2  .

The consequence of these preferences is that the tradeoff between period v and period v  1 is

not evaluated the same way from the perspective of period v  1 and period v , leading to time

inconsistency.171 Other possibilities are that the discount rates change with age. Hyperbolic and

age-dependent discounting makes use of the subscript v on the utility function. We may think

of an agent in multiple periods as several agents who play a game with each other. The agent

170
    Further support for this disassociation comes from a cross-cultural study by Du, Green and Myerson [2002], in
which Chinese graduate students discounted delayed rewards much more steeply than Japanese students, but
Japanese students discounted probabilistic rewards more steeply than did the Chinese. Barsky, Juster, Kimball et al.
[1997] report that their estimates of time preference and risk tolerance are independent.
171
    This specification originates in the work of Phelps and Pollak [1968].
                                                       Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

today might account for what future agents might do. Further, discount rates appear to vary

inversely with the size of reward and vary with the type of reward offered.172

        As previously noted, the expected utility form for risk preferences does not explain risk

preferences over small stakes, as argued by Rabin [2000]. If subutility functions represent utility

of lifetime wealth in different states, people should be approximately risk neutral for small

stakes. However, people often avoid more than fair small bets. If this is explained by expected

utility, then the curvature of the utility of wealth function would have to be implausibly high.

Kahneman and Tversky [1979] suggest that people are loss averse, i.e., that losses weigh higher

than gains in the utility function. This would imply that people have state-dependent preferences,

which can be expressed as

            U n  X 1 , X 2 ,... X n ,... X K    1u  X 1  X n    2u  X 2  X n   ... K u  X K  X n 

where n is the current state, and where u  y  is higher for negative y than for positive y. Note

that this specification is very similar to that of inequality aversion discussed above. Both models

share the feature that people do not have stable preferences over levels, but over differences.

        The concepts of loss aversion, reference point dependence, and endowment effects

(Thaler [1980], Kahneman and Tversky [1979]) are variations on this theme. If an agent has had

an object in his possession for even a short amount of time, it affects how he trades it off against

other goods. List [2003] has shown that this effect disappears when agents have market

experience. However, loss aversion will interact with many choices in life, for example, how

agents evaluate lotteries.

           Reference point dependence has also been demonstrated in dictator games. In the

standard dictator game, the first player, the “dictator,” is given a positive endowment and can

choose to transfer some of it to a second player at which point the game ends. Numerous studies

have shown that most dictators transfer a positive amount, even though they have no monetary

incentive to do so. List [2007] and Bardsley [2008] modified the standard dictator game by

allowing dictators to take part of the second player’s endowment. With this modification, most

dictators did not transfer positive amounts to the second player.

           Experimental measures of social preferences vary greatly across studies. Levitt and List

[2007] and List [2009] argue that the degree of scrutiny in the lab as opposed to in the real world

may make subjects behave more pro-socially (Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul [2005], List [2006])

and argue against the “realism” of experimental data.173 Further, several studies have found that

people tend to be more selfish when the stakes of the game increase (Carpenter, Verhoogen and

Burks [2005], Slonim and Roth [1998], Parco, Rapoport and Stein [2002]).

           There is evidence of substantial heterogeneity in preferences both between

socioeconomic groups and within groups. Marginal rates of substitution depend on other factors

such as education, age, cultural values, etc.174 This evidence supports the claim that people are

different at a basic level, since preferences govern the choices that shape life. However,

preferences may be experience dependent. While most studies view life outcomes as the result

of choices governed by exogenous preferences, and hence infer preferences from outcomes,

initial conditions might determine both preferences and constraints on the available choices.

           The motivation for preference specifications in economics is typically introspection,

axioms about rationality, and convenience, rather than empirical evidence. When measuring

preferences, functional forms are chosen in an attempt to minimize approximation error subject

to identification. However, economists typically consider preferences over a limited range of

fundamental attributes. Time, risk, and social preferences may not be the right dimensions of

choice over which parameters are stable. Each of these domains seem to be guided by multiple

parameters, and some of these parameters seem to matter for each of the domains. While the

marginal rates of substitution economists measure are correct at observed prices, they may not be

easily mapped into the conventional preference specifications. Personality psychology may help

in guiding economists as where to look for more fundamental parameters. However, the

potential is largely unexplained.

7.      The Predictive Power of Personality Traits

  This section discusses the empirical evidence on the power of personality in predicting life

  outcomes. A growing body of evidence suggests that personality measures—especially those

  related to Conscientiousness, and, to a lesser extent, Neuroticism—predict a wide range of

 outcomes. The predictive power of any particular personality measure tends to be less than the

 predictive power of IQ but in some cases rivals it.

            For three reasons, summarizing the large literature on the predictive power of personality

 on outcomes is a daunting task. First, the measures of personality and cognition differ among

 studies. As noted in Section 5, not all psychologists use the Big Five. We attempt to cast all

 measures into Big Five categories. When this is not possible, we discuss the measures used and

 how they relate to the Big Five measures.

            Second, different studies use different measures of predictive power. Many studies report

 only simple correlations or simple standardized regression coefficients.175 Such estimated

     relationships do not control for other factors that may influence outcomes. This is particularly

     problematic for estimated relationships between personality measures and other outcomes that do

     not control for cognition, situation, or the effect of other personality measures. Where possible,

     we report both simple and partial correlations.

            We also consider a measure of predictive validity that extends traditional conceptions of

     variance explained. Recent work by economists relaxes the normality and linearity assumptions

     that underlie the use of simple partial correlations and standardized regression coefficients that

     are used in psychology. This method measures the predictive power of variables by the slopes of

  175
    Standardized regressions produce regression coefficients of outcomes divided by their standard deviations
 regressed on explanatory variables divided by their standard deviations. This produces correlation coefficients in
 bivariate regressions and partial correlation coefficients in multivariate regressions. See, e.g., Goldberger [1968].
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 126
percentile changes on outcomes and not by variance explained. If outcomes are characterized by

substantial measurement error, a low R 2 for a predictor may still be consistent with a substantial

effect of the predictor on means and quantiles.176

         For example, Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] report the effects of percentile changes

in cognitive and personality measures on a variety of outcomes over the full range of estimated

relationships, relaxing traditional normality or linearity assumptions and not relying directly on

measures of variance explained. This approach to measuring predictive power is increasingly

being applied by economists.177

         Third, many studies do not address the question of causality, i.e., does the measured trait

cause (rather than just predict) the outcome? Empirical associations are not a reliable basis for

policy analysis. Problems with reverse causality are rife in personality psychology.

Contemporaneous measures of personality and outcomes are especially problematic. For

example, does greater Neuroticism lower earnings, is it the other way around, or do they

mutually influence each other?

         Few economists or psychologists working on the relationship between personality and

outcomes address the issue of causality, and when they do so, it is usually by employing early

measures of cognition and personality to predict later outcomes. As discussed in Section 4,

using early measures of personality traits to predict later outcomes raises problems of its own.

We delineate how each study addresses causality.



176
    The slope versus variance explained distinction is an old one. However, the use of slopes as measures of
“importance” is problematic in general because of the arbitrariness in the scales of the dependent and independent
variables. (See Goldberger [1968].) This arbitrariness is resolved in the new measure by mapping quantiles into
quantiles. This literature is nonparametric. The measure is clear in its choice of units but the economic significance
is still questionable. A better measure would relate costs of a change in the independent variable to the benefits.
177
    See, e.g., Piatek and Pinger [2010].

                                                                                         127
An Overview of the Main Findings

Before presenting a detailed survey of the effects of personality and cognition on a variety of

outcomes, it is useful to have an overview of the main findings. One principle finding of our

survey, consistent with the claims of the early psychologists cited in Section 2, is that

Conscientiousness is the most predictive Big Five trait across many outcomes. However, other

personality measures predict some outcomes.

       Measures of personality predict a range of educational outcomes. Of the Big Five,

Conscientiousness best predicts overall attainment and achievement. Other traits, such as

Openness to Experience, predict finer measures of educational attainment, such as attendance

and course difficulty. Traits related to Neuroticism also affect educational attainment, but the

relationship is not always monotonic. Conscientiousness predicts college grades to the same

degree that SAT scores do. Personality measures predict performance on achievement tests and,

to a lesser degree, performance on intelligence tests.

       Personality measures also predict a variety of labor market outcomes. Of the Big Five

traits, Conscientiousness best predicts overall job performance but is less predictive than

measures of intelligence. Conscientiousness, however, predicts performance and wages across a

broad range of occupational categories, whereas the predictive power of measures of intelligence

decreases with job complexity. Additionally, traits related to Neuroticism (e.g. locus of control

and self-esteem) predict a variety of labor market outcomes, including job search effort. Many

traits predict sorting into occupations, consistent with the economic models of comparative

advantage discussed in Section 3. Personality traits are valued differentially across occupations.

       All Big Five traits predict some health outcomes. Conscientiousness, however, is the

most predictive and can better predict longevity than does intelligence or background.
                                             Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                          128
Personality measures predict health both through the channel of education and by improving

health-related behavior, such as smoking.

       The little evidence on the effect of personality measures on crime suggests that traits

related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important predictors of criminality. These

findings are consistent with the possibility that personality is related to social preferences, as

discussed in Section 6.

       Our survey, even though extensive, is not fully comprehensive. We place additional

material in the Web Appendix.




7.A.   Educational Attainment and Achievement

We now turn to evidence for the predictive power of personality traits for educational outcomes,

separately considering educational attainment, grades, and test scores.



Educational Attainment

Despite recent increases in college attendance, American high school dropout rates remain high.

About one in four American students drops out of formal schooling before receiving a high

school diploma, and in recent decades the dropout rate has increased slightly (Heckman and

LaFontaine [2010]). A growing body of research finds that personality is associated with

educational attainment, suggesting that further study of personality and its determinants might

shed light on the recent stagnation in educational attainment. We begin by reviewing evidence

about the relationship of personality measures with years of schooling and then consider specific

aspects of educational achievement.
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                               129
        Traits such as perseverance and preferences related to an interest in learning might lead

people to attain more total years of schooling. Indeed some evidence suggests that this might be

the case. Table 8 presents associations between years of schooling and the Big Five from three

nationally representative samples. The studies yield different results, possibly because they

control for different covariates or because they come from different countries. The first study

controls for age, sex, and gender and finds that of the Big Five, Openness to Experience and

Conscientiousness are most related to years of schooling attained (Goldberg, Sweeney, Merenda

et al. [1998]) . The second study—which also controls for parental education and father’s

occupational status—reports reports a strong relationship with Openness to Experience but a

much weaker relationship with Conscientiousness than the first study, suggesting that parental

background might mediate some of the effects of Conscientiousness (van Eijck and de Graaf

[2004]).

        The first two samples lack information on cognitive ability. Openness to Experience,

however, is the only Big Five factor with moderate associations with general intelligence

( r  0.33 in a meta-analysis by Ackerman and Heggestad [1997]), and intelligence is associated

with years of education ( r  0.55 in Neisser, Boodoo, Bouchard et al. [1996]). Thus Openness

to Experience may proxy for intelligence. However, as Figure 9 illustrates, controlling for

rudimentary measures of crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence does not affect the

coefficients on the Big Five within the third sample.178 This sample differs from the others,

because Openness to Experience is not strongly associated with years of education unconditional

on intelligence, possibly because it is based on a smaller inventory of questions.

Conscientiousness, however, is associated with years of schooling to a similar degree as

178

A7 of the Web Appendix presents analogous results for high school graduation.

intelligence. In each study, schooling and personality are measured at the same point in time, so

that for older individuals, personality is measured long after schooling has been completed. This

complicates the interpretation of the estimated effects of schooling on personality in young

samples.

           Nevertheless, the components of Openness to Experience representing an intrinsic

interest in ideas and learning may affect educational attainment not measured by total years of

schooling such as the student’s difficulty with classes and attendance. Consistent with this

supposition, a longitudinal study of talented high school students showed that when controlling

for PSAT score, students who expressed more intrinsic motivation in learning took more difficult

math courses one year later (   0.30, p  0.05) , two years later (   0.31, p  0.05) , and three

years later (   0.26, p  0.10) but did not have higher grades in a standardized set of courses.179

Likewise, of the Big Five, Openness to Experience is most consistently associated with fewer

contemporaneously measured school absences in seventh grade ( r  0.31, p  0.01) , tenth

grade ( r  0.19, p  0.01) , and twelfth grade ( r  0.27, p  0.01) (Lounsbury, Steel, Loveland

et al. [2004]). Still, interest in learning is not the whole story. Using prospective data, Lleras

[2008] finds that controlling for cognitive ability, three Conscientious behaviors (completing

homework, working hard, arriving promptly to class) in tenth grade predicted educational

attainment ten years later, whereas relating well to others, a behavior related to Extraversion and

Agreeableness, did not.

           Examining discrete educational decisions, rather than total years of education, gives a

more nuanced picture. The decision to obtain a GED is a particularly telling example. Many

view GED certification as equivalent to earning a high school diploma. Indeed GED recipients

have the same distribution of measured achievement test scores as high school graduates who do

not attend college. However, controlling for cognitive ability, GED recipients have lower hourly

wages and annual earnings and attain fewer years of education, suggesting they may “lack the

abilities to think ahead, to persist in tasks, or to adapt to their environments” (Heckman and

179
      Wong and Csikszentmihalyi [1991].

Rubinstein [2001, p. 146]). Figure 10, taken from Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010],

shows that GED recipients have cognitive skills similar to students who obtain high school

diplomas but do not attend college. However, GED recipients have noncognitive skills

(personality traits) similar to high school dropouts.180

Notes: The data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 (no college sample, all ethnic
groups). The distributions above represent noncognitive ability factors estimated using measures of early violent
crime, minor crime, marijuana use, regular smoking, drinking, early sexual intercourse, and educational attainment
as laid out in Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004]. The sample is restricted to the cross-sectional subsample for
both males and females. Distributions show only those with no post-secondary educational attainment. The
noncognitive ability factors are separately normalized to be mean zero standard deviation one.

            Supporting the evidence from the GED program that personality plays an important role

in explaining educational attainment in adolescence, several prospective studies have shown that

facets of Conscientiousness (e.g., self-control, distractibility) and facets of Neuroticism (e.g.,

internal locus of control) predict successful graduation from high school (Bowman and Matthews

[1960; Gough [1964; Hathaway, Reynolds and Monachesi [1969; Janosz, LeBlanc, Boulerice et

al. [1997; Kelly and Veldman [1964; Whisenton and Lorre [1970]).181 Table 9 presents findings

from three more recent studies examining the relationship between locus of control, a trait

related to Emotional Stability, and high school graduation. While the level of statistical

significance varies across studies, the studies report remarkably similar estimates. When

controlling for basic demographics, a one standard deviation increase in locus of control is

associated with a 4.5-6.8 percentage point increase in graduating from high school. Two of the

studies control for cognitive ability and find that the coefficient drops to between 1.4 and 1.5.

However, the measures of cognitive ability (course grades and AFQT score) are partly

determined by locus of control, as discussed later in this section.

           Several recent studies using methods that address measurement error and reverse

causality corroborate the evidence that traits related to Neuroticism affect educational attainment.

For example, Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] account for the effect of family background

on test scores. They correct for the influence of schooling on personality. They address

measurement error in test scores. (Their estimates of the effect of schooling on these traits and

on cognitive measures are discussed in Section 8.) Figure 11 shows that better adolescent

personality traits – as measured by locus of control and self-esteem (traits related to

Neuroticism)—increases the probability of graduating from high school (and stopping at high

school) for males at the lowest quantiles of the personality distribution. However, at higher

quantiles, the probability of stopping education at high school graduation is decreasing in

measured personality, because those students continue on to college. As discussed in Section 3,

the effects of traits on outcomes need not be monotonic. As Figure 12 shows, both higher

cognitive and personality traits have strong effects on graduating from a 4-year college at all

deciles. Moving from the lowest decile to the highest decile in the measured personality

distribution increases the probability of graduating from college more than a similar change in

the cognitive trait distribution. These examples show why considering broad measures of

education might obscure important relationships between skills and educational attainment and

why assuming a linear—or even monotonic—relationship between skills and educational

attainment might be incorrect.182

        Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] use a dynamic factor model to investigate the

development of both cognitive skills and personality traits during childhood, allowing for

endogenous investment in skills and dynamic complementarities. They find that adolescent

personality—as measured by a variety of behavior inventories—accounts for 12% of the

variation in educational attainment, whereas adolescent cognitive ability accounts for 16% of the

variation.

        A separate, but related literature examines the importance of early attention (a trait

related to Conscientiousness) and aggression (a trait related to low Agreeableness) in
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

determining graduation from high school. Some studies find that aggression is particularly

important compared to attention. Duncan and Magnuson [2010a] find that when controlling for

measures of intelligence and demographic variables, antisocial behavior, but not attention

measured in childhood, predicts high school completion where antisocial behavior is negatively

associated with completion. Likewise, Fergusson and Horwood [1998] find that teacher and

parent ratings of conduct problems at age 8 are negatively related to predicted high school

completion at age 18. In contrast, Vitaro, Brendgen, Larose et al. [2005] examine individuals in a

population-based sample of Quebec children and find that kindergarten teacher ratings of

hyperactivity-inattention (inversely) predicted completion of high school better than did

aggressiveness-opposition. Both attention and aggression likely play roles, but there is no

consensus on their relative importance.

       In sum, traits related to Big Five Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness are

particularly important in determining how many total years of education individuals complete in

their lifetimes. Two traits related to Neuroticism, locus of control and self-esteem, play a

particularly important role for adolescent schooling decisions. Their effects differ across

schooling attainment levels, suggesting that analysts should be wary of using years of schooling

attained as the outcome variable compared to using the probability of attainment at different

grades. Attention and early aggression, traits related to Conscientiousness and Agreeableness,

are also predictive.



Course Grades

Conscientiousness is the most robust Big Five predictor of course grades, in terms of raw and

partial correlations. Poropat [2009] conducted a meta-analysis of Big Five personality traits and
                                                     Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

course grades in primary, secondary, and post-secondary education, presented in Figure 13.

Associations between grades and Conscientiousness are almost as large as those between grades

and cognitive ability. Associations with grades are substantially smaller for other Big Five

factors, the largest of which is Openness to Experience.

grades.

         A few prospective, longitudinal studies, have estimated the effect of Conscientiousness

on course grades when controlling for baseline levels of grades. These studies help isolate the

effects of personality on grades by reducing the potential for omitted variable bias and

misleading halo effects – the propensity for teachers to favor students based on traits unrelated to

academic achievement. In general, these studies support the conclusions of studies that do not

account for halo effects. For instance, in a sample of American middle school students, self-

control predicts report card grades, controlling for both general intelligence and baseline grades
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

(Duckworth and Seligman [2005]). Likewise, Duckworth, Tsukayama and May [2010] use

longitudinal hierarchical linear models to show that changes in self-control predict subsequent

changes in report card grades. In a sample of Chinese primary school children, effortful control

predicted report card grades when controlling for baseline grades (Zhou, Main and Wang

[2010]).

        Figure 14 shows that associations between course grades and personality and cognitive

ability and grades are generally stronger in the primary grades, a pattern consistent with

censoring.183 A notable exception to this trend is Conscientiousness, which has the same

association with course grades at all levels.184 If censoring on cognitive and personality traits

attenuates observed associations with course grades among students at higher grade levels,

Conscientiousness might be even more predictive of course grades as students progress through

the education system.185 Consistent with this possibility, in a prospective study of an entire

cohort of Belgium’s medical students, the correlation (corrected for censoring) of

Conscientiousness for GPA increased from r  0.18 in the first year to r  0.45 in the seventh

and final year (Lievens, Dilchert and Ones [2009]).186

    Censoring was not accounted for in the meta-analysis in Poropat [2009], presumably because norms for variance
in representative samples are generally unavailable for personality measures (Duckworth [2009]).

            Overall, the empirical evidence suggests that Conscientiousness may be as predictive as

cognitive ability in predicting and possibly causing higher course grades. Why? Even intelligent

students might not enjoy the work (Wong and Csikszentmihalyi [1991]). Indeed, there is

evidence that the association between Conscientiousness and course grades is mediated by

positive study habits and attitudes, effort, and prosocial behavior in the classroom.187



Standardized Achievement Test Scores

Like course grades, standardized achievement test scores reflect a student’s acquired skills and

knowledge. Thus, dimensions of personality that influence the acquisition of skills and

knowledge should predict both outcomes. One might expect, therefore, that traits related to

Conscientiousness predict achievement test scores. While studies using standardized

achievement tests are less common than studies using grades, ample empirical evidence shows

that aspects of personality predict both metrics of performance. As shown in Section 5, two traits

related to Neuroticism, locus of control and self-esteem, explain much of the variance of the

Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT), an achievement test which is often used as a measure

of pure intelligence in studies in economics. Similarly, Figure 15 shows that in samples from

three New York City middle schools, controlling for IQ, Openness to Experience is associated

with Standardized Achievement Test Scores.

        Roy Martin and colleagues were among the first to demonstrate that teacher and parent

ratings of early childhood persistence, (low) distractibility, and (low) activity prospectively

predict both course grades and standardized achievement test scores (see Martin [1989] for a

summary). Likewise, in a representative sample of Baltimore first graders, teacher ratings of

attention span—restlessness in first grade—predicted both course grades and standardized

achievement test scores four years later (Alexander, Entwisle and Dauber [1993]).

        More recently, in a sample of preschool children from low-income homes, parent and

teacher ratings of effortful control, a facet of Conscientiousness, predicted standardized

achievement test scores in kindergarten, even after controlling for general intelligence (Blair and

Razza [2007]). Similarly, in a sample of kindergarteners, teacher and parent ratings of effortful

control predicted performance on standardized achievement tests six months later when

controlling for both verbal intelligence and family socioeconomic status (Valiente, Lemery-

Chalfant and Swanson [2010]). Teacher ratings of inattention at the beginning of the school year

predicted standardized achievement test scores at the end of the school year in a sample of fourth

graders (Finn, Pannozzo and Voelkl [1995]).

        Task measures of effortful control, a trait related to Conscientiousness, predict

performance on standardized achievement tests much later in life. For instance, the number of

seconds a child waits for a more preferred treat in a preschool test of delay of gratification

predicts the SAT college admission test more than a decade later, with raw correlations of

r  0.42 for the verbal section and r  0.57 for the quantitative section (Mischel, Shoda and

Rodriguez [1989]). The Head-to-Toes and Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders tasks requires young

children to inhibit automatic responses, pay attention, and keep instructions in working memory

(e.g., to touch their heads when the experimenter says “touch your toes”) (Ponitz, McClelland,

Jewkes et al. [2008]; Ponitz, McClelland, Matthews et al. [2009]). Performance on this brief task

predicts later performance on standardized achievement tests (McClelland, Cameron, Connor et

al. [2007]).

                                                                                               148
        Perhaps most conclusively, Duncan and colleagues [2007] analyzed six large,

longitudinal datasets and found that school-entry attention skills, measured variously by task and

questionnaire measures, prospectively predict achievement test scores, even when controlling for

school-entry academic skills. In contrast, internalizing behavior (e.g. depression, anxiousness,

withdrawal) and externalizing behaviors (e.g. aggression, hyperactivity, antisocial behavior) at

school-entry do not reliably predict standardized achievement test scores. Attention skills are

related to Conscientiousness; externalizing behavior is related to Agreeableness and

Conscientiousness; and internalizing behaviors are related to Neuroticism.

        In sum, traits related to Conscientiousness play an important role in predicting

achievement tests above and beyond cognitive ability. Nevertheless, as discussed in Section 6,

time discounting and risk aversion also relate to test score performance, suggesting that both

personality-related traits and preferences are important determinants of outcomes, consistent

with the economic model presented in Section 3. In contrast to educational attainment, traits

related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are less important for test

performance.



Where Course Grades and Standardized Achievement Test Scores Diverge

Course grades and standardized test scores are generally highly correlated. Each form of

assessment provides reciprocal evidence on the validity of the other. Willingham, Pollack and

Lewis [2002] estimate a raw correlation of r  0.62 ( p  0.01) between total grade average and

achievement test scores.188 This strong association—and the objective of each form of

assessment to gauge student learning—explains why standardized achievement tests and grades
188
   The correlations were even higher when the test and grades were based on similar subject matter. They use the
data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS) data.
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 149
are widely assumed to be “mutual surrogates; that is, measuring much the same thing, even in the

face of obvious differences.”189 What are these differences, and how might the contribution of

personality to performance vary accordingly?

           Standardized achievement tests are designed to enable apples-to-apples comparisons of

students from diverse contexts. To this end, standardized achievement tests are uniform in

subject matter, format, administration, and grading procedure across all test takers. A course

grade, on the other hand might depend on a particular teacher’s judgment.

           The power of standardized achievement tests to predict later academic and occupational

outcomes is well-established (Kuncel and Hezlett [2007]; Sackett, Borneman and Connelly

[2008]; Willingham [1985]). Nevertheless, cumulative high school GPA predicts graduation

from college dramatically better than SAT/ACT scores do, even without adjusting for differences

in high school quality (Bowen, Chingos and McPherson [2009b]). Similarly, high school GPA

more powerfully predicts college rank-in-class (Bowen, Chingos and McPherson [2009b]; Geiser

and Santelices [2007]).

           Perhaps more important than which measure of academic achievement – course grades or

standardized achievement test scores – is more predictive of later outcomes is why these

outcomes are related but not entirely interchangeable. Bowen and colleagues [2009b] speculate

that aspects of Conscientiousness seem differentially essential to earning strong course grades

because of what is required of students to earn them. Standardized achievement tests, in contrast

to teacher-designed quizzes, exams, homework assignments, and long-term projects, challenge

students to solve relatively novel problems. It is therefore not surprising that Frey and Detterman

[2004] found a correlation of r  0.82 ( p  0.01) between SAT scores and performance on the

      Willingham, Pollack and Lewis [2002, p. 2].

                                                                                         150
ASVAB, an aptitude and achievement test developed for the United States Army. In a separate

sample, Frey and Detterman found a correlation of r  0.72 ( p  0.01) between SAT scores and

IQ when accounting for censoring. In contrast, the correlation between GPA and IQ is r  0.23

( p  0.01) (Poropat [2009]).

       In three longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students, Duckworth, Quinn

and Tsukayama [2010] compare the variance explained in year-end standardized achievement

test scores and GPA by self-control (a facet of Conscientiousness) and fluid intelligence

measured at the beginning of the school year. For example, in a national sample of children,

fourth grade self-control was a stronger predictor of ninth grade GPA (   0.40, p  0.001) than

was fourth grade IQ (   0.28, p  0.001) . In contrast, fourth grade self-control was a weaker

predictor of ninth grade standardized test scores (   0.11, p  0.05) than was fourth grade IQ

(   0.64, p  0.001) . These findings are consistent with those of Willingham, Pollack, and

Lewis [2002], who show that conscientious classroom behaviors are more strongly associated

with GPA than with standardized achievement test scores. Likewise, Oliver, Guerin, and

Gottfried [2007] found that parent and self-report ratings of distractibility and persistence at age

16 predicted high school and college GPA, but not SAT test scores. Table 10 presents results

showing that Conscientiousness and SAT scores are similarly predictive of college GPA.

However, in each of the studies below, Conscientiousness was measured in college which

presents problems for a causal interpretation of this evidence due to the potential for reverse

causality.

            In sum, standardized achievement tests and teacher-assigned course grades both reflect

  students’ accumulated knowledge and skill. However, they differ in important ways. The

  benefits of Conscientiousness, which inclines students to more productive work habits, seem

  greater for course grades than for test scores. This finding might explain why girls, who are

  higher than boys in Conscientiousness, reliably earn higher grades than boys in every subject

from primary school through college – but do not reliably outperform boys on either

standardized achievement or intelligence tests (Duckworth and Seligman [2006]).



7.B.     Labor Market Outcomes

                                “Eighty percent of success is showing up.”

                                                 Woody Allen

It is intuitive that personality traits affect labor market outcomes. Showing up is required for

completing a task. Precisely quantifying the direct effects of personality, however, is more

difficult.190 Recently, social scientists have started to tackle the problem and, in general, find

that of the Big Five, Conscientiousness and traits associated with Neuroticism (locus of control

and self-esteem) play a particularly important role in determining job performance and wages.

The evidence suggests multiple channels of influence, including occupational matching,

incentive scheme selection, absenteeism, turnover, and job search.

         Aspects of job performance are related to academic performance. For example, both

require completing work on a schedule and involve intelligence to varying degrees. It is

therefore not surprising, that, as with academic performance, numerous studies and meta-

analyses have found that Conscientiousness is associated with job performance and wages

(Nyhus and Pons [2005]; Salgado [1997]; Hogan and Holland [2003]; Barrick and Mount

[1991]). Figure 16 presents correlations of the Big Five and IQ with job performance. Of the Big

Five, Conscientiousness is the most associated with job performance but is about half as

predictive as IQ. Conscientiousness, however, may play a more pervasive role than IQ. The


190
   Even Allen admits that his estimate is partially based on the fact that “eighty” has better cadence than “seventy”
(Safire [1989]). Bowles, Gintis and Osborne [2001b] discuss evidence on the association between personality traits
and labor market outcomes.
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

importance of IQ increases with job complexity, defined as the information processing

requirements of the job: cognitive skills are more important for professors, scientists, and senior

managers than for semi-skilled or unskilled laborers (Schmidt and Hunter [2004]). In contrast,

the importance of Conscientiousness does not vary much with job complexity (Barrick and

Mount [1991]), suggesting that it pertains to a wider spectrum of jobs. Causality remains an

open question, as it does in most of the literature in psychology. The raw correlations presented

in Figure 16 do not account for reverse causality, and the authors do not clearly delineate when

the measures of personality were taken.

The authors do report the timing of the measurements of personality relative to job performance. Of the Big Five,
the coefficient on Conscientiousness is the only one that is statistically significant with a lower bound on the 90%
credibility value of 0.10. The value for IQ is a raw correlation.

       Facets related to Emotional Stability (the opposite of Neuroticism) are also important for

labor market success. Accounting for reverse causality, however, is particularly important,

because strong evidence suggests labor market participation can affect traits related to

Neuroticism (See the discussion of the research of Gottschalk [2005] in Section 8). Several

studies have addressed this problem by using measures of personality measured well before

individuals enter the labor market and find that locus of control and self-esteem, two facets of

Emotional Stability, predict wages (Judge and Hurst [2007]; Drago [2008]; Duncan and Dunifon

[1998]). Table 11 presents results from the structural model of Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua

[2006] suggesting that standardized adolescent measures of locus of control and self-esteem

predict adult earnings to a similar degree as cognitive ability. However, the effects vary across

educational levels. In general, noncognitive ability (personality) affects wages to a similar

degree across all education levels, whereas cognitive ability tends to have little effect for GED

recipients, high school dropouts, and college dropouts.

         More recent evidence, however, suggests that personality affects wages mostly through

the channel of educational attainment. In Section 7.A, we presented evidence that personality

measures (along with measurements of cognition) are strong predictors of educational

attainment. Heckman, Humphries, Urzua et al. [2010] estimate a model of sequential

educational choice and find that personality, as measured by participation in adolescent risky

behaviors, primarily affects age 30 earnings through its effects on education. They find that

given educational attainment, the effects of personality variables on outcomes are weak.191

recipients – who have lower levels of non-cognitive skills but comparable levels of cognitive

skills (see the previous section) – have lower wages, lower total wage income, and work fewer

hours relative to high school graduates, when controlling for ability. Other studies by Heckman,

Stixrud and Urzua [2006] and Cattan [2010], using other measures of personality traits, find that

the traits affect earnings above and beyond their effects on education and the effects of education

on earnings. Resolving these disparate findings is an important topic for future research.

Notes: Regressions control for baseline AFQT scores, age, mother's highest grade completed, and dummies for
urban residence at age 14, southern residence at age 14, and race. Baseline test scores are estimated using the
procedure of Hansen, Heckman and Mullen [2004] as implemented in Carneiro, Heckman and Masterov [2005]. The
regressions use the cross-sectional subsample and minority oversamples of the NLSY79 data. The estimation sample
is restricted to individuals who never attend college and who have not been incarcerated. Regressions for hourly
wage and hours worked are restricted to those reporting more than $1/hour and less than $100/hour, and individuals
working less than 4,000 hours in a given year. Wage income regressions are restricted to individuals reporting wage
incomes between $1,000/year and $100,000/year. All monetary values are in 2005 dollars. Standard errors are
clustered by individual.

        These various studies have shown that personality is associated with wages, but do not

explain why they are associated other than suggesting that the relationship occurs through the

channel of educational attainment. Other mechanisms might be absenteeism, job turnover and

unemployment. Indeed, controlling for basic demographics, employment history and health,

Störmer and Fahr [2010] estimate that a standard deviation increase in Emotional Stability and

Agreeableness is associated with 12% ( p  0.01) and 9% ( p  0.05) fewer absent days for men

and a standard deviation increase in Openness to Experience is associated with 13% ( p  0.01)

more absent days for women. However, the study uses contemporaneous measures of

personality and absenteeism.192

        Personality plays a role outside of formal employer-employee relationships. Self-

employed workers, with either very low or high levels of risk-aversion, a trait related to

dimensions of personality as discussed in Section 6, tend to remain self-employed for a shorter

time, suggesting that they are less suited to self employment (Caliendo, Fossen and Kritikos

[2008]).193

        Personality could directly affect the duration of unemployment spells. Gallo, Endrass,

Bradley et al. [2003] finds that an internal locus of control is associated with a higher probability

of reemployment. A couple of studies have explicitly incorporated locus of control into standard

job search models. For example, Caliendo, Cobb-Clark and Uhlendorff [2010] examine whether

a higher locus of control increases the perceived marginal benefit of exerting search effort, so

that people with a more internal locus of control will search more intensely and will have a

higher reservation wage. Supporting their theory, a one standard deviation increase in internal

locus of control was associated with a 1.9% increase in the reservation wage ( p  0.01) and a

5.3% increase in the number of job applications submitted ( p  0.01) , controlling for

192
   All other Big Five traits were not statistically significant at the 10% level.
193
   Caliendo, Fossen, and Kritikos use measures of risk-aversion from 2004 and employment status from 2000-2005,
assuming that risk-aversion is constant during this period.

                                                                                                 159
demographic characteristics and past employment history.194 While the measures were

contemporaneous, the respondents became unemployed near the time that the locus of control

was measured, potentially limiting the role of reverse causality. Similarly, McGee [2010]

proposes a model in which people with a higher locus of control believe that search effort has a

higher return. The theoretical model predicts that those with an internal locus of control search

more intensely but have higher reservation wages, so that the effect on the hazard rate of leaving

unemployment is ambiguous. In line with his predictions, he finds that a one standard deviation

increase in pre-labor market locus of control is associated with a 1.3% increase in the reservation

wage ( p  0.01) and a 20% increase in the time spent searching for a job per week ( p  0.14) .195

Those with moderate levels of locus of control have the highest hazard rates for leaving

unemployment. Consistent with the interpretation that locus of control affects beliefs (not

productivity), locus of control has no effect on reemployment wages when controlling for

reservation wages.

         Personality traits also affect occupational choice. From an economic perspective, some

personality traits that reflect ability might be valued more highly in some occupations, and, on

the supply side, people with certain personality traits that relate to preferences might value the

non-pecuniary benefits associated with particular occupations. Supporting this notion,

Conscientiousness (Barrick and Mount [1991]; Ham, Junankar and Wells [2009]), locus of

control and self-esteem (Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006]) predict sorting into occupations.

However, these studies use relatively broad occupational categories that might obfuscate more

nuanced influences of personality. Analyzing eighteen occupational categories, Cobb-Clark and


194
    The associations were partially mediated when controlling for the Big Five, suggesting that locus of control
overlaps with the Big Five as suggested in Section 5.
195
    The effect on the reservation wage is higher for people looking for first jobs.

                                                                                              160
Tan [2009] find that for men, a one standard deviation increase in Agreeableness is associated

with a 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( p  0.01) and a 2.9% decrease in

being a business professional ( p  0.01) . A standard deviation increase in internal locus of

control is associated with 2.8% decrease in the probability of being a manager ( p  0.01) . In

contrast, for women, a one standard deviation increase in Openness to Experience is associated

with a 2.5% increase in being a manager ( p  0.01) .196,197

        Furthermore, the value of cognitive ability and personality differs based on occupation

just as they do by education. Cattan [2010] estimates a structural model of comparative

advantage along the lines discussed in Section 3 and finds different skills are valued differently,

depending on the occupation. Accounting for selection, a standard deviation increase in

adolescent sociability (related to Extraversion) leads to a 6% increase in the wages of managers

( p  0.01) , a 4% increase in the wages of sales workers ( p  0.10) , a 2% increase in the wages

of clerical workers ( p  0.05) , but leads to a 2% decrease in wages of professionals ( p  0.10)

and has no significant impact on the wages of blue-collar workers. Self-esteem and locus of

control are positively valued in all occupations, but the magnitudes also depend on the

occupation. The effects of traits need not be uniform on wages across occupations.

        Personality might affect not only the occupational selection, but also the type of

compensation scheme selected within occupation. Dur, Non and Roelfsema [2010] extend the

standard principal-agent model by allowing for workers to reciprocate positive attention from

managers by working harder. Their theoretical model implies that promotions, rather than

monetary incentives, should be more effective for eliciting effort from reciprocal workers.

196
    The data for occupational categories came from 2001-2006, whereas locus of control was measured in 2003-2004
and The Big Five were measured in 2005. Thus these concerns about reverse causality are valid.

    They find other statistically significant results at the 5% and 10% levels which we omit for brevity.

Workers self-select into different compensation schemes. Supporting their model, they find that

a one point increase on a seven point reciprocity scale for workers is associated with a 5

percentage point increase of having a job with promotion incentives ( p  0.01) . They use

contemporaneous measures of reciprocity and job attributes, which could be problematic if pay-

for-performance schemes affect reciprocity. Similarly, Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2009] find

that in a German sample self-reported positive reciprocity is associated with income, and

employment, and working over time. Negative reciprocity tends to work in the opposite

direction. As discussed in Section 6, these measures of social preference relate to personality.198

        In sum, there are good theoretical reasons as well as some empirical evidence that

personality affects labor market outcomes through channels other than education.

Conscientiousness and Neuroticism are associated with job performance and wages to a similar

but lesser degree than cognitive ability. The personality traits are more important for people with

lower levels of job complexity or education level, whereas cognitive ability is more important at

higher levels of job complexity. Nevertheless, some research suggests that facets related to

Neuroticism might affect labor outcomes primarily through the channel of educational

attainment. Other traits, such as Openness to Experience and Agreeableness affect more specific

outcomes, such as selection into particular careers or type of compensation. Table A10 in Web

Appendix A7 summarizes a variety of studies that associate personality with labor market

outcomes.




198
  Agreeableness and Conscientiousness are associated with more positive reciprocity and less negative reciprocity,
whereas Neuroticism is associated with more negative reciprocity (Dohmen, Falk, Huffman et al. [2008]).

7.C.     Personality and Health199

A link between personality and health has been noted for thousands of years. Hippocrates

argued that an imbalance of the four temperaments would affect both personality and physical

health.200 Consistent with Hippocrates’ ideas, recent evidence suggests that personality predicts

health. The mechanisms are relatively unexplored but some empirical evidence suggests that

personality affects health-related behavior, psychological responses, and social relationships

(Kern and Friedman [2010a]).

         A growing body of work shows that personality measures predict longevity. Roberts,

Kuncel, Shiner et al. [2007] review evidence from 34 different studies on the predictive validity

of Big Five personality traits, relative to that of cognitive ability and socioeconomic status, for

longevity. Most studies in their meta-analysis control for relevant background factors, including

gender and severity of disease. Roberts and colleagues convert the results of each study into

correlation coefficients that can be compared across studies. As shown in Figure 18,

Conscientiousness was a stronger predictor of longevity than any other Big Five trait and a

stronger predictor than either IQ or socioeconomic status.201 In general, traits related to

Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Agreeableness are associated with longer lives,

whereas those related to Neuroticism are associated with shorter life spans.202 The magnitudes

of the relationships, however, vary across studies and not all results are replicable. While the

specific channels through which personality affects longevity and health are largely unknown,

several studies provide some clues.

         Personality may affect health-related behavior, such as smoking, diet, and exercise. For

example, Hampson, Goldberg, Vogt et al. [2007] find that high scores of teacher-assessments of

Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness during elementary school predict overall

health status during midlife (less smoking, more exercise, better self-rated health) and indirectly

affect health through educational attainment. The correlations that were statistically significant at

the 5% level or less ranged from 0.06 for the effect of Extraversion on physical activity to 0.12

for the effect of Conscientiousness on self-reported health status. Both the initial level and the

growth in hostility (a facet of Neuroticism) throughout elementary school predict cigarette,

alcohol, and marijuana use in high school, and sociability (a trait related to Extraversion) predicts

drinking but not smoking (Hampson, Tildesley, Andrews et al. [2010]). As Figure 19 illustrates,

Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] find that their personality factor affects the probability of
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

daily smoking for males. The gradient is steepest at the high and low quantiles of the

distribution.

        Although many studies control for socioeconomic and health factors associated with

mortality, most do not explore how personality affects health throughout the life-cycle (Kern and

Friedman [2010b]). The relationship between health and personality is complicated because
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

health can affect personality.203 Some studies investigate the mechanisms by which personality

affects health by considering how initial endowment of traits and health affect mid-life

outcomes, such as healthy behavior and education, which in turn can influence health and

longevity. For example, Gale, Batty and Deary [2008] find that a one standard deviation

increase in age-10 locus of control decreases the risk of adult obesity by 8% ( p  0.05 ).

Similarly, Friedman, Kern and Reynolds [2010] find that in a cohort of gifted children,

Conscientiousness better predicted longevity and social interactions at age 70. They find that

Neuroticism is associated with worse health for women but better health for men. These studies

do not account for the possibility that health and personality exhibit dynamic complementarities

over the life cycle.

        Several studies have controlled for reverse-causality by using structural models to

estimate the life-cycle evolution of health. Using a structural model of skill expression, Conti and

Heckman [2010] estimate the causal relationship between personality traits, initial health

endowments and endogenous choices about schooling and post-schooling outcomes. They find

that women sort into higher education based on cognitive ability, personality traits and initial

health endowment. Furthermore, personality and health status measured during youth explain

more than half of the difference in poor health, depression and obesity at age 30. Figure 20

shows that for males, personality and health endowments are more predictive than the cognitive

ones, whereas for females all three are similarly predictive. Using similar methods, Savelyev

[2010] finds that both child Conscientiousness and higher education increase survival through

age 80, but these traits serve as substitutes for each other so that effects of education are only

strong at low levels of Conscientiousness.

         In sum, Conscientiousness seems to be the most important Big Five trait in predicting

health outcomes. Personality likely affects health through behaviors such as smoking, eating, and

exercising. Studies that model the dynamic evolution of health over the life cycle find that

personality affects health outcomes as much as cognitive measures or even more so in some

cases.

7.D.    Crime204

Few studies have examined the relationship between the Big Five and criminal behavior. The

available evidence suggests that Big Five Conscientiousness and Agreeableness are important

protective factors against criminal activity. Figure 21 illustrates that in a sample of at-risk youth,

boys who had committed severe delinquent behaviors were more than three quarters of a

standard deviation lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, as measured by mother’s

reports at age 12 or 13, than boys who had committed minor or no delinquent behaviors up to

that age (John, Caspi, Robins et al. [1994]).



Figure 21. Juvenile Delinquency and the Big Five




Notes: Delinquents are those who have committed at least one of the following: breaking and entering, strong-
arming, or selling drugs. Non-delinquents have committed at most one of the following stealing at home, vandalism
at home, or theft of something less than $5. The y-axis reports mean differences in standardized scores of the Big
Five measures based on mother’s reports. The measures were taken at ages 12-13 and reflect cumulative delinquent
behavior.

        Much of the literature in criminology focuses on the effects of self-control on crime.

People with low self-control are “impulsive, insensitive, physical (as opposed to mental), risk-

taking, short-sighted, and non-verbal” (Gottfredson and Hirschi [1990], p. 90). Measures of self-

control are associated with Big Five Conscientiousness (O’Gorman and Baxter [2002]). Several

studies have confirmed that self-control is associated with criminal activity. In an international

sample, controlling for basic demographics, a measure of self-control explained between 10%

and 16% of the variance in contemporaneously measured theft, assault, drug use, and vandalism

(Vazsonyi, Pickering, Junger et al. [2001]). Self-control relates to controlling impulsive

behavior so it is not surprising that sensation-seeking and impulsivity are also positively

associated with crime. In a sample of college students, partial correlations between a crime

factor205 and sensation-seeking and impulsive behavior were of 0.27 and 0.13 respectively, when

controlling for peer behavior and measures of risk appraisal (Horvath and Zuckerman [1993]).

         Self-control might not be the entire story. Negative emotionality—a tendency towards

depression likely related Neuroticism—is associated with contemporaneously measured

delinquency. Raw correlation coefficients range from r  0.13 for whites ( p  0.05) and

r  0.20 for black ( p  0.05) in one sample (Caspi, Moffit, Silva et al. [1994]) to r  0.22

( p  0.01) in another sample (Agnew, Brezina, Wright et al. [2002]). None of these studies

control for cognitive ability nor do they address causality.

         Further, an emerging literature investigates causal effects of education on crime.

Heckman, Stixrud and Urzua [2006] estimate a causal model of personality and education

accounting for reverse causality. They find that both cognitive traits and noncognitive traits, as

captured by locus of control and self esteem are affected by schooling.206 These traits in turn are

    The crime factor is based on arrest for selling or buying drugs, shoplifting, driving while drunk, perjury, forging
checks, and vandalizing.

    We discuss this work in Section 8.

equally predictive of criminal activity.207 Using changes in compulsory schooling laws as an

instrument, Lochner and Moretti [2004] and Machin, Marie and Vujić [2010] find that years of

education are negatively associated with criminal activities in the US and UK, respectively. In a

structural model of skill production, Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] show that

personality traits are relatively more important in predicting criminal activity than are cognitive

traits.

   Their measure of prediction is the effect of decile improvements of cognition and personality traits on the

8.   Stability and Change in Personality Traits and Preferences

 In this section, we review empirical evidence that shows that personality and IQ change over the

 life cycle. We explore three channels through which personality can change. First, we discuss

 the contribution of ontogeny (programmed developmental processes common to all persons) as

 well as sociogeny (shared socialization processes) and show how aspects of personality, such as

 sensation-seeking, evolve as the brain develops. Second, we show how personality changes

 through external forces that operate through alterations in normal biology, such as brain lesions

 and chemical interventions. Third, and most relevant for policy, we show that education,

 interventions, and parental investment can affect personality throughout the lifecycle. We also

 discuss the less abundant evidence on the malleability of preferences.


 8.A.   Broad Evidence on Changes in Traits over the Life Cycle
 The malleability of personality can be defined and measured in several ways: Mean-level change

 refers to change over time in absolute levels of a trait and is measured by changes in measures of

 a trait over time. Rank-order change, in contrast, refers to changes in the ordinal ranking of a

 trait in a population and is measured by rank correlations among longitudinal measures. One

 commonly held view is that rank-order or mean-level change in personality is nearly impossible

 after early adulthood. The speculation of James [1890] that “in most of us, by the age of thirty,

 the character has set like plaster, and will never soften again” (pp. 125-126) is widely touted (see

 Costa and McCrae [1994], McCrae and Costa [1990; 1994; 1996; 2003], Costa, McCrae and

 Siegler [1999]). However, mounting evidence suggests that the personality-as-plaster view is not

 correct (Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006], Roberts and Mroczek [2008]).

        During the early years of life, mean-level changes in measured traits are obvious and

 dramatic. For example, children become much more capable of self-control as they move from

                                                                                              171
infancy into toddler and preschool years (McCabe, Cunnington and Brooks-Gunn [2004],

Mischel and Metzner [1962], Posner and Rothbart [2000], Vaughn, Kopp and Krakow [1984]).

But mean-level changes in measured personality are also apparent, albeit less extreme, later in

life. In a 2006 meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, Roberts, Walton and Viechtbauer [2006]

examine cumulative lifetime change in Big Five Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness,

Extraversion, and Agreeableness. They disaggregate Big Five “Extraversion” into social

dominance (assertiveness, dominance) and social vitality (talkativeness, gregariousness, and

sociability). Figure 22 shows that people typically become more socially dominant,

conscientious, and emotionally stable (non-neurotic) across the life cycle, whereas social vitality

and Openness to Experience rise early in life and then fall in old age.208 Surprisingly, after

childhood, the greatest mean-level change in most measured personality traits takes place not

during adolescence, but rather in young adulthood.

   Figure A3 in Section A9 of the Web Appendix presents results for a variety of cognitive, personality and
preference parameters from a cross-sectional study based on the GSOEP data. Samples are small and standard
errors are large. Many preference parameters show a surprising stability over the life cycle.

         In contrast, a longitudinal study of adult intellectual development shows mean-level

declines in cognitive skills, particularly cognitive processing speed, after age 55 or so (Schaie

and crystallized intelligence rises over the life cycle (Horn [1970]). Accumulated skills and

knowledge are important: most of us would rather use an experienced cardiac surgeon who has

seen hundreds of cases just like ours to perform our surgery, rather than an exceptionally bright

young surgeon with minimal experience.

   Cross-sectional estimates of mean-level change are biased by cohort effects (for example, the Flynn effect)
whereas longitudinal estimates are biased by test-retest learning (when the same IQ tests are administered repeatedly
to the same subjects) and by selective attrition. Thus, both estimates must be considered in conjunction as evidence
for mean-level change.

                                       Rank-order stability in measured personality increases steadily over the lifespan. Figure

25 shows that seven-year test-retest stability estimates for personality plateau far from unity, at

r  0.74 , about the same level as terminal stability estimates for IQ (Roberts and DelVecchio

[2000]). However, measured personality does not reach this plateau until at least age 50; whereas

IQ reaches this plateau by age six or eight (Hopkins and Bracht [1975], Schuerger and Witt

[1989]). Figure 26 shows rank order stability of IQ over broad age ranges.

8.B.                           Evidence on Ontogenic and Sociogenic Change
A useful dichotomy contrasts normative change, defined as changes that are caused either by

biological programming (ontogenic) or by predictable changes in social roles (sociogenic), with

non-normative change, encompassing both intentional change, caused by deliberate, self-directed

efforts, deliberately chosen changes in social roles and atypical life events (trauma, for

example).210

                               If, as McCrae and colleagues have claimed, normative changes reflect genetically

programmed processes then investment should not affect change. The current literature in

psychology claims that genetic factors are largely responsible for stability in personality in

210
   Normative here refers to what most people or the average person experiences. If most people deliberately do
something that causes change, it would be normative. But that seems unlikely. Therefore, most deliberative change
is non-normative, but logically this is not necessarily true.
                                                     Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                  177
adulthood whereas environmental factors are mostly responsible for change (Blonigen, Hicks,
                                                                     211,212
Krueger et al. [2006]; Plomin and Nesselroade [1990]).

         In a longitudinal study of twins surveyed at age 20 and then again at age 30, about 80

percent of the variance of the stable component of personality was attributed to genetic factors

(McGue, Bacon and Lykken [1993]). In the same study, change in measured personality was

mostly attributed to environmental factors. Helson, Kwan, John et al. [2002], for example,

document the substantial influence that social roles and cultural milieu can have on personality

development. Their analysis is consistent with an economic model of investment and the

response of measured traits to incentives. However, recent evidence suggests that environmental

factors, and in particular stable social roles, also contribute to stability in personality and that

genetic factors can contribute to change (see Roberts, Wood and Caspi [2008] for a review).

         Research on IQ also points to the enduring effects of genes, in contrast to more transient

effects of environmental influences, which depend on a multitude of unstable variables,

including social roles, levels of physical maturity and decline, and historical and cultural

milieu.213 Increases in the heritability of IQ from childhood (about 40 percent) to adulthood

(estimates range from 60 percent to 80 percent) are well-documented in studies of behavioral

genetics and possibly reflect increasing control of the individual (vs. parents) over environment

(Bergen, Gardner and Kendler [2007]; McGue, Bouchard, Iacono et al. [1993]; Plomin, DeFries,




211
    Plomin and the essays in the December issue of Monographs for the Society for Research in Child Development
(Kovas, Haworth, Philip et al. [2007]) extend this analysis to childhood.
212
    We note that there is controversy in the literature about the validity of conventional estimates of heritability. It
centers on the linearity and additivity assumptions, the assumed absence of interactions between genes and
environment, and the assumption that genes do not select environments.
213
    We note here that while genes remain constant through the life cycle, the expression of genes is determined, in
part, by experience.

Craig et al. [2002]).214 Heritability estimates for Big Five traits are relatively stable across the

life cycle at about 40 to 60 percent (Bouchard and Loehlin [2001]).215 Behavioral genetics

studies typically estimate the effect of common parental environments on adult measures of

outcomes to be near zero, but Turkheimer, Haley, Waldron et al. [2003] find estimates from such

studies to be biased downward by the over-representation of middle- and upper-class families.

Among poor families, Turkheimer et al. find that 60 percent of the variance in IQ is accounted

for by shared environment and heritability estimates are much smaller than they are for affluent

families, whereas among affluent families, the contribution of heritability is much larger.

Krueger and colleagues have recently demonstrated that other moderators also influence the

heritability of traits (see Krueger, South, Johnson et al. [2008]).216

        Genes exert their influence in part through the selection and evocation of environments

that are compatible with one’s genotype—a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “gene-

environment correlation” or “nature via nurture” (see Rutter [2006a]). As individuals move from

childhood to adulthood, they have more control over their environments, and thus gene-

environment correlation becomes more important because shared environments become less

common.217

        Substantial but temporary influence of environment is a basic assumption of the Dickens-

Flynn model reconciling the high heritability of IQ and massive gains of IQ between generations


214
    Devlin, Daniels and Roeder [1997] suggest that traditional estimates of the heritability of IQ may be inflated
because they fail to take into account the effect of the environment of the maternal womb. See also Rutter [2006b]
and an emerging literature on epigenetics.
215
    Lykken [2007] suggests that heritability estimates for personality are substantially higher when situational
influence and measurement error are minimized by taking multiple measures at least a few months apart.
216
    It is important to note that shared environment is not the same as environment. Children may be treated
individually by parents.
217
    Gene-environment interactions are another means by which genes and environment jointly influence traits. The
effects of the environment depend on the genes and vice versa (see Caspi, Sugden, Moffitt et al. [2003]; Moffitt,
Caspi and Rutter [2005]; and Caspi, McClay, Moffitt et al. [2002]).
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 179
(Dickens and Flynn [2001]).218 The relatively short half-life of common environmental

influences may also explain why adopted children resemble their biological parents more and

more and their adopted parents less and less as they grow older (Scarr, Weinberg and Waldman

[1993]).219

         It is important to note that the family studies of genetic influence measure only the effects

of shared environments, which become less similar as children age. Thus even identical twins

may be motivated to seek out different environments over time (Rutter [2006a]). Recent

evidence that first born children grow up, on average, to have three points higher IQ than their

younger siblings reinforces the point that parents do not necessarily provide identical

environments in childhood (Kristensen and Bjerkedal [2007]). Conti, Heckman, Yi et al. [2010]

demonstrate how parents differentially respond to health shocks of identical twins. Lizzeri and

Siniscalchi [2008] develop an economic model of differential parenting of siblings.

         As mentioned earlier, genes could affect not only the base level of personality but also

how personality changes over the life cycle. Just as people grow taller throughout childhood,

people’s personalities might naturally develop, even without investment. Steinberg [2008]

speculates that typical biological (ontogenic) development explains the surge of risk-taking in

adolescence followed by the decline in adulthood. Figure 27 illustrates his conjecture about how

basic intellectual ability and psychosocial maturity (related, e.g., to impulsivity, risk perception,


218
    A second crucial assumption is that environmental influence can be amplified by a “social multiplier” effect:
smarter individuals create for one another an enriched environment, which in turn increases intelligence, and so on.
Some caution must be taken in relying on the claims in this literature. Blair, Gamson, Thorne et al. [2005] attribute
the Flynn effect to increasing access to formal schooling early in the twentieth century and, from the mid-century
onward, to increasing fluid cognitive demand of mathematics curricula. Flynn [2007] concurs about the former but
believes that the latter had negligible impact.
219
    The literature establishes that shared environments become less important as children age. This literature does
not say that environments do not matter. This effect can arise because genetically similar children (or their parents)
choose different environments to distinguish themselves or because of parental investment (Lizzeri and Siniscalchi
[2008]).

sensation-seeking, future orientation) evolve over the life cycle.220 He argues that intellectual

ability peaks around age 16, whereas psychosocial maturity develops during late adulthood. In

his model, the increase in adolescent risk taking is due to a restructuring of the brain’s

dopaminergic system (responsible for the brain’s reward processing) in such a way that

immediate or novel experiences yield higher rewards, especially in the presence of peers. He

attributes declines in risk-taking due to development of the brain’s cognitive control system,

specifically improvements in the prefrontal cortex which promote aspects of executive function

such as response inhibition, planning ahead, weighing risks and rewards, and the simultaneous

consideration of multiple information sources. Interestingly, even in his model, sensation-

seeking partly depends on the presence of peers, which corresponds to aspects of the situation

(h ) in the framework of Section 3. This example highlights the difficulty in disentangling

situational and biological changes in personality.




220
      Spear [2000a; b] also finds that sensation seeking reaches its peak in adolescence.

        What factors other than preprogrammed genetic influences might account for mean-level

changes in personality? Personality change in adulthood may be precipitated by major shifts in

social roles (for example, getting a job for the first time or becoming a parent). If social role

changes are experienced by most people in a population at the same time, we will observe the

effects as mean-level changes in measured personality. If, on the other hand, these social roles

are not assumed synchronously, we will observe rank-order changes.

        One difficulty with many of the studies that address this question is the problem of

reverse causality. Changes in personality may drive social role changes rather than the other way

around.

8.C.   External Changes to Biology
The previous subsection discusses the difficulty in disentangling biological changes in

personality from environmental or situational effects. In this subsection we provide some

evidence on causal changes in personality due to external forces that either damage parts of the

brain or abruptly alter the chemistry of the brain.


Brain Lesion Studies

Brain lesion studies provide the most dramatic and convincing evidence that personality can

change. The most famous example is Phineas Gage, a construction foreman whose head was

impaled by a metal spike and who subsequently changed from being polite and dependable to

rude and unreliable (Damasio, Grabowski, Frank et al. [2005]). Since then, there have been many

more case studies of patients with brain damage. For example, Mataró, Jurado, García-Sánchez

et al. [2001] describe the behavior of a Spanish patient whose head was impaled by an iron spike,

injuring both frontal lobes. Like Phineas Gage, his behavior changed. After the accident, he had

difficulty planning, became more irritable, and had problems regulating emotions. Unlike

Phineas, he was cheerful and did not display anti-social behavior, suggesting the personality is

malleable in different dimensions, even through brain damage.

       The effects of brain damage are persistent. After five years, patients who suffered

traumatic head injuries have social impairments, such as anger control, even when their

performance on cognitive tasks returns to the normal range (Lezak [1987]).

       Using more advanced methods, neuroscientists have delved deeper into the inner

workings of the brain. Some recent studies have investigated how two parts of the brain, the

amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), affect personality by regulating emotion.

Bechara [2005] discusses how emotion might allow people to assign and store value to particular
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         183
outcomes in a way that is useful for decision-making. The amygdala is thought to signal

“impulsive” emotional responses to immediate environmental stimuli, such as reacting quickly to

a snake. In contrast, the VMPC is thought to signal “reflective” emotional responses to

memories and knowledge. These two parts of the brain conflict with each other when people

make decisions: signals from the amygdala induce behavior that implicitly values immediate

outcomes, whereas signals from the VMPC reflect long-run considerations. The stronger signal

dictates the resultant behavior. People with damage to these parts of the brain, exhibit changes in

personality. For example, people with damage to the VMPC, the part that regulates reflective

emotion, tend to act impulsively and seem to overvalue short-term outcomes in a way that leads

to long-term financial loss and loss of friendships, despite having relatively normal levels of

intellectual capacity. These findings are consistent with McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein, and

Cohen’s    system that describes hyperbolic discounting (McClure, Laibson, Loewenstein et

al. [2004]). However, some recent research in neuroscience challenges this theory and presents

empirical evidence that contradicts    theory (Monterosso and Luo [2010]).

       Further experiments involving these parts of the brain highlight why attempts to separate

cognitive and noncognitive traits might be futile. For example, Bechara and Damasio [2005]

study the performance of patients with lesions in the VMPC in a seemingly cognitive task. The

participants were given the Iowa Gambling Task, in which they repeatedly chose between four

decks of cards that represented lotteries of different value, unknown to the participant at the

onset. Throughout the experiment, the authors also measured skin conductance responses

(SCRs), a known physiological reflection of emotion. By trial and error, participants without

lesions learned to choose the “better” decks of cards with lower short-term payoffs but higher

card and when receiving the rewards or penalties. In contrast, people with lesions never learned

to pick the better decks, seemingly because they could not develop emotional responses. Patients

with damage to the amygdala never showed emotional response to rewards or penalties,

suggesting they never learned to value the outcomes at all. Patients with damage to the VMPC

showed emotional response only when receiving the reward or penalty but not when selecting

decks, suggesting that they might not have reflective emotional responses crucial in considering

future consequences. The findings suggest that emotion helps to guide decision-making.

Numerous other studies show the role of the amygdala in signaling emotions and its relationship

to cognition and behavior (Phelps [2006]).


Chemical and Laboratory Interventions

A few recent studies show that it is possible to alter preferences and personality through

experiments that change the brain’s chemistry. For example, magnetic disruption of the left

lateral prefrontal cortex can increase experimentally elicited discount rates (Figner, Knoch,

Johnson et al. [2010]). Similarly, nasal sprays of oxytocin increase trust (distinct from altruism

or ability to assess probabilities) in a game-theoretic experiment (Kosfeld, Heinrichs, Zak et al.

[2005]). As discussed in Section 5, the Big Five traits are linked to personality disorders.

Therefore, it is not surprising that administering paroxetine, a drug for treating depression,

decreases Neuroticism and increases Extraversion. More surprising is that the drug affects

personality above and beyond its direct effects on depression. Furthermore, patients who become

less neurotic are also less likely to relapse even after treatment, suggesting that paroxetine might

have a long-lasting impact through a bio-chemical change in the brain (Tang, DeRubeis, Hollon

et al. [2009]). Similarly, Knutson, Wolkowitz, Cole et al. [1998] find evidence that paroxetine

can diminish hostile behavior through a decrease in general negative affect.

8.D.   The Evidence on the Causal Effects of Parental Investment, Education, and
       Interventions
Even though brain lesion studies and laboratory experiments provide convincing causal evidence

that personality can be changed, they are not viable mechanisms for large scale policy

interventions. A growing body of evidence suggests that education, parental investment, and

interventions can causally affect personality traits. More than just ontogenic and sociogenic

processes are at work. A major contribution of economics to the literature in psychology is to

develop and apply a framework to investigate how investment, including education, work

experience, and self help, changes traits. We discuss the evidence on trait changes through these

mechanisms, using the theoretical framework introduced in Section 3.H as a guide. In all of the

models considered in this subsection, the development of traits arises from purposive actions of

agents and not just from exogenous biological processes.

       The empirical literature has not estimated investment model (16) in Section 3.H in its full

generality. It focuses on estimating productivity functions (1) specified in terms of traits  .

Due to data limitations, there is no empirical work yet to report that standardizes for effort or for

situation. To simplify the notation, we keep h implicit.

       Denote the productivity traits at age v by  v . Substituting for actions in terms of their

determinants, the performance on task j at age v is

(22)                            Pjv   jv  v , evj  , j  1,, J  , v 

where evj is effort devoted to task j at time v . For simplicity, break  v into cognitive,  , and

personality,  , components:
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                186

                                                  v   v ,v  ,

using the notation of Section 3.221 evj depends on preferences, rewards and information.

           The vector of productivity traits evolves via a simplified version of (16):

(23)                                 v 1   v  v , IN v , hv  , v  1, ,V .

IN v is interpreted very broadly to include investment by parents, schools, work experience and

interventions.  0 is the vector of initial endowments. Some components of effort may be

included in investment.

           The productivity of investment can depend on the age at which it is made. A crucial

feature of the technology that helps to explain many findings in the literature on skill formation

(see Cunha and Heckman [2007; 2009]) is complementarity of traits with investment:

                                             2 v ( v , IN v , h v )
(24)                                                                    0.

                                                             
           Technology (23) is characterized by static complementarity between period v traits and

period v investment. The higher  v , the higher the productivity of the investment. There is also

                                                                                      
dynamic complementarity if the technology determines period v  1 traits  v1 . This generates

complementarity between investment in period v  1 and investment in period s , s  v  1 .

Higher investment in period v raises  v1 because technology is increasing in IN v , which in

turn raises  s because the technology is increasing in  v , for v between v and s . This, in turn,

                s (·)
increases            s
                        because  s and IN s are complements, as a consequence of (24).

        Dynamic complementarity explains the evidence that early nurturing environments affect

the ability of animals and humans to learn. It explains why investments in disadvantaged young

children are so productive. (See Knudsen, Heckman, Cameron et al. [2006].) Early investments

enhance the productivity of later investments. Dynamic complementarity also explains why

investment in low ability adults often has such low returns—because the stock of  v is low.222

Using dynamic complementarity, one can define critical and sensitive periods for investment. If

 v (·)                                                                   v (·)  v (·)
          0 for v  v   , v   is a critical period for that investment. If                   for all
 IN v                                                                       IN v    IN v

v  v , v is a sensitive period.223 The technology of skill formation is consistent with a body of

evidence that shows critical and sensitive periods in human development for a variety of traits.224

        Figure 28 shows how adult outcomes are shaped by sequences of investments over the

life cycle. The importance of the early years depends on how easy it is to reverse adverse early

effects with later investment. The literature shows that resilience and remediation are possible,

but are more costly later on.225 The accumulation of investments over the life cycle of the child

determines adult outcomes and the choices people will make when they become adults. To

capture these interactive effects requires nonlinear models.

        For the purposes of policy analysis, it is important to know at which stage of the life

cycle interventions are the most effective and to move beyond the correlations between early life

and later life events to understand the mechanisms of skill formation. Cunha and Heckman

[2008] and Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] estimate technologies of skill formation to

         The most general empirical specification of the technology to date is that of Cunha,

Heckman and Schennach [2010]. They allow for Q different developmental stages in the life of

the child: q  {1,  , Q} . Developmental stages may be defined over specific ranges of ages,
                                                                Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011

        A main finding of Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] is that the elasticity of

substitution  q governing the acquisition of cognitive traits decreases with q . This is consistent

with other evidence that shows the declining malleability of cognition with age, i.e., that

cognitive deficits are easier to remedy at early ages than at later ages. At the same time,  q ,

associated with personality, stays roughly constant over q . This is consistent with evidence on

the emergence of psychological maturity, as shown in Figure 27.227

        Adjoined with measurement systems for productivity on tasks in period v (equation

(22)), the econometric model is a “state space” model that accounts for errors in measurements

and endogeneity of inputs. Cunha and Heckman [2008] and Cunha, Heckman and Schennach

[2010] estimate these models on panel data on the growth dynamics of individuals and show that

accounting for measurement error and endogeneity is empirically important.

        Cunha, Heckman and Schennach [2010] estimate technology (25) using longitudinal data

on the development of children with rich measures of parental investment and of child traits.

They focus on the substitution parameters to examine the issue of the cost of remediating early

226
   For them, environment is parental environment.
227
   Cunha and Heckman [2008] estimate a linear version of the technology. Their specification rules out interaction
and assumes that, over the feasible range, investment can substitute for skill deficits.

disadvantage at later ages. Their findings shed light on the dynamic process of capability

formation in a way that raw correlations do not. They find that self-productivity becomes

stronger as children become older, for both cognitive and noncognitive capability formation. The

elasticity of substitution for cognitive inputs is smaller in second stage production, so that it is

more difficult to compensate for the effects of adverse environments on cognitive endowments at

later ages than it is at earlier ages.

          This finding helps to explain the evidence on ineffective cognitive remediation strategies

for disadvantaged adolescents documented in Cunha, Heckman, Lochner et al. [2006], Knudsen,

Heckman, Cameron et al. [2006] and Cunha and Heckman [2007]. Personality traits foster the

development of cognition but not vice versa. It is equally easy to substitute at both stages for

socioemotional skills over the life cycle. Overall, 16% of the variation in educational attainment

is explained by adolescent cognitive traits, 12% is due to adolescent personality (socioemotional

traits), and 15% is due to measured parental investments.


 8.D.1.       Evidence of Change in Traits from Other Studies of Parental Investment
Cunha, Heckman, Lochner et al. [2006] summarize a large literature on child development.

Evidence from a substantial literature suggests that for intelligence, the enduring effects of

environment are greater earlier in life. Duyme, Dumaret and Tomkiewicz [1999] studied children

with IQs below 86 who were adopted between the ages of four and six into stable homes. As

measured in their adolescent years, children adopted into high-SES homes gained an average of

19.5 IQ points; children adopted into low-SES homes showed an average gain of 7.7 IQ points.

In studies of Romanian children taken from impoverished orphanages and placed into middle-

class British homes, the long-term salutary effects of adoption on cognitive ability were dramatic

when infants were placed before they reached six months, and markedly less so when adoption
                                                  Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                               191
was delayed until later ages (Beckett, Maughan, Rutter et al. [2006]). Notably, children adopted

at different ages between six to 42 months did not differ at age 11 from each other in the terms of

cognitive ability, with all children demonstrating an average deficit of 15 IQ points relative to

children who had been adopted earlier in life. The effects of low nutrition had no effect on

cognitive outcomes at age 11, suggesting a prominent role for psychological deprivation. As

Beckett and colleagues point out, these findings are consistent with the existence of a very early

critical or sensitive period for intellectual development in which particular environmental stimuli

are necessary for normative axonal rewiring (see Uylings [2006] and Rutter [2006b] for

reviews).228


 8.D.2.        The Effects of Schooling on Cognitive and Personality Traits
Despite a large literature on the effects of schooling on shaping preferences (see Bowles and

Gintis [1976] and the literature it spawned), there is surprisingly little direct evidence on the

effect of schooling on cognitive and personality traits. An exception is the analysis of Heckman,

Stixrud and Urzua [2006]. The authors formulate and estimate an economic model that identifies

the effect of cognitive and personality traits on schooling and a variety of other outcomes. The

model controls for the effect of schooling in boosting both cognitive and personality measures

and thus controls for reverse causality. They estimate their model on the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), which has measures on the components of the Armed Services

Vocational Battery (ASVAB) that are used to create the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT),

a widely used measure of cognition. In addition, the NLSY79 has two measures of personality.

The Rotter Locus of Control Scale, discussed in Section 5, is designed to capture the extent to


228
   However, the data are also consistent with alternative explanations such as extreme stress permanently damaging
brain structures.
                                                    Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                 192
which individuals believe that they have control over their lives through self-motivation or self-

determination as opposed to the extent that the environment controls their lives (Rotter [1966]).

The NLSY79 data also contain the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, which attempts to assess the

degree of approval or disapproval of one’s self (Rosenberg [1965]). The relationship between

these measures and the Big Five traits of Neuroticism is discussed in Section 5.

           Different traits might be more responsive to investment at different ages. Figure 29

shows the causal effects of years of schooling attained on five components of the Armed Forces

Qualifying Test (AFQT). Schooling in the high school years has moderate but positive effects on

the measures of cognition, consistent with previous research by Hansen, Heckman and Mullen

[2004], Neal and Johnson [1996], and Winship and Korenman [1997]. The most dramatic causal

effects on cognition arise from college attendance. In contrast, locus of control is primarily

affected by high school attendance but not college attendance. On measures of self-esteem, an

additional year of high school and college play powerful roles.229

Notes: Effect of schooling on socioemotional scales for males with average ability, with 95% confidence bands. The
locus of control scale is based on the four-item abbreviated version of the Rotter Internal-External Locus of Control
Scale. This scale is designed to measure the extent to which individuals believe that they have control over their
lives through self-motivation or self-determination (internal control) as opposed to the extent to which individuals
believe that the environment controls their lives (external control). The self-esteem scale is based on the 10-item
Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. This scale describes a degree of approval or disapproval toward oneself. In both
cases, we standardize the test scores to have within-sample mean zero and variance one, after taking averages over
the respective sets of scales. The model is estimated using the NLSY79 sample. Solid lines depict average test
scores, and dashed lines, 2.5%–97.5% confidence intervals.

           Some other evidence supports the possibility that school can affect measures of

intelligence. Cahan and Cohen [1989] use a quasi-experimental paradigm comparing children

who differ in both age and schooling to show that schooling increases intelligence test scores

independently of age. Schooler and colleagues show that complex (that is, cognitively

demanding) work increases intellectual functioning among adults and vice versa (Schooler,

Mulatu and Oates [1999]; Kohn and Schooler [1978]).




 8.D.3.          Evidence from Interventions
As noted in the introduction, the Perry Preschool Program, did not have a lasting improvement

on cognitive ability, but did improve important later-life outcomes through personality

(Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010]). The Perry preschool program enriched the lives of

low-income black children with initial IQs below 85 at age 3. In addition, there were home visits

to promote parent-child interactions. The program stopped after two years. Participants were

taught social skills in a “plan-do-review” sequence where students planned a task, executed it

and then reviewed it with teachers and fellow students. They learned to work with others when

problems arose.230 The program was evaluated by the method of random assignment.

           The program had strong effects for both boys and girls, although the effects differ by age

and outcomes. The program had a statistically significant rate of return of around 6-10% per

annum for both boys and girls. These returns are above the post-World War II, pre-2008

meltdown, stock market returns to equity in U.S. labor market that are estimated to be 5.8% per




230
      Sylva [1997] describes the Perry program as a Vygotskian program fostering personality traits.
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         199
annum.231 The Perry Preschool Program worked primarily through socioemotional channels.

Figure 31 shows that the program improved scores on the California Achievement Test (CAT).

The program, however, did not have a lasting effect on IQ scores. This evidence is consistent

with the discussions in Sections 5 and 7 that show that achievement test results are strongly

dependent on personality traits (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008]; Borghans,

Golsteyn, Heckman et al. [2009]). Indeed the personalities of participants improved. Participants

had better direct measures of personal behavior (a weighted average of “absences and truancies,”

“lying and cheating,” “stealing,” and “swears or uses obscene words” measured by teachers in

the elementary school years). Participants improved their internalizing behavior, which, as noted

in Section 5, is related to Neuroticism. Heckman, Malofeeva, Pinto et al. [2010] decompose the

treatment effects of the Perry Program into components due to experientially-induced changes of

cognition (IQ) and the measures of personality at their disposal, and to residual factors.

Personality played a more important role in outcomes, particularly in later life.

         Analyses of data from Project STAR, a program that randomly assigned kindergarteners

and teachers to classes of different sizes, yields similar results to the Perry Program. Using data

from Project STAR, Dee and West [2008] find that assignment to a small class is associated with

positive changes in personality. In a follow-up reanalysis, Chetty, Friedman, Hilger et al. [2010]

examine the Project STAR program and find that students placed in higher quality kindergarten

classes—as measured by their peer’s average performance on a Stanford Achievement Test—

tend to have higher test scores at the end of kindergarten. The effect fades out over time; by

eighth grade, students in better kindergarten classes perform no differently on tests. However, as

with the Perry Program, the benefits reemerge later in life. People in better kindergarten

classrooms had significantly higher earnings in early adulthood. Furthermore, kindergarten

classroom quality also predicted better fourth and eighth grade behavior as measured by teacher-
                                                   Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                                201
assessed effort, initiative, interest in the class, and disruptive behavior.232 In turn, behavior

predicted earnings in adulthood, suggesting that personality is the channel through which better

kindergarten classrooms improve earnings.

        The Perry Program and Project STAR did not primarily focus on improving personality

traits, but a few programs have. The Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS)

curriculum teaches self-control, emotional awareness, and social problem-solving skills and is

aimed at elementary school children (see Bierman, Coie, Dodge et al. [2010]). A recent random-

assignment, longitudinal study demonstrates that the PATHS curriculum reduces teacher and

peer ratings of aggression, improves teacher and peer ratings of prosocial behavior, and improves

teacher ratings of academic engagement.233 PATHS is an exemplar of school-based social and

emotional learning (SEL) programs, whose impact on both course grades ( d  0.33 ), where d is

measured in units of standard deviations (“effect sizes”), and standardized achievement tests

scores ( d  0.27 ), was recently documented in a meta-analysis of controlled studies involving

over 270,000 children in kindergarten through college (Durlak and Weissberg [in press]).234

Likewise, a random assignment evaluation of Tools of the Mind, a preschool and early primary

school curriculum, shows that in short-term follow-ups it improves classroom behavior as well as

executive function, defined as higher-level cognitive skills including inhibitory control, working

memory, and cognitive flexibility (Barnett, Jung, Yarosz et al. [2008]; Barnett, Yarosz, Thomas

et al. [2006]; Bodrova and Leong [2001]; Bodrova and Leong [2007]; Diamond, Barnett,

    These scales are based on more detailed questionnaires. Only a subset of the sample has their behavioral
measures.

    Bierman, Coie, Dodge et al. [2010]

    Note however that the largest federal study to date on character education programs, including PATHS, failed to
find evidence for improvements in behavior or academic performance (see Social and Character Development
Research Consortium [2010]).

Thomas et al. [2007]). Similar findings are reported for the Montessori preschool curriculum

(Lillard and Else-Quest [2006]).

       There is also evidence that targeted intervention efforts delivered to individual children

can improve aspects of Conscientiousness. These studies are typically more short-term and, in

contrast to the multi-faceted curricula described above, are designed to isolate a particular

mechanism for behavior change. For instance, Rueda and colleagues [2005] designed a set of

computer exercises to train attention in children between four and six years of age. Children in

the intervention group improved in performance on computer tasks of attention relative to

children who instead watched interactive videos for a comparable amount of time. Similarly,

Stevens and colleagues [2008] designed a six-week computerized intervention and showed that it

can improve selective auditory attention (i.e., the ability to attend to a target auditory signal in

the face of an irrelevant, distracting auditory signal). Again, all of these programs have short-

term follow-ups.

       Several studies suggest that personality can be remediated in adolescence. Martins [2010]

analyzes data from EPSIS, a program developed to improve student achievement of 13-15 year-

olds in Portugal by increasing motivation, self-esteem, and study skills. The program consists of

one-on-one meetings with a trained staff member or meetings in small groups. The intervention

was tailored to each participant’s individual skill deficit. Overall, the program was successful,

cost-effectively decreasing grade retention by 10 percentage points. Bloom, Gardenhire-Crooks

and Mandsager [2009] analyze the data from the National Guard Youth Challenge program, a

17-month intervention for youth who have dropped out of high school. While the program does

not require military enrollment, it stresses aspects of military discipline. The program features a

two-week assessment period, a 20-week residential program often conducted at a military base,
                                            Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                         203
and a one-year mentoring program. Nine months after entry, participants in the program were

12% more likely to obtain a high school diploma or GED, were 9% more likely to be working

full time, and were less likely to be arrested. Furthermore, participants had higher levels of self-

efficacy (a trait related to Emotional Stability), suggesting that personality change might have

helped with the improvements. However, the 9-month follow-up period is too short to know if

the program has long-lasting effects. While these studies show that personality can be improved

through intervention, a couple of other studies show less promising results when the

interventions were targeted at adolescents (Rodríguez-Planas [2010], Holmlund and Silva

[2009]).

       Behncke [2009] provides some experimental evidence that short-term exogenous shocks

to non-cognitive skills affect test performance. She finds giving words of encouragement, an

intervention that might boost short-term self-efficacy or self-esteem, before a diagnostic math

test was associated with 2.5% higher scores amongst all students ( p  0.05) and 8% higher

scores amongst those with self-reported difficulties with math ( p  0.01) . The result suggests that

non-cognitive skills can be shaped, even in the very short-term.

       The evidence for adults corroborates the finding of Cunha, Heckman and Schennach

[2010] for children. Personality is malleable throughout the life cycle. For example, Gottschalk

[2005] shows evidence from a randomized control trial that working at a job can improve locus

of control. He uses data from the Self-Sufficiency Project (SSP) in which some welfare

recipients were randomly offered substantial subsidies to work. The subsidy more than doubled

the earnings of a minimum wage worker, and people in the experiment group worked about 1/3

more hours than those in the control group. After 36 months, those who received the subsidy

were more likely to have an improved locus of control.

       Several other studies find similar results. Clausen and Gilens [1990] claim that female

labor force participation increases self-confidence. Roberts [1997] reports an increase of social

dominance and Roberts and Chapman [2000] a decrease in Neuroticism for working women.

Others show that marital and family experiences shape personality (Helson and Picano [1990],

Roberts, Helson and Klohnen [2002]). However, these studies are all correlational in nature.

None of these studies have the random assignment features of the Gottschalk study.

       Personality may even be malleable at the end of life. Jackson, Hill, Payne et al. [2010]

investigate causal mechanisms behind the association between Openness to Experience and IQ,

using data from a 16-week intervention designed to boost inductive reasoning for elderly people.

The intervention consisted of lab training for how to recognize novel patterns and around 10

hours a week of solving crossword, Sudoku, and logic puzzles. Controlling for inductive

reasoning, self-reported Openness to Experience increased for participants during the training

program relative to those in a waitlisted control group. However, the elderly people were not

followed after the program to determine whether the change was long-lasting nor were other

important outcomes, like life expectancy, tracked.

       Table 12 summarizes the evidence on the effects of interventions that is discussed in this

subsection. The evidence is consistent with effects of interventions but there are woefully few

causal studies with long term follow-up.

Evidence from Psychotherapy

The accomplishments of psychotherapy also support the possibility of intentional, mean-level,

and rank-order change. In a 1980 meta-analysis, Smith, Glass and Miller summarized 475

controlled studies, concluding that individuals who undergo psychotherapy are about 0.85

standard deviations better on outcome measures than those who do not. The large benefits of

therapy are not permanent, however: the effect of psychotherapy over control conditions falls to

about half a standard deviation two years after therapy is concluded. Moreover, it is not clear that

the effects of psychotherapy on individuals who seek change generalize to individuals who are

not actively seeking treatment for a condition that causes them distress.235

        More evidence on the possibility of intentional change comes from the psychological

literature on expertise. Ericsson, Krampe and Tesch-Römer [1993] demonstrate across domains

as diverse as chess, musical performance, and digit span memory, that thousands of hours of

sustained, deliberate practice lead to dramatic improvements in skill. Ericsson points out that the

top performers in nearly every field do not reach world-class levels of skill until at least ten years

of deliberate practice.236




8.E.    Stability of Economic Preference Parameters
Less is known about the stability of economic preferences. To our knowledge, no longitudinal

study has measured the mean-level or rank-order stability of time preference over the life cycle

(Frederick, Loewenstein and O'Donoghue [2002]). A handful of cross-sectional studies using

relatively small samples have examined mean-level stability, and their findings are mixed.
235
    Some evidence that further intervention can produce enduring change in non-clinical populations comes from
Gillham and Reivich [1999] who show that children taught to make more optimistic causal attributions about
negative events maintain this optimistic outlook two years post-intervention.
236
    See Ericsson and Ward [2007] for a recent review of the evidence.

Green, Fry and Myerson [1994] and Harrison, Lau and Williams [2002] find that discount rates

are lower among older individuals. On the other hand, Chesson and Viscusi [2000] claim to find

that older adults have higher discount rates than younger adults. Chao, Szrek, Sousa Pereira et

al. [2007], de Wit, Flory, Acheson et al. [2007], and Coller and Williams [1999] find no

relationship between age and discount rate. Finally, Read and Read [2004] find a curvilinear

relationship in which older people discount more than younger people, and middle-aged people

discount less than either group. Sahm [2007] shows that risk aversion increases with age. Table

13 below summarizes the findings for a variety of recent economic studies on the heritability,

malleability and stability of preferences and personality.


Summary of Section 8

We have reviewed the evidence on change in personality over the life cycle. The evidence is

strong that personality changes over the life cycle, both in terms of mean-level and rank-order

change. The evidence on the source of the change is less clear cut. Three competing visions of

the source of change are discussed: (a) The ontogenic and sociogenic model that describes how

biology and socialization produce changes in average traits. This approach does not explain why

individuals develop with different trajectories; (b) The biological and pharmacological model

that describes how alterations in the biology of the person can explain variations in personality

and its evolution; and (c) The intervention/family influence model that describes how investment

and environments influence changes. No study considers all three sources of development at the

same time, largely due to data limitations. The evidence from the intervention and family

influence studies suggests that interventions that target personality may be effective but much

further evidence is required to specify the exact mechanisms through which the interventions

work.

9.     Summary and Conclusions

 We summarize this chapter by providing provisional answers to the eight questions posed in

 Section 1.

       (1) How can we fit psychological constructs of personality into an economic framework?

          Can conventional models of preferences in economics characterize the main theories in

          personality psychology?

          We have defined personality as a response function of agents that depends on situations

          (including incentives), endowments of traits, information, and resources within a

          conventional economic model. Psychologists analyze a richer class of actions than

          economists normally consider. We show how to integrate these actions into economic

          theory. The leading models of personality psychology are special cases of our model.237

       (2) What are the main measurement systems used in psychology for representing personality

          and personality traits, and how are they validated? How are different systems related to

          each other? What is the relationship between standard measures of personality and

          measures of psychopathology and child temperament?

          In Section 5, we exposit the main systems for measuring personality, focusing primarily,

          but not exclusively, on the Big Five model. We consider the strengths and limitations of

          the systems and the relationships among competing systems. We show how measures of

          psychopathology are extreme manifestations of personality traits and how child

          temperament is related to adult traits. We link specific diagnoses of pathology with

          conventional measures of psychological traits.

 237
    Freudian models of the unconscious would make the traits that govern behavior, and especially  , unknown to
 agents but nonetheless governing choices. A pure model of behaviorism would feature the effects of constraints on
 choices. Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman et al. [2008] develop such a model. We review it in the Web Appendix.

                                                                                      218
(3) What is the relationship between economic preference parameters and psychological

    measurements?

    We review an emerging body of research that relates economic preference parameters

    (risk aversion, time preference, ambiguity aversion, social preferences) to the Big Five

    traits and to measures of self-esteem and personal control that are linked to the Big Five

    traits. Time preference is negatively correlated with IQ and the ability to control

    attention. Risk preference is negatively correlated with IQ and other measures of

    cognition. Higher IQ people are more consistent in their choices under uncertainty.

    While risk aversion is related to personality traits, the available evidence suggests that

    marginal ambiguity aversion is not. Social preferences are predicted by measured

    personality traits, but the evidence on this question is not strong.

(4) How stable across situations and over the life cycle are preference parameters and

    personality traits?

   We review the history of the person-situation debate between the social psychologists

   who maintain the primacy of the situation in determining behavior and the traits theorists

   who maintain the primacy of traits in explaining behavior. Behavioral economists, as a

   group, have adopted the situationist point of view. Extreme advocates of the situationist

   point of view claim that there is no personality construct. The issue hinges on the

   nonlinearity of action, effort, and productivity functions. In the presence of such

   nonlinearities, measured traits (e.g., actions) depend on situations and tasks.

           A large body of evidence suggests that nonlinearity is an empirically important

   phenomenon. Nonetheless, a large body of evidence suggests that there are stable

   personality traits that predict a variety of behaviors in different situations. Personality is
                                         Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                      219
   not an ephemeral creation of situations, nor is its manifestation invariant across

   situations. Moreover, personality traits are not set in stone. They change over the life

   cycle. The evidence on the stability of preference parameters across situations and over

   life cycle is less ample. There is evidence that standard separable models of preferences

   are inadequate descriptions of choice behavior. There is little evidence on the stability or

   instability of preference parameters over the life cycle.

(5) What is the evidence on the predictive power of cognitive and personality traits?

    We present a large body of evidence that shows strong associations between personality

    traits and educational, labor market, health, and criminal outcomes.

(6) What is the evidence on the causal power of personality on behavioral outcomes?

   Few of the correlational studies relating personality to outcomes have a firm causal basis.

   Personality psychologists do not yet attempt to establish the causal status of personality.

   There are, however, a few experimental manipulations that establish the causal effect of

   personality. Recent studies in economics establish causal status of certain personality

   traits on outcomes for observational studies invoking assumptions that are inevitably

   subject to debate. Research in this area is likely to flourish in the coming years.

(7) Can personality be altered across the life cycle? Are interventions that change

    personality traits likely fruitful avenues for policy?

    There is a small but growing body of intervention studies that establish that personality

    traits can be altered over long periods of time in response to interventions. Some of the

    major effects of early childhood intervention programs appear to operate through their

    lasting effects on personality. Family investment decisions also change personality. The
                                       Almlund, Duckworth, Heckman, and Kautz 3/17/2011
                                                                                    220
   evidence to date suggests that interventions that boost personality traits can be effective

   in promoting adult success.

(8) Do the findings from psychology suggest that conventional economic theory should be

   enriched?

   The evidence from psychology enriches economics by providing a more nuanced

   interpretation of human choice and actions. It promises to provide a deeper

   understanding of conventional economic preference parameters and how they arise.

   Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, this promise remains unfulfilled. Given the

   current state of evidence against conventional economic preference specifications (see,

   e.g., Starmer [2000] and the evidence in Section 6), this line of research is very

   promising.
