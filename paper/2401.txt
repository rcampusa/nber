1.   Introduction

        The Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) has quickly become a popular

functional form for estimation and testing of consumer demand theory

since its introduction by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).1 AIDS provides a

first order approximation to any arbitrary demand system, and can

"almost" be made consistent with classica) demand theory through linear

resrictions on the parameters of the system.2 Since most empirical

applications of consumer demand theory employ aggregate data, the

desirable aggregation properties of AIDS renders it a particularly useful

functional form.3

        In this note I demonstrate the previously overlooked fact that if

the AIDS aggregate demand model is constructed as the aggregation of

individual consumer demands, then the error structure for any individual

equation is necessarily heteroskedastic unless the distribution of income

is constant across aggregates. Maximum likelihood estimation which

ignores this heteroskedasticity yields inconsistent estimates of the

variance—covariance matrix and renders likelihood ratio tests of the

restrictions of consumer demand theory inappropriate. A

heterokedasticity—consistent estimator of the variance—covariance matrix

is proposed by adopting the technique of White (1980) to the case at

hand.




2. The AIDS Model and Aggregation

     Muellbauer (1975, 1975) has shown that exact aggregation with respect

to AIDS is possible if the demand system takes the form
                                                    3


    5hki =       +                 log Pj + ak      log Exhi/khi.P,) +                 (1)
                     '3




where         is the expenditure share for the hth consumer of the kth

commodity in the Ith aggregate, Pj is the price of the jth commodity

(faced by all consumers in aggregate I), Xhj is an error term which Is

assumed to be iid across consumers and homoskedastic. P is a price

index defined by


    log P1 a +                 a   log kl +             y(log k1

                 +
                      J ) y.           log ki log p,1                                  (2)
                         kj
                         j<k

and ak, k' Tkj are parameters to be estimated.
        The term xhj/khi in (1) is called an "income equivalent" and can be

interpreted as the total expenditure by consumer h such that, if

different consumers h with different preferences faced the same prices,

they would choose the same expenditure shares of the commodities. This

specification allows for a limited amount of taste variation among

consumers without requiring linear Engel curves for exact aggregation to

be valid.

        Aggregating (1) over all consumers in the ith aggregate yields


          Ski = ak   +             log         +
                                                   [log   (x1/k1) —   log PJ +   tki

for Ahkl     the quantity demanded of the kth corinodity,

                 =



and, following Deaton and Muellbauer (1980), we define the aggregate

index k by



             lo(x1/k)                  log(xhi/khi)                                  (6)
                              I


where x is the average expenditure per consumer in aggregate i. The

aggregate k1 is viewed as a distributional entropy index, measuring the

distribution of consumer characteristics withing aggregate i. Aside from

the problem of determining k1, (3) is applicable to aggregate data and

will, in principle, yield estimates of the parameters of the individual

consumer's demand system. in most applications of AIDS where aggregation

has been considered explicitly, k1 has been assumed constant over i or

uncorrelated with        or Pjj due to lack of appropriate data (Deaton and

Muellbauer (1980), Veall and Zirirermann (1986)).

     Assuming that Chki is homoskedastic implies that Cki is

heteroskedastic, since



     V(Eki) =                               =            x       2
                                                                               (7)
                                                     [       ]
                                   Ehki]

where v(chki) =         and            E
                                       h
                                           x.       The degree of heteroskedasticity

depends on the unknown expenditure of alcohol distribution in the

i—th aggregate. Note that              is homoskedastic in general only if xhl/Xi
                                  ki

is independent of i, which will occur if the distribution of income is
                                                     5

constant across aggregates.

        The heteroskedaticity cannot be modelled since it is inherently

unobservable.5 However by adapting a procedure due to White (1980), it

is possible to calculate a heteroskedaticity—consistent variance—

covariance matrix            for   the parameter estimates.



3. A Heteroskedasticity—consistent Varlance—Covarfance Matrix for AIDS

        We begin by using a fundamental statistical relation: the

asymptotic variance—covariance matrix of a maximum likelihood estimator

is equal to the inverse of the variance—covariance matrix of the gradient

of the likelihood function (Kendall and Stuart (1967), Vol. II, p. 9,

Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman (1974), p. 657).

        Suppose we write the system of equations (1) in the form

                         =
                             f(z, )    +j                                              (8)
where x       is   the vector of left—hand side variables, z            is   the vector of

right—hand side variables, and i                is   the stacked vector of error terms

stacked first over the aggregates and then over equations. From (7),



   var (iki)           E(ikj)2 =
                                                [ j2             = A.                 (9)

where
         A1
              is   a vector of data for aggregate 1, each element at time t
                                          2
corresponding to
                                    hit
                             h


        Similarly,

                                            =
                                                     °k                               (10)

Hence
                                                                6

                                      021                                                             (11)


                                                            .

     The gradient of the likelihood function for the system of equations

(8) when the heteroskedasticity of i Is ignored can be written in the

form (Berndt, Hall, Hall and Hausman (1974))


          Q = (             )       (f . I) i                                                         (12)
                       j
    The variance-covariance matrix of the gradient is given by


  E(qq)        ( j )                (C' • 1) EEL j')](f1 • 1)1


           =
               C
                   j)               (C' .   I)   [z .       A)(I       •   1)1     )




           = (          )           (C • A)(
                   j                                    )                                             (13)


    The asymptotic variance—covariance matrix of ,                                     the   estimate of

calculated by the maximum likelihood (ML) method but assuming A                                       I when

forming the likelihood function, is given by



    V(j) =
                   {Lj )             (C1 •A) (j)Y'                                                    (14)
                                                7

        In order to find a consistent estimate of V(j) we first consider the

squared residual                from ML estimation when heteroskedasicity is

Ignored. This residual will provide the key to obtaining a consistent

estimate of V().

        Normalizing A11 (the first observation In the first aggregate) to be

unity, an estimation of Ait. 1, t not both =             1, can be obtained as


                  t =   2it                                                      (15)
                        ekll


There is one estimate of At from each equation In the system.6 A

natural single estimate of                 is



                            1                                                  (16)


        From White's (1980) extension of his Theorem 1 to the non—linear

case (p. 821). it is clear that utilizing Att along with consistent

estimates of if         and I will yield a consistent estimate of V(fi).


     The simplest way of completing this estimation problem is to use a

standard systems estimation computer program to find the maximum

likelihood estimator whose variance—covariance matrix is a consistent

estimate of the inverse of (13). Let ! be a transformation of both sides

of equation (8) which results in the gradient


    q      ( if   )CI   .
                            !')(      •   I)                                   (17)


where i    Is   a transformed error vector with variance-covariance matrix

assumed by the computer program to be I •           I.   Then the output of the

computer program will contain the following estimate of the variance—
                                       8

covariance matrix of the gradient:



  E(qq') = (           !')(      •   I)(E   •   I)(z1   •   flU   •   1) (   )


         =
               (j       • !'!]   C      )                                        (18)
Comparing (18) with (13) it Is apparent that setting 8'! = A will solve

our problem, since both z and         will be estimated consistently.7
