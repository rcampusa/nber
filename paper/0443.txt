      Federal Deficit Policy and the Eefects of Public Shocks



                              ABSTRACT



     Shifts between current taxation and debt issue alter the timing of
taxes, which induces a variety of intertemporal substitution effects. In
some circumstances the minimization of excess budget costs would entail
stabilization of expected overall tax rates over time. The first section
of the paper discusses this condition and derives its implications for the
behavior of public debt. Empirically the major movements in U.S. public
debt can be explained along the lines of the theoretical model as sensible
responses to business fluctuations, changes in government expenditures,
and variations in the anticipated inflation rate. In particular, much of
federal deficit policy appears to be consistent with economic efficiency.
The next section focuses on the economic effects of debt shocks, which are
interpreted as departures of public debt movements from the systematic
behavior that was investigated in the previous section. It is possible
theoretically that these shocks could influence aggregate demand even when
such effects did not arise from the systematic behavior of the deficit.
The constructed debt shocks appear to have expansionary influences on out-
put and negative effects on the unemployment rate, although the magnitudes
of the effects that have been isolated are substantially weaker than those
estimated for money shocks. Because it is the shock component of deficits —
rather than the systematic "policy" response — that has been shown to affect
real economic activity, the results do not provide a basis for using the
deficit as an element of activist stabilization policy. Overall, the results
do not suggest much payoff from the imposition of restrictions on federal
deficit behavior; it Is likely that such constraints would mainly increase
the excess burden that is imposed on the.pvivae.secto..• 'py: atcng

     It is standard practice in macroeconomics to focus on the aggregate

demand and stabilization policy aspects of federal deficits. The usual

macroanalysis neglects the implications of the choice between current tax-

ation and the issue of interest-bearing debt for the time pattern of tax

collections. If the aggregate demand effects of the debt/tax choice are

not the dominant considerations--as in the Ricardian equivalence case dis-

cussed but not necessarily supported in Ricardo (1951, pp. 184-89), Buchanan

(1958, pp. 43-46, 114-22), Bailey (1971, pp. 156-58), Barro (1974) and Buiter

and Tobin (1978), et.al.--then an assessment of the substitution effects

associated with the timing of taxes may be a key 'element in positive and norm-

ative analyses of public debt behavior. These types of allocative effects

would most naturally be studied from the viewpoint of public finance theory,

which is the perspective that I employ in the present paper. The spirit of

the approach is to go as far as possible theoretically and empirically in

analyzing deficit policy as the choice of tax rates over time in a setting

where the usual first-order macroeconomic effects are not present, but where

allocative issues arise that involve intertemporal substitution effects pro-

duced by changes in the timing of taxes.

     The first section summarizes some theoretical arguments on the debt/tax

choice that were presented in an earlier paper of mine (1979). The propo-.

sitions that are derived for public debt behavior center around a condition

of maintaining constant expected overall tax rates over time. Empirical

evidence is then reviewed on the long-term behavior of public debt in the

United States. The basic conclusion is that the major movements in public

debt can be explained along the lines of the theoretical model as sensible

responses to business fluctuations, changes in government expenditures, and

variations in the anticipated inflation rate. In particular, the public
                                    -2-




finance perspective suggests that much of federal deficit policy has been

consistent with economic efficiency. The next section focuses on the eco-

nomic effects of debt shocks, which are interpreted as departures of public

debt movements from the systematic behavior that was investigated in the

previous section. It is possible theoretically that these shocks could influ-

ence aggregate demand even when such effects did not arise from the systematic

behavior of the deficit. The constructed debt shocks appear to have expan-

sionary influences on output and negative effects on the unemployment rate,

although the magnitudes of the effects that have been isolated are substan-

tially weaker that those estimated for monetary shocks. Because it is the

shock component of deficits--rather than the systematic "policy" response--

that has been shown to affect real economic activity, the results do not

provide a basis for using the deficit as an element of activist stabilization

policy. Overall, the results do not suggest much payoff from the imposition

of restrictions on federal deficit behavior; it is likely that such constraints

would mainly increase the excess burden that is imposed on the private sector

by the financing of government expenditures.

Theoretical Considerations on Deficits and the Timing of Taxes

     It is assumed that tax collection entails not only the transfer of

resources from the private sector to the government, but also excess burdens

that involve the distortion of allocative decisions, which include the time

misallocated to tax computations and to the design of tax-avoidance schemes

and any administrative costs incurred by the tax-raising institution. In

other words "lump-sum" taxation is ruled out. If the present value of gov-

ernment expenditures is fixed, there will be a given present value of tax

revenues to be raised.' However, the fixity of this total leaves open the

timing of tax levies. Generally, alterations in this timing, which are

brought about by shifts between taxes and debt issue, will influence the

overall amount of excess burden costs.

     For present purposes I consider the behavior of a large national gov-

ernment, which can reasonably neglect the effects of the timing of taxes

and public services on mobility in and out of its jurisdiction. (See Benjamin

and Kochin, 1978, for a discussion of this matter.) In this circumstance

the choice of tax rates over time to minimize the overall excess burden costs--

that is, to minimize the deadweight resource loss from raising a given pre-

sent value of net revenues--provides a criterion for optimal policy. For

the present analysis I do not distinguish average from marginal tax rates;

essentially, the relation between these rates is assumed to be fixed by the

cross-sectional structure of taxation at a point in time, which is taken as

given.

     Suppose that taxes are levied on labor earnings or other activities at

various dates. The existence of these taxes induces a variety of tax-

avoiding responses, including substitutions away from market work and toward
                                     -4-




non-market activities at various points in time. However, if the tax rates

are equal over time, there are no tax-induced substitution effects on the

intertemporal arrangement of work or other activities. If the sensitivity

of supply to after-tax real returns is similar at different dates--in par-

ticular, if there is no strong interaction between supply elasticities and

the contemporaneous levels of either government purchases or real wages--

then a departure from this uniform pattern of taxation would generate extra

deadweight losses. That is, in accordance with the usual "triangle" anal-

ysis in consumer surplus calculations, the loss from reduced effort at a

high tax rate date would more than offset the gain associated with increased

supply at low tax rate dates. As seems clear from the time symmetry of this

model, optimal policy in this circumstance involves a unifGrm pattern of

tax rates over time. Further discussion of this proposition appears in

Barro (1979, pp. 941-45) and Kydland and Prescott (1980,         ).


     In   an environment where future government spending and gross national

product are uncertain, the precise constancy of tax rates over time would be

unattainable, but optimal policy would seem to dictate an equality between

current tax rates and anticipated future rates. (The model with uncertainty

has not been worked out rigorously.) In this case unexpected shifts in the

long-run average share of government spending in gross national product

would induce corresponding changes in current and expected future tax rates.

The current overall tax rate would be set so that--given the initial stock of

public debt, the anticipated pattern of future GNP and government spending

aside from interest payments, and the constraint imposed intertemporally by

the government's budget--it would be impossible to predict future changes in
                                    -5-




overall tax rates. As with some price variables in efficient market models,

tax rates would be generated from a random walk process.

     Although constancy of expected tax rates over time would not be optimal

in general, this condition may provide an approximate guide for desirable

deficit policy--and thereby also a positive theory of behavior--under many

circumstances. In any case it seems worthwhile first, to examine the theoretical

implications of the constant expected tax rate policy and second, to explore

the conformity of empirical evidence with these propositions. The stabili-

zation of anticipated tax rates over time has a large number of implications

for public debt behavior, some of which are familiar from alternative per-

spectives and some of which are new. These implications include the following:

     1) Temporarily large government expenditures, such as war spending,

extensive capital projects and international reparations payments, would be

financed principally by debt issue. Major increases in current tax rates

would be inconsistent with the expectation of reduced government spending in

future periods. Current and expected future tax rates would be raised only

to the extent of changes in the present value of expected government spending;

that is, only in accordance with shifts in the "permanent" expenditure flow.

Therefore, blips in expenditure that were anticipated at earlier dates would

not be associated with changes in current tax rates. Further, in order to

offset ex ante the positive effect on debt of infrequent, large wars, the

debt-income ratio would decline, rather than remain constant, during typical

peacetime years.

     2) Expansions of government's share of gross national product that

are perceived as permanent would be met by corresponding increases in current
                                       -6-




and expected future tax rates. This behavior is in line with the matching

of taxes to permanent government spending.

     3)   If real government expenditures exhibit little cyclical variability,

a tax-smoothing policy entails deficit finance during recessions and surpluses

during booms. In this respect the behavior of government resembles that of

individuals, who would tend to dissave during (temporary) bad times and save

a large fraction of windfalls. In the basic model the amount of counter-

cyclical deficit finance would be sufficient to stabilize overall tax rates

over the business cycle; see below for a discussion of some conflicting empi-

rical evidence.

     4) The policy of maintaining stable tax rates over time is independent

of the initial stock of outstanding public debt. Therefore, exogenous changes

in the real debt stock would alter the overall level of tax rates (corresponding

to the decline in long-run real interest payments), but would leave unchanged

the growth rate of the debt, which determines the relative values of tax

rates over time. In particular, the inverse effect of unanticipated infla-

tion on the real value of dollar-denominated debt leaves unchanged the sub-
                                   2
sequent growth rate of the debt.

     5) An unanticipated increment in unfunded future liabilities, such as

planned social security benefits, raises the long-run real government spending

flow and therefore current taxes by the product of the real interest rate

and the real present value of the future liability. There is a corresponding

shift toward a surplus position in the current government budget, as defined

to exclude the unfunded liabilities. That is, if other components of anti-

cipated government spending are held fixed and no parts of the unfunded
                                    -7-




liability are paid off currently, the funded debt would decline in the present

period by the product of the real interest rate and the change in the capi-

talized value of the unfunded debt. This behavior implies that movements in

funded debt exactly offset predictable changes in unfunded debt.   (I have not

yet attempted to test this proposition empirically.)

     6) Anticipated (exogenous) inflation has a one-to-one effect on the

growth rate of nominal debt. A divergence between the debt growth rate and

the expected inflation rate implies systematic movements in the stock of

real debt and hence in real interest payments, which would be inconsistent

with the policy of smoothing tax rates over time. Viewed another way, an

increase in the anticipated inflation rate would tend to be associated with

a corresponding increase in nominal interest rates3 and hence--neglecting the

distinction between long-term and short-term debt4- -with a rise in current

real interest payments. The theory implies that these higher real interest

payments are met with debt issue rather than increased taxes. This response

maintains the previous pattern of anticipated values over time for taxes and

the real stock of debt.

     7) Anticipated growth in real income has a one-to-one effect on the

growth rate of real debt. Any divergence here would produce systematic move-

ments in interest payments relative to national income, which conflicts with

the policy of maintaining stable tax rates over time.

Empirical Evidence on Public Debt Behavior

        In some earlier papers (Barro, 1979; 1978a) I have examined the con-

formity of some of the above propositions with the United States experience

since 1916 on funded, privately-held, interest-bearing public debt.5     I


have also looked less formally at the behavior of U.S. public debt over a

longer period.

        The first observation is that the principal peaks in the ratio of public

debt to gross national product in the United States are associated with

major wars; notably, with the Civil War, World War I and World War II. Each

peak is followed by a steady decline in the debt-GNP ratio during the sub-

sequent peactime periods: from a peak of .24 in 1865 to a trough of .018

in 1916, from .30 in 1919 to .14 in 1929, and from 1.07 in 1945 to .24 in

1978.

        The analysis in Barro (l99 pp. 160, ff.) includes a detailed study of

the response of federal deficits to shifts in federal spending, which picks

up also the effects of smaller wars like Korea and Vietnam and includes other

movements in federal expenditures. These findings are basically in accord

with the theoretical objective of funding temporary spending increases pri-

marily with debt issue in order to stabilize anticipated overall tax rates

over time. Some details of this analysis are reproduced in the next section

of this paper.

        A second inference from the data is the important countercyclical response

of the federal deficit to business fluctuations. Earlier discussions of this

type of relationship include Committee for Economic Development (1947),

Brown (1956), Council of Economic Advisers (1962, pp. 78-82), and Okun and

Teeters (1970). A dramatic countercyclical reaction of this type appears
                                     -9-




during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Structurally similar behavior can

account also for much of the well-publicized increase in federal debt during

the 1974-76 recession. The detailed analysis suggests a stronger counter-

cyclical response of the federal deficit than would be necessary to stabilize

federal tax rates; that is, average federal tax rates seem to decline during

recessions and rise in booms.   (See equation (1) in the next section for some

detailed estimates.) This behavior accords with estimates of the built-in

flexibility of the federal individual income tax that are given in Pechman

(1973). A number of suggestions, including attempts at activist stabilization

policy, countercyclical behavior of factor supply elasticities, and the pro-

gressivity of the income tax law,6 have been offered to explain the "excessive"

countercyclical response of federal debt. An interesting possibility involves

the federal government's interaction with state and local governments.

Because of cross-jurisdiction mobility potential, Benjamin and Kochin (1978)

argue that local governments would be in a less advantageous position than a

large national government to pursue tax rate smoothing policies over the busi-

ness cycle.   (This difficulty may even be institutionalized in constitutional

restrictions to balced current account budgets at the state and local level.)

An optimizing response of the federal government, which took account of the

welfare of the citizens of each locality, would be a countercyclical response

of the deficit that stabilized total government tax rates. Therefore, the

countercyclical movement of the deficit would appear excessive- -with a mag-

nitude that depends on the ratio of total to federal government expenditures

and on the cyclical behavior of state and local spending--when the federal

government was viewed in isolation. The magnitude of this effect seems suf-

ficient to reconcile the observed federal deficit behavior since the l930s
                                   -10-




with the objective of stabilizing total government tax rates over the business

cycle, but this explanation may be difficult to sustain for the peacetime

years before the 1930s, where state and local spending is typically two to

three times the size of federal spending.

     In any event the strong response of federal deficits to economic con-

traction is not a creation of the post-World War II period, but characterizes

also the behavior in the 1930s. The same re1ationship is consistent with

the smaller amount of evidence afforded by data from the less volatile period

of the 1920s and, less formally, with observations from the pre-World War I

period. Overall, there is no indication of growth over time in the extent

of countercyclical deficit response.

     Another finding from the data is a one-to-one link from anticipated

inflation to the growth rate of nominal debt (Barro, 1979, p. 96l). Of

course, this association does not settle the question of the direction of

causation between debt issue and inflation. Some studies of post-World War II

United States inflation (Gordon, 1975, p. 647; Barro, 1978b, p. 563) indi-

cate that price level changes can be explained largely on the basis of mone-

tary movements, although some puzzlingly long lags appear in these relation-

ships. Even if correct, these findings leave open the possibility of a strong

interplay between the deficit and money creation.8 However, some investi-

gations of money supply determination (Barro, l978a, pp. 576-78; Niskanen,

1978, pp. 597-602; Hamburger and Zwick, 1979) do not indicate an important

role for the deficit, especially when the behavior of real federal spending

relative to "normal" is held fixed separately.9 Overall, it seems a reason-

able preliminary inference that the inflation/deficit relationship is prin-

cipally in the direction from anticipated inflation to nominal public debt
                                      —11—




movements, rather than the reverse.

      The   inflation influence appears to be a major determinant of nominal
debt issue since the late 1960s. For example, at the end-of-1977 value of
about $460 billion for   privately-held, interest-bearing public debt, roughly $30

billion of the measured fedérál deficit for 1978 would have been required merely

to maintain the anticipated real value of the outstanding debt. An inflation-

proof accounting system would delete this amount from the measured deficit;10

such an adjustment would be automatic (for actual rather than anticipated

inflation) if the debt were issued in indexed form-- assuming that the infla-

tion correction to the outstanding nominal principal were not then included

as part of the deficit. For example, the increase during 1978 by    $44 billion
in   privately-held, interest-bearing public debt should be rated as no more

than $10-is billion of effective federal deficit.

       Two other empirical findings that accord with the underlying theory are

a lack of relationship between either the beginning-of-period public debt-

GNP ratio or the "loig-run" federal expenditure-GNP ratio and the subsequent

behavior of federal deficits (Barro, 1979, p. 966).

Effects of Debt Shocks on Economic Activity

     The above analysis suggests that a substantial fraction of public debt

movements can be explained as responses to variations in business cycle

variables, government expenditures, and anticipated inflation. Further, the

bulk of these systematic responses can be rationalized from the objective

of stabilizing anticipated overall tax rates over time. A different issue

concerns the implications of federal deficit behavior for economic activity.

This issue can be separated into two parts: first, what are the implications

of the systematic behavior of the deficit; specifically, of the choice of

parameters in a policy rule that relates public debt movements to the variables

discussed above; and second, what are the effects of debt shocks; that is,

of departures of public debt movements from the typiëal pattern? As has

become clear from previous attempts to test natural rate hypotheses (Lucas,

1972; 1976; Sargent, 1976a, l976b; Barro, l980b, section V), it is at least

difficult empirically to distinguish systematic movements from shocks and,

thereby, to distinguish the two types of effects listed above. The central

problem concerns the possibility of identifying the effects of changes in

the parameters of a policy rule (in this case for public debt movements)

from a sample where shifts in the policy regime have not been isolated. Such

identification requires some additional a priori restrictions; for example,

the omission of some variables that help to predict the deficit from other

equations of interest, such as those for output and the unemployment rate.

The analysis below includes some preliminary estimates for the effects of

constructed "public debt shocks" on output and the unemployment rate.

Because of the identification problems alluded to above, it is difficult to
                                              —13-



 draw firm inferences from these results for some interesting policy questions.

      Reduced form analyses of business fluctuations, as in Barro (1980a),

 show major effects on output and the unemployment rate of monetary "surprises"

and of movements in government purchases. Shifts in public debt, with the

behavior of money and government purchases held fixed, have not yet been

demonstrated to have these types of business cycle effects. One difficulty

with reduced form empirical an1yses of public debt effects is the endogenous,

countercyclical response of the deficit, which tends to produce a negative

reduced form correlation between output and public debt movements.                  (Qf

course, related problems arise in isolating monetary effects.) The full

employment deficit concept was originated, in part, to filter out this endo-

genous response mechanism; see Brown (1956), Council of Economic Advisers

(1962, pp. 78-82), and Okun and Teeters (1970) for discussions. This approach

can be carried further to isolate debt shocks, which measure the departure

of public debt movements from the amount associated normally with a set of

explanatory variables. The discussion above indicates that important deter-

minants of the federal deficit include current values of business cycle varia-

bles, government spending, and the anticipated inflation rate. The construction

of debt shocks requires a detailed statistical relationship between the growth

rate of public debt and the set of explanatory variables. For this purpose I

utilize the regression equations that were estimated in my earlier public

debt study. The estimated equation for the growth rate of the public debt,

using annual data over the 1948-76 period, is (Barro, 1979, p. 961)

     The estimated coefficient of iT, 1.12, s.e. =        .22, supports the one-to-

 The positive estimated coefficient, .61, s.e. =     .16,   on the temporary federal

 spending variable is also in accord with the discussion above. Finally, the

 significant excess of this estimated coefficient magnitude above unity cor-

 responds to the "excessive" amount of countercyclical reaction that was high-

 lighted in the earlier discussion.

        The public debt growth rate equation has also been estimated with the

coefficient of the           variable constrained to equal the theoretical value of

unity. The results are then


  (2)      DB = .015     +     +    .62[P   (FED -t )/1 J - l.77(P           /1t )log(Yt/Vt ),

                             R2 = .87,      G   = .022,   D-W =   1.7.

The estimated coefficients are similar to those shown in equation (1), but

the standard errors are reduced somewhat.

        Table 1 reports for annual data from 1948 to 1976 the values of actual

debt growth and the estimated values and residuals from equation (2). The

basic empirical procedure is to examine the effects of these residuals--inter-

preted as departures of public debt movements from the normal pattern of

association with the right-side variables- -on the subsequent behavior of

output and the unemployment rate.U Note that the residuals are, by con-

struction, orthogonal to a variable that is closely related to the departure

of current real GNP from trend. Therefore, the present procedure precludes

the isolation of contemporaneous effects of debt shocks on output and the

unemployment rate)2 Given the impact of lagged debt shocks, it is possible

to examine whether lagged values of actual debt growth--or, equivalently, of

the estimated "normal" amounts of debt growth- -have any additional explanatory

power for output and the unemployment rate.

     The estimated equations for the unemployment rate and real GNP for

annual data over the 1949-77 sample are

The new variables used in equations (3) and (4) are

             U is the unemployment rate in the total labor force, which

     includes military personnel (table 2),

             DMR is the residual from an equation estimated Over the 1941-78

     period in Barro (l980a,                       )    for   the annual average growth rate

     of the Ml definition of the money stock (table 1),

             C is real federal purchases, 1972 base (reported relative to

     real GNP in table 2),

              DBR is the residual from the public debt growth rate equation (2)

         (table 1),

              t is a time trend.

The form of the dependent variable in equation (3) corresponds closely to

log(U) over the sample period. Actual values of U and of output growth, DY,

are shown along with estimated values and residuals derived from equations (3)

and (4) in table 2.

         Equations (3) and (4) indicate significant expansionary effects of con-

 temporaneous and one-year lagged monetary shocks and of the contemporaneous

value of government purchases. These effects have been discussed in detail

 in previous research, as summarized in Barro (l980a,                                         ),     and will not be

 examined here. The new result is the expansionary influence of the one-year-lagged
                                        -17-




debt shock DBRt_i. The estimated coefficient of this variable is negative

with a t-value of 2.2 in the unemployment rate equation (3) and positive with

a t-value of 2.7 in the output equation (4))3 Additional lagged values of

debt shocks (or monetary shocks) are unimportant; for example, the estimated

coefficient of DBRt
                      2
                          is -1.8, s.e. =   1.4,   in an unemployment rate equation;

and .04, s.e. =    .18,in   an output equation.

     Lagged values of actual debt growth are insignificant when added to the

equations. For example, joint tests that the coefficients of the variables

(DBt1, DBt2) are zero in equations that include also up to two lagged values

of the DMR and DBR variables yield the test statistics F0 =          1.2,   5 per cent

critical value =   3.5,   for the case of the unemployment rate equation, and

F9 = 1.5, 5 per cent critical value = 3.5, for the output equation.14 The
estimated coefficients of the variables DMRt, DMRt_1 and DBRt_1 remain signi-

ficant when these values of actual debt growth are introduced. These results

support the special role of debt shocks, as opposed to the systematic parts

of deficit movements, as influences on the unemployment rate and output--how-

ever, inferences of this type are sensitive to the identification problems that

were mentioned above.

     In terms of magnitudes of effect, the estimated unemployment rate and

output equations indicate expansionary effects of lagged debt shocks that are

significant, but quantitatively less important than those of monetary shocks.'5

As an illustration of the role of debt shocks, the realized value for DBR of

.016 for 1965, which reflects        the 1964 tax cuts, is estimated to reduce

the unemployment rate for 1966 by about 3-tenths of a percentage point. Cor-

respondingly, the value DBR = .008 for 1964 implies a reduction by about 1-1/2
                                    -18-




tenths of a percentage point for the 1965 unemployment rate.'6 The most

important explanatory role for the debt shock variable appears for the 1974-75

contraction. In equations that omit the DBRt_i variable, the estimated unem-

ployment rate for 1975 is 7.0 per cent, as compared with an actual value of

8.3 per cent; while the estimated amount of output growtji is .008, as compared

with an actual value of - .013.   The inclusion of the lagged debt shock vari-

able implies, given the value DBR =   -.042   for 1974, an estimated value for

the 1975 unemployment rate of .081 and for output growth of    _.0l4) Although

this effect for 1975 is important, the general pattern of results in the

estimated unemployment rate and output equations does not hinge on the inclu-

sion of the 1975-77 observations. For 1949-74 samples, the estimated coef-

ficient of the DBRt i variable in an unemployment rate equation becomes -4.1,

s.e. = 2.5; and in an output equation, .61, se. = .28. Although the standard

errors are higher than before, these results are in conformity with the esti-

mates shown in equations (3) and (4).      (The inclusion of the 1975-77 obser-

vations with the earlier values would be accepted by the usual F-test for

structural shift.)

     The estimated expansionary effects of debt shocks have policy implications

that parallel those of monetary shocks. The principal finding is that depar-

tures of realized values of debt and money from customary amounts--as deter-

mined by a set of explanatory variables--influence real economic activity.

The results suggest that the systematic parts of policy as represented by

the parameters of a policy rule--for example, by the coefficients in the

public debt equations (1) and (2)--do not influence the realizations for debt

 or money shocks and therefore do not affect the determination of the unemployment
                                    -19-



rate and   output   in the manner described by equations (3) and   (4).   The

problems in using the present type of empirical results to draw inferences

about the economic effects of anticipated movements in money or public debt

involve observational equivalence issues (Sargent, 1976a, pp. 1-12; 1976b)

and the distinction between unperceived and unanticipated values of shocks

(Fischer, 1980). These questions are discussed, but at best only partially

resolved, in Barro (1980b, section V). In any event the present results

do not prove that a shift in the parameters of deficit policy would leave

unchanged the mean values or other moments of the probability distributions

for the unemployment rate and output. (In fact, the discussion in the pre-

vious section suggested that the choice of parameters in the public debt

equation would have some allocative effects.) Tests of these types of

propositions require some sample variation in the structure of policy.

Conclusions on the Behavior of Federal Deficits

     The central message from the present discussion is that the systematic

parts of federal deficit policy have been reasonable. The major movements

in privately-held, interest-bearing federal debt can be explained as aspects

of a policy for achieving an interteinporally efficient collection of net

revenues in the face of fluctuations in government expenditures, national

income and inflation. There is also some indication that the (random)

departures of debt changes from the regular pattern have contributed to move-

ments in the unemployment rate and output. However, the fluctuations from

this source that have presently been isolated are substantially smaller

that those associated with monetary disturbances.

     Given these conclusions it is disturbing to see the major "reform"

thrust toward a constitutionally-mandated balanced budget at the federal level;

see, for example, Buchanan and Wagner (1977, Ch. 12). In effect, this type

of proposal is aimed at controlling the size of the federal government by

insisting on an intertemporally inefficient method for raising funds. Doubt-

less, there would be many methods for limiting the scope of government by

analogous restrictions of the taxing power to areas that entail the greatest

amounts of excess burden per net dollar collected. These policies would be

expected to achieve some reduction in the size of the public sector at the

expense of increased misallocation per unit of government spending.   Such

policies seem clearly to be dominated by direct restrictions on the amount of

government expenditure, especially in the area of transfers, and by other

direct limitations on the scope of governmental powers. Similarly, an objec-

tive of controlling inflation and business fluctuations would imply special
                                   -21—



attention to the behavior of money and perhaps also to government purchases,

but would devote much less energy to restrictions on the federal deficit.

     'The present value of revenues net of direct collection costs is the

magnitude that is actually held fixed. Money creation is not modeled sepa-

rately, but seems satisfactorily viewed as one form of taxation, which is

associated with governmental monopoly power in the issue of high-powered

money. It is unclear to me whether current money issue constitutes "current"

taxation of money holdings in the same sense that a tax on current labor

earnings amounts to a tax on current work; that is, whether elements of the

dynamics of inflation have to be considered that differ qualitatively from

the dynamics of labor supply.   I am also abstracting from chain letter type

cases that involve a perpetual deficit finance/no taxation option. These

possibilities arise only in paradoxical situations where the present value

of private resources is unbounded.




     2Somewhat different effects arise for changes in interest rates. See

n. 4 below.




     3Although this case is convenient for exposition, the one-to-one link

between the expected inflation rate and nominal debt growth does not depend

on a one-to-one connection between the expected inflation rate and nominal

interest rates.




     4me finite maturity of existing debt brings in some additional, second-

order effects on debt issue that concern changes in nominal interest rates.

See Barro (1979, p. 966) for a discussion.
                                    -25-




     5The main results use par value data, but only small changes arise

when the necessary refinements are made to utilize estimates for the market

value of public debt. Recently constructed comprehensive estimates of public

debt at market value were made available to me by John Seater.



     6            ..
      The progressivity explanation requires the cross-sectional graduated

nature of the tax system to apply--because of adjustment costs for changing

the law--to the behavior of aggregates over the business cycle. The con-

struction of the tax law to allow the cross-sectional graduations to carry

over in this manner to cyclical movements would also require some explanation.

In any case this line of argument suggests that a different cyclical behavior

of the deficit would apply during the pre-Worid War I period before the

individual income tax was introduced. Thus far, the evidence from that earlier

period is not sufficiently precise either to reject or strongly support

this viewpoint.




     7The anticipated inflation rate was measured in two alternative ways.

First, a forecast for one-year-ahead inflation (for the GNP   deflator)   was

constructed over the 1948-76 sample from a price equation (Barro, 1978b,

p. 564) that was estimated over that period. These values of expected infla-

tion are shown in table 1.   Second, a long-term nominal interest rate (Aaa

corporate bond rate) was used as a proxy for anticipated inflation. Although

this variable was available for the entire 1916-76 period under study, an

apparent shift in anticipated real rates of return required the use of a

dummy variable for the pre-1941 years. It is also unclear that nominal
                                  -26-




n. 7 continued

interest rates are closely correlated with anticipated inflation in the pre-

World War II period. A direct estimate of the anticipated Inflation rate

for the pre-1948 years would be a substantial improvement.




     8My study (l978b) also has the shortcoming of including a nominal

interest rate measure as an "explanatory variable" for the price level

(through a positive effect on velocity). However, in order for this channel

to provide a link between deficits and inflation it would be necessary for

the growth rate of public debt to affect the change in interest rates, rather

than the level of rates.




     9Normal real federal spending has been measured as a distributed lag of

itself; see the discussion below. Hamburger and Zwick (1979, table 1)

find some evidence for a relation between the deficit and money creation for

samples that begin in 1961. However, these equations do not seem to hold

fixed the appropriate measure of federal expenditures.




     10This approach would count the portion of the "deficit" that was

financed by issue of high-powerd money as a form of current taxation, which

may also be appropriate. See n. 1 above.




     ilSi    the estimated values are conditioned on current realizations of

the right-side variables, these shocks cannot be interpreted as prediction

errors. However, the distinction between the typeof shock that 1 am

presently using and shocks of the "unanticipated" variety is a difficult one

to make empirically; see Barro (1980b, section V) for a discussion.




     12The money growth equation that was used to construct monetary shocks

includes as a regressor the lagged unemployment rate, but excludes current

values of business cycle variables. The estimated coefficient of the contem-

poraneous monetary shock on output and the unemployment rate (see below) would

be biased substantially toward zero if there were an important within-year

countercyclical reaction of money growth to unemployment. My asymmetric

handling of the debt and money growth variables refelcts a prior view that

the countercyclical response of debt would be more important and qiicker than

that of money. These issues become less important with quarterly data, which

I have not yet utilized for the analysis of public debt effects.




     13My failure to detect effects of this magnitude in earlier investigations

involves the use of 1946 rather than 1949 as a starting date for the samples.

With a 1946-77 sample, the estimated coefficient of the DBRt
                                                                 .

the unemployment rate equation become -0.6, s.e. =   1.6;   while that in the

output equation is 0.29, s.e. =   0.14.   I suspect that these large changes

from the estimates shown in equations (3) and (4) reflect improper measure-

ment of the normal real federal spending variable       for the immediate post-

World War II years, which would affect the calculations of the DBR and      DMR

from the standpoint of the actual time series properties of real federal spending.

             A test for the irrelevance of estimated values (DBt1, DBt2), given

the values of the DBR variables, would be equivalent.                      -




        15This statement refers to equal size values for growth rate residuals,
DBR and DMR. The standard-error-of-estimate for the debt growth equation (2)

is .022, as compared with a value of .014 for the money growth equation (Barro,

1980a, p.             ).    That is, the larger size of the typical debt shock par-
tially offsets the smaller coefficient applicable to a given size shock. It

may be more appropriate to normalize each shock by multiplication by the

level of each stock, B and M respectively, expressed relative to nominal GNP.

The values of DBR and DMR were pre-multiplied by one-year lagged values of

B/PY and M/PY, respectively, and regression equations (3) and (4) were rerun.

(These changes produced a minor deterioration in the fit of each equation.)

The resulting estimated coefficients in the unemployment rate equation were
                            *
                  _30.9DMRt 1 -6.8DBR1, and in the output equation,

Coefficient          values above one in the output equation now indicate a form of

multiplier response of annual output to infusions of money or debt. Overall,

the results in the normalized forms confirm the impression that monetary

shocks have larger unemployment rate and output influences than debt shocks- -

at   least for the effects that have thus far been isolated.




        16These effects would appear substantially greater if the values of

 DBR for 1964-65 were contrasted not with zero but with the negative values

that apply for 1960-63.




     170n the other hand, the major discrepancies for the 1958 recession

are unaffected by the inclusion of the debt shock variable.
