We argue that the cointegrating relation between dividends and consumption, a measure of long run
consumption risks, is a key determinant of risk premia at all investment horizons. As the investment
horizon increases, transitory risks disappear, and the asset's beta is dominated by long run consumption
risks. We show that the return betas, derived from the cointegration-based VAR (EC-VAR) model,
successfully account for the crosssectional variation in equity returns at both short and long horizons;
this is not the case when the cointegrating restriction is ignored. Our evidence highlights the importance
of cointegration-based long run consumption risks for financial markets.

Introduction

How does the riskiness of equity returns change with investment horizon? We show that at

long horizons risks are dominated by long run consumption risks in dividends, while at short

horizons, additional price risks may also matter. The cointegrating relation between dividends

and consumption measures long-run covariance consumption risks in dividends. We show that

this cointegrating relation has important conceptual and empirical implications for the risks

at all horizons. Empirically, we document that consumption asset betas determined by the
cointegration based vector-autoregression (EC-VAR) can very well account for the mean equity

returns in the cross-section at both short and long horizons. This is not the case when the

cointegration restriction, as is traditionally done, is ignored. Hence, our evidence underscores

the economic importance of the cointegrating relation in understanding sources of risks and

explaining equity risk premia across all investment horizons.

   Our focus on the cointegrating relation is motivated by Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal,

Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001, 2005), Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005), and Bansal, Gallant,
and Tauchen (2005) who show that long run risks can be important in explaining risk premia.

Cointegration, as made clear by the representation theorem of Granger and Engle (1987),
has sharp implications for predictability. In the context of dividends and consumption, the

representation theorem implies that the deviation of the level of dividends from consumption

(the error-correction variable) is important for predicting dividend growth rates and returns
at all horizons. As the error-correction variable alters the information set used to predict

future returns, it also signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the return innovation and, hence, the conditional

consumption betas.

   The empirical literature frequently imposes the implicit assumption of no cointegration by

modeling returns with a standard vector autoregression (VAR). We show that this traditional
approach leads to a signiﬁcant deterioration in the ability of consumption-based models to


                                               3
explain risk premia at both short and long horizons relative the the cointegration-based

speciﬁcation. In this “standard VAR”, consumption and dividend growth rates are stationary,

however the levels of consumption and dividends are not cointegrated. Deviations of dividends
from consumption contain a unit root and, thus, the two series can drift far apart — there

is no error-correction mechanism, which ties dividends and consumption together in the long

run. Cointegration, and the implied EC-VAR framework, ties these two series together in the

long run; for this reason, the error-correction term can be quite important for predicting future
returns and growth rates. The inclusion of the error-correcting mechanism can signiﬁcantly

alter the transition dynamics of returns and asset betas relative to the standard growth-rate

based VAR speciﬁcation.

   We ﬁrst document that the error-correction term in the dividend-consumption cointegrating
relation contains important information for predicting future dividend growth and returns.
Imposing cointegration, we are able to predict on average 11.5% of the variation in one-year

returns, compared to 7.5% when we do not impose cointegration. This diﬀerence is even starker

at longer horizons: at the 10-year horizon, the EC-VAR speciﬁcation results in an average 44.0%
adjusted R2 , compared to 9.9% for the standard growth-rate VAR speciﬁcation. That is, at

longer horizons, we are able to predict far more variation in returns using the cointegration

speciﬁcation than when we do not impose cointegration on the return dynamics.               This
predictability evidence suggests that cointegration has important implications for measuring

return innovations and, consequently, conditional consumption betas.

   Using the EC-VAR, we ﬁnd that the cointegrating relation indeed signiﬁcantly inﬂuences

the conditional consumption betas and resulting prices of risk at all investment horizons. The

estimated market price of consumption risks is always positive and signiﬁcant. For example, at

the short horizon, the market price of risk is 1.19 (SE=0.41); at the long horizon, it continues
to be highly signiﬁcant of 0.72 (SE=0.25). Our conditional consumption betas account for

about 75% of the cross-sectional variation in risk premia at the one-year horizon, and are able

                                               4
to explain over 85% of the the cross-section of mean returns at long horizons. In contrast,

VAR models traditionally used in the literature ignore the cointegrating relation in measuring

conditional betas and, hence, are unable to account for the diﬀerences in risk premia across
assets. The unconditional consumption CAPM also fails to explain the variation in average

returns across assets. To conﬁrm our ﬁndings we conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments

and show that our empirical evidence is statistically signiﬁcant and robust.

   The unique dimension of our paper is to show that after accounting for the long-run
relation between dividends and consumption, conditional consumption betas contain important

information about risk premia at all investment horizons. At long horizons, transitory risks

vanish and only long-run risks drive risk compensations. Our approach, therefore, allows us to

analyze the size of the compensation for long-run versus transitory risks in accounting for risk
premia. Quantitatively, we ﬁnd that long-run consumption risks are the dominant source of
risk premia at all investment horizons. Conceptually, we provide a framework for linking the

cointegration parameter to the conditional consumption betas by horizon and show that they

can explain the cross-sectional variation in expected returns at both short and long horizons.
Earlier work has pursued a very diﬀerent approach to account for the cross-sectional variation in

short-horizon (one period) returns. In particular, Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001, 2005)

and Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) focus on cash-ﬂow betas and inquire if these betas can

account for short horizon expected returns. Parker and Julliard (2005) measures covariance

risk between current returns and future consumption, while Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) and
Jagannathan and Wang (1996) rely on time-varying betas to justify the cross-sectional pattern

in one period expected returns.

   A rich array of speciﬁcations for dividends have been used in earlier asset pricing models.

In Campbell and Cochrane (1999), and Bansal and Yaron (2004) models, consumption and
dividend growth rates have the same unconditional mean but are not cointegrated. Cochrane,

Longstaﬀ, and Santa-Clara (2006) develop a theoretical model where the average growth rates

                                               5
of aggregate dividends diﬀer across sectors and analyze the implications for risk premia. Menzly,

Santos, and Veronesi (2004) consider a speciﬁcation where dividends and consumption across

all sectors have unit cointegration, while Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001) and Hansen,
Heaton, and Li (2005) entertain speciﬁcations that permit heterogeneity in the cointegrating

relation between dividends and consumption. The economic implications of these alternative

speciﬁcations of dividends for the risk-return relation are empirically evaluated in this paper. As

stated above, the heterogeneity in the cointegrating relation is found to be empirically important
for understanding risk premia across assets at all investment horizons. Speciﬁcations which do

not allow for this heterogeneity are not supported in the data. The empirical evidence in this

paper, therefore, suggests that developing dynamic models that permit heterogeneity in the
cointegrating relation would be very valuable.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we discuss a brief and simple
theoretical framework and present our econometric speciﬁcation for return dynamics. Section

2 describes the data. Section 3 contains the results of our empirical analysis. Monte Carlo

evidence that supports our data ﬁndings is discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 provides
concluding remarks.




1     Cointegration and Risk Premia

In this section, we discuss a simple theoretical framework that we employ and implications

of cointegration for risk measures and risk premia. Throughout our discussion, we utilize a

Taylor series approximation for log returns (see Campbell and Shiller (1988)). Let zt = pt − dt

represent the log of the price-dividend ratio. The return approximation is given by


                              rt+1 = κ0 + dt+1 − dt + κ1 zt+1 − zt ,                           (1)



                                                 6
where the log-linearization constants κ0 and κ1 are,

                                          exp(z̄)
                                κ1 =                ,                                       (2)
                                        1 + exp(z̄)

                                κ0 = log(1 + exp(z̄)) − κ1 z̄,


and z̄ is the mean of the log price-dividend ratio. Using ∆zt+s = zt+s − zt , equation (1) also

implies

                          rt+1 = κ0 + ∆dt+1 + ∆zt+1 + (κ1 − 1)zt+1 .                        (3)


We further assume that the log price-dividend ratio, zt , and dividend growth rates, ∆dt+1 ,

are covariance stationary processes. To model long-horizon returns, it is useful to deﬁne the
                                                      
summed level of the price-dividend ratio as zt+1→t+s ≡ sj=1 zt+j , the accumulated change in

it as ∆zt+1→t+s ≡ zt+1→t+s − zt→t+s−1 , and accumulated s-period growth rate as ∆dt+1→t+s ≡
s
   j=1 ∆dt+j . Using the return expression (3), it follows that s-horizon compounded return,
            
rt+1→t+s ≡ sj=1 rt+j , is completely characterized by these three components.



1.1       Risk Premia

We assume, as in Lucas (1978), that a representative agent prices assets across various
investment horizons. The Euler equation associated with this agent will therefore determine

the risk-return relation at all horizons.   To keep the analysis simple, we further assume

that the representative agent’s preferences are characterized by the standard power utility

of aggregate consumption. Hence, the log of the one-step-ahead stochastic discount factor
is mt = ln() − γ∆ct , where ∆ct is the growth rate of log aggregate consumption, γ is the

parameter of risk aversion, and  determines time preferences. The standard asset pricing




                                               7
condition for any horizon s is,


                                    Et [exp(mt+1→t+s + rt+1→t+s )] = 1,                                       (4)

                      s
where mt+1→t+s =         j=1   mt+j . We assume that the log of the stochastic discount factor and log

returns are jointly conditionally normal and homoskedastic, and ∆ct is a covariance stationary

process. Our preference and distributional assumptions are similar to those used by Hansen

and Singleton (1983).1

       Let ηt+1 ≡ ∆ct+1 − Et [∆ct+1 ] be the one-step ahead innovation in consumption growth

and ηt+1→t+s be the innovation in the cumulative growth in consumption, ∆ct+1→t+s . The

conditional variance of the cumulative consumption growth corresponds to the variance of this
                                         2
s-period innovation, which we denote as σc,s . Similarly, ηr,t+1→t+s is the innovation in s-horizon
                    2
return, rt+1→t+s , σr,s denotes its conditional variance, and Cov [ηt+1→t+s , ηr,t+1→t+s ] corresponds

to the conditional covariance between consumption and return innovations for horizon s.
Given our distributional assumption of homoscedasticity, all conditional second moments are

constants. The asset pricing condition in eq.(4) along with distributional assumptions implies
that the conditional expected return at any horizon s is given by,

    It is straightforward to extend the presented framework to a more general framework such as in Bansal and
Yaron (2004). This, however, would entail estimation of a larger set of parameters in the cross-section of assets.
To avoid this, we conﬁne our attention to the case of power utility, which is suﬃcient for addressing questions
about the cross-sectional dispersion in mean returns that are the focus of this paper.

the price of risk that is determined by the agent’s risk aversion and the conditional variance

of consumption growth for the corresponding investment horizon, and βs is the conditional

consumption risk measure for horizon s. We scale expression (5) by s to ensure that moments

exist and to provide the interpretation of the risk premium as per unit of time.

   The expected return is obtained by taking unconditional expectations of (5). Let µr be the

one-period-ahead geometric mean return,

                         s                                 s

As shown in expression (6), expected returns per unit of time are determined by the the market
price of horizon risk, λs , and the horizon-dependent beta, βs .

   If returns are Gaussian i.i.d. processes, then conditional expected returns per unit time
                                       2       2
at all horizons will be identical, as σr,s = sσr,1 . On the other hand, if there is predictable
                            2                    2
variation in returns, then σr,s need not equal sσr,1 , leading to variation in expected returns

per unit time across diﬀerent investment horizons. Below we provide an empirical method for
           2
measuring σr,s , which allows us to construct expected returns at various horizons.



1.2    Betas by Horizon

The return expression (3) implies that the innovation in s-horizon return is determined by the
innovations to ∆dt+1→t+s , ∆zt+1→t+s and zt+1→t+s , which we respectively denote as ηd,t+1→t+s ,

η∆z,t+1→t+s and ηz,t+1→t+s . The covariance of these components with consumption growth will

determine the overall risk compensation. Speciﬁcally, note that the asset beta, βs , can be

expressed as the sum of three covariances:

                           Cov (ηt+1→t+s , ηd,t+1→t+s ) Cov (ηt+1→t+s , η∆z,t+1→t+s )
                βs =                   2
                                                       +            2
                                                                                             (7)
                                     σc,s                          σc,s

                                                                     ,
                                                  σc,s

which we write compactly as,


                                       βs = [βd,s + β∆z,s + (κ1 − 1)βz,s ].                           (8)


Thus, the asset beta is determined by risks in both dividend growth rates and price-dividend

ratios. We refer to the ﬁrst component, βd,s , as the cash-ﬂow beta, β∆z,s as the price change

beta, and βz,t as the level beta associated with the risk in the cumulative price-dividend ratio.

Equation (8) suggests that the joint dynamics of consumption growth, dividend growth, and
price-dividend ratios contribute to the determination of assets’ risk. We discuss the implications

of modeling these dynamics in the next section.

      The expression for risk exposures (equation (8)) also suggests that risks faced by a long-
run investor are quite diﬀerent than those faced by a single-period investor. While at short

horizons, transitory movements in price-dividend ratios may be important, their contribution

to asset betas and risk compensations is virtually washed out in the long run. As the change
in the price-dividend ratio represents a change in a stationary variable, its covariance with
consumption growth (see the second term in eq.(7)) is gradually swamped by the variance of

the cumulative growth in consumption; in the limit (i.e., as s = ∞), β∆z,s = 0. Further, as

the approximation parameter κ1 is close to one,2 the ﬁnal term in expression (8), (κ1 − 1)βz,s ,

is quite close to zero. Consequently, for a long-run investor, an asset’s risk is dominated by
the long-run covariance risk in dividends, which the cointegration parameter between dividends

and aggregate consumption measures. In particular, as the investment horizon increases,

      In the data, the value of the log-linearization parameter, κ1 , varies between 0.96 and 0.99.

where δ is the parameter of cointegration between dividends and consumption (see equation

(19) below). In our empirical work, we show that the long-run risk measure δ has important

information about expected returns at short horizons as well.



1.3    Cointegration Speciﬁcation

A number of recent papers (e.g., Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001) and Hansen, Heaton,

and Li (2005)) suggest that consumption and dividends are stochastically cointegrated (see

Campbell and Perron (1991)). In this section, we examine the implications of cointegration for

the calculation of the risk measures outlined in the preceding section.

   We focus on the per-share dividends series traditionally used in the literature. Dividends
per share are constructed as follows. The total return per dollar invested is


                                     Rt+1 = Ht+1 + Yt+1 ,                                  (10)


where Ht+1 is the price appreciation and Yt+1 is the dividend yield. The level of dividends per

share and the price per share can then be computed as


                                       Dt+1 = Yt+1 Vt ,                                    (11)

                                       Vt+1 = Ht+1 Vt ,


given V0 , which equals the price per share of portfolio at the initiation date. Note that the

present value of dividends per share is price per share. These dividend series correspond to the

series commonly used in empirical work, as in Campbell and Shiller (1988), Bansal, Dittmar,

and Lundblad (2005), Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) amongst others.

   If two non-stationary variables are cointegrated, a linear combination of the variables is



                                              11
stationary. We express the relation between two such variables, dividends and consumption, as


                                      dt = τ0 + τ t + δ ct +   d,t ,                              (12)


where the level of dividends and consumption in logs is dt and ct respectively and E[     d,t ]   = 0.

From equation (12) it also follows that τ = µd − δµc , where µc and µd are the average growth of

consumption and dividends respectively. Substituting for τ , the above equation can equivalently

be stated as

                                  dt − µd t = τ0 + δ(ct − µc t) +      d,t                        (13)

That is, the cointegration parameter δ can be estimated via the projection of deterministically
de-trended dividends on de-trended consumption (as in Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001)).

The Granger and Engle (1987) representation theorem states that the error-correction variable,

 d,t ,   will forecast future dividend growth rates, and consequently, perhaps returns. As we show

below, this predictability has important implications for the calculations of risk measures in
standard models.

     Several features of our cointegration speciﬁcation are worthy of further discussion. In

particular, the speciﬁcation in (12) includes a time trend and the cointegration parameter, δ, is
unrestricted as in Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2001) — we refer to this as our “preferred
speciﬁcation”. Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) also entertain a speciﬁcation with τ = 0 and

unrestricted δ, and another with τ unrestricted while δ is restricted to one, while Menzly,

Santos, and Veronesi (2004) consider a speciﬁcation with τ = 0 and δ = 1 parameter. In our

empirical analysis, we consider and discuss the implications of these alternative speciﬁcations

as well.

     It is important to note that it is not time trend but the cross-sectional heterogeneity in δ

that is important for capturing diﬀerences in risks across assets. Note, without the time trend



                                                  12
in equation (12) the cointegration parameter simply equals the ratio of average dividend growth

to average growth in aggregate consumption (see Hamilton (1994)). In this case, cross-sectional

diﬀerences in δ’s will tautologically reﬂect diﬀerences in average dividend growth (and average
capital gains) and, therefore, average ex-post returns. Including the time trend purges the

eﬀect of mean growth rates in dividends on the cointegration parameter, and ensures that long-

run risk measures do not mechanically replicate cross-sectional diﬀerences in ex-post average

returns.



1.4     Deriving Mean Returns and Betas by Horizon

This section provides the details for estimating assets’ consumption betas for diﬀerent

investment horizons. We ﬁrst estimate the cointegrating relation (12) between dividends and
consumption via OLS, that is by regressing the de-trended portfolio’s cash ﬂows onto the

stochastic trend in consumption. Using the resulting cointegrating residual,               d,t ,   we model its

dynamics jointly with the portfolio’s price-dividend ratio, zt , and consumption growth, ∆ct , via
the ﬁrst-order error-correction VAR (EC-VAR) structure:


                                           Xt = AXt−1 + Gut ,                                              (14)


where Xt = ( ∆ct      d,t   zt   ∆dt   ∆zt ), A is a 5 × 5 matrix of coeﬃcients, G is a 5 × 3 matrix,
and u is a three by one matrix of shocks, ut = ( ηt             η,t   ηz,t ).3 All the variables are de-

meaned throughout our discussion. While details of the EC-VAR speciﬁcation are provided in
the Appendix, below we highlight some of its salient features. The ﬁrst three variables form

the basis of the EC-VAR process. The last two variables provide no additional information;

they are included into the EC-VAR to facilitate the description and discussion of consumption
   3
    We have also considered speciﬁcations that include more lags in the vector error-correction model. As this
does not materially change the results, we only report evidence based on the ﬁrst-order EC-VAR.



                                                     13
betas by horizon. The dynamics of ∆dt and ∆zt are derived from the dynamics of the ﬁrst

three variables by exploiting ∆dt = ∆             d,t   + δ∆ct , and ∆zt = zt − zt−1 .

    Note that the EC-VAR speciﬁcation reduces to the standard growth-rate based VAR if

the error-correction term,        d,t ,   is excluded from the set of variables that predict future growth

rates and returns. In this “standard VAR”, ct and dt are each integrated, that is, the growth

rates of consumption and dividends are stationary; however, ct and dt are not cointegrated.
Thus, deviations of dividends from consumption contain a unit root and these two series can

arbitrarily drift far apart — there is no error-correction mechanism which ties dividends and

consumption together in the long run. Cointegration, and the implied EC-VAR framework,

ties the long-run dynamics of the two series together. For this reason the error-correction term,

d,t ,   can be quite important for predicting future dividend growth rates and returns and its

inclusion can signiﬁcantly alter the transition dynamics of returns. In sum, there can be large
diﬀerences between the standard VAR and the EC-VAR implications for risks measures and

expected returns, which we subsequently highlight in our empirical work.

    Using the recursive structure of the EC-VAR, we can compute the conditional variance of
          2                                                      2
returns, σr,s , the conditional variance of consumption growth, σc,s , and the conditional beta,

βs , for any given horizon s. Speciﬁcally, let Bj = Bj−1 + Aj−1 , j = 1, 2, ..., and B0 = 0. The

horizon-s covariance matrix of the above variables satisﬁes the recursion


                                               Σ∗s = Bs Σe Bs + Σ∗s−1 ,                             (15)


where Σe = GΣu G , and Σ∗0 = 0. As s increases, Σ∗s grows without a bound; hence we consider
         Σ∗s
Σs ≡      s
             .   In the long-run limit, this covariance matrix becomes:


                                                                           
                                            Σlr = [I − A]−1 Σe [I − A]−1 .                           (16)




                                                            14
Details of the derivation of the covariance matrix are provided in the Appendix.

   The s-period covariance matrix, Σs , allows us to calculate the s-period beta of an asset

using the appropriate covariance and variance terms. For a given horizon s, the covariance risk

in the asset is
                               Σs (1, 4)   Σs (1, 5)            Σs (1, 3)
                        βs =             +           + (κ1 − 1)           ,                  (17)
                               Σs (1, 1)   Σs (1, 1)            Σs (1, 1)

where Σs (i, j) is the (i, j)-element of the covariance matrix Σs .      Note that computations

in equation (17) correspond to various components in equation (8). In particular, the ﬁrst

component corresponds to the cash-ﬂow risk, βd,s , the second component, β∆z,s , corresponds to

the price change risk, and βz,s corresponds to the level risk.

   There are several implications of expression (17) that are worthy of note.           First, the

cointegration parameter will be an important determinant of the asset’s risk at any investment
horizon. To illustrate this point, consider the beta for one-period investment. Given the

equation above,

                                                                      
                  β1 = δ +    Σ1 (1, 2) + Σ1 (1, 5) + (κ1 − 1)Σ1 (1, 3) Σ1 (1, 1)−1 .        (18)


Notice that the cointegration parameter is one of the four components of the consumption

beta at the one-period horizon. Further, the presence of cointegration not only alters betas

directly (via the ﬁrst term), it also alters the beta through the other terms (via its impact
on the transition matrices A and G). Thus, the parameter of cointegration that reﬂects long-

run consumption risks in the asset’s cash ﬂows is an important determinant of the risk-return

relation at all investment horizons.

   At long horizons, cash-ﬂow cointegration risks are especially important. As noted above,

variation in transitory components in returns die out in the long run. Thus, variation in the

error-correction term and the growth in the price-dividend ratio will vanish in the limit. This


                                                 15
means that, in the long run, lr, the beta will become


                                 βlr = δ + (κ1 − 1)Σ1 (1, 3)Σ1 (1, 1)−1 .                              (19)


That is, the beta becomes the cointegration parameter plus a term related to the accumulated

price-dividend level risk.

   Expression (17) characterizes conditional consumption betas by horizon and highlights

important implications of the cointegrating relation for risk measures. For example, when δ is

assumed to be one, as in Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004), the cross-sectional dispersion in

betas will be signiﬁcantly reduced at both short and long horizons. Further, when cointegration

is not imposed,   d,t   is not a predictive variable for dividend growth rates and returns, and the

permanent term δ is absent from the term structure of betas. This predictive power is an
empirical consideration which we investigate below.

   The proﬁle of expected returns by horizon can be read from the above EC-VAR speciﬁcation
                                                                             2
                                                                            σr,s
by adding half the variance on return innovation for a given horizon,        s

We use betas and mean returns by horizon, implied by the EC-VAR dynamics, to analyze
the cross-sectional relation in risk and return at various investment horizons. Speciﬁcally, we

investigate the relation by considering cross-sectional regressions for diﬀerent horizons s,

                                            σr2 ,s 

Evidence on the sources of betas at various horizons and the explanatory power of these betas

for the cross-section of mean returns is presented in Section 3.




                                                   16
2     Data

The portfolios employed in our empirical tests sort ﬁrms on dimensions that lead to cross-

sectional dispersion in measured risk premia. The particular characteristics that we consider

are ﬁrms’ market value and book-to-market ratio. Our rationale for examining portfolios

sorted on these characteristics is that size and book-to-market based sorts are the basis for

factor models used in Fama and French (1993) to explain the risk premia on other assets.

Consequently, understanding the risk premia on these assets is an economically important step
toward understanding the risk compensation of a wider array of assets.

    We construct the set of portfolios formed on the basis of market capitalization by ranking
all ﬁrms covered by CRSP on the basis of their market capitalization at the end of June of
each year using NYSE capitalization breakpoints. We form annual returns on these portfolios

over the period 1929 through 2002. In Table 1, we present means and standard deviations of

market value-weighted returns for size decile portfolios. The data evidence a substantial size
premium over the sample period; the mean real annual return on the lowest decile ﬁrms is

13.45%, contrasted with a return of 7.58% for the highest decile.

    Book-to-market portfolios are formed by ranking ﬁrms on their book-to-market ratios as
of the end of June of each year using NYSE book-to-market breakpoints. Book values are

computed using Moody’s data prior to 1955 and Compustat data in the post-1955 period. The
book-to-market ratio at year t is computed as the ratio of book value at ﬁscal year end t − 1 to

CRSP market value of equity at calendar year t − 1. Average value-weighted portfolio returns

are also presented in Table 1. The data evidence a book-to-market spread of similar magnitude

to the size spread; the highest book-to-market ﬁrms earn average real annual returns of 13.37%,

whereas the lowest book-to-market ﬁrms average 7.01%.


    We utilize the dividends paid on these value-weighted portfolios to explore the relations



                                              17
between portfolio cash ﬂows and consumption. Our construction of the dividend series is

standard; details of the construction can be found in Campbell and Shiller (1988) and Bansal,

Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005). We construct the level of cash dividends per share, Dt , for the

size and book-to-market portfolios on a monthly basis as described above. From this series, we

construct the annual levels of dividends by summing the cash ﬂows within the year. These series
are converted to real by the personal consumption deﬂator. Log growth rates are constructed by

taking the log ﬁrst diﬀerence of the cash-ﬂow series. Summary statistics for the cash dividend

growth rates of the portfolios under consideration are presented in Table 1. Earlier work shows
that alternative measures of dividends, such as including repurchases, do not aﬀect the results.4




3       Empirical Results

In this section, we investigate the implications of the preceding framework for the measurement

of assets’ risks. We ﬁrst analyze the cointegration of assets’ dividends with consumption and
investigate the implications of the cointegrating relation for the predictability of assets’ growth

rates and returns. We then compute the proﬁle of consumption betas and expected returns
for diﬀerent investment horizons, implied by our EC-VAR framework, and analyze the cross-

sectional implications of the model.



3.1     Cointegration Evidence

In Table 2, we present point estimates of the cointegration parameters between portfolios’

cash ﬂows and consumption, the sample autocorrelation functions (ACF) of the cointegrating

residuals, and unit root tests of the stationarity of the cointegrating residuals. As discussed
    4
    Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005)) show that alternative dividend measures, which include share
repurchases do not make a big diﬀerence to their cash-ﬂow risk measures. We ﬁnd the same is true for the
empirical evidence in this paper.



                                                  18
earlier, we estimate cointegration parameters via OLS by regressing the deterministically de-

trended dividends on de-trended consumption. We ﬁrst note that, for the majority of portfolios

analyzed, the sample autocorrelations of the resulting cointegrating residuals exhibit a relatively
rapid decline. This supports our assumption that the long-run dynamics of portfolios’ dividends

and aggregate consumption are governed by the same permanent component that can be

eliminated by the appropriate linear combination of the levels. In addition, large cross-sectional

variation in the estimated cointegration parameters, presented in the ﬁrst column, suggests that
assets’ cash ﬂows diﬀer in their exposures to this low-frequency component. The unit root tests

suggest cointegration in 10 of the 20 portfolios, and a number of portfolios’ test statistics are

close to the Mackinnon critical value of -3.59. Because of the low power of this test in samples
of the size that we analyze (74 observations), we conclude that the results in the table provide

reasonable support for the cointegration speciﬁcation.

   We now examine the point estimates of the cointegration parameters more closely. Note

that for the size portfolios, the parameters exhibit a near-monotonic decreasing pattern across

the market capitalization deciles. The estimate for the small size portfolio is 9.62 compared
to 0.82 for the large size portfolio, mirroring the pattern in observed risk premia. For the

book-to-market portfolios, the cointegration parameters exhibit an increasing relation in the

book-to-market decile. The point estimate for the highest book-to-market portfolio is 10.25,

compared to -0.27 for the growth portfolio. Again, this result is broadly consistent with the

pattern of observed risk premia. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the cointegration parameter by itself
explains about 81% of the cross-sectional variation in average one-period returns on size and

book-to-market sorted assets. The price of risk of 0.486 (SE=0.053) is positive and statistically

signiﬁcant. This evidence suggests that long-run risks embodied in assets’ cash ﬂows are able
to account for a signiﬁcant portion of the diﬀerences in risk premia. The fact that small and

high book-to-market stocks have large exposures to permanent risks in consumption implies

that the performance of these ﬁrms is linked to the permanent risks in the economy, while that


                                                19
of large and low book-to-market portfolio ﬁrms is not. As consumption is largely dominated

by permanent shocks, risks in large market-capitalization and low book-to-market stocks are

largely unrelated to the long-run evolution of the economy. This, as we document further below,
is exactly why large and low book-to-market portfolios should bear a low ex-ante risk premium

and already highlights the importance of long-run risks.



3.2    Predictability Evidence

As stated above, cointegration implies that dividend growth rates are predicted by the

cointegrating residuals. That is, the current deviations of an asset’s cash ﬂows from their

long-run relation with consumption should forecast the dynamics of dividend growth rates
while dividends are moving back towards the equilibrium.          For example, if dividends are

unusually high today, dividend growth is expected to fall in order for cash ﬂows to adjust

to the stochastic trend in consumption. Given the approximation for the log return in equation
(3), the predictability of dividend growth rates potentially translates into return predictability.
The variation in the cointegrating residuals, therefore, may also be able to account for the

variation in expected future returns.

   We explore the ability of our EC-VAR speciﬁcation to predict future dividend growth rates

and returns at various horizons. To emphasize the importance of the cointegrating relation, we

compare the adjusted-R2 ’s for dividend growth and return projections implied by the EC-VAR

model outlined above with the corresponding R̄2 ’s from the growth-rate VAR speciﬁcation.

The latter simply excludes the cointegrating residuals from a set of VAR variables. Results for

dividend growth are presented in Table 3. We examine results at horizons of 1, 5, and 10 years.

As shown in the table, at the one-year horizon, the diﬀerences between the EC-VAR speciﬁcation

and the simple growth-rate VAR are quite stark. The mean (median) adjusted R2 for the EC-

VAR speciﬁcation is 0.19 (0.16), compared to 0.15 (0.11) for the growth rates speciﬁcation.


                                                20
At longer horizons, the inclusion of the error-correction term becomes less important; at the

ten-year horizon the mean (median) adjusted R2 for the EC-VAR and VAR speciﬁcation are

0.20 (0.17) and 0.26 (0.24) respectively. This is not surprising, as the error-correction term

captures transitory variation in dividend growth rates.

   Further, asset return predictability is also altered by the cointegration between dividends
and consumption. Return projections’ R̄2 ’s for horizons 1, 5 and 10 years implied by the EC-

VAR model as well as the alternative, growth-rate speciﬁcation are reported in Table 4. The

EC-VAR speciﬁcation, on average, is able to explain an average (median) of 11.5% (10.5%) of

return variation at one year horizon, and 44.0% (43.5%) of the variation in ten-year returns.

Excluding the cointegrating residual signiﬁcantly lowers the predictability of asset returns and

alters the conditional mean of returns. We illustrate this point in Figure 1 by plotting one and
ten-year returns predicted by the EC-VAR speciﬁcation along with the forecasts implied by
the alternative VAR model. Predicted conditional means are displayed for the top and bottom

market capitalization and book-to-market portfolios. It can be seen that the two speciﬁcations

produce quite diﬀerent predictions of future expected returns, especially at longer horizons.
That is, the cointegrating residual, included in the error-correction speciﬁcation, contains

distinct information about future returns beyond that in the growth-rate based model. Return

innovations, therefore, also diﬀer across the two speciﬁcations, and most importantly so will
the consumption betas measured from the two alternative models.

   As a robustness check, we have also examined direct projections of multi-period compounded
dividend growth rates and returns on the EC-VAR versus growth-rate VAR information sets.

We do not entertain this method beyond 5-7 years as the number of independent observations

in such direct projections decreases rapidly with the horizon. Predictability evidence from these
projections is very similar to that discussed above and, for brevity, is not reported. In sum, we

ﬁnd cointegrating residuals to be a signiﬁcant predictor of both future growth rates and future



                                               21
returns at short and intermediate horizons.5

       The results of this section underscore the importance of cointegration in the measurement

of risk and return. As emphasized in this section, temporary deviations of cash ﬂows from

the permanent component in consumption, that is cointegration residuals, contain valuable
information for predicting dividend growth rates and returns, and thus represent an important

component in the calculation of expected returns and betas by horizon. We turn to this point

in the following section, and analyze how the risk-return relation changes with the investment

horizon.



3.3       Betas and Expected Returns by Horizon

Mean returns for the portfolios at the one-, ﬁve-, and ten-year horizons, implied by the EC-

VAR, are presented in Table 5. As shown in the table, the general pattern observed in expected
returns is preserved across the various horizons. Small ﬁrm portfolios tend to earn higher mean

returns than do large ﬁrm portfolios, and low book-to-market portfolios earn lower expected
returns than high book-to-market portfolios. Further, at all horizons, the mean returns exhibit

considerable cross-sectional variation; the dispersion in mean returns at the ten-year horizon is
though slightly less than that at the one-year horizon.

       We now explore the implications of cointegration for the determination of assets’

consumption risks. Table 6 presents betas at various horizons for each of the portfolios; Newey

and West (1987) standard errors are given in parentheses. Similarly to mean returns, risk

measures implied by the EC-VAR exhibit substantial cross-sectional variation. At the 1-year

horizon, the small-ﬁrm portfolio beta (4.12) exceeds the large-ﬁrm portfolio beta (1.54), and
   5
    In particular, at the one-year horizon, t-statistics on the cointegrating residual in dividend growth
projections are signiﬁcant for 11 out of 20 portfolios. As the horizon increases, the predictive power of the
error-correction variable considerably improves: at the ﬁve-year horizon, robust t-statistics in dividend growth
and return projections become statistically signiﬁcant for virtually all the portfolios.



                                                      22
the high book-to-market beta (3.89) exceeds the low book-to-market beta (1.81). Further,

there is a generally declining pattern in the size dimension and increasing pattern in the book-

to-market dimension that is consistent with the pattern observed in mean returns. As the
horizon increases, the cross-sectional pattern in these risk measures generally remains the same,

although the precision of the estimates suﬀers. At the 10-year horizon, the small-ﬁrm beta (6.54)

continues to exceed the large-ﬁrm beta (0.34) and the high book-to-market beta (4.33) exceeds

the low book-to-market beta (-0.83).

   As argued in Section 1, the cointegration parameter is one of the components of the overall

consumption beta at each horizon, along with risks arising from transitory ﬂuctuations in

dividends and prices. The relative importance of price risks and short-run dividend risks,

however, decreases over time, and in the long run, systematic risks in returns should be
dominated by permanent risks in assets’ cash ﬂows. We ﬁnd that this theoretical proposition is
strongly supported in the data. While at the one-year horizon, the correlation between assets’

betas and cointegration parameters is about 0.87, by the ﬁve-year horizon it already exceeds

0.90, reaching virtually 1 in the limit. Thus, the contribution of the cash-ﬂow component
of risks to the beta dominates in the long run. Moreover, even at short horizons, long-run

consumption risks in dividends are an important determinant of assets’ betas.

   To illustrate the importance of the cointegrating relation between dividends and
consumption for measuring expected returns and conditional consumption betas, we compare

the evidence discussed above with that implied by the alternative growth-rate based VAR

speciﬁcation.   We ﬁnd that the magnitude of mean returns for the growth-rate VAR

speciﬁcation, reported in Table 5, is somewhat higher relative to the EC-VAR speciﬁcation

but their cross-sectional pattern by horizon is very comparable to that impled by the EC-

VAR. However, the betas in the VAR speciﬁcation, reported in Table 6, signiﬁcantly diﬀer
from the EC-VAR based betas. For comparison, in Table 6 we also present the unconditional

C-CAPM betas. Both the unconditional betas and those based on the VAR do not reﬂect the

                                               23
cross-sectional diﬀerences in mean returns on size and book-to-market sorted portfolios. This

evidence underscores the importance of conditioning information contained in the cointegrating

residual in computing assets’ exposures to consumption risks.

       Below, we more formally analyze the relation between mean returns and risk measures in
the cross-section across various investment horizons.



3.4       Cross-Sectional Risk and Return

In this section we investigate the cross-sectional risk-return relation and explore the ability

of various speciﬁcations to account for cross-sectional diﬀerences in mean returns across

various investment horizons. We report and discuss evidence based on our preferred EC-VAR
speciﬁcation, as well as alternative speciﬁcations: the standard growth-rate based VAR and the

unconditional C-CAPM. Table 7 presents results of estimating the cross-sectional regression

(20) for diﬀerent investment horizons. The market prices of risk are estimated jointly with the
time-series parameters via one-step GMM. The reported standard errors of the cross-sectional
parameters, therefore, are robust to the estimation error in betas.6

       As shown in the table, at the one-year horizon, betas impled by our EC-VAR speciﬁcation

explain 75% of the cross-sectional variation in mean returns with a positive price of risk of 1.19
(SE=0.41). This explanatory power is maintained at the 5- and 10-year horizons, with adjusted

R2 of 0.73 and 0.84 respectively, and prices of risk of 0.73 (SE=0.32) and 0.65 (SE=0.24)

respectively. At the very long horizon, i.e., s = ∞, the estimate of the market price of risk

remains strongly signiﬁcant of 0.72 (SE=0.25), and the cross-section of long-run consumption

betas accounts for a sizeable portion of the variation in long-run risk premia (R̄2 =87%). The

ﬁt for the one-period and the very long horizon is plotted in Figure 2. Thus, at all horizons,
   6
    In addition, we have constructed bootstrap distributions of time-series and cross-sectional parameters of
interest. As bootstrap-based standard errors are very similar to the above-discussed standard errors, for brevity,
they are not reported.


                                                       24
the EC-VAR speciﬁcation explains most of the cross-sectional variation in mean returns across

assets. This evidence manifests the empirical importance of the cointegrating relation between

dividends and consumption in determining assets’ risk premia not only at long but also at short
horizons.

       Table 7 also provides the cross-sectional risk-return tradeoﬀ comparison of the EC-VAR

relative to the VAR-based speciﬁcation. As we might expect, given the estimates in the

preceding section, the VAR betas have almost no power in explaining the cross-sectional
variation in mean returns. In particular, at the one-year horizon, it explains just about 22% of

the cross-sectional variation in mean returns and implies although positive, but insigniﬁcant,

price of risk of 1.278 (SE=1.57). As the horizon extends, however, the ability of the VAR

speciﬁcation deteriorates substantially. At both ﬁve and ten-year horizons, it produces negative
prices of risks and completely fails to account for the diﬀerences in risk premia across assets,
as indicated by adjusted R2 ’s of -0.02 and -0.05 respectively.7

       In addition to the conditional beta regressions, Table 7 presents the cross-sectional evidence

for the unconditional C-CAPM for the one-year horizon. In contrast to our preferred EC-VAR
speciﬁcation, the unconditional C-CAPM is not able to account for the variation of average

returns across the portfolios — the market price of risk is insigniﬁcant and the R̄2 is negative.

As the horizon increases, the cross-sectional ﬁt of these unconditional betas remains quite low.

For example, at the ﬁve-year horizon, the explanatory power of the C-CAPM is only 23%.

We do not look beyond the 5-year horizon, as the number of independent observations in such

multi-period regressions shrinks rapidly with horizon.

       To ensure our results are robust, we consider standard misspeciﬁcation tests as in
   7
     We ﬁnd that this evidence is fairly robust if we instead employ a double-sorted set of portfolios. In particular,
using 9 portfolio sorted on size and book-to-market characteristics delivers virtually the same magnitudes of
market prices of risks as for single-sorted collections of assets, which we discussed in details. The same is true
for the cross-sectional R̄2 ’s — while the EC-VAR is able to account for more than 50% of the cross-sectional
variation in risk premia across various investment horizons, the adjusted-R2 ’s are virtually zero in the growth-
rate VAR setting.


                                                         25
Jagannathan and Wang (1998). Speciﬁcally, in addition to our EC-VAR betas, we also include

commonly used portfolio attributes: size and book-to-market. We ﬁnd that the EC-VAR

betas remain highly signiﬁcant, while t-statistics on portfolio-speciﬁc characteristics are largely
insigniﬁcant. In particular, at the ﬁrst-year horizon, the robust t-statistic on the EC-VAR beta

is 2.5; for size and book-to-market characteristics the corresponding statistics are -1.9 and 0.4

respectively. As the horizon increases, the explanatory power of the EC-VAR betas increases,

while the signiﬁcance of both characteristics diminishes. For example, at the ten-year horizon,
the t-statistic for our betas is 2.6, and for size and book-to-market attributes are -0.6 and 0.2

respectively. In sum, this ﬁnding shows that our EC-VAR based betas are very important for

capturing the dispersion in risks across assets.

   Our empirical evidence highlights the importance of the cointegration-based speciﬁcation
for understanding the risk-return tradeoﬀ at all investment horizons. The EC-VAR relative to
alternative speciﬁcations, such as the growth-rate based VAR, incorporates the error-correction

term   d,t   as a predictive variable. This error-correction state variable alters the information set

used to predict future returns relative to other speciﬁcations of return dynamics, and hence
signiﬁcantly alters the return innovation and conditional betas.

   It is worth noting that the implicit assumption (the null hypothesis) behind the EC-VAR

speciﬁcation is that the error-correction term is stationary — all the eigenvalues of the A matrix
are all inside the unit circle. At the point estimates, this critical restriction is satisﬁed for all

20 portfolios. If this restriction were not satisﬁed, then our betas could not be constructed for

the entire cross-section of assets and the cross-sectional price of risks could not be computed

at all horizons. Hence, for evaluating the cross-sectional implications, the null hypothesis that

EC-VAR speciﬁcation leads to stationary dynamics is an important input. In contrast, in the

standard VAR, the error-correction mechanism is absent as dividends and consumption are not

cointegrated and deviations between them contain a permanent component. This, as discussed
earlier, is the key economic diﬀerence between these two speciﬁcations.

                                                   26
3.5    Long-Run Risks Compensation

Since consumption growth is a covariance-stationary process, its level satisﬁes a Beveridge and

Nelson (1981) decomposition. That is, the consumption process can be presented as a sum of

a deterministic trend, a random walk component and a transitory (stationary) component:


                                         c t = µc t + Tt + S t ,                             (21)


where Tt is the stochastic trend of log consumption, and St is a transitory (or short-run)

component. The covariance of the return with consumption (i.e., the beta) can, therefore,
be broken into two parts: the covariance with trend shocks (βT,s ) and the covariance with

transitory shocks in consumption (βS,s ),

                    Covt (rt+1→t+s , Tt+1→t+s )              Covt (rt+1→t+s , St+1→t+s )
           βT,s =               2
                                                , and βS,s ≡             2
                                                                                         .   (22)
                               σT,s                                     σS,s

The overall beta is just a weighted combination of the two risk measures,

                                               2        2
                                              σT,s     σS,s
                                     βs ≡ βT,s 2 + βS,s 2 .                                  (23)
                                              σc,s     σc,s

Consequently, at each horizon, the market price of risk reﬂects the premium for both very long

risks and short-run ﬂuctuations in consumption:

                1                  2
                                                
                  Et rt+1→t+s + 0.5σr,s − srt,s

                                                  ≡ λs βs = λT,s βT,s + λS,s βS,s .          (24)
                s

As the horizon increases, transitory consumption shocks die out, and the transitory risk

compensation shrinks to zero. Thus, the total risk compensation in the long-run limit (when

s = ∞) provides a measure of the compensation solely for long-run consumption risks, i.e.,

λ∞ = λT,∞ . We isolate and estimate this long-run compensation by considering the long-


                                                   27
run risk-return relation in the cross-section of assets. Subtracting it from the overall risk

compensation for a given horizon s allows us to construct the time-horizon proﬁle of risk premia

for transitory consumption risks.

    We ﬁnd that the compensation for long-run risks in consumption is about 60% of the
overall compensation at the one-year horizon. Speciﬁcally, the estimate of the long-run risk

compensation is 0.72 per annum compared to 1.19 at the one-period horizon. Figure 3 plots

the compensation for short-run consumption risks along with the total market price of risks
for investment horizons up to 15 years. The compensation for transitory ﬂuctuations is small

relative to the premium for long-run risks and exhibits a rapid decline as the time horizon grows,

starting at about 50 basis points at the ﬁrst horizon and falling to zero by the 5th year. That is,

long-run ﬂuctuations in consumption are the dominant source of the premium for consumption
risks in asset markets.




4      Robustness of Evidence

4.1     Alternative Cointegration Speciﬁcations

In this section, we discuss the implications of various restrictions on the cointegration

speciﬁcation presented above. In particular, we focus on three alternative speciﬁcations relative

to our preferred cointegration speciﬁcation where both δ and τ are unrestricted. In the ﬁrst,

we estimate (12) and (14) under the restriction δ = 1 for all assets and τ is unrestricted. In the
second speciﬁcation, we impose the restriction that τ = 0 (no time trend) but δ is unrestricted.

In the third case, we impose a joint restriction of τ = 0 and δ = 1 across all assets.8
    8
      It the time-series dimension, these restrictions are sharply rejected for the majority of assets. In particular,
according to Park (1992) test statistics, single hypotheses of τ = 0 and δ = 1 are rejected for 13 and 14 portfolios,
respectively. The joint null of no time trend and a unit cointegration parameter is rejected for all 20 assets (for
all but one portfolio, at the 1% level). Empirical evidence provided in this section reinforces this analysis. We
show that imposing restrictions on the long-run dynamics of assets’ dividends and consumption signiﬁcantly


                                                         28
    Results for cross-sectional regressions incorporating these restrictions are presented in Table

8. The ﬁrst set of columns present results for the ﬁrst speciﬁcation, where δ = 1 for all assets

(while still allowing for diﬀerences in time trends). The results at the one-period horizon are
somewhat weaker relative to our preferred case; the price of risk is 1.58 (S.E. = 0.39) and

the betas explain 45% of the cross-sectional variation in average returns, as indicated by the

R̄2 . However, as the horizon increases, the explanatory power of the speciﬁcation deteriorates

rapidly. At the two- and ﬁve-year horizons, the prices of risk are no longer statistically signiﬁcant
and the explanatory power of the regression is near zero. These results indicate that allowing

for heterogeneity in the long-run risk in dividends is important for capturing variation in risk

premia not only in the long run, but also the short term.

    In the second set of columns, we report results for the second speciﬁcation, where δ is

unrestricted and τ = 0 (no time trend) for all assets. These results represent an improvement

over the case in which the cointegration parameter is restricted to be one, and are mostly
comparable to our preferred speciﬁcation. At the ﬁrst horizon, the estimated price of risk is
positive and statistically signiﬁcant and R̄2 is of 62%. The price of risk and the explanatory

power of the regression remain high as the horizon lengthens. Finally, we have also considered

a speciﬁcation with τ = 0 and δ = 1 for all assets as in Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2004).
This speciﬁcation, however, is sharply rejected in the data and, for brevity, we do not report

the detailed evidence.

    A comparison of our preferred case (unrestricted time trend and cointegration parameter),

to the second case where the time trend is eliminated highlights that it is not the time trend per-

se but cross-sectional heterogeneity that is important for capturing diﬀerences in risks across
assets at long and short horizons. This is further reinforced by the evidence that when δ = 1,

the speciﬁcation cannot account for the diﬀerences in risks at various horizons. As mentioned
limits the ability of the cointegration-based betas to account for the cross-sectional variation in risk premia at
all investment horizons.



                                                       29
previously, in the second case (τ = 0 and δ unrestricted) the cointegration parameter equals

the ratio of the mean growth rate in the portfolio dividends to the mean growth of aggregate

consumption, and hence may tautologically reﬂect average ex-post returns. Including the time
trend purges the eﬀect of mean growth rates in dividends on the cointegration parameter, and

ensures that long-run risk measures (that is, δ’s) do not mechanically replicate cross-sectional

diﬀerences in ex-post average returns. Despite this, if one chooses to restrict τ = 0 for all

assets and estimate δ’s under this restriction, this speciﬁcation produces cross-sectional results
that are comparable to our preferred case. This, once again, underscores that it is appropriate

heterogeneity in δ that is critical and not merely the inclusion or exclusion of time trends in the

cointegration speciﬁcation. Below, we further highlight the importance of the cross-sectional
dispersion in long-run dividend risks, δ’s, using Monte Carlo simulations.



4.2    Monte Carlo Analysis

The results presented above show that the price of risk and R̄2 are highly signiﬁcant for our

preferred EC-VAR speciﬁcation. In this section, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, we
show that our empirical evidence is robust to alternative speciﬁcations and is not likely to be

an outcome of a lucky draw. We consider four diﬀerent Monte Carlos which highlight diﬀerent
aspects of our empirical evidence.

   As noted earlier, the cross-sectional heterogeneity in the cointegration parameter is

important.    Our ﬁrst Monte Carlo experiment (MC-1) is designed to evaluate if this

heterogeneity could arise in a set-up where, in fact, there is none due to either small sample

errors or overﬁtting in small samples.       In this experiment, the population value of the

cointegration parameter is set at 1 for all assets. We ask the question if such an economy

is capable of replicating the cross-sectional evidence that we ﬁnd across various investment

horizons. We simulate all the data, of the sample length, from the EC-VAR speciﬁcation


                                                30
that imposes the restriction δ = 1. Using the simulated data we estimate the cointegration

parameter and the unrestricted EC-VAR, as we have done in the data. We then use the

constructed betas to run cross-sectional regressions and to compute the prices of consumption
risk and the R̄2 ’s by horizon. Table 9 reports the cross-sectional evidence from this simulation

exercise. The table shows that the conditional consumption betas in this case fail to explain the

cross-sectional diﬀerences in mean returns across almost all investment horizons — the cross-

sectional R̄2 ’s are very small and the cross-sectional slope coeﬃcients are mostly insigniﬁcant.

This Monte Carlo experiment, therefore, suggests that our empirical evidence is unlikely to come

from a world where long-run cross-sectional dividend heterogeneity is absent. In addition, it
underscores the importance of cross-sectional diﬀerences in the cointegration parameter for
explaining diﬀerences in mean returns across all horizons.

   In the second Monte Carlo (MC-2), we highlight the importance of the EC-VAR speciﬁcation

relative to the standard VAR speciﬁcation.          As is well known (see Granger and Engle
(1987)), imposing a growth-rate based VAR structure when dividends and consumption are

cointegrated entails loss of information that emanates from the error-correction mechanism.
This can substantially aﬀect the transition dynamics of dividend growth rates and returns and,

consequently, the asset’s consumption betas that interest us. The null model that we simulate
from is the EC-VAR; we then estimate the standard growth-rate based VAR (using the same
speciﬁcation as discussed earlier) to measure asset betas, price of risk, and the cross-sectional

R̄2 ’s. The evidence reported in Table 10 shows that the VAR loses considerable information

and, on average, cannot account for the cross-sectional diﬀerences in mean returns. In all,

this suggests that if the data indeed have an EC-VAR structure then, as documented in our

empirical section, the standard-VAR speciﬁcation (commonly used in empirical work) will fail
to measure asset risks.

   The third Monte Carlo (MC-3) sets the standard growth-rate VAR as the null model, and



                                               31
asks what would one ﬁnd if one estimates our preferred EC-VAR model.9 It is important to

note that under the null of the VAR speciﬁcation, consumption and dividend growth rates are

stationary. However the level of dividend is not cointegrated with the consumption level as
they do not share a common stochastic trend. A stationary error-correction variable does not

exist as the deviation between dividends and consumption contains a unit root (see Granger

and Newbold (1974), and Phillips (1986) and Hamilton (1994)). As the number of time-series

observations increases, this unit root will become easier to detect (technically, one of the roots
of A matrix will be outside the unit circle for all the assets). This implies that our EC-VAR

based consumption betas will not exist in large enough samples. Our focus here, though, is on

the modest sample length we observe in the data. We simulate sample lengths of data for 20
portfolios and then attempt to estimate our preferred EC-VAR speciﬁcation.

       We ﬁnd, that in every each of samples we simulate, the A matrix for at least one of the
portfolios implies an explosive path for the estimated error-correction variable. On average,

about 3 assets have explosive dynamics and, thus, the EC-VAR conditional betas do not exit

for the whole cross-section. Hence, the cross-sectional regression of mean returns on the asset
betas cannot be conducted. That is, in this set-up, the distribution of various cross-sectional

statistics of interest does not exist even in our modest length samples.10 In addition, we

have examined the Monte Carlo distribution of the ﬁrst-order autocorrelation (ACF(1)) of the

estimated cointegration residual from MC-3. We ﬁnd that the ACF(1) coeﬃcient, even in our

modest samples, is very high relative to the data, suggesting as to why some portfolios in a given
draw have explosive dynamics. More speciﬁcally, for all the portfolios but one, the estimates

of the ﬁrst-order autocorrelation coeﬃcient in the data, reported in Table 2, are well in the left

tail (below the 2.5% percentile) of the Monte Carlo distribution. This evidence, and the fact
   9
     Notice that a special case of the null is the i.i.d. growth rates speciﬁcation. This nested case brings us back
to the unconditional C-CAPM speciﬁcation that, as we have shown, is strongly rejected in the data.
  10
     In particular, the fraction of draws without at least one portfolio having explosive dynamics is zero; the
percentage of draws with at least 1 explosive portfolio is 17%, with at least 2 explosive portfolios is 35%, and at
least 3 explosive portfolios is 25%. Additionally, probabilities of observing at least 4, 5 and 6 explosive portfolios
are 16%, 5%, 2%; for 7 portfolios and above, it is essentially zero.

                                                         32
that in the data not a single asset has an explosive path at our point estimates, suggest that

the population model of a standard growth-rate based VAR is an unlikely description of the

observed data. Thus, our ﬁndings based on the EC-VAR speciﬁcation are not a lucky draw.

    Finally, to ensure that we do not have a lot of degrees of freedom with the considered
collection of assets, we have constructed a Monte Carlo based distribution for the cross-sectional

R̄2 and t-statistics (MC-4). We simulate consumption growth rates of the sample size we observe

and replace the observed consumption data with these simulated draws; the rest of the data

(returns, pd ratios, etc.) are identical to what we observe. The EC-VAR based consumption

betas estimated using this simulated consumption should provide no information about the

cross-sectional distribution of mean returns as the simulated consumption is just a random

factor (this is our counterpart to the exercise considered in Lewellen, Nagel, and Shanken
(2006)). We ﬁnd that our point estimate for the R̄2 and the t-stat on the slope coeﬃcient lie

above the 95% probability cut-oﬀ of the corresponding Monte Carlo distributions. This Monte
Carlo evidence, therefore, shows that the empirical ﬁndings, using our asset menu, are both

statistically and economically signiﬁcant and cannot simply be regarded as good luck.

    To summarize, the Monte Carlo results corroborate the empirical evidence presented in the
paper and show that these ﬁndings are robust against many alternatives.




5     Conclusion

We show that the long-run relation between consumption and dividends, that is, the

cointegration, is important for understanding the dynamics of asset returns and their risk

compensations across investment horizons. Cointegration measures the long-run covariance
consumption risk in dividends and implies that deviations between dividends and consumption

(i.e., the error-correction) are temporary. An important implication of cointegrating relation is


                                               33
that returns can be characterized by an EC-VAR, in which returns can be predicted by the error-

correction variable. Hence, the error-correction mechanism alters the transition dynamics of

returns and, hence, the conditional consumption betas by horizon in interesting ways relative to
a commonly used standard VAR setup. We demonstrate that the cointegration vastly improves

the consumption-based model’s ability to explain risk premia on size and book-to-market-sorted

assets at both short and long horizons.

   At the one-year horizon, the cross-sectional explanatory power rises from an adjusted-R2

of less than zero for the unconditional C-CAPM and 22% for a growth-rate based conditional

C-CAPM, to 75% for a C-CAPM based on a cointegration speciﬁcation. At long horizons these

diﬀerences in favor of the EC-VAR framework are even more dramatic. At a conceptual level,
we show that the conditional consumption betas at long horizons are largely determined by

the cointegration parameter between dividends and consumption. Alternative dividend growth

models, which do not impose cointegration or impose unit cointegration across assets are not
supported in the data. This points to the importance of cross sectional diﬀerences in long run
consumption risks for explaining the risk return tradeoﬀ.

   Our approach allows us to assess the importance of long-run consumption risks relative to
the overall consumption uncertainty. At all but the very long horizon, the cross-sectional slope

coeﬃcient from projecting mean returns on consumption betas reﬂects the risk compensation

for both short- and long-run ﬂuctuations in aggregate consumption. In the limit, on the other
hand, it provides a market measure of risk compensation solely for long-run consumption risks.

We ﬁnd it to be a dominant source of the total risk premium, which, once again, points strongly

towards the importance of long-run consumption risks in asset markets. This, along with the

cross-sectional evidence, suggests that a more primitive production based multi-sector model,

which yields diﬀerences in long run cointegration risks across assets, would be a very valuable

contribution to the literature.

Appendix

In this appendix, we provide the details of the EC-VAR structure employed in the paper and
the calculation of the horizon-dependent covariance matrix. Given estimates of the parameters
and residuals in the the cointegrating relation (12) between dividends and consumption, we
model the dynamics of the resulting cointegrating residual,                            d,t ,   jointly with the portfolio’s
price-dividend ratio, zt , and consumption growth, ∆ct , by the following EC-VAR structure:

The ﬁrst three variables form the basis of the EC-VAR process. The last two variables provide

no additional information; they are included into the EC-VAR to simplify the computation of
long-run covariances. The dynamics of ∆dt and ∆zt are derived from the dynamics of the ﬁrst

three variables by exploiting ∆dt = ∆                   d,t   + δ∆ct , and ∆zt = zt − zt−1 .

   Denoting Xt = ( ∆ct                  d,t   zt    ∆dt      ∆zt ), we can rewrite the EC-VAR compactly as


                                                       Xt = AXt−1 + Gut ,                                            (A-2)

where the matrix A is deﬁned above, G is a 5 × 3 matrix, and u is a three by one matrix of
shocks, ut = ( ηt       η,t        ηz,t ), that is

Given this structure and a horizon s ≥ 1, the innovation in the sum of s consecutive X’s can

be extracted as follows,
                                        
                                        s                   

                                              Xt+j − Et [         Xt+j ] ≡ ζt,t+s ,              (A-4)
                                        j=1                 j=1

where ζt,t+s is
                                                         
                                                         s
                                              ζt,t+s =         Bj et+1+s−j ,                     (A-5)
                                                         j=1


with et ≡ Gut , Bj = Bj−1 + Aj−1 and B0 = 0, for j = 1, ..., s.

    Exploiting the fact that the errors are identically distributed and uncorrelated, the

covariance matrix of ζt,t+s for any given horizon s is


                                               Σ∗s = Bs Σe Bs + Σ∗s−1 ,                         (A-6)


where Σe = GΣu G , and Σ∗0 = B0 Σe B0 = 0. As s increases, Σ∗s grows without bound; hence we
                    Σ∗s
consider Σs ≡        s
                        ,   that is the covariance matrix of ζt,t+s scaled by the horizon. Given Σe and

Bs , the evolution of Σs is given by

                                             1                1
                                         Σs = Bs Σe Bs + (1 − )Σs−1 .                           (A-7)
                                             s                s

Equation (A-7) provides a direct recursive algorithm for the construction of the covariance

matrix of interest. For large s, the long-run matrix is determined by the limit of Bs , which is

[I − A]−1 , i.e.,
                                                                               
                                          Σlr = [I − A]−1 Σe [I − A]−1 .                         (A-8)

NASDAQ ﬁrms by their market capitalization as of June of each year (using NYSE breakpoints), and holding
the capitalization decile constant for one year. Book-to-market portfolios are formed by sorting NYSE, AMEX,
and NASDAQ ﬁrms based on their market capitalization as of June of each year divided by their book value
as of the most recent ﬁscal year end available. Returns are value-weighted. The cash ﬂow growth rates are
constructed by taking the ﬁrst diﬀerence of the logarithm of dividend series. The data are converted to real
using the PCE deﬂator. The data are sampled at the annual frequency, and cover the period 1929 through 2002,
for a total of 74 observations.

Table 2 presents the estimates of cointegration (CI) parameters for the 20 portfolios sorted by market
capitalization (S1-S10) and book-to-market ratio (B1-B10). CI parameter estimates are obtained by regressing
the deterministically de-trended log level of portfolio’s dividends on the de-trended log level of aggregate
consumption. Aggregate consumption is deﬁned as seasonally adjusted real consumption of nondurables plus
services. Consumption data are taken from the NIPA tables available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
The three columns labeled “ACF” report sample autocorrelation function of the cointegrating residuals for lags
1, 5 and 10. The ﬁnal column presents a unit root test for null that the error correction residuals contain a unit
root. Test statistics that exceed the 10% critical threshold are indicated with an asterisk.

Table 8 presents results for cross-sectional regressions for a set of 10 portfolios sorted by market capitalization
and 10 portfolios sorted by book-to-market ratio. The ﬁrst row labeled λ1,s reports the estimated prices of risk.
Consumption risk for diﬀerent investment horizons is measured by the corresponding consumption beta. Betas
are measured under two restrictions on the cointegrating relation between dividends and consumption:

                                            dt = τ0 + τ t + δ ct + d,t .

In the left columns, we restrict the cointegration parameter, δ = 1, for all assets while still allowing for diﬀerent
time trends. In the right columns, we suppress the time trend in the cointegration speciﬁcation, τ = 0, but do
not restrict the cointegration parameter, δ. The beta for a given horizon is calculated from the error-correction
VAR model as in equation (17). All risk prices are expressed in annual percentage terms. Robust standard
errors, reported in parentheses, are computed by estimating time-series and cross-sectional parameters in one
step via GMM. The number of lags used in Newey-West covariance estimator is 8.

Table 9 reports the ﬁrst Monte Carlo experiment (MC-1). It presents distributions of cross-sectional statistics
based on asset betas computed using an unrestricted EC-VAR; the data are simulated from a speciﬁcation
where the cointegration parameter, δ, is restricted to be one for all assets. We simulate samples of 74 annual
time-series observations of consumption growth, dividend growth and price-dividend from the EC-VAR, using
estimates of A and G, and the covariance matrix Σ. Using these simulated data, we re-estimate the EC-VAR
without imposing the restriction. See section Section 5.2 for additional details.

Table 10 reports distributions of cross-sectional statistics from the second Monte Carlo experiment (MC-2).
We simulate from our preferred, unrestricted EC-VAR but asset betas are computed from a standard VAR
speciﬁcation. The cross-sectional prices of risks and other statistics are computed using the betas constructed
from the growth-rate based VAR. See section Section 5.2 for additional details.

Figure 1 plots one- and ten-year returns predicted by the EC-VAR model and the alternative, growth-rates VAR
speciﬁcation. The latter ignores the error-correction information in predicting returns. Expected returns are
plotted for small (S1) and large (S10) market capitalization ﬁrms, and low (B1) and high (B10) book-to-market
portfolios.

run) consumption risk for investment horizons up to 15 years. The diﬀerence between the total and short-run
compensations represents the premium for long-run consumption risks. The prices of risks are expressed in
annual percentage terms.
