        ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS OF THE OPTIMAL RETIREMENT AGE:
                     AN EITIRICAL INVESTIGATION




                              ABSTRACT




This paper examines how the structure of earnings and pension oppor-
tunities affects retirement behavior. We use a life cycle model of
labor supply, paying special attention to the institutional
features of private pensions and Social Security benefits. This
theoretical formulation is used to develop comparative dynamic pre-
dictions and to guide empirical modelling. Data from a new survey
of workers and their income alternatives are used to implement the
empirical model. Along the way, we highlight a number of interesting
and little known facts about older workers' income. Contrary to
popular opinion we find that private pensions are not always
actuarially neutral; Social Security benefits do not typically
decline (in present value terms) the longer retirement is deferred;
and for many people, retirement income approaches and even exceeds
net labor income. On the basis of empirical estimates of retirement
paramaters, we conclude that (1) people with higher base incomes
retire earlier, and (2) those who have more to gain by postponing
retirement, retire later. These findings are relevant to proposed
reforms of the Social Security system as well as pension programs.

    1. Introduction



         Social Security and pension reforms are under current policy discussion)

    It is of interest to determine how older workers' retirement behavior responds

    to the structure of earnings and pensions. However, the empirical record

    on this issue is in substantial disagreement as to the magnitudes and even

    the signs of key economic variables. This paper provides new estimates of the

    effects of earnings, private pensions, and Social Security retirement behavior,

and seeks to resolve some of the contradictions encountered to date in the

empirical literature.
                                                                           2
        Existing theoretical retirement models are quite well developed.       They

typically focus on the decision variable over which older individuals have

most control, the age of retirement. The better theoretical studies also

recognize the most important institutional features of the economic environment

facing older individuals, such as the structures of available earnings and

retirement income streams. Empirical studies of older workers' labor—leisure

choices have developed along somewhat independent lines. Many studies have shown

that economic variables such as earnings and retirement income do influence

retirement behavior. However their results are often contradictory, because

(1) they usually do not focus on the life cycle of the optimal retirement

problem, and (2) they usually do not take explicit account of the complexities

of pension and earnings structures. The present paper remedies these deficien-

cies by developing an empirical retirement model derived directly from economic

life cycle theory, recognizing the special institutional features of wages

and pension structures available to older workers.

      Implementing an empirical retirement model imposes especially stringent

data requirements, since the analyst must know each individual's lifetime

budget set. In this study we use a new longitudinal data set containing

individuals' earnings histories and formulas determining their private pension

and Social Security benefits available at each possible retirement date.

While roughly similar data were utilized in two previous studies l, no previous

researchers have evaluated workers' full lifetime budget constraints using the net

earnings, private pensions and Social Security benefits available at each alter-

native retirement age. Therefore one contribution of this paper is to spell out

in detail for the first time the form and shape of lifetime income profiles. We

find, contrary to popular and professional opinion, that private pensions are not

always actuarially neutral; that Social Security benefits typically increase in

present value terms the longer retirement is postponed; and that for many people

in our sample, retirement income approaches and even exceeds net labor income.

      In addition, this paper combines information on chosen retirement ages arid

budget constraints to infer how individuals respond to retirement incentive

structures. Several empirical models are discussed; the most complete, in our

view, is also that which confirms predictions from economic theory. Less

complete specifications often found in the literature are also examined and are

found to produce biased results.

      Section II contains a theoretical discussion of the life cycle retirement

problem and provides comparative dynamic predictions. Section III reports on

the data set used in empirical analysis, and reviews our findings about the

lifetime budget constraint facing older workers. Results from empirical retire-

ment models are presented in Section IV and conclusions appear in Section V.

    II. Theoretical Framework



           A. The Model


            theoretical discussions in the literature recognize that retire-
        Several

ment behavior can be fruitfully modelled in the context of a life cycle
framework, where the decision       variable is   the number of periods of work before
             1
retiring.         The   individual is assumed to maximize lifetime utility, a
function    of consumption and leisure in all remaining periods, subject to a

lifetime budget constraint. The constraint is determined by the monetary

payoffs to work (earnings) and nonwork (pension income from both private

pension plans and Social Security). This lifetime perspective suggests that

retirement patterns depend on: earnings at each age, the stream of private

pension and Social Security benefits available at each possible retirement age,

and the form and structure of preferences toward income and leisure.

        While theorists have begun to analyze this problem, empirical studies

focusing on retirement have taken a rather different tack. Instead of asking

what determines workers' retirement ages, existing studies have focused

exclusively on cross sectional labor force participation patterns of older

workers. Indirectly, these two empirical issues are related, of course.

However, from a policy perspective, it is of great interest to model directly

the determinants of retirement ages. This perspective will prove useful in

evaluating proposed reforms of Social Security and pension systems. It is also

useful in illustrating some shortcomings in existing empirical models.




1
     One of the earliest studies on the economics of retirement and pensions is
     Feldstei&s (1974) work; Sheshinski's (1978) piece generalizes the model as
     do Crawford and Lilien (1981). These and other theoretical contributions
     are reviewed in Mitchell and Fields (1982).
                                                                                4




     In the present analysis, we posit that individuals maximize lifetime

utility (U), a positive function of the present value of lifetime consumption

(C) and leisure, measured here by the length of the retirement period (RET).

As in most analyses of retirement behavior, we assume that older individuals

find it advantageous to work full time until some age and then retire

completely.   Our model also assumes that individuals know their lifetime
                                                    2
budget sets and survival probability at each age.

     Under these conditions, and assuming that lifetime consumption must equal

lifetime income, the individual confronts the following problem:

      (1)     Max U = U    (PDVY, RET)
              subject to
      (2)     PDVY = PDVE + PDVP.

PDVY is the present value of lifetime income, and can be decomposed into the sum

of lifetime earnings net of taxes and pension contributions (PDVE), and net income

from pensions (PDVP).       The sum of earnings (Er) over the work period is:




    This is clearly a simplifying assumption and could be relaxed in future
    research. Only one published study, that by Boskin and Hurd (1978) has
    addressed the part—time work option. Unpublished papers examining this
    issue include those by Reimers (1977), Gustman and Steinmeler (1981),
    Saminartino (1981), and Clark and Johnson (1980). Fewer than 10% of the individ-
    uals in our sample reported anyearñed income after accepting their company's
    pension, and only one individual earned enough income to attain the Social
    Security earnings ceiling (in only one year). Incorporating part—time
    work arrangements would greatly increase the complexity of the lifetime
    budget constraint, and is apparently not required for the workers
    represented in our data (described below).
2
    Crawford and Lilien (1981) analyze a theoretical model where changes in
    uncertainty are allowed to affect retirement behavior. In the empirical
    work below we assume individuals discount future income streams by
    the relevant mortality probabilities.
    Throughout this section the term "pension" is used to denote the sum of (net)
    private pension and Social Security income.
                                                                                     5

Et should be expressed net of income taxes and of pension contributions, if any.

PDVP is the discounted sum of net pension benefits             received during the retire—

ment period (from retirement R to death T, appropriately discounted for mortality):


     (4a)         PDVP =   I
                           R
                                   e     dt.



A retiree's pension in year t is a function of the year itself (t), the age

he retires (R), and a pension amount factor (F):


     (4b)            =   P(t,   R, F).


The year itself (t) enters in, because pension benefits may vary with time, as for

instance in the cases of indexed Social Security benefits and union—negotiated in-

creases in retirement benefits for persons already retired. The age of retirement

(R) appears, because a person who retires later often receives larger annual pen-

sion benefits than he would if he retired earlier. In some pension plans the

factor (F) is a positive function of earnings; hence:


     (4c)
                                --> -->
The other argument of the lifetime utility function is the length of the

retirement period (RET). RET is the difference between expected lifetime (T)

and age of retirement (R):


     (5)          RET =T —          R.

Combining equations (1) through (5), the first order condition for a maximum

is obtained as an implicit function for the optimal ratirement date, R, expressed

in terms    of   the effect of working the Rth year:
                                                                                 0

                                                          P(t,R ,F ) e_r t dt]



                                              -
                                                      U      =0.
                                                      FRET

At the optimal retirement age, an individual equates the utility value of

working one more year with the utility loss experienced by postponing retire-

ment. He gains the Rth year's earnings as well as higher pension benefits in

later years, which just offsets the loss in the Rth year's pension income and

1eisure. In general terms, then, the optimal retirement date is a function

of two types of variables. The first is the term in square brackets representing

the price of leisure, or the change in discounted income as retirement is post-

poned. The other variables           and RET reflect taste factors. A general

solution for the optimal retirement age should thus have the following form:


     (7)     R =   f   (price of leisure, tastes for income and leisure)

     Determining the effect of a change in the earnings or pension on an

individual's retirement age is feasible using comparative dynamics on equation

(6). Results from this analysis are summarized in Table 1. In general, we

find that increases in earnings and pension streams have ambiguous effects on

retirement. Ceteris paribus, more income should induce more leisure

consumption (if leisure is a normal good), so that higher earnings and pensions

can cause earlier retirement. However, if more income is gained as retirement

is postponed, higher income streams can also elicit more years of work through

an intertemporal substitution effect. The only unambiguous sign is that of a




   The price of leisure term differs conceptually from that used in previous
   studies because it reflects the change in the present value of total net
   income associated with later retirement, rather than just the change in
   pension wealth or earnings alone.

change in the pension amount       which raises the worker's income stream

without changing the slope of his lifetime budget set. In this case alone will

a higher pension unambiguously induce earlier retirement.1

      The preceding paragraph addressed effects of changes in the budget set

for a specific individual. Of course we would expect that the same patterns

would hold in looking across a sample of individuals in a survey data set

such as the one discussed below. In addition, if individual preferences

differ, workers with higher marginal utility for income would be more likely

to work longer (retire later) than those with a lesser marginal preference

for income. Utility parameters cannot be observed directly, however, so they

must be proxied in empirical analysis.



         B. Implications for Empirical Specifications

      The general retirement model embodied in equation (7) has several impli-

cations for empirical researchers wishing to evaluate the retirement response

to budget set parameters.

      1. The age of retirement is a function of earnings and pension

nities in every period.2 Most previous empirical studies use only current

variables to explain retirement status; even the best studies focus only on two




     Some of these results have been noted in the theoretical literature; for
     instance Burbidge and Robb (1980), Sheshinski (1978), Hemming (1977) and
     Fields and Mitchell (1981) recognize that many of these effects are
     theoretically ambiguous in sign. However empirical discussions have
     sometimes overlooked these ambiguities, claiming for instance that higher
     pensions always induce earlier retirement.
 2
     This holds even if the dependent variable is a cross—sectional labor force
     participation measure, as noted by Heckman and McCurdy (1980) in a
     different context.
                                                                                9



of several alternative retirement ages,1 rather than looking at the complete

budget set. In addition, many studies include only a subset of earnings and

retirement income opportunities, and omit taxes and contributions from

consideration altogether. A complete specification of the lifetime budget

set requires that total net income available from postponing retirement be

examined.


      2. The age of retirement is a non—linear function of earnings and

pension parameters. There are two kinds of nonlinearity to consider. The

first type arises because the expression defining the optimal retirement age,

equation (6), is in general quite complicated. A very simple example

demonstrates this point: take the case of a wealth maximizer facing linear

earnings and pensions functions, whose discount rate is zero: U   PDVY,

I = m + nt, and P = p + q R. In this case the optimal retirement age can be

solved for explicitly as a function of the base earnings (m) and pension (p) as

well as the change in annual earnings (n) and pension (q) as retirement is

postponed:

      (8)       R = m—p+qT
                      2 q-n



The effect of a change in any one variable is not, even in this simple

model, independent of the levels of other variables. One could, of course,

linearize the determinants of retirement as:



                R =
      (9)
                      b0 + b1 m + b2 n + b3 p + b4 q,
but this formulation ignores the dependence of earnings effects on pension

levels (and vice versa).



1
    E.g., Burkhauser (1979) and Gordon and Blinder (1980).
                                                                                              10




       A more serious problem arises when pensions are functionally related to

earnings. This dependency is characteristic of Social Security and is also

relevant to many private pension schemes. In this event, because earnings

increases are automatically translated into pension increments, the coefficient

on earnings obtianed by regressing retirement on an earnings parameter is not

the ceteris paribus impact of labor income.

       These types of interactions imply that retirement is not a linear function

of earnings and pension parameters entered separately. However, existing

empirical studies usually include labor and pension income as separate argu—

nients in linear models of older workers' behavior.


       3. Effect of earnings and pensions on the age of retirement will depend

on taste parameters in complicated ways. To see this, we can derive the

optimal retirement date for an individual who values leisure as well as income.

Consider for instance a worker with a Cobb—Douglas utility function of the form:


(10)                U = (PDVY)°         (RET)

Even if    the worker faced linear earnings and pension streams E = m+nt and P =

p ÷ qR, the optimal retirement age would be a quite complex function of the
parameters of the utility function and budget constraint:


(11)                                                                                    2

     4. Lookin across a sample of people, retirement ages will vary for

two reasons. First, workers' budget constraints may differ and second, their

tastes for income and leisure may be different. Most previous studies have

recognized that workers' current incomes differ, but frequently fail to

recognize that people also differ in the amount that they could gain by

postponing
             retirement.1 These variations in budget constraints across people

arise because they face different earnings and pension functions. Section III

examines these variations in our data directly. If, in addition, workers

differ according to the way they value income and leisure, taste variations

must also be incorporated in an empirical evaluation of how retirement ages

responded to income changes. Empirical retirement analysis to date has also not

focused on this sort of variation.2 In Section IV below, we address this issue

directly.




1   Burkhauser (1979) recognizes that pension benefits change as retirement is
    postponed, and that this amount varies across workers. However, that
    paper does not take into account the fact that the other components of
    workers' total lifetime budget sets ——— discounted earnings and Social
    Security benefit streams ——— also change as retirement is postponed.

2   Gordon and Blinder (1980) and Zabalza et al (1980) both utilize models where
    workers' preferences for retirement are allowed to vary across people.
    This is similar in spirit to the work by Burtless and Hausman (1978) in
    another context. In all cases, however, the authors (continued on next page)

III.    Data Description and the Lifetime Budget Constraint



           One reason that previous researchers have not examined the lifetime

budget constraint of older workers in great depth is that information on

total retirement income is extremely difficult to obtain. The most

frequently used source, the Retirement History Survey, does not provide

formulas for computing private pension benefits at alternative retirement

ages; other data sets tend to be deficient in other respects. The analysis

in the present paper utilizes a new data set which contains all the elements

required to construct the requisite income streams for each worker. This

section describes the data source and the structure of the lifetime budget

set. Then, in Section IV, we show that variations in the budget constraint

are indeed associated with ages of retirement in the ways predicted by theory.




            A. Data Source and the Sample Under Analysis


       In 1978, the U.S. Department of Labor selected a sample of private

pension plans that filed Summary Plan Descriptions (SPDs) under the

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The SPDs contained

information on pension formulas used to determine retirement benefits. Each
                                                 recipients including the birth
 sample plan also provided data on all pension

                                Employer—provided data were then merged with
year and year of retirement.

 individual Social Security records to obtain earnings histories and basic demo-

 graphic information.




 2     (continued from preceding page) focus on the probability of being in the
       labor force at a single survey date, rather than on the age of retirement
       of central concern here.
                                                                             13




      Establishing the exact pension formulas proved unexpectedly complicated,

and has led us to analyze the workers in one particular pension plan in this
          1
paper.        The structure of pension benefits in this company is sketched in

subsection B below. The resultant lifetime budget set is discussed in sub-

section C.

     Working with this one pension plan, for which the structure of pension

benefits is well understood, we set out to produce a sample of retirees for

whom age of retirement could be related to earnings, private pension income,

and Social Security benefits. We sought to avoid sample truncation bias arising

from two sources. One such source is that persons who had retired from the

firm, but who already had died by 1978, were not included in the recipient

file. This suggested choosing a sample young enough to minimize sample trun-

cation on account of mortality. On the other hand, individuals who were

elegible to retire, but who had not yet retired, were not included in the

pension recipient file either. This argues for choosing a sample that is

old enough to minimize sample truncation on account of incomplete work spells.

The compromise adopted here focuses on one age group of workers born in

1909 and 1910. These individuals were thus 68 or 69 years old in 1978 when

the survey data were gathered, and had passed the mandatory retirement age at

the firm in question, assuring that their work spells were completed. Some

(unknown) amount of mortality bias remains but it is expected to be small.

         While the survey is quite informative on retirees' behavior, it contains

no information on spouses' work status. Since this omission is much more serious

for women than for men, the analysis was limited to males only. The resultant

sample consists of 390 males born in 1909 and 1910, who retired between the

ages of 60 and 68.

    In future work we plan to extend the analyses to other companies.

         B. The Private Pension Structure in Company X

      The pension structure in Company X is negotiated every three years and

written into a contract with the United Automobile Workers union (UAW). The

formula negotiated in the early 1970s, when the workers in our sample were

about 60 years of age and were presumably deciding when to retire, varied depend-

ing on age and/or years of service. To illustrate, the following rules applied

to an individual who started work at Company X at age 30:

         i. If he retires after age 60, but before age 62: his pension
             benefit is $6,000 per year until age 62 and $5,400 per
             year from 62 to 64; thereafter, it is [$90 x yrs. of service
             less (.04 * the difference between the retirement age and
             62)] + $63.60.

        ii. If he retires after age 62, but before age 65: his pension
             benefit is $5,400 per year until age 65; thereafter, it is
             [$90 x yrs. of service] + $63.60.

       iii. If he retires at age 65 or later: his pension benefit is
             [$90 * yrs. of service] + $63.60.

Table 2 presents several streams of annual pension benefits available to a

hypothetical worker at selected retirement ages, based on these rules.

      One remarkable feature of this private pension structure is that at age

62, a retiree actually gets less in initial pension benefits per year than at

age 61. The same sort of benefit decrease occurs if the worker postpones

retirement from age 64 to 65. A partial explanation may be found for this by

recognizing that the pension plan is de facto integrated with Social Security.

In other words, though benefits are not formally reduced when Social Security

 recipiency begins, the perception is clearly that workers can claim full

 Social Security benefits at age 65, and thus are provided with supplemental

 private benefits until Social Security commences.   The fallacy of thinking that

 annual pension benefits are monotonically increasing functions of time worked

 is clearly indicated in these numbers.

         C. The Lifetime Budget Set

      Space permits us to only briefly summarize the specific assumptions
                                                          1
that went into the creation of the lifetime budget set.       Previous empirical

analysts have not recognized the importance of modelling older workers'

expectations about the institutional environment they are likely to face in

the future. In contrast, our approach develops each individual's budget con-

straint assuming that his best estimate of changes in future earnings, taxes,

Social Security and pension opportunities would be forecast on the basis
                                                                         2
of actual changes expecrienced during the decade prior to retirement.        It


was also assumed that individuals considering retirement prospects would

discount future income promises by the probability of not surviving to that

age. In addition, all future income streams were discounted at a nominal

rate of 5%3

    Details are available from the authors on request.


2
    Both Social Security and private pension benefits had been increasing at
    positive real rates throughout the 1960's, so that the constant nominal
    (declining real) benefit stream assumed in other studies would clearly be
    inconsistent with expectations. Formulating other models of expectations
    is left to future work.


    Sensitivity analyses with other discount rates produced budget constraints
    virtually identical in shape to those obtained with the 5% rate.
                                                                           17



      Earlier we noted that income opportunities for each possible retirement

age have not been calculated previously in empirical work.1 Mean values for

the annual amounts appearing in the first three rows and in present discounted

value (PDV) terms in the following three rows. Total lifetime income is

given in Row (7).

      Several features of the lifetime budget set stand out. First, examine

Row (7). Discounted lifetime income always increases in real terms as

ment is postponed. The lifetime budget profile is monotonically increasing

because in each year the sum of earnings plus (or minus) the change in future

pension income is greater than the loss of the current year's pension if re-

tirement is postponed. (See the term in brackets in equation (6))

      The components of the budget set also are of interest. For obvious

reasons, people who retire later have higher cumulative real earnings (Row 7).

Later retirement also translates into a higher stream of private pension

benefits until age 64, as is evident in row (5); this pattern contrasts with

Lazear's (1981) claim that private pension wealth falls as retirement is de—

layed. In general, we conclude that the private pension plan is not

ally neutral; the PDV of net private pension income is an inverted—U—shaped

function of age of retirement. Pension wealth does decline after age 64, in

this plan; however, this relatively early peak to private pension wealth

contradicts both Burkhauser and Quinn's (1980) proposition that pension

wealth increases until mandatory retirement, since in this firm age 68 is the

obligatory retirement age, and Bulow's 0979) claim that pension wealth de—

dines eacE year retirement is postponed.

    Further, previous studies typically do not subract income taxes from earnings
    and private pensions, nor Social Security contributions from earned income.
    Both adjustments have been made here.

     Unlike for the private pension plan, the lifetime stream of Social Security

benefits continues to rise in present value terms as retirement is postponed,

as row (6) indicates. In other words, as workers postpone retirement, their

rising real earnings combine with Social Security benefit rules to raise annual

Social Security benefits at a faster rate than expected remaining lifetime

declines. Thus, contrary to the popular belief that the Social Security

System is actuarially neutral until age 65 and actuarially disadvantageous

thereafter, we find that deferring retirement produces successively higher

values of Social Security wealth)

     Another conclusion from Table 3 is that the budget constraint is not linear.

The gains to deferring retirement range from a high of about $12,000 for working

the 63rd year of life, to a low of about $6,600 for working the 65th year.

This is a function of the non—linearities in the private pension plan, Social

Security and net earnings profiles and the interactions among them. These

interactions have not been recognized in previous attempts to construct the

lifetime budget set facing older workers.

     A final observation on Table 3 is that the average ratio of pension benefits

to earnings (referred to as the "replacement rate" in the literature) varies

a great deal across ages. In our data the ratio of net private pensions to net

earnings ranges from 37 to 53%, while the Social Security replacement rate spans

the range from 24 to 47%. The mean ratio of total net retirement income to net

earnings in our sample stands at 74% for retirement at age 60, and rises to 91%

if the worker waited until age 68 to retire.2 To our knowledge no previous

study has found replacement rates of this magnitude, because no analysis has

focused on after—tax total income.



    Recent reforms in the Social Security rules may have modified this pattern;
    see Blinder, Gordon and Wise (1980) and 3u:khaucer and :urner (1981).

2
    One sixth of the workers in our sample would have received retirement
    income greater than or equal to 95% of net earnings had they retired at
    age 62; over one third would have experienced a replacement ratio of this
    magnitude if they had waited until age 68.

IV.     Empirical   Determinants of Retirement Behvi9

        The theoretical model of determinants of retirement presented in Section II

suggested several lessons for empirical analysis. One conclusion we drew is that

retirement must be modelled as a function of total income changes as retire-

ment is postponed. A natural way to summarize this information in ..mpirical work

is to measure the change in the present vilue of income available at the earliest

possible retirement age and at the age of mandatory retirement.1 In

empirical work below, we refer to this variable as YSLOPE, and treat it as

a price ——   it   is the amount of income foregone in favor of leisure if the

worker retires earlier rather than later.

        This formulation has several advantages over those available in the

literature. Because it includes net earnings, net private pensions and Social

Security, it is a more complete specification of the budget set than in any

previous empirical retirement study, since data limitations have prevented

other analysts from combining all three elements of the lifetime budget con-

straint into a total income term. This approach also incorporates the

functional dependence of changes in retirement income on earnings prior to

retirement, in contrast to previous formulations. Finally, the coefficient

of YSLOPE in a retirement model has a natural interpretation: it represents

the (unconipensated) effect of a change in the value of additional

leisure on the age of retirement. In general therefore, YSLOPE may be

associated with later retirement (if the substitution effect dominates)

or earlier retirement (if the income effect is stronger). As with most



1
      Other approximations to the slope of the lifetime budget constraint as
      retirement is postponed could be computed since the budget set is non-
      linear, but sensitivity analysis we have performed indicates that this
      would not materially affect results as described below.
                                                                                  21




regressions of a quantity on its own price, we expect a negative relationship

even though we are looking at uncompensated effects. In the age—of—retirement

model, those who forego more income by retiring earlier would, we hypothesize,

tend to work longer, producing a positive coefficient on YSLOPE.

        In Section II it was also suggested that differences in tastes could

explain some additional variation in retirement ages, ceteris paribus. Of

course, workers' marginal utility parameters are not directly observable, and

thus must be proxied by other variables. The best proxy available to us is

income. If leisure is a normal good, one would expect that higher income

would be associated with earlier retirement for three reasons. Because of an

ordinary income effect, higher income people would buy more leisure. Also,

because of diminishing marginal utility of income, higher income people would

value extra income less than would poorer people. Thirdly, in a household

production context, higher income people are apt to own more goods to comple-

ment their retirement years (e.g., sailboats, multiple homes for various seasons)

and hence have higher marginal utility of leisure years than do lower income

persons. In the analysis below, we control for such taste variation with YBASE,

the worker's total income at the earliest possible retirement age (age 60 for

this sample). It is hypothesized to have a negative coefficient in an age—of--
                          1
ret irement regression.

        The results in Table 4 clearly demonstrate that retirement behavior is

responsive to the structures of earnings and retirement incentives. Column 1

reports the relationship between the age of retirement and the variable we claim


1
    We assume that remaining variation is distributed independently of included
    variables. We also explored models where other demographic variables such
    race were incorporated, but they proved to be virtually identical to those
    discussed below. In other samples one might wish to incorporate additional
     taste proxies; however, our data set is quite homogeneous since it includes
    only blue collar workers covered by a IJAW contract, employed by one firm, all
    born in the same period. It is therefore not surprising that demographic var—
    iables proved insignificant in empirical analysis.
                                                                                  22




 is the theoretically correct "price" term, YSLOPE, as well as the variable

 proxying for the marginal utility of income, YBASE. It is evident that

 people who have more income retire earlier, confirming the hypothesis that

 retirement years are a normal good. In addition it appears that the substi-

 tution effect dominates the income effect, since people who have more to gain

 by postponing retirement indeed retire later, ceteris paribus. Both effects

 are statistically significant with the theoretically anticipated signs.

      Sensitivity analysis on the basic model reveals that most alternative

formulations affect results very little if at all. Slightly different

specifications of YSLOPE produce about the same elasticities as those reported

above; Column (2) for instance uses the change in total income as retirement is

postponed from 60 to 65 rather than 68, as in the first column. Interacting

YBASE and YSLOPE in the third column proves less interesting. The signs and

magnitudes of the effects are roughly similar to those in the first two

columns, but multicollinearity introduced at this step increases standard errors.

At conventional significance levels, the hypothesis that price and proxies for

tastes interact (in the way specified by Column 3) must be rejected.

      As we have argued earlier, a model compatible with a life cycle approach

to the retirement problem is one that incorporates all income opportunities

from alternative retirement dates and their interactions as in Columns (1—3).

However, less complete specifications are often used in the literature because

of data limitations or lack of a firm life cycle foundation, and it is of inter-

est to inquire what we would find if other approaches had been used to address

the age of retirement problem. Columns (4—6) speak to this question. The

fourth equation reflects a rather widespread view that retirement depends on

pension and Social Security wealth, and that these variables enter additively

separably. As we have seen above, the dependence of retirement on pension and

Social Security wealth is soniewhat ill—defined since the present values of

?ension and Social Security wealth change with retirement age. Nonetheless,

we can arbitrarily select age 65 to compute discounted streams of retirement

income, and also include the base level of earnings as an explanatory factor.'

Alternatively, we might use base year pension and earnings levels as well as

changes in these levels if the worker defers retirement until age 65; see

column 5. The model in column 6 includes all the components of column 2 in

present value terms but enters them linearly instead of collapsing them in

the total income concept used earlier.

       When analysts have used earnings levels in previous empirical studies,

both positive and negative effects on retirement have been discerned.2 Both

Columns 4 and 5 suggest that higher base earnings induce more work and later

retirement. This directly contradicts the evidence provided by the model of

Column 1, where we found that a rise in base income from any source, including

earnings, induces earlier retirement, as expected if leisure is a normal good.

Thus, if we had used the ad hoc specifications in Columns 4 and 5 rather than

the life cycle model of column 1, we would have reached the implausible con-

clusion that leisure is not a normal good.

       Other types of increases in base income should also induce earlier re-

tirement according to the conceptual model of Section II, but one would not




    This equation is thus more complete than many previous models because both

    as well. It remains incomplete, of course, as compared to Column 1, for
    the reasons noted in the text.

       Consider now the gain in lifetime income if retirement is postponed.

According to theory, increases in the amount of income associated with post-

poning retirement should induce later retirement. This conclusion was borne

out empirically in Regressions 1 and 2. However this conclusion would not

have been reached from differently specified models. In column 5, faster

earnings growth appears to induce later retirement, but more generous pension

and Social Security adjustments as retirement is postponed appear to induce

earlier retirement. On the other hand, regression 6 seems to indicate that

workers retire earlier if the pension stream rises but later if earnings or

Social Security streams increase. Not only are these findings mutually in—

consistenet, but they are also at odds with models using the more conceptually

appealing lifetime budget constraint which includes total income.



 V. Conclusion
        This paper suggest that older workers respond to the structure of

 earnings, private pensions and Social Security in ways that are consistent
                                                                 of a life cycle
 with a life cycle labor supply formulation. The implications

model are drawn out in the context of the special institutional features

characterizing retirement income, and comparative dynamic predictions are

derived. This formulation provides guidance for empirical modelling of re—

tirement behavior, which we incorporate in our estimation equations. Data from

a new survey are used to implement the theoretically preferred empirical model;

in addition a number of alternate empirical equations are estimated. In de-

veloping the data we highlight a number of interesting and little known facts

about older workers' lifetime budget sets. Retirement ages among workers in our

sample respond in a manner compatible with theory; alternative specifications

similar to those found in the literature do not. We find: (1) Higher base in-

come induces earlier retirement. (2) Those who have more to gain by postponing

retirement, retire later.
