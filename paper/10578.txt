                                         ABSTRACT

This paper explores the following hypotheses on the appropriate education for innovating

entrepreneurship: a) breakthrough inventions are contributed disproportionately by independent

inventors and entrepreneurs, while large firms focus on cumulative, incremental (and often

invaluable) improvements; b) education for mastery of scientific knowledge and methods is

enormously valuable for innovation and growth, but can impede heterodox thinking and

imagination; c) large-firm R&D requires personnel who are highly educated in extant information

and analytic methods, while successful independent entrepreneurs and inventors often lack such

preparation; d) while procedures for teaching current knowledge and methods in science and

engineering are effective, we know little about training for the critical task of breakthrough

innovation.

       First, some preliminary observations on which the hypotheses at the heart of this

paper are founded: As should not be surprising, only a very small proportion of the

enterprising founders of business firms actually engage in the innovative activity that is a

key element in the extraordinary growth performance of the industrialized free-market

economies. In fact, it has been suggested that something on the order of only five percent

of firm-creating entrepreneurs engage in significant innovation. Rather, most private-

                                                                                              2

sector expenditure on research and development is attributable to very large corporations.

These corporations are prime employers of scientists and engineers, personnel

characteristically highly educated and technically erudite. But, despite this concentration

of knowledge, talent, and expenditure in these major enterprises, an examination of the

list of revolutionary technological breakthroughs since the onset of the Industrial

Revolution suggests that they were contributed in overwhelming proportion by

independent inventors and small, newly founded enterprises, not by major firms.2 Finally,

and intriguingly, a review of the biographies of the most celebrated of these innovators

shows, in a surprising share of these cases, a most remarkable absence of rigorous

technical training and, in many cases, little education at all. The obvious names of yore—

Watt, Whitney, Fulton, Morse, Edison and the Wright brothers—illustrate the point.3

       The preceding observations would seem to lend support to two surmises: that the

concentration of R&D in corporate hands is a gross misallocation of social resources, and

even that education contributes little and may even be a hindrance to technical progress.

Research recently undertaken by several colleagues and myself already indicates that the

curious observations just listed are generally consistent with the facts, but that the

dubious conclusions that they would appear to imply are incorrect and misleading.

Rigorous education does play a critical role in support of technical progress, and R&D

expenditure by the giant corporations, together with the efforts of the independent

entrepreneur-innovators provide a crucial contribution to the process. However, the

corporate contribution and that of the innovative entrepreneur are characteristically very

different from one another and characteristically play complementary roles. Moreover,

                                                                                             3

the contribution of the two together is superadditive, that is, the combined result is greater

than the sum of their individual contributions.



I. Education as a Help, and a Hindrance, to Innovation

       Historical evidence indicates that the design of the educational process has

significant consequences for two highly pertinent, but very different, capabilities of the

individuals engaged in innovative activities. On one side, education provides technical

competence and mastery of currently available analytic tools to future entrepreneurs and

others who will participate in activities related to innovation and growth. On the other

side, education can stimulate creativity and imagination and facilitate their utilization.

But it is at least a tenable hypothesis that educational methods that are effective in

providing one of these benefits may actually tend to be an obstacle to attainment of the

other. For example, the student who has mastered a large body of the received

mathematical literature, including theorems, proofs and methods of calculation, may be

led to think in conventional ways that can be an obstacle to unorthodox approaches that

favor creativity. And our preliminary evidence suggests that there is a comparable

difference between the ways of thinking of the personnel of large industrial laboratories

who focus on successive, incremental technical advances in product and process design,

and the innovative entrepreneur (the inventive individuals who are responsible for true

technological breakthroughs). This suggests two companion premises: one related to

education, and the other to the complementary activities of invention and incremental

innovation. The first premise is that education designed for technical competence and

mastery of the available body of analysis and education designed to stimulate originality

                                                                                             4

and heterodox thinking tend to be substitutes more than complements. The second and

more complex premise is that technical progress requires both breakthrough ideas and a

protracted follow-up process of cumulative incremental improvement of those

breakthroughs, with the combined incremental contribution of this second phase often

exceeding that of the first. Further, the industrial laboratories of the giant corporations are

ill-suited to the provision of the seminal breakthroughs but well-designed for the

subsequent development tasks, which are indispensable for achievement of the

technological breakthroughs’ full promise. The study of these ideas promises to provide a

deeper understanding of both the nature of education and that of innovative and inventive

activity. In addition, it can perhaps suggest ways in which it may be desirable to modify

the educational system in general and the preparation of future entrepreneurs in

particular.



II. Background Evidence on Inventive Entrepreneurs vs. Incremental Innovators

        There are at least three strands of evidence about the differences between

inventive entrepreneurs and incremental innovators. The first is related to the types of

contributions to economic growth that are characteristic of these two types of innovative

enterprise; the second deals with the differences in the educational levels of inventive

entrepreneurs and incremental innovators; and the third focuses on the nature of the

educational process itself.

        Type of Enterprise, Innovation and Growth. The evidence shows that there is a

rather sharp differentiation between the contributions to the economy’s technological

innovation that are provided by entrepreneurs and those that are offered by the large

                                                                                           5

internal R&D laboratories of established businesses. Large business firms, which account

for nearly three-quarters of U.S. expenditure on R&D, have tended to follow relatively

routine goals, slanted toward incremental improvements rather than revolutionary ideas.

Greater user-friendliness, increased reliability, marginal additions to application,

expansions of capacity, flexibility in design—these and many other types of improvement

have come out of the industrial R&D facilities, with impressive consistency, year after

year, and often pre-announced and pre-advertised.

       In contrast, the independent innovator and the independent entrepreneur have

tended to account for most of the true, fundamentally novel innovations. In the list of the

important innovative breakthroughs of the 20th century, a substantial number, if not the

majority, turn out to be derived from these sources rather than from the laboratories of

giant business enterprises. For example, the U.S. Small Business Administration (1995)

provides a list of important 20th century innovations for which small firms were

responsible, and its menu of inventions spans an astonishing range (see Table 1 below).

Other studies come to similar conclusions. It is a plausible observation, then, that perhaps

most of the revolutionary new ideas of the past two centuries have been, and are likely to

continue to be, provided more often by these independent innovators who, essentially,

operate small business enterprises. This is not to say, however, that the routine innovative

activities have not accomplished a great deal. Though their outputs have usually been less

dramatic and less spectacular, if one takes their incremental contributions together and

sums their achievements, it becomes clear that their accomplishments of the large

corporations have been very substantial. A very clear example is the airplane. The

comfort, speed and reliability of modern passenger aircraft and complex military flying

                                                                                             6

machines clearly, by contrast, make the Wright brothers’ revolutionary device into a

historical curiosity. Automatic piloting, communication, location and computing

equipment were surely undreamed of in the years following the first flights. And most of

the sophistication, speed and reliability of today’s aviation equipment is probably

attributable to the combined incremental additions made by routine research activities in

corporate facilities. Other careful observers have extended such examples and have

concluded that incremental and routinized innovation activities have been responsible for

a very respectable share of the contribution of innovation to economic growth in the 20th

century.

       Educational Attainment of Personnel. All of this is pertinent to study of

innovation and growth because our communications with a number of major firms with

substantial R&D activities indicate that these enterprises generally employ at least some,

and often a profusion of, persons with advanced technical training and higher academic

degrees. In contrast, a preliminary sample of successful entrepreneurs and independent

inventors indicates that they frequently have had only a basic education and that, though

at least some of them have consulted closely with more extensively trained advisors, the

core ideas were contributed by the entrepreneurs and inventors themselves.

      Education for Mastery of Received Knowledge versus Education for

Innovative Ideas. I will end this recapitulation of the preliminary evidence with an

observation on a very different subject though, as will be seen below, for purposes of

study of the issues under discussion it is closely related to the preceding observations.

This is the contrast between U.S. and foreign educational performance at different levels

of education. As has been widely publicized, international comparison tests on subjects




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                             7

such as mathematics, physics and other technical and scientific disciplines apparently

show consistently that the performance of American students at the elementary school

and high-school levels is markedly inferior to that of some European and Asian countries.

Yet, the U.S. is universally considered the superior venue for Ph.D. training, so that the

best students from the other countries in question vie to come to this country for their

graduate work. Moreover, it appears to be the American graduate students who frequently

produce the more original and more substantial dissertations. This difference in

performance at the two levels of education is a paradox, but like many paradoxes, it may

have a straightforward explanation. It may be that the educational approaches that are

most effective in providing mastery of the already extant body of intellectual materials

actually tend to handicap a student’s ability to “think outside the box” and thus

discourage unorthodox ideas and breakthrough approaches and results.

       I am led, then, back to my first two premises. The exploration of these premises

may, in Benjamin Franklin’s words, constitute useful knowledge for the design of

educational procedures, for promotion of entrepreneurship, for facilitation of the

innovation process and for extension of equality of opportunity in a market economy.

Specifically, my colleagues and I are undertaking the study and testing of the following

seven hypotheses:

       Hypothesis 1. A disproportionate share of breakthrough inventions is contributed

by independent inventors, entrepreneurs and small or startup firms, while the large firms

specialize in incremental improvements.

       Hypothesis 2. A substantial proportion of startup enterprises involve former

employees of large firms who left their former jobs because their large employer was

                                                                                              8

unreceptive to heterodox ideas or offered financial or other incentives to contributors of

valuable inventions.4

       Hypothesis 3. Training for mastery of currently available scientific and technical

methods and materials is of enormous value for innovation and growth. But educational

practices that encourage heterodox thinking and exercise of originality and imagination is

evidently also of very great importance for society.

       Hypothesis 4. The educational approaches best suited for the first of the preceding

purposes may be quite different from those that contribute to the second. Indeed, the two

approaches may be somewhat inconsistent, with promotion of the one objective tending

to impede attainment of the other.

       Hypothesis 5. The R&D division of the large firm tends primarily to require

personnel who have undergone training for mastery of extant information and analytic

methods, while the work of the independent entrepreneur and inventor may prove to be

more effectively facilitated by avoidance of that sort of preparation to the extent that it

impedes imagination and originality.

       Hypothesis 6. Incremental improvement of complex products may require mastery

of far more demanding technical information and techniques than was needed for the

original ideas that resulted in the invention of those products. The technology needed to

improve the design of a Boeing-777 passenger airplane is obviously enormously more

complex than that underlying the Wright brothers’ first vehicle.

       Hypothesis 7. Thus, while the two educational approaches are quite different and

to some degree inconsistent, neither can be considered irrelevant or inferior. Each is

essential for the process of innovation and growth, and it is important to investigate what




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                            9

educational approach is most appropriate for each task that underlies invention,

development and economic expansion.

       Let us, then, turn to the preliminary evidence and see what it implies about the

validity of the hypotheses.



       Entrepreneurship and its Role in the Growth Process

       Entrepreneurship has long been valued as a key contributor to the growth of an

economy.5 Indeed, it is widely believed that economies that are abundantly supplied with

entrepreneurs will tend to grow far more rapidly than those in which entrepreneurial

talent is scarce. Yet Joseph Schumpeter himself, indisputably the 20th century’s prime

contributor to the economic analysis of entrepreneurship and innovation, was led to

conclude that the day of the entrepreneur was waning, that the expanding role of

routinized innovation by big business was threatening to make the entrepreneur obsolete.

I will argue here that part of the pertinent mechanism has been correctly discerned both

by those who continue to have faith in the individual entrepreneur’s critical role in

economic growth but also by any who follow Schumpeter in concluding that routinized

innovation by giant enterprises is assuming a primary role. But each side here is telling

only part of the story and, as a result, overlooks much of its essence. The entrepreneur

continues to play a critical part in the growth process, and there is no reason to expect

that role to disappear. But in the modern economy the entrepreneur, working alone in the

marketplace, cannot carry out the task most effectively. Fortunately, the market

mechanism has provided the partners that the entrepreneur needs for the purpose.

        Market Pressures for an Enhanced Large-Firm Role in Technical Progress

        Free competition—that is, competition not handicapped by severe government

regulations or tightly enforced customary rules, like those of the medieval guilds that

prevented gloves-off combat among rival firms—has arguably played a critical role in the

growth of the capitalist economies. Of particular significance in the arena of innovation is

rivalry among oligopolistic firms—those large firms in markets dominated by a small

number of sellers. And crucial here is the fact that in today’s economy many rival

oligopolistic firms use innovation as their main battle weapon, with which they protect

themselves from competitors and with which they seek to beat those competitors out. The

result is precisely analogous to an arms race—to the case of two countries, each of which

fears that the other will attack it militarily and therefore feels it necessary always at least

to match the other country’s military spending. Similarly, either of two competing firms

will feel it to be foolhardy to let its competitor outspend it on the development and

acquisition of its battle weapons. Each firm is driven to conclude that its very existence

depends, at the least, on matching its rivals’ efforts and spending on the innovation

process. In an economy in which this is so, a constant stream of innovations can be

expected to appear, because the giant warring firms to whom the story pertains do not

dare relax their innovation activities.

        Increasingly, at least in the United States, the funding for innovation has been

supplied by large oligopolistic enterprises, hardly the sort of firms that one associates

with the entrepreneur. Today some 70 percent of R&D expenditure in the U.S. is carried

out by private business, and the annual level of real investment by the private sector is

growing with a trajectory that seems near geometric (Figure 1). Most of this growing

outlay is provided by the larger firms. According to data gathered by the National

Science Foundation (National Science Board, 2000, Chapter 2, p. 24), in 2000, 46 percent

of total U.S. industrial R&D funds was spent by 167 companies, each of which employed

25,000 or more workers; 60 percent of these funds was spent by 366 companies with at

least 10,000 employees, and 80 percent was spent by 1,990 firms of 1,000 or more

employees. At the other end of the spectrum, about 15 percent of total U.S. industrial

R&D funds was spent by 32,000 companies, each of which employed fewer than 500

workers.

       In these enterprises, innovative activities are carefully designed to prevent

unwelcome surprises and to keep risks to a minimum. As a result, there is little of the

free-wheeling, imaginative, and risk-taking approach that characterizes the entrepreneur.

Instead, the large firm’s top management often keeps a tight rein on the activities of the

company’s laboratories, with budgets determined by the upper strata of control within the

                                                                                              12

firm, who also may determine how many persons and what sort of specialists at what

levels will be employed on R&D endeavors. It is not even unusual for management to

determine what new products and processes the laboratories should next seek to discover.

Sometimes, large firms try to unleash their employees engaged in innovative activity by

organizing a subsidiary operation that is more inviting to the free exercise of

entrepreneurship, but often without much success.

        The natural incentive system for a bureaucratically governed enterprise is to run

research and development in accord with bureaucratic rules and procedures. All of this

leads to the conjecture, voiced by Schumpeter, that the work responsibilities the economy

assigns to the entrepreneur are narrowing and are destined to shrink even further. One can

easily surmise what prompted Schumpeter to foresee a limited future for the entrepreneur

where industry and its innovation processes are widely characterized in the manner just

described. Yet, I will argue next that this is fundamentally a mischaracterization. Rather

than being condemned to obsolescence, a vital role continues to be played by independent

entrepreneurs.



        Revolutionary Breakthroughs: A Small-Firm Specialty

        It is convenient here, if patently inaccurate, to divide up inventions with the aid of

two polar categories: revolutionary breakthroughs and cumulative incremental

improvements. Of course, many new products and processes fall into neither extreme

category, but are somewhere in-between. Still, it will become clear that the distinction is

useful. Moreover, there are many examples that clearly fit into one of these categories or

the other quite easily. For instance, the electric light, alternating electric current, the

                                                                                           13

internal combustion engine, and a host of other advances must surely be deemed

revolutionary, while successive models of washing machines and refrigerators—with

each new model a bit longer-lasting, a bit less susceptible to breakdown, and a bit easier

to use—arguably constitute a sequence of incremental improvements.

       The relevance of the distinction should be evident, given what has been said about

the working and organization of R&D in the large business organization. The inherent

conservatism of the process naturally leads to the expectation that these firms will tend to

avoid the risks of the unknown that the revolutionary breakthrough entails. The latter,

rather, is left most often to the small or newly founded enterprise, guided by its

enterprising entrepreneur. Though that is to be expected, the degree of asymmetry in the

apportionment of this specialized activity between large and small firms in reality is

striking. Earlier studies, such as that by Jewkes, Sawers and Stillerman (1969), Scherer

(1980) and Acs and Audretsch (1988), have provided evidence pertinent to this

conclusion. Acs and Audretsch conclude that, “While some of the appropriability

measures such as market concentration and unionization are negatively related to

innovative activity, the extent to which an industry is composed of large firms is

positively related to the total number of innovations” (p. 679). They go on to write that,

while their results, “…do not support an unequivocal conclusion regarding the exact

differences in innovation behavior between large and small firms” (p. 688), the data

suggest, “that, ceteris paribus, the greater the extent to which an industry is composed of

large firms, the greater will be the innovative activity, but that increased innovative

activity will tend to emanate more from the small firms than from the large firms” (p.

687). Scherer remarks in a similar vein that, “…the most favorable industrial

environment for rapid technological progress would appear to be a firm size distribution

that includes a predominance of companies with sales below $500 million, pressed on

one side by a horde of small, technically oriented enterprises bubbling over with bright

new ideas and on the other by a few larger corporations with the capacity to undertake

exceptionally ambitious developments” (p. 422, as quoted in Acs and Audretsch).

       My hypothesis here goes a little beyond these conclusions, surmising on the basis

of only preliminary evidence that small enterprises tend to produce a disproportionate

share of inventions that are the heterodox breakthroughs. Table 1 is a list, made up by the

U.S. Small Business Administration (also the source of the Acs and Audretsch data), of

small-firm innovations in the last century. Its menu of inventions literally spans the range

from A to Z, from the airplane to the zipper.

This remarkable list includes a strikingly substantial share of the technical breakthroughs

of the twentieth century. Besides the airplane, it lists FM radio, the helicopter, the

personal computer, and the pacemaker, among a host of others, many of enormous

significance for our economy.

        Two recent studies, also sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration

(CHI Research, 2002, 2004), provide more-systematic and powerful evidence to similar

effect.6 These reports examine technical change through patenting and define “small

firms” as “businesses with fewer than 500 employees.” Perhaps most notably, the first of

these studies finds that, “…a small firm patent is more likely than a large firm patent to

be among the top 1 percent of most frequently cited patents.” Among other conclusions,

in the words of its authors, this study reports that, “Small firms represent one-third of the


File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                           16

most prolific patenting companies that have 15 or more U.S. patents…. Small firms are

more effective in producing high-value innovations—the citation index for small firm

patents averaged 1.53 compared to 1.19 for large firms…. A small firm patent is at least

twice as likely to be found among the top 1 percent of highest-impact patents as a patent

from a large firm” (CHI Research, 2002, p. 2). Moreover, the more recent study found

that, “The technological influence of small firms is increasing. The percentage of highly

innovative U.S. firms (those with more than 15 U.S. patents in the last five years) that are

defined as small firms increased from 33 percent in the 2000 database to 40 percent in the

2002 database.” In addition, “Small companies represent 65 percent of the new

companies in the list of most highly innovative companies in 2002” (CHI Research,

2004, p. ii).

        As we will see next, however, large firms have made equally important

contributions to technological progress. Though the small enterprises have specialized in

the breakthroughs, they are not alone in making critical contributions to innovation and

growth.



        Revolutionary Consequences of Aggregated Incremental Improvements

        The type of innovation in which the giant enterprises tend to specialize is

primarily devoted to product improvement, increased reliability and enhanced user-

friendliness of products and the finding of new uses for those products. The approach

tends to be conservative, seeking results whose applicability is clear and whose markets

are relatively low in risk. As already noted, the bureaucratic control typical of innovative

activity in the large firm serves to ensure that the resulting changes will be modest,




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                          17

predictable and incremental. These firms are not predisposed to welcome the romantic

flights of the imagination, the entrepreneurial leaps of faith and plunges into the unknown

that often lead only to disaster, but which alone are likely to open up new worlds.

       However, having recognized the critical role of the smaller enterprises, one

should not go to the other extreme and undervalue the incremental contribution of the

routine activity that at least sometimes arguably adds even more to growth than do the

more revolutionary prototype innovations. Though each such small improvement may be

relatively unspectacular, added together they can become very significant indeed.

       Table 1 provided a set of extreme examples of the contributions of the small,

entrepreneurial firms. But one can easily obtain equally startling examples of the

magnitude of the innovative contributions of the large companies, whose incremental

contributions can add up and compound to results of enormous magnitude. One such

illustration is the progress in computer chip manufacture by the Intel Corporation, which

is the leading manufacturer of these devices and has brought to market successive

generations of chips and transistors, on which the performance of computers is so heavily

dependent. According to a recent report,7 over the period 1971-2003, the “clock speed”

of Intel’s microprocessor chips—that is, the number of instructions each chip can carry

out per second—has increased by some 3 million percent, reaching about 3 billion

computations per second today. During the period 1968-2003, the number of transistors

embedded in a single chip has expanded more than 10 million percent, and the number of

transistors that can be purchased for a dollar has grown by five billion percent. These are

evidently no minor contributions. Added up, they surely contribute far more computing

capacity than was provided by the original revolutionary breakthrough of the invention of

                                                                                            18

the electronic computer. Of course, that initial invention was an indispensable necessity

for all of the later improvements. But it is only the combined work of the two together

that made possible the powerful and inexpensive apparatus that serves us so effectively

today. Yet we must not ignore a caveat here. The 2004 CHI Research study cited above

reports that in their large sample the 5.3 percent of all patent citations by large firms that

entailed patents owned by small firms was substantially smaller that the small firm’s

ownership share (6.1) percent of patents owned. “This suggests that large firms build

upon the patents of small firms at a rate 14 percent lower than expected given the number

of patents owned by small firms” (p. 11).8



III. Some Suggestive Inter-Country Comparisons

       Having set the background, I can return now to the central issue of this paper and

its hypotheses: the role of educational orientation in affecting the amount and type of

innovation, here distinguishing once more between “breakthrough” and “incremental”

innovations. Since there is no easy way of dividing innovations between these two

categories, one cannot expect to find any systematic body of data that permits any formal

test of the hypotheses. However, we can glean some suggestive observations from the

available statistics on patenting, patent license revenues, and R&D spending and

personnel.

       Recall that one of the conjectures at least implicit in my earlier discussion is that

the U.S. educational system is less effectively designed than that of most other

industrialized countries to inculcate full mastery of currently available bodies of scientific

and technological knowledge, but that this country’s educational process is better adapted

                                                                                                                                                     19

to stimulation of heterodox and imaginative thinking. The implication is that the U.S.

system is better suited to the creation of breakthrough innovation but less well adapted to

incremental innovation. Let us see what the data suggest about these conjectures.

        The following four figures include the nine countries that are the highest

performers in the whatever measure is at issue in each graph. Where the data are

available, the graphs also include the Russian Federation, for a reason that will be

brought out presently, though that country is generally far from the top performer in

terms of each variable studied.9 Figure 2 shows the number of patents per million

inhabitants granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2001. It is clear that the

U.S. itself is in the leading position.,

        Figure 3 shows receipts of royalties and license fees, in U.S. dollars per person in

2001. First, we observe that, in this case, Japan ranks third from the bottom, indicating

either a marked unwillingness to license or, instead, that its large number of patents have

relatively little market value, a possibility consistent with its “first to file” patent system,

which promotes rapid filing of a large number of patent applications that can be prepared

quickly, are narrow in scope, and often represent incremental advances. We see that the

U.S. is not the leader in terms of license royalties per capita, but is second only to

Sweden. In contrast, as shown in Figure 4, the U.S. is very much in the middle in terms

of its R&D spending as percent of GDP (1996-2000), as well as in number of scientists

and engineers in R&D, per million people (Figure 5).10

       While nothing can be inferred categorically from this set of observations, they do

at least appear to be consistent with the conjecture that superior performance in the

number and economic significance of the inventions that are produced in the U.S. place it

in or near the lead, despite the relatively mediocre levels of its per-capita expenditure on

R&D and the size of the body of persons with advanced formal education who are

employed in this arena. This surely is not inconsistent with our conjectures on U.S.

education, though one cannot claim any more.

       A word should be added about the performance of the Russian Federation, which

is close to the other end of the spectrum, at least in the number of scientists and engineers

devoted to R&D, as contrasted with its near-zero licensing royalties. It is suggestive here

that technical training in the sciences and engineering in Russia has for many years been

quite rigorous, satisfying exceedingly high standards. But the Russian data are even more

to the point for an issue I have discussed elsewhere (see Baumol, 2002, p. 67). I have

argued that the Soviet Union’s poor performance in terms of innovation (including

putting inventions to actual use), despite its fine body of scientists and engineers, was

ascribable in good part to the absence of incentives for rapid and effective utilization like

those provided in the free market economies. The data described above seem to confirm

that the Russian economy still has far to go before it achieves the full free-market

stimulus to innovation and growth.



IV. Trends in the Required Education of the Entrepreneur

        I have argued earlier that, by the nature of his task, the entrepreneur-innovator

has required less advanced education than the industrial scientist and engineer who focus

                                                                                            23

on cumulative incremental improvement. More than that, I have suggested that such

limited education has been helpful to the former, and indeed almost essential, as a way of

liberation from the rigidities and standardized ways of thinking that current practice in

higher education is apt to impose. Yet it is arguable that the advantages of limited

education may be subject to diminishing returns. As time passes, the cumulative character

of technological information makes it increasingly complex and this imposes an ever

more severe handicap upon relatively unaided intuition. Even ill-educated entrepreneurs,

with Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates apparently prime examples, cannot usually get along

without at least some limited knowledge of physics, chemistry, computer technology, or

some other body of analysis and information. This complicates to some degree our

hypothesis about the ideal education of the innovative entrepreneur. That hypothesis must

apparently be modified to assert that while over-rigorous education is an impediment to

exercise of the imagination (which is an entrepreneur’s prime professional instrument),

nevertheless the minimum educational attainment characteristically needed for the task is

growing. No carpenter such as John Harrison, who solved the longitude problem, no mere

bicycle repairmen such as the Wright brothers, can any longer hope to contribute, for

example, today’s mind-boggling medical breakthroughs. An illustration is (the already

extant and workable) equipment that makes it possible for surgery to be carried out by

computer-guided robots, with immediate and automatic restocking (without reordering or

human intervention) of surgical equipment and medication (which is partly already in

use), and remote surgery in which the operating surgeon (who controls the computer)

may be thousands of miles from the patient during the procedure, as has already been

done successfully (American Philosophical Society, 2003).

V. The University’s Role in Innovator Education

        I have so far omitted two other key players in the innovation process, the

universities and the pertinent government agencies, which, of course, have also made

major contributions to technological progress. I do not mean to undervalue their role—

one need only mention once again the development of the electronic computer, or the

creation of the internet, to illustrate their important contributions. But these institutions

have also tended to carry out a rather specialized and different function from those

discussed above. It is to these not-for-profit players that we must look primarily for the

results provided by basic research as distinguished from applied research.

        The reasons for this division of labor with private industry are well understood, so

that only a few words (but taking a viewpoint that is not quite standard), need be said on

the subject here. I have argued earlier that the market mechanism is a powerful enforcer

of corporate innovative effort, making mandatory its growing participation in applied

innovative research. But the same market mechanism also inhibits investment in basic

research, that mainstay of long-run innovative output. From the point of view of the

unthinking market mechanism, investment in basic research is largely a “wasteful”

expenditure, because the outlay offers no dependable promise of addition to the profits of

the firm.11 By its very nature, it is nearly impossible to predict whether basic research

will yield any financial benefit at all and, if so, who will ultimately be the beneficiary.

Certainly, it need not be the enterprise that was so improvident as to have carried it out.

That is why governments and universities have had to step in, if truly basic research of

any magnitude was to be carried out in the market economies.




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                             25

       The importance for technological progress of this contribution of academia and

the public sector need hardly be argued. The focus here, however, is not upon innovation

itself, but on the education of the innovator. Obviously, the institutions of higher

education are at the heart of this process. And university research activity is directly

pertinent to this subject. For as the universities themselves frequently point out, one of

the major purposes of research in the academy is the training of the researchers of the

future. The participation of graduate students in the investigations of senior faculty

members, as well as the research the students carry out themselves under faculty

supervision, is clearly an effective way, perhaps even the most effective way, to equip the

next generation to carry on the tasks of discovery and innovation.

       Though their work at institutions of higher learning leans toward basic research,

many of these students will, of course, go on to jobs in the industrial laboratories of

private enterprise, swelling the number of employees with advanced academic degrees.

Moreover, such research activity of the postgraduate students can help to prepare them

for participation in either camp. It can offer them both of the two types of education that

have been stressed here: mastery of the currently available body of analysis that arguably

is of primary importance in the industrial laboratories, and more free-wheeling exercise

of the imagination in the unorthodox directions from which the technical breakthroughs

are more likely to emerge. But there is also a danger here. As in any activity, many

university teachers understandably succumb to the temptation to direct students to follow

all too closely in their own footsteps, thereby leading to mastery of the already available

research paths but weakening their ability to proceed in unexplored directions. There is

no obvious way to eliminate this arguably widespread problem, but it may at least be

                                                                                             26

possible to contain it to some degree if the evidence supports the educational hypotheses

that have been offered here and the results are appropriately disseminated.



VI. Appropriate Educational Programs for Innovative Entrepreneurship

       I have already argued that at least some limited amount of technical training,

presumably at the university level, is growing increasingly indispensable even for the

most independent of innovating entrepreneurs. Though there presumably remains a

marked difference between this sort of education and that needed for cumulatively-

incremental product development, the implication is that it is increasingly appropriate for

the universities to provide a place for these prospective entrepreneurs, but to design for

them a program that avoids the inculcation of standardized and unimaginative ways of

thinking. That, in essence, is the difficult task—but the critical assignment—that faces

those who would provide a better program for educational preparation of the innovating

entrepreneur of the future. It is not something that need significantly concern the training

of prospective entrepreneurs as defined in a broader sense, in other words, the process of

equipping those who hope to create new firms that are likely to be of some standard type,

with products and procedures that are largely conventional and replicative. But it is an

issue that pertains to the education of the entrepreneur with innovative propensities.

       Of course, there are also more humdrum educational activities that can be helpful

both to the nascent innovating entrepreneur and the prospective entrepreneur in the more

general sense. As we know, it has generally proven convenient, if not essential, even for

innovating entrepreneurs to establish new business firms as their vehicle for economic

exploitation of their ideas. But the inexperienced founder of any new company is apt to




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                              27

be handicapped, sometimes fatally, by lack of types of rather elementary knowledge that

are particularly critical for successful and innovative firms. This includes things like

guidance on the different sources of funding, their relative advantages and perils. It can

also encompass steps that can be adopted to reduce the dangers raised by the financing

process, pitfalls stemming from the tax system, safety requirements to protect the labor

force, and environmental regulations. Inventors need guidance through the morass of the

patent laws and the complications with which they threaten inventive activities, as well as

the difficulties that can be introduced by institutions that deal with patents, such as patent

pools and standard setting organizations. The founders of new enterprises need help in

dealing with regulations, from the tax laws to the fire laws, in avoiding difficulties

entailed in construction of their facilities, in the requirements of record keeping, and so

on. It follows that nothing said in this paper should be taken as an effort to induce

prospective entrepreneurs to avoid education. Rather, the purpose here is to suggest what

differences in the contents of the entrepreneur’s education are most promising.



VII. Conclusion

       This paper offers two relatively novel observations that may contribute to our

understanding of the growth process. The first asserts that our economy derives its

innovations from two sources: from the routine activities of giant firms and from

independent inventors and their entrepreneur partners. The second observation is that the

education that is best adapted to the requirements of the one of these activities is very

different from that most suitable for the other.




File: Education for InnovationNBER5.doc April 30, 2004
                                                                                            28

       These two types of inventive effort are not as inherently substitute activities as

they may appear to be. Rather, there has been a predictable tendency toward

specialization, with the entrepreneurs providing the more heterodox, breakthrough

innovations, and the R&D establishments of the larger firms creating the enhancements

to those breakthroughs that contribute considerably to their usefulness. These “Goliath”

innovators have not eliminated the role of the entrepreneurial “Davids.” Instead, the two

have tended to specialize and, together, they have enhanced the process beyond what

either type of innovator might have been able to achieve by itself. Thus, there is a critical

complementarity between the roles of the two types of innovating enterprise, and growth

is arguably enhanced by this division of their labor.

       Routine innovation processes—those guided by standard-business decision

principles—are of great and probably of growing importance. But the entrepreneurial

independent innovator in his small business enterprise continues to play a critical role.

Revolutionary breakthroughs continue to be provided to a considerable degree by small

enterprises that can avoid the conservative propensities of the giant firm. Without their

revolutionary entrepreneurial contributions there would be much less for the large firms

to develop further.

       It is fortunate for the U.S. economy that its institutions and arrangements are such

as to facilitate and stimulate profuse formation of small firms and to encourage their

more-radical innovative contributions. And the American educational system seems to be

less rigid and demanding than those in the other industrialized countries, thereby enabling

it to serve more effectively the needs of innovative entrepreneurship. If further

investigation indicates that these two observations are valid, they can perhaps offer some

useful guidance for design of better-adapted educational procedures, particularly those

that are intended as preparation for entrepreneurship.

    There are, of course, significant exceptions, notably the invention of the transistor at

Bell Laboratories. But in that particular case, the parent firm was in a special situation

that was arguably highly relevant. Most notably, at that time AT&T was a regulated

monopoly protected from competitors who might otherwise have benefited from the

spillovers generated by the innovative breakthrough, and regulation virtually guaranteed

AT&T recoupment of the R&D outlays that other, less-protected firms might have

considered a wild gamble on a harebrained project.

    Samuel Morse did attend Yale but, like Fulton, was trained as an artist. More recently,

he was a pilot in the Royal Air Force, years before he attended Cambridge University.

    If the firm offers little or no added reward to successful employee inventors but

provides all R&D staff members with wages sufficiently above market levels, this can be

interpreted simply as a transfer of the risk of the invention process from the employee to

the firm. But it must be noted that it reduces the prospective incremental payoff for

successful contribution to the individual employees and can thereby reduce the effort they

devote to the process.

    Here, I will emphasize Joseph Schumpeter’s conception of the entrepreneur as a partner

of the inventor—as a businessperson who recognizes the value of an invention,

determines how to adapt it to the preferences of prospective users, and brings the

invention to market and promotes its utilization.

    Quoting the press release describing the study, “A total of 1,071 firms with 15 or more

patents issued between 1996 and 2000 were examined. A total of 193,976 patents were

analyzed. CHI [the firm that carried out the study] created a data-base of these firms and

their patents. This list excluded foreign-owned firms, universities, government

laboratories, and nonprofit institutions” (p. 2). The 2004 study expanded the sample to

1,270 firms and dealt with the period 1995-99, and a total of 1777,899 patents.

    However, “There are a number of individual industries in which large firms cite a

higher than expected number of small firm patents, suggesting that they are building

extensively on small firms’ technology. These industries include high-tech areas such as

biotechnology, medical electronics, semiconductors and telecommunications” (CHI

     Here, it should be observed that, because of the absolute size of its economy, the total

figures for the U.S. tell a different story. The U.S. accounts for 44 percent of total R&D

expenditures in all OECD countries combined. And U.S. R&D investments outdistance,

by 150 percent, the R&D investments made by the second largest R&D performer, Japan.

Thus, the fact that Sweden spends 3.8 percent of its GDP as opposed to the U.S. spending
