                                               ABSTRACT

This paper explores the links between exports, export destinations and skill utilization by firms. We
identify two mechanisms behind these links, which we integrate into a unified theory of export destinations
and skills. First, exporting to high-income countries with higher valuation for quality leads to quality
upgrades that are skill-intensive (Verhoogen, 2008). Second, exporting requires services such as distribution,
transportation, and advertising, activities that are also intensive in skilled labor (Matsuyama, 2007).
Depending on the characteristics of the source country (such as income, language), the theories suggest
a skill-bias in export destinations: firms that export to high-income destinations hire more skills and
pay higher wages than firms that export to middle-income countries or that sell domestically. We test
the theory using a panel of Argentine manufacturing firms. The data cover the period 1998-2000 and
span the Brazilian currency devaluation of 1999. We use the exogenous changes in exports and export
destinations brought about by this devaluation in a major export partner to identify the causal effect
of exporting and of exporting to high-income countries on skill utilization. We find that Argentine
firms exporting to high-income countries hired a higher proportion of skilled workers and paid higher
average wages than other exporters (to non high-income countries) and domestic firms. Instead, we
cannot identify any causal effect of exporting per se on skill utilization.

1    Introduction

In this paper, we investigate whether the destination of exports, rather than the mere act of
exporting, affects firm behavior. While it has already been established that exporters outperform
non-exporters (they pay higher wages, they are more productive, and they are larger), the causal
effect of exporting is less evident. Often, the evidence supports a story of selection. Exporting
allows firms to take advantage of their inherent good attributes, such as productivity, but the act
of exporting itself does not necessarily affect firm behavior (Bernard and Jensen, 1995; Bernard
and Jensen, 1999; Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott, 2007; Clerides, Lach, and Tybout, 1998).
In other instances, exporting does affect behavior. The evidence in Bustos (2011) and the theory of
Matsuyama (2007) suggest that what matters is exporting per se, with exporters adopting better
technologies and utilizing more skilled labor. In turn, the evidence in Bastos and Silva (2010),
Görg, Halpern and Muraközy (2010), Hummels and Skiba (2004), Manova and Zhang (2011),
Martin (2010) and Verhoogen (2008) suggests that certain features of the country of destination,
such as income, quality valuation, distance, and transport costs, affect firm decisions. Our analysis
shows that exporting to high-income destinations affects firm behavior, but exporting does not.
    We elaborate upon a theory of how exports and export destinations affect the utilization of
skilled labor, and we document those features using a panel of manufacturing firms from Argentina.
Traditional theories of international trade often take a relatively simple view of the production
process in which the production of goods is carried out by combining factors (labor, capital) and
a technology. Recent trade models, including Feenstra and Hanson (1996), Matsuyama (2007),
Verhoogen (2008), and Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), internalize some of the complexities of
modern production processes by assuming that the production of goods comprises the combination
of activities such as various manufacturing tasks, marketing, distribution, foreign trade activities
and exporting services. These tasks differ in their skill intensity so that the act of “exporting”
becomes a skilled intensive activity, even when the act of “manufacturing” is unskilled-intensive.
Moreover, we argue here that the act of “exporting to high-income destinations” may require
technologies and tasks that are yet more skill-intensive. In consequence, economies that trade with
high-income countries will utilize relatively higher levels of skills and will pay higher wages than
economies that are either closed or specialized in trade with middle- or low-income countries.
    There are various reasons why the act of exporting by developing countries may demand skills,
even when the production process is relatively intensive in the use of unskilled labor. A leading

                                                 2
recent theory is provided by Verhoogen (2008), who develops a model where exporting allows
for quality upgrading—an activity that demands skilled labor. This idea can be extended to
accommodate models where vertical differentiation includes associated services such as labeling or
customer support and where the provision of these services is a skilled-intensive activity. Note
that exporting per se does not necessarily lead to quality upgrading. Firms in a country like
Argentina—the target country in the empirical work—may choose to produce the same level of
quality to sell internally than to sell to neighboring markets like Brazil. By contrast, exporting to
high-income countries with higher valuation for quality (e.g., the U.S.) does lead to higher quality
products and to higher skill use. In other words, our claim is that “where you export” matters.1
       Matsuyama (2007) proposes another reason why export destinations may require varying levels
of skills. He advances a model of “skilled-bias globalization” in which international trade activities
use resources and are relatively skilled-intensive. These activities, which include international
marketing and commercialization, transportation and distribution, and advertising (as in Arkolakis,
2010), require expertise in international businesses, languages, foreign technologies, and in the social
idiosyncrasies of foreign markets. In Matsuyama’s model, the technologies to supply goods depend
on whether firms sell domestically or abroad. In our setting, we allow for a modified Matsuyama
argument where the technology to supply goods may also depend on the destination of exports: for
a country like Argentina, the activities needed to access high-income countries may require more
skills than those activities needed to access neighboring markets.
       We test our hypothesis using a panel of Argentine manufacturing firms, the Encuesta Nacional
Industrial, ENI (National Industrial Survey). The surveys include information on sales, wage bill,
employment of production and non-production workers, and other general characteristics of the
firms (such as industry affiliation, type of ownership, and plant age). Using confidential information,
we matched the firms in the ENI with administrative customs data available for 1998, 1999 and
2000. The result is a combination of typical information from industrial surveys with information
on export values and export destinations at the firm level. In other words, we know, for each firm
in the panel, whether the firm exported, how much it exported, and where it exported to.
       Our 1998-2000 data span the Brazilian devaluation of 1999, which provides a nice setting for
identification. Brazil is a major trade partner of Argentina, and the 1999 devaluation had a large
   1
    Our theory is thus related to the argument in Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik (2007), who claim that “what you
export” matters. If goods are differentiated by export destination, then “what you export” and “where you export”
are clearly interrelated.



                                                       3
impact on Argentine exporters. The Brazilian devaluation generated exogenous variability in the
export destinations of Argentine firms as some switched Brazil for high-income countries (and
also the domestic market). We use an instrumental variables strategy to exploit these exogenous
changes to identify the role of exports and of the composition of exports in the determination of
the skill composition of employment in Argentine firms. Moreover, since we work with a panel, we
can match, for a given firm, the behavioral changes in terms of skill utilization with the exogenous
changes in its export composition induced by the Brazilian devaluation.
    We find that, for Argentine firms, exporting to high-income countries matters, but exporting
per se does not. Firms that tend to export more to high-income countries use more skills and
pay higher average wages than firms that do not export at all or export instead to middle-income
countries. The reason is that the local markets in Argentina are similar to the export markets
in middle-income countries and thus it is only possible to observe differences in outcomes for
firms exporting to high-income countries. Further, we use the information on exports to different
destinations to explore which features of those destinations are likely to drive the results. Our
evidence strongly supports the quality valuation story of Verhoogen (2008). We instead only find
partial support for the modified Matsuyama (2007) required-services argument.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we integrate the various
channels linking the choice of skilled labor utilization with the act of exporting and with the act
of exporting to high-income destinations. In Sections 3 and 4 we discuss our empirical model and
identification strategy, and we present the results. Section 5 concludes.


2     An Integrated Theory of Skills and Export Destinations

This section presents a simple partial equilibrium model that integrates two broad mechanisms
linking exports and skill composition at the firm-level: quality valuation (Verhoogen, 2008) and
exporting-related required services (Matsuyama, 2007).2 We first describe the demand side and
the structure of production in a generic market. We then discuss how these mechanisms depend
on features of the export destinations.
   2
     The literature on trade and quality is growing steadily. See Manasse and Turrini (2001), Hummels and Skiba
(2004), Hummels and Klenow (2005), Hallak (2006), Verhoogen (2008), Hallak (2010), Hallak and Schott (2011),
Hallak and Sivadasan (2009), Khandelwal (2010), Kugler and Vergoohen (2011), and Fajgelbaum, Grossman and
Helpman (2009), among others. Our model combines elements from various papers. Matsuyama (2007) was the first
to highlight the role of activities that are inherent to the act of exporting in the theory of trade and comparative
advantage.

       Let products be both horizontally and vertically differentiated and allow preferences to be
non-homothetic in order to capture the notion that high income countries value high quality goods
more than low income countries.3 We adopt a multinomial logit utility specification as in Verhoogen
(2008) where consumers in high income countries have a lower marginal utility of income and thus
are willing to pay a premium for a good of a given quality. The utility that consumer i in country
of destination c derives from purchasing product j depends on a vertical differentiation parameter,
denoted by θ, its price, denoted by p, and a random deviation that follows a type-I extreme value
distribution, denoted by . Utility is given by


(1)      Uijc = θjc − αc pcj + cij .


These assumptions yield the well–known multinomial–logit aggregate demand function

                              Mc
(2)      xcj (pcj , θjc ) =      exp(θjc − αc pcj ),
                              Wc

where M c is the number of consumers in country c, or market size, and W c is an index that
summarizes the characteristics of all available products in that market (i.e. W c = z∈Z c exp(θzc −
                                                                                   P

αc pcz ), where Z c is the set of available products). The parameter αc can be interpreted as the
marginal utility of income, or the inverse valuation of quality; it dictates the relative importance
of θ and p in the utility function. Thus, 1/αc captures quality valuation, as in Verhoogen (2008).4
       On the supply side, there are J monopolistically-competitive firms in the source country, each
producing a differentiated product.5 Each firm can ship its product to multiple destinations.
Exporting to destination c has an associated fixed cost given by F c . Firms can choose the level
   3
       For simplicity, we do not consider differences in preferences among consumers in a given country.
   4
       The utility function in (1) can be derived from a utility function defined over the vertically differentiated products
and a homogeneous numeraire product. Utility from choosing variety j and consuming y c − pcj units of the numeraire
good is Vijc = u(y c − pcj , θjc ) + ecij , where y c denotes income in country c. Utility from spending all income in
the numeraire is Vi0c = u(y c , 0) + eci0 (the vertical differentiation component is normalized to zero without loss of
generality). If pcj is small enough relative to income, the difference in utilities can be approximated by Vijc − Vi0c =
[∂u(y c , 0)/∂θ]θjc − [∂u(y c , 0)/∂y]pcj + [ecij − eci0 ], which, after rearranging terms, yields [Vijc − Vi0c ]/[∂u(y c , 0)/∂θ] =
θjc − [∂u(y c , 0)/∂y]/[∂u(y c , 0)/∂θ]pcj + [ecij − eci0 ]/[∂u(y c , 0)/∂θ]. This yields the utility function in (1) with Uij  c
                                                                                                                                   =
    c      c        c             c         c                 c                c      c    c         c
[Vij − Vi0 ]/[∂u(y , 0)/∂θ], α = [∂u(y , 0)/∂y]/[∂u(y , 0)/∂θ], and ij = [eij − ei0 ]/[∂u(y , 0)/∂θ]. The normalization
with respect to the ‘outside option’ does not affect the choice probabilities. Notice that the primitive preferences
are the same across countries of destination and that the parameter αc varies across countries through differences in
income. We assume that αc is not affected by changes in income induced by exchange rate movements.
     5
       We assume that the number of firms is fixed, as in Chaney (2008) and Arkolakis (2010). Arkolakis, Demidova,
Klenow, and Rodriguez-Clare (2008) show that this assumption yields the same results as free entry in the model of
Melitz (2003).




                                                                 5
of vertical differentiation of their products and, moreover, they can tailor the level of vertical
differentiation to each specific country of destination (thus, θjc is indexed by j and c). Intuitively,
vertical differentiation involves physical product quality, packaging, and services such as advertising,
customer support, and timely delivery, which can be differentiated by country of destination. By
choosing the level of vertical differentiation, firms shift their residual demands. The degree to which
a residual demand is shifted depends on the quality valuation parameter 1/αc , which gives firms
the option to provide more vertical differentiation in destinations where it is valued more highly.
   We assume that reaching consumers in country c involves a second set of services and tasks,
such as marketing research, communication with clients or intermediaries, transportation, and
distribution. These services, akin to the variable costs of Matsuyama (2007), are related to the
exporting technology and do not affect the value that consumers attach to a firm’s product; nor is
its level chosen by the firms. We refer to these services as “required services,” and we denote the
level of required services to reach consumers in country c by τ c . Note that in Matsuyama (2007),
τ is independent of the destination market. Our modified Matsuyama hypothesis allows instead
for differences in the level of required services by country of destination. These differences arise
from geographic location (through transportation costs), from cultural and linguistic distance, from
differences in social norms and idiosyncracies, and from differences in business models. A similar
idea emerges from the case studies of Argentine exporters in Artopoulos, Friel and Hallak (2011).
They identify “embeddedness” in foreign businesses as a prerequisite for successful exporting to
developed countries. Being familiar (embedded) with business and social practices in the destination
country creates intrinsic knowledge about the destination markets (such as detailed information
about consumer trends or about the main features of different distributors) and this knowledge is
essential for exporting.
   To study the relationship between the provision of vertical differentiation and required services,
the decision to export to different destinations, and the skill composition of employment, we adopt
several simplifying assumptions. First, labor is the only input and there are two types of workers,
skilled and unskilled. Second, wages are fixed (e.g., they are determined in the production of larger
homogeneous goods sectors). Without loss of generality we normalize the wage of unskilled workers
to one and denote the wage of skilled workers by w. Third, we assume that there is no direct
substitution (except through the choice of quality) between skilled and unskilled workers. Finally,
we assume that the provision of vertical differentiation and of required services is, as in Verhoogen


                                                   6
(2008) and Matsuyama (2007), intensive in skilled workers. To formalize this, we assume that
delivering one unit of final product of quality θjc to country c requires aj units of unskilled labor
and bj ((θjc )β + τ c ) units of skilled labor, with β > 1.6 Note that since parameters aj and bj vary at
the firm level, we allow for two sources of firm heterogeneity as in Hallak and Sivadasan (2009).
       For each destination, firms choose prices pcj and the level of vertical differentiation θjc to maximize
profits given by πjc = [pcj − aj − bj (τ c + (θjc )β )w]xc (pcj , θjc ) − F c .7 The solutions for pcj and θjc , which
are independent across destinations, are given by

                                                                β

The vertical differentiation parameter θjc is decreasing in the marginal utility of income (αc )—firms
choose to provide a higher level of quality when it is valued more highly —and it is independent of
τjc . Price is increasing in τ c , reflecting the higher unit cost implied by a higher τ c , and decreasing in
αc , reflecting both the higher unit cost implied by the higher optimal quality and the fact that firms
can extract more surplus from consumers when they are willing to pay more for their products.
Once prices and quality are chosen, firms compare variable profits with the destination-specific
fixed costs and decide which markets to enter.
       Given the optimal solution for price and vertical differentiation, the relative demand for skilled
workers employed in the production of goods that are shipped to country c (Sjc ) is

Equation (5) delivers the basic relationship between export destinations and skill utilization that
   6
     To preserve Matsuyama’s Ricardian features, we assume linearity in the provision of required services, such as
transportation costs, while decreasing returns to scale in the provision of vertical differentiation, such as quality of
service. This latter assumption reflects the fact that shifting the demand function becomes increasingly more difficult
as quality increases. From a technical standpoint, this assumption is needed because θjc is a choice variable. The skilled
labor requirements could also be written as bj (τ c + θjc )β . This alternative assumption yields very similar predictions.
At the same time, we assume that the cost of providing vertical differentiation in one market is independent of the
level of vertical differentiation provided by the same firm in other markets. This assumption is in line with the
constant marginal cost assumption in the number of units and with independence of preferences across markets (by
which shifting the demand function in one country does not become increasingly more costly as demand is shifted in
other markets).
   7
     The monopolistic competition assumption implies that firms do not affect the index W c .



                                                                              7
stems from our theory. Since firms need to provide the required services τ c because of technological
requirements, and the provision of these services is skilled intensive, Sjc is increasing in τ c . Since
firms provide services to increase quality when these services are more valuable to consumers, and
since quality provision is intensive in skills, Sjc is decreasing in αc . Differences in τ c and αc across
destinations create differences in the skill utilization of domestic firms.
       To study the role of these differences in τ c and αc , we work with three markets: the domestic
market (D), high income destinations (H), and low income destinations (L). We start with the
quality valuation mechanism (Verhoogen, 2008). The marginal utility of income is decreasing in
income, and thus is lower in the high-income market than in the low-income market (αH < αL ).
In equilibrium, firms choose a higher level of vertical differentiation in high income destinations
(θjH > θjL ) which in turn implies that exporting to high-income markets is more skill-intensive than
exporting to low income markets (SjH > SjL ). The quality valuation mechanism does not provide
a general prediction regarding skill intensity for exports vis-à-vis domestic sales. The relative skill
use depends on the income level of the domestic market. For a middle-income source country like
Argentina (the target country in our empirical analysis), we assume that αD = αL , which yields
SjH > SjL = SjD . This shows that, ceteris paribus, exporters to high-income destinations utilize
more skills than both other exporters and domestic producers.8
       The “required services” mechanism of Matsuyama (2007) implies that reaching consumers
abroad is more costly than reaching domestic consumers. Because τ captures exporting services,
it is zero for domestic shipments (τ D = 0) and positive for export markets (τ H > 0, τ L > 0). This
implies SjH > SjD and SjL > SjD . The required services are related to the exporting technology,
instead of demand, and are thus not directly related to income. As a result, the channel does not
provide a prediction regarding SjH and SjL . In the case of Argentina, low and middle-income markets
in South America (Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile) are geographically close, and share the same
or similar languages, similar cultural heritage, and similar business models. On the other hand,
exporting to most high-income destinations (U.S., Germany, U.K.) requires higher transport costs,
English speaking managers, and more able managers and entrepreneurs to adopt foreign business
   8
    In the presence transport costs, this result needs to be qualified to accommodate the shipping -the-good-apples-out
argument of Hummels and Skiba (2004). In particular, if transport costs are non-proportional then high-priced,
high-quality goods become relatively cheaper in high-transport-cost markets, which will thus disproportionately
demand higher-quality goods. It is possible for two countries with the same valuation of quality (the same α) to
have different demands for quality. If, as we discuss in the empirical section, high-transport-cost countries are also
high-income countries, then domestic firms will disproportionately ship higher quality goods to those markets but
not necessarily because of lower α but rather because of higher (non-proportional) transport costs.

practices.9 This implies that, for Argentina, τ H > τ D and that as a result SjH > SjL > SjD . This
result establishes the second link between export destinations and skills.
      Our model is also useful to clarify a few specific issues related to the empirical strategy in
section 3. In the data, we do not observe Sjc , the level of skills used to serve different destinations,
at the firm level. Instead, we observe the aggregate skill composition (Sj ) and the level of sales by
country of destination. Thus, we need to be able to establish differences in SjH , SjL , and SjD from
changes in these observable variables. To see how we do this, note first that relative demand for
skilled workers at the firm level can be written as a weighted average of the relative demands for
skilled workers employed in the production and delivery of goods that are shipped to each of the
three destinations:

                   xD
                    j       xL
                             j       xH
                                      j
(6)     Sj = SjD      + SjL    + SjH    ,
                   xj       xj       xj

where x = xD + xL + xH is total firm sales (including domestic sales and exports to different
destinations). Since S H > S L and S H > S D , the higher the share of exports destined to high
income countries is, the higher the relative demand for skilled labor becomes (controlling for the
share of exports in total sales). Note also that firms exporting to high income countries will incur
a higher wage bill since skilled labor earns a higher wage than unskilled labor.10
      Second, as we will shortly discuss, our empirical strategy exploits exogenous changes in exports
and in export destinations of Argentine firms brought about by a Brazilian devaluation that took
place in 1999. In our model, the Brazilian devaluation causes a decrease in demand in low-income
markets (because Brazilian demand declines), without affecting market conditions in high-income
destinations. As a result, some exporters to low income foreign markets will exit (eventually
retrenching into local markets) and exporters to high income markets will sell less in low income
markets. This implies that the share of exports to high income markets will increase and so will
the utilization of skills, as per equation (6). Note that this is a within-firm composition effect,
where a weighted average (total skill utilization) changes due to changes in the participation of
   9
     Note that some low-income destinations such as China, India or Africa are geographically and culturally far from
Argentina (but may share instead more similar business practices and models). These destinations amount to a small
share of exports, however.
  10
     There are other mechanisms that could in principle explain a positive link between exporting to high-income
countries and wages in a country like Argentina. One explanation is “profit sharing” in a model of fair wages (Egger
and Kreickemeier, 2009; Amiti and Davis, 2011). It is also possible that exporting to developed countries is associated
with higher wages to reduce labor turnover. Another theory due to Yeaple (2005) argues for higher wages due to
scale economies attached to exporting (to different destinations).


                                                          9
each destination in total sales. This corresponds to changes in the weights with constant Sjc in
equation (6).
         In a more general model, the devaluation of the low income country’s currency could also boost
exports into high income markets. This can happen if, for instance, there are increasing marginal
costs with joint production or capacity constraints. In this setting, production shipped to Brazil
affects the costs incurred in production shipped to, for instance, the U.S. (and vice-versa). As a
result, when Brazil devalues, shipments to Brazil contract, and this reduces production costs to
U.S., so that exports to the U.S. can actually increase. In this case, the increase in the share of
high-income markets will be twofold, first because of a decrease in exports to Brazil, and second
because of an absolute increase in exports to the U.S.


3         Empirical Analysis

We now turn to our empirical analysis. We describe the data, introduce the regression model and
the identification strategy, and present the main findings on exports, export destinations and skill
utilization in Argentina.


3.1        The Data

We use two main sources of data in our analysis: a firm survey and administrative customs
information. The firm survey is the “Encuesta Nacional Industrial” (ENI) or National Industrial
Survey. The ENI is a panel of manufacturing plants and collects information on sales, value added,
input use, employment of production workers, employment of non-production workers, total wage
bill, and industry affiliation at the 3-digit level of the ISIC Revision 2 classification. We have access
to the module of the survey that corresponds to the province of Buenos Aires for the years 1998,
1999 and 2000.11 A key limitation of these data is sample size, with only 901 firms in a short 3-year
panel.
         The second source of data for our analysis is administrative customs records. From the customs
records we extracted the total value of exports by country of destination at the firm level.12 We
then matched this information to the firm survey using tax identification numbers. The result is a
    11
     Being the most highly industrialized and developed area of the country, the province of Buenos Aires accounts for
40 percent of the population and more than half of the manufacturing activity in terms of employment and output.
  12
     We do not have access to quantities or unit values.




                                                         10
panel of employment, wages, exports, and export destinations by firm.
       The firm survey was collected at the plant level but customs information was recorded at the firm
level. Since all plants owned by a same firm share the same identification number, we aggregated
information across plants owned by a given firm and created a dataset at the firm level that we
then matched with the customs records. In our survey, only 14 percent of firms own more than one
plant. In the online appendix, we show that regression results are very similar whether we use the
full sample of firms or only one-plant firms.13
       Table 1 presents summary statistics from the combination of firm and customs data for the
full sample 1998-2000. In Panel A, we describe the export intensity and export destinations of
Argentine firms; in Panel B, we focus on differences in outcomes (employment, wages, and skill
utilization) across firms. Out of 901 firms and 2544 firm-year observations, 68 percent of firms
exported in at least one of the three years of data, while in a given year, the average share of
exporters is 59 percent (Panel A). The proportion of exporters is higher than what the literature
typically finds. This can be partly explained by the fact that our firm survey corresponds to an
export-oriented geographic area of Argentina.14 The share of exports in total sales is, in contrast,
small: exports account for only 8 percent of sales across all firms (column 1) and 13 percent among
exporters (column 2). The average number of destinations (including the domestic market) is 3.3
in the sample of all firms and 4.9 among exporters.
       In columns 3 and 4, we describe the characteristics of firms that export to at least one high
income destination, the “high-income exporters.” We work with two definitions of high-income
destinations based on the World Bank country classification. In the first definition (Definition I),
we include countries classified as high-income OECD, high-income non-OECD and upper-middle
income. The countries in each group are listed in the online appendix. On average, each year
51 percent of firms export to at least one high-income destination (1307 out of 2544 firm-year
observations). For high-income exporters, total exports (to all destinations) account for 15 percent
of total sales and the average number of destinations, including domestic sales, is 5.4.
       In the second definition (Definition II), we classify as high-income destinations only countries
in the World Bank’s high-income group, while upper-middle income economies are excluded. In
this grouping, the number of firms that export to high-income countries drops to 27 percent (680
  13
    The online appendix is available at the authors’ websites.
  14
    At the same time, the high share of exporting firms is not explained by biases in firm size, as the ENI covers
firms of all sizes (provided they are in the formal sector), based on censuses sampling weights. While tax evasion and
worker informality are prevalent among manufacturing firms in Argentina, firm informality is not.


                                                         11
out of 2544 firm-year observations). These firms show a higher export intensity (exports account
for 22 percent of total sales) and a higher number of destinations (7.8 per firm). For our regression
analysis, we chose the first classification as our main specification to show that even under a
conservative definition there are significant differences between high- and low-income exporters. As
we will show below, these differences are magnified when we apply the more liberal definition that
excludes upper-middle income economies from the high-income destinations set.
       Panel B of Table 1 explores the relationship between skill utilization, exports and export
destinations by comparing exporters and non-exporters. From the ENI panel survey, we report
in column 1 average employment, sales and two measures of skill utilization. Our first measure
is the average wage, defined as the total wage bill divided by total employment. In the surveys,
firms report the total wage bill, which includes total payments to all workers, production and
non-production. Firms, however, do not report the wage paid to different types of workers. The
average wage is a proxy for skill utilization inasmuch as firms with a higher skill composition pay
higher wages. Firms do report separately the total number of employees in each of those two
categories. Our second measure of skill utilization is thus the share of non-production workers in
total employment.15 In our sample, firms employ an average of 89.7 workers and pay average annual
wages of 12,154 USD. Non-production workers account for 26 percent of total employment. In
column 2, we report differences between exporters and non-exporters by running an OLS regression
of each firm attribute on a dummy of whether the firm exports or not (which we build using the
matched customs data), controlling for 3-digit industry and year effects. Our data confirm the
stylized fact of this literature: Exporters are larger by around 122 percent (173 percent in terms
of sales); they pay higher wages by about 48 percent; and they hire 5 percentage points more
non-production workers than non-exporters.
       In column 3, we compare high-income exporters to low-income exporters. Conditional on
exporting, we run OLS regressions of the various outcomes on a dummy for high-income exporters
(controlling for industry and year effects). Using Definition I, the results show that firms that
export to at least one high-income destination are 39 percent larger in terms of employment and
54 percent larger in terms of sales than exporters that only export to low income countries; they
pay higher wages by about 12 percent; and they hire a larger fraction of non-production workers by
  15
    Firms also report hours worked by each of the two categories of employment and our results are robust to using
the share of hours worked by non-production workers as a measure of skill utilization. Note that we do not have
information on the educational level of the workers.



                                                       12
about 3 more percentage points. Thus, exporters have good attributes, and high-income exporters
have even better attributes.
       Column 4 compares high-income exporters in Definition I with those in Definition II. The
data show that firm differences persist among high-income exporters. For instance, Definition II
high-income exporters are larger (by 43 percent in terms of employment and by 54 percent in
terms of sales) than Definition I high-income exporters. They also pay higher average wages (by
15 percent) and employ a higher share of non-production workers (by 1.4 percentage points).


3.2      Skills and Export Destinations: The Empirical Model

The statistics reported in Table 1 uncover the basic relationship between exports, export
destinations and skills. We now study this relationship in more detail with the following regression
model:


(7)      sijt = δ1 EXPijt + δ2 HIijt + x0ijt β1 + φjt + φi + ijt .


The variable sijt is a measure of the utilization of skills in the labor force employed by firm i
in industry j at time t (i.e., the average wage and the share of non-production workers in total
employment). The right-hand side variables of interest are EXP and HI. Let Eijt be total exports
of firm i, let Yijt be total sales (including domestic sales and exports) and let EHijt be exports to
high-income destinations.16 We define EXPijt = Eijt /Yijt as the ratio of total firm exports to total
firm sales. We use this variable rather than an exporter dummy because EXP captures the intensity
of the exporting status and because it has much more variability within firms in a 3-year panel
such as ours, but we also explore results using an export dummy indicator. HIijt = EHijt /Eijt
is defined as the share of firm exports to high-income destinations over total firm exports. This
variable is a measure of the composition of exports across destinations and captures the impact of
exporting to high-income countries once export intensity has been accounted for. In our robustness
tests below, we also report results where we measure HI as the ratio of exports to high-income
destinations over sales.
       The vector of firm characteristics, x, includes industry dummies (when firm fixed effects are
  16
    In most of this section, we use the conservative definition (Definition I) where high income destinations are
countries in the high-income OECD, high-income non-OECD and upper-middle income groups of the World Bank
classification. We later show robustness results dropping the group of upper-middle income countries from high-income
destinations.


                                                         13
not included), firm size measured by the log of total sales, and differential trends across time at the
firm level (which we discuss below). The error term includes a firm fixed effect φi , a year-industry
(at the 3-digit level) fixed-effect φjt , and a random component ijt .
   To uncover the basic correlations that we want to study, we start by estimating (7) by OLS,
pooling all years of data but including industry and year fixed effects. The results are in Table 2.
In Panel A, we work with our first proxy for skill utilization, average wages. In column 1, where
we include EXP but exclude HI, we confirm the cross-section result: firms with higher ratios of
exports to sales pay higher wages. In column 2, where we include HI, high-income destination
exports, but we exclude EXP , we find a positive and significant coefficient as well. In column 3,
we include both the exports to sales ratio (EXP ) and the ratio of exports to high income (HI) in
the same regression. Both coefficients are positive and statistically significant. Overall, thus, we
observe that skill utilization is positively correlated not only with export intensity but also with the
destination of a firm’s exports. This means that, conditional on the same export intensity, firms
that ship a larger share of their exports to high-income markets utilize, on average, more skills.
   In Panel B, we work with our second proxy for s, the share of non-production workers in total
firm employment. When we only include EXP (column 1), we find a positive correlation, albeit
not statistically significant, between export intensity and skills. When we only include HI, we find
a strong positive correlation between exporting to high-income countries and skill composition.
Finally, when both EXP and HI are included (column 3), exporting to high-income countries is
positively correlated with a higher utilization of skills, but export intensity is not.
   Both the simple correlations in Table 1 and the OLS estimates in Table 2 are consistent with
the claim that exporters utilize relatively more skilled labor and that exporters to high-income
markets even more than exporters. In the light of our model in Section 2, there are two ways
to interpret these findings with different implications about the behavior of exporting firms (to
different destinations).
   Our model combines differences in the fixed costs of exporting to different destinations,
multi-dimensional firm heterogeneity (the parameters a and b), and differences in both the marginal
utility of income (α) and in the costs of exporting (τ ) across destinations. Consider first a scenario
where there are no differences in α and τ , so that we “shut down” both the quality (Verhoogen
2008) and exporting technology (Matsuyama 2007) mechanisms. We retain the differences in a and
b and we assume higher fixed costs in the high-income market, lower in the low-income market,


                                                  14
and even lower domestically, F H > F L > F D . In this scenario, since α and τ are the same
across destinations, a given firm will choose the same level of skills for each export destination
(SitH = SitL = SitD ). However, this level of skill will vary across firms according to their efficiency in
the utilization of skilled and unskilled labor (parameters a and b). This is because more efficient
firms will choose a higher level of vertical differentiation for their products, which provides higher
profits. At the same time, the differences in fixed costs generate a sorting of firms, where firms
with lower a and b will be more likely to find it profitable to export to high income destinations.
       This scenario generates a positive association between the skill (s) and the export destination
variables and it is thus consistent with the OLS results of Table 2. There is no causality, however.
The correlation arises because of the selection of firms into the different export markets. In other
words, there are productivity and cost shocks that allow firms to simultaneously enter or expand
their export operations and hire different skill levels.
       Let us now add the quality and export technology channels. We showed that in a scenario with
lower marginal utility of income in high-income destinations (αH < αL = αD ) and with more costly
technology to export to high-income markets (τ H > τ L > τ D = 0), firms will use a higher share
of skilled workers in their exports to high-income markets (SitH > SitL > SitD ). This result is not
directly testable with our data, since we do not observe skill use by country of destination. Instead,
we observe the total skill intensity, which is a weighted average of the skill use in each destination as
given by equation (6). However, since SitH > SitL > SitD , we should observe that for a given firm, the
average skill use increases with the share of high-income exports. This scenario is also consistent
with the OLS results of Table 2 but the implications are different. The correlation between skill use
and high-income exports is not merely due to selection across firms but also because of differences
in firm behavior (i.e., the utilization of different skills in serving different markets) in response to
differences in α and τ .
       For our analysis, we want to be able to discern between the two scenarios, because they have
implications regarding the relevance of the theoretical mechanisms. Clearly, it matters if the
correlations between the variables are only due to selection of more productive firms or also to
behavioral responses. OLS cannot distinguish between the two scenarios.17 To tell them apart,
we develop an empirical strategy to look at changes within firms and use instruments that explain
  17
     There are other sources of unobserved heterogeneity which are beyond the scope of the model but that could be
affecting the correlation in skill utilization and high income exports in the data. We discuss those below, when we
compare the OLS and IV results.



                                                        15
exogenous shifts in the export share of high-income destinations. This strategy provides an answer
to the following question: for a given firm, with given a and b (possibly changing over time), and
thus given SitH , SitL and SitD , does the average skill use go up if there is an exogenous increase in the
share of high income destinations?


3.3      Identification Strategy

There are two endogenous variables in our model: exporting to high-income destinations HI (the
share of exports to high income countries on total firm exports), and export intensity EXP (the
share of exports in sales). To achieve identification, we exploit the panel nature of our data and
we use instrumental variables. The panel allows us to track firms over time. The instruments
exploit the exogenous variation in HI and EXP caused by the Brazilian devaluation of 1999,
which induced Argentine firms to cut sales in Brazil and to expand sales both domestically and in
high-income countries.18 Ultimately, our strategy boils down to tracking changes in skill utilization
for a given firm, due to responses in exports and export destinations following the exogenous
Brazilian devaluation.
       Argentina and Brazil are major trade partners and thus the Brazilian devaluation had an impact
on Argentine exports that is large enough to achieve identification. Argentine export statistics by
country of destination, shown in Table 3, provide prima-facie evidence in support of our strategy.
In the pre-devaluation year of 1998, Argentine exports were destined mostly to Brazil (36 percent),
Europe (13 percent), the United States (10 percent) and neighbors like Chile (6 percent), Uruguay
(4 percent) and Paraguay (3 percent). In 1999, when Brazil devalued, the share of exports to Brazil
dropped to 28 percent. These shares partially recovered in 2000, reaching 31 percent. Consistent
with our argument above, alternative markets for Argentine exports were found in the U.S. (with
shares increasing to 13 percent in 1999 and 15 percent in 2000) and Europe (with shares increasing
to 15 percent in 1999 and 14 percent in 2000). At the bottom of Table 3, we observe that the share
of exports destined to high-income countries increased from 43 percent in 1998 to 50 percent in
1999 and 51 percent in 2000 (using Definition I) and from 28 percent to 34 percent (using Definition
II).
       In Table 3, we also report changes in export values. As expected, exports to Brazil declined,
  18
     There is a growing literature that looks at changes in major trade partners as a source of identification. Exchange
rates of trade partners were used for instance by Revenga (1992) and Park et al. (2010). Changes in Brazilian tariffs
due to Mercosur were used to identify impacts on Argentine firms in Bustos (2011). Verhoogen (2008) uses the own
devaluation of Mexico to link exports to wage inequality.


                                                          16
because Brazilian domestic products became relatively more inexpensive. At the bottom of the
table, we show that exports to high-income destinations increased significantly, from 6.5 billion
dollars in 1998 to 7.2 billion dollars in 2000. This expansion is largely accounted for by an increase
in exports to the U.S., from 1.6 to 2.2 billion dollars. While it is interesting to confirm that exports
to high-income countries increased, this result is not necessary for identification. Clearly, however,
the fact that exports to high-income countries actually increased in the data only reinforces the
mechanisms that we exploit in our empirical analysis.
      Our empirical test is related to Verhoogen’s approach in that both use devaluation episodes.
However, while Verhoogen exploits Mexico’s own Peso devaluation of 1994, we focus here on
the devaluation of a major trading partner and exploit exogenous changes in exports to various
destinations. This provides a cleaner environment for identification, allows us to test the importance
of export destinations vis-à-vis exports, and to disentangle the effects of factors such as technology
and willingness to pay.


3.4     IV Results

We build separate instruments for HI and EXP . Our instrument for HI is defined as IitHI =
P ostt ∗ λBRA
          i98 , that is, it is the interaction of a P ost devaluation variable with the pre-devaluation

share of the firm’s exports that were destined to Brazil, λBRA                          BRA
                                                           i98 . Since the 1998 shares λi98 precede

the devaluation, they measure exogenous exposure to it. The rationale for this instrument is that,
as documented in Table 3, firms that were most exposed to the Brazilian devaluation adjusted by
moving away from this market and by exploring new markets in high-income countries. We expect
a positive correlation between the “scope to divert exports” and exports to high-income markets.
      We adopt two specifications for P ost. In the relatively more non-parametric model we interact
the level of exposure to Brazil before the devaluation, λBRA
                                                         i98 , with 1999 and 2000 year dummy

variables, so that the instrumental variables are


(8)     IitHI1 = φt ∗ λBRA
                       i98 ,



where φt denotes the 1999 and 2000 year dummies. This specification allows the impacts of the
devaluation to vary from one year to the other as firms adjust to the exchange rate shock. In
the second specification, we interact λBRA
                                       i98 with the exchange rate between the Brazilian and the



                                                    17
Argentine currencies, erateBRA
                           t   :


(9)     IitHI2 = erateBRA
                      t   ∗ λBRA
                             i98 .



      Since the initial shares of Brazilian exports play a predominant role in the construction of our
instrument, we report summary statistics from the firm data on the share of exports to different
destinations in Table 4. The export-weighted average of the share of exports to Brazil in 1998
was 37 percent, declined to 32 percent in 1999 and to 35 percent in 2000. This decline correlates
with an increase in the share of exports to high-income countries from 49 percent in 1998 to 58
and 54 percent in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Unconditionally, the share of Brazilian exports
declined from 19 percent in 1998 to 16 percent in 2000, while the share of high-income exports
increased from 29 to 33 percent from 1998 to 2000. These trends are consistent with the story
behind our identification strategy. Table 4 also reports average shares for different types of firms.
For instance, with an average share of 27 percent, large firms were more exposed to Brazil in
1998 and thus increased the share of exports to high-income destination from 40 to 47 percent.
Different industries reacted differently as well. For instance, the share of exports to Brazil in
“Paper products,” a highly-exposed industry, declined from 25 percent in 1998 to 16 percent in
2000, with an increase in the share of high-income exports from 31 to 48 percent. In contrast, the
share of exports to Brazil in “Leather” was only 1 percent in 1998 (and remained roughly constant
after the devaluation), while the share of exports to high-income countries in this sector in fact
declined from 37 to 32 percent during the period.
      To deal with the endogeneity of the ratio of exports over sales (EXP), we construct a measure
of the average exchange rate faced by a given firm in international markets:

                 X
(10) IitEXP =         eratect ∗ ψi98
                                 c
                                     ,
                  c

       c
where ψi98 is the share of exports of firm i to country c on total sales in 1998 (which is
predetermined) and eratect is the exchange rate of country c (relative to the Argentine Peso) at
time t. Instruments such as (10) have been used before by, for example, Revenga (1992) and Park
et al. (2008). Given the shares of export sales to market c in 1998, a higher exchange rate would
induce firm i to export more to this market, thus increasing EXPit . In consequence, we expect




                                                   18
EXP to be positively correlated with I EXP in the first stage regressions.19
    Good instruments have to be exogenous, help to explain the endogenous variables, and satisfy
the exclusion restrictions. As argued above, our instruments are prima-facie correlated with the
level of exports and with its composition across destinations, and we further test these correlations
below with results from the first-stage regressions. In addition, the Brazilian devaluation generated
exogenous variation in export intensity (EXP ) and in export destinations (HI), and these changes
in exports are plausibly exogenous to the pre-devaluation shares of exports to Brazil. Likewise,
our second instrument is based on arguably exogenous changes in the exchange rates of all trading
partners and on each firm’s exposure to those changes given their pre-shock export share over
sales. In other words, while the pre-shock shares are a choice variable of the firm, once they
are predetermined, the differential change in exports due to the devaluation of Brazil (or other
countries) is reasonably exogenous. In our empirical analysis, we discuss various tests of potential
violations of the exclusion restrictions. As a caveat, note that our strategy can fail if there is serial
correlation in the errors, but we cannot do much about this with our short 3-year panel. As we
show next, however, our IV results are very robust.
    We begin with Table 5, which shows results from the baseline model where our measure of skills
is the average wage bill, the instrument for HI is the interaction between initial shares in 1998 with
year dummies (equation (8)), and the instrument for EXP is the average weighted exchange rate
(equation (10)). Panel A reports the IV estimates of δ1 and δ2 in (7); Panels B1 and B2 document
the first stage regressions for HI and EXP , respectively.
    To benchmark the discussion, we begin in column 1 with a simple model including HI and EXP
as regressors but omitting all controls as well as the industry-year effects: we find that exporting
per se does not raise skill utilization, but exporting to high income countries does. The first stage
regressions (panels B1 and B2) allow us to assess the instruments, which work very well. They
have substantial explanatory power, are statistically significant, and the p-values associated with
the F -statistic of joint significance of the instruments are very low.
    In columns 2-5, we include various controls to test for potential violations of the exclusion
restrictions that can arise if the devaluation of a major trading partner or the 1999 concurrent
domestic recession had heterogeneous effects across industries. For instance, the evidence in Galiani
  19
     Note that while λBRA
                       98
                                                                                                           c
                             in equations (8) and (9) is the share of exports to Brazil in total exports, ψ98 in equation
(10) is the share of exports to country c on total sales. As a consequence, the instruments convey different useful
information for identification purposes. Also, using sales in the denominator is actually preferred in the case of I EXP
because we are instrumenting the degree of export orientation of the firm.


                                                           19
and Hopenhayn (2003) suggests that unskilled workers, rather than skilled workers, are the first
to be laid off during a recession, and this may lead to higher average wages and higher shares of
non-production (skilled) employment. If these effects were industry-specific, we can account for
them with industry-year fixed effects, which we add in column 2. With industries disaggregated at
the 3-digit level, these industry-year effects are quite comprehensive. The results remain unchanged:
only exporting to high-income countries matters. The first stage results (panels B1 and B2) are
also robust to the addition of the industry-year effects.
   Another concern with the exclusion restriction are firm-specific trends. There can be unobserved
factors that simultaneously determine the choice of export shares to Brazil in 1998 and the
subsequent response to the devaluation. For example, pre-devaluation productivity shocks or cost
shocks that persist in time imply that a firm’s ability to change export destinations might depend on
the initial share exported to Brazil (in 1998). To control for these unobserved pre-shock differences
in initial conditions, we interact log sales in 1998 with year dummies (column 3) and with the
Brazilian exchange rate (column 4). In addition, the crisis might have affected exporters and
non-exporters differently. If non-exporters are hit harder than exporters by the domestic recession,
because they cannot sell to unaffected countries (such as the U.S. or the E.U.), then non-exporters
may suffer larger profit losses and, eventually, may need to impose larger wage cuts. To control
for this, we interact the exporter status in 1998 with year dummies (column 3) and with the
Brazilian exchange rate (column 4). In the specifications in columns 3 and 4 of Table 5, EXP is
never statistically significant, while HI is always positive and highly significant. In addition, the
coefficients in columns 3 and 4 (0.267 and 0.284) are comparable to those in the simpler models
of columns 1-2. In panels B1 and B2, we find that the addition of controls for the firm’s initial
conditions does not affect the statistical properties of our instruments.
   In column 5, we estimate the model with the log of sales as an additional control in the regression
for time-varying heterogeneity such as current productivity or cost shocks. Note that we use sales
as a proxy for unobserved characteristics in order to improve the estimation of δ1 and δ2 ; we
consequently do not attach any causal interpretation to the coefficient of log sales. Our main
results remain unchanged: EXP does not affect skill use, but HI does. The estimated coefficient
of HI is 0.260, implying that a firm with the average shares of exports to high-income countries
(30 percent) pays around 7.8 percent higher wages than firms that do not export at all to these
markets. Besides, the 3.4 percentage points increase in export shares to high-income destinations


                                                 20
observed in our data between 1998 and 2000 implies, ceteris paribus, an increase in average wages
of 0.9 percentage points.
    Before testing the robustness of the results, we compare our IV estimates with OLS-FE
estimates. In column 6, the FE coefficient is positive, not statistically significant, and, more
importantly, much smaller than the IV coefficient. Note that unobserved firm attributes such
as inherent productivity or cost shocks would in principle generate the opposite bias.                           For
instance, positive productivity shocks are likely to simultaneously allow firms to expand high-income
operations and utilize more skills so that OLS-FE results would be biased upwards. However,
there are at least four mechanisms, some of them inherent to the Argentine case, that suggest a
downward bias in the OLS-FE regressions. First, OLS-FE estimates are attenuated when firms
are subject to policy or domestic regulatory shocks. For instance, firms that are more likely to
be “captured” by unions could be less likely to export, especially to high-income countries, while
at the same time they would be required to pay higher wages on average (see Galiani and Porto,
2010). Second, high-income exporters are likely to have ties with multinational corporations and
may base a larger fraction of their managerial operations abroad. Failure to control for this type
of firm outsourcing may drive the OLS-FE estimates downward. Third, a potentially important
unobserved factor is imports, because Bernard, Jensen, Redding and Schott (2007) show that
exporters are also importers and thus if high-income exporters are more likely to import goods to
resell domestically, their labor demand and wage payments may also be lower. Finally, OLS-FE
may be attenuated by stock liquidation during the 1999 domestic recession. The crisis affected all
firms, but high-income exporters may be in a better position to run inventories down by liquidating
stocks, originally planned for the domestic markets, in their export markets. Note that this is akin
to measurement error in the export shares to high income countries in 1999 and 2000 because these
shares increase due to inventory liquidation rather than to firm behavioral responses. This leads
to typical attenuation bias in the pooled OLS regressions, which is actually exacerbated in the
OLS-FE regressions. Our IV model is instead based on changes in exports shares caused by the
exogenous Brazilian devaluation and thus only pick up the change in HI that occurs because of
changes in firm behavior.20 In column 7, we re-estimate the OLS-FE model excluding data for year
1999. This regression is in fact exploiting a 2-year (2000-1998) variation in export destinations
   20
      To put the argument into a standard measurement error interpretation, the variable HI should measure
production decisions (i.e., skill utilization) based on the destination of the firms exports. The claim is that HI
correctly measures these decisions in normal periods, such as 1998. However, during the crisis of 1999 and 2000 firms
liquidate stocks and this creates variation in HI that is spurious.


                                                         21
and skill utilization and is, we argue, less subject to this type of measurement error. The OLS-FE
estimate is still biased down, but it is larger, positive, and statistically significant, a finding that
provides some support to the presence of attenuation bias.
   As an additional robustness check, we run all the previous specifications using the alternative
instrument for HI, equation (9) instead of (8). That is, the instrument is the interaction of the
initial shares of exports to Brazil with the Brazilian exchange rate. Results are reported in Table 6.
As before, panel A shows the IV estimates of δ1 and δ2 , and panels B1 and B2 show the first-stage
results for HI and EXP , respectively. All findings remain unchanged. The ratio of exports to
sales (EXP ) is never significant and the ratio of exports to high-income markets on total exports
(HI) is always significant. The estimated coefficients are also very similar. For instance, in our
preferred specification with controls for log sales (column 5), our estimate of δ2 is 0.272 and it was
0.260 in Table 5. In the first-stage results in panels B1 and B2, the instruments show the expected
signs, are jointly significant, and there is no risk of weak instrumentation.
   Before discussing our interpretation of these findings, Table 7 reports the results from models
where skill utilization is measured with the share of non-production workers on total employment.
In panel A, we use the instrument for HI built with year dummies (equation (8)); in panel B, we
replace year dummies with exchange rates (equation (9)). In both cases, the instrument for EXP
is given by (10). Our results suggest that, as before, the ratio of exports to sales does not seem
to have an effect on the composition of skills at the firm level, whereas exporting to high-income
countries does matter. In our preferred specification, column 5, we find that a firm exporting to
high-income destinations at the average share of 0.30 utilizes 2.37 percentage points more skilled
workers than non-high-income exporters.
   It is important to note that the changes in skill utilization that occur as firms change export
destinations do not appear to be the result of a spurious shrinking of the unskilled labor force
(Galiani and Hopenhayn, 2003). To verify this, we estimated separate IV regressions using the
log of skilled and unskilled labor employment as dependent variables. The results (available in the
online appendix) reveal positive impacts on skilled employment and negative impacts on unskilled
employment (though both impacts are relatively imprecisely estimated). This means that firms
that switched to high-income destinations due to the Brazilian devaluation simultaneously increased
absolute employment of skilled workers and reduced employment of unskilled workers. Second, in
reduced form regressions, we find that firms more exposed to Brazil in 1998 actually increased skill


                                                  22
employment but did not modify unskilled employment, and this is consistent with the behavioral
responses highlighted in this paper. Taken together, these results allow us to rule out a scenario
where firms that exported more to Brazil in 1998 were the ones to downsize unskilled workers
disproportionately because of the recession (thus paying higher wages and employing a higher
share of non-production workers).
   Turning to the interpretation of our findings, the reason why exporting to high-income countries
(HI) is significant, while exporting (EXP ) per se is not, is the following. If the domestic market
in Argentina is similar to export markets in low- and middle-income economies (including any
fixed costs), then the nature of domestic firms and of low-income exporters, in terms of their
attributes a and b, will be similar and, consequently, differences in skill utilization will be small.
In contrast, exporting to high-income countries does need quality upgrades and required-services,
which implies a significantly higher utilization of skills. A potential concern with this conclusion
is that we are exploiting the negative shock created by the Brazilian devaluation, rather than a
permanent expansion in export opportunities. However, evidence from the international finance
literature has consistently reported persistent exchange rate shocks, and this suggests that the
Brazilian devaluation can actually be seen as a permanent or persistent shock (Rogoff, 1996).
   The finding that export destinations, especially exports to high-income countries, matter has
found recent support in the related literature. Using transaction-level data for Portugal, Bastos and
Silva (2010) document higher unit values in shipments to richer nations. Manova and Zhang (2011)
also find that Chinese firms set higher prices in richer and more distant markets (see also Martin,
2010). In turn, Görg, Halpern and Muraközy (2010) use Hungarian firm-product-destination data
to establish a positive correlation between unit values and the per capita GDP of the export
destination. In our data, we only have information on export volumes, not on unit values. However,
the aggregate trade data for Argentina is consistent with these observations. In particular, in 2000,
the unit values of exports to high-income countries were 4 percent higher than the unit values of
exports to low-income countries.


3.5   A Validation Exercise

In this section, we perform a validation exercise where we explore results under the more stringent
definition of “High-Income” destinations, which includes only High-Income OECD and High-Income
non-OECD countries (Definition II, see section 3 and the online appendix). Table 8 reports IV


                                                 23
results using both log average wages (Panel A) and the share of non-production workers (Panel
B) as our measures of skill utilization. To simplify the exposition, we only report IV estimates
from regressions models that include industry-year effects and initial conditions, and that use
the more non-parametric set of instruments (I HI1 , the share of Brazil in exports in 1998 times
year effects, and I EXP , the weighted average exchange rate, defined in equations (8) and (10),
respectively). In Table 8, we confirm our conclusion that exporting per se does not really matter
but that exporting to high-income countries does. In fact, we find that under the more stringent
definition of high-income destinations the coefficients are close to three times larger than under
Definition I. For instance, in the model of wages controlling for log sales, the coefficient on HI is
0.781 instead of 0.260. At the average share of exports to High-Income II, 8.5 percent, the results
imply that high-income exporters pay 6.6 percent higher wages. This result is consistent with our
hypothesis since we expect larger differences in α and τ , and thus in skill utilization, the higher
the income of the high-income destination group. Our conclusions are robust to results (reported
in the online appendix) using the alternative set of instruments given by (9), the share of Brazil in
exports in 1998 times the Brazilian exchange rate, and (10).


3.6   Additional Robustness Tests

Table 9 reports results from various robustness tests.         In all these regressions, we include
industry-year effects and the two sets of controls for initial conditions. In panel A, the dependent
variable is log wages; in panel B, it is the share of non-production workers. In the first test, we
replace our measure of HI by the ratio of rich-countries exports to total sales (in place of the
share of exports to rich countries in total exports). In column 1, HI is positive and significant for
both log wages and the share of non-production workers. The coefficients are also larger, which is
consistent with the fact that the share of exports to Brazil on total exports is much higher than
the share of exports to Brazil on total sales (with averages of 30 and 4 percent, respectively). We
still do not find any impact of the ratio of exports to total sales.
   Second, although our test of relative skill utilization across destinations operates via
compositional changes within firms (that is, changes in the export participation weights of the
different Sjc in equation (6)), the impact should in principle be stronger for firms that actually
increased exports to high-income destinations (in absolute value) than for firms that only adjusted
exports to Brazil. We explore this in columns 2 and 3 of Table 9. For firms that increased exports to


                                                  24
high-income countries between 1998 and 2000, the estimated coefficient of HI is 0.430 (column 2),
whereas the estimate is 0.319 for the rest of the sample (column 3). Both estimates are statistically
significant. The point estimates are much larger for firms that expanded rich-country exports, both
for log wages and for the share of non-production workers. This difference, although not significant,
points in the expected direction. These results are reassuring.
    Finally, we explore results on export intensity and export status to assess whether regressions
based on export intensity (or status) actually confound the role of exports and exports to
high-income countries. In column 4, we report estimates from an IV model that includes EXP
but omits HI. In this case, a higher ratio of exports over sales is positively associated with skill
utilization and the coefficient (0.208) is in fact twice as large as that in column 5 of Table 5 (0.101),
with comparable standard errors. The estimates are not statistically significant, however, and this
is mainly because the covariance between EXP and HI is not high enough to overturn the lack
of explanatory power of EXP itself. In column 5, we replace the export intensity EXP variable
with an export dummy (using the same instruments). Exporting positively affects skill utilization
but, once again, the estimates are not statistically significant. Finally, in column 6 we include
an exporter dummy together with a high-income exporter dummy (instrumenting both with our
standard set of instruments). The results are consistent with the conclusion that while exporters
to high-income countries do hire more skills, exporters to other destination do not.


4     Channels

In this section, we set out to uncover some of the channels behind our “export destinations matter”
result. We want to illustrate the mechanisms by which Argentine firms that became more oriented
towards high-income destinations utilized more skills.


4.1   Skill Upgrading Within Labor Categories

We begin with a simple extension of our baseline regression model. We re-estimate the wage
specification with the addition of the share of non-production workers as a regressor to test whether
HI remains statistically significant. We include, as before, both HI and EXP as explanatory
variables, and we instrument them with I HI1 and I EXP . Results are reported in Table 10 (similar
results are obtained when we use I HI2 , in place of I HI1 , and I EXP as instruments). We find that



                                                   25
export intensity, EXP , is never significant, while HI, exports to high-income countries, always is.
As expected, the share of non-production workers is positively associated with the average firm
wage because on average non-production workers are more skilled than production workers. In
addition, the coefficient of HI is smaller than in all previous regressions. Taken together, these
results indicate that part of the impact of HI on average wages effectively works through increases
in the share of non-production workers but that there are also other channels playing a role.
       One plausible mechanism is skill upgrading within labor categories. The average wage paid
by the firm is a weighted average of the wages paid to production and non-production workers.
Our findings so far revealed that firms exporting to high-income countries pay higher average
wages, hire a higher share of non-production workers, and pay higher average wages conditional
on the non-production workers shares. This last result is consistent with a scenario where firms
engage in skill upgrading within skill categories and possibly utilize better (that is, more skilled)
non-production and production workers (in at least one of the two categories). To further clarify
this idea, assume that, within the non-production worker category, there are semiskilled and skilled
workers and that skilled wages are higher than semiskilled wages. Our finding of higher shares of
non-production workers associated with high-income exports can be the result of both more skilled
or semiskilled workers, but if the mechanism operates via more skilled workers, then average wages
will be even higher. This channel is consistent with the within-category skill upgrading uncovered
by Verhoogen (2008).21


4.2      Quality Valuation and Required Services

In our theory, we discussed a quality upgrading and a required services mechanism. In what follows,
we attempt to tell them apart. First, note that the quality mechanism should be stronger in sectors
with higher scope for quality/services upgrades. To test this, we estimate our IV regressions after
splitting the sample according to the variance of the unit values in exports at the industry level (a
measure of the degree of product vertical differentiation in the sector). Unit values were calculated
using industry-level bilateral trade data from COMTRADE. First, we matched the COMTRADE
trade data to the industrial classification system from the firm survey, the ISIC Revision 2 at the 3
digit level. Second, for each 3-digit industry, we computed the variance in export unit values from
all pairwise combinations of countries of origin and destination that report to COMTRADE, after
  21
     Note that, as discussed in the theoretical model, we cannot rule out other possible mechanisms like profit-sharing
(fair wages), labor turnover, or scale economies.


                                                          26
trimming outliers. Finally, we classified industries as “High Variance,” if the variance of their unit
values is above the 75th percentile, or as “Low Variance” otherwise.
       Results are displayed in columns 1 and 2 of Table 11. We report the estimates of the IV models
that use the more non-parametric instruments (year dummies times initial shares (equation 8)
and the average exchange rate (equation 10)) and that control for industry-year effects and firm
initial conditions. The results are however robust to all other specifications presented above (see
online appendix). In panel A, we use log average wages as measures of skill utilization. We find
that exporters to high-income countries pay higher wages in industries with both high and low
scope for vertical differentiation. Furthermore, ceteris paribus, industries with a higher scope for
differentiation pay higher wages than industries with lower differentiation scope (the coefficient of
HI is 0.344 and highly significant in column 1, while it is 0.188 and marginally significant in column
2). In panel B, we use instead the share of non-production workers. In this case, the impact of HI
is positive in both high- and low-variance sectors, but the estimates are imprecise. Similar results
are obtained when using Khandelwal’s (2010) quality ladder length.22 The fact that high-income
exporters pay higher wages in sectors with high scope for quality differentiation is consistent with
Verhoogen’s quality valuation mechanism.
       A potentially important confounding factor for the quality valuation theory is that, for
Argentina, high-income destinations such as the U.S. and the E.U. are also farther away. In
consequence, exporting to those markets incurs higher transport costs, and this increases the scope
for a shipping-the-good-apples-out argument, as in Hummels and Skiba (2004) and Görg, Halpern
and Muraközy (2010). As argued in section 2, higher (non-proportional) transport costs can make
high-priced exported goods (due to, for example, quality) relatively cheaper in high-income markets
than in neighboring markets. If so, Argentine firms will disproportionately ship higher quality
products to higher-income destinations. Furthermore, if the production of quality requires skills,
our finding of a positive impact of high-income exports on skill utilization can be due to the
shipping-the-good-apples-out argument rather than to the quality valuation argument. Note that
this interpretation still requires a quality dimension (the good apples are higher quality goods),
but the key difference is that export destinations do not differ in terms of how they value quality.
Rather, the mechanism works via transport costs.
  22
    Khandelwal (2010) calculates an index based on the estimation of demand equations that incorporate a valuation
for quality. We defined sectors with “long” quality ladders if his index is above the mean, and with “short” ladders
in the opposite case. A full set of results can be found in our online Appendix.



                                                        27
    We explore this distinction as follows. We use U.S. customs data (from the USITC website) to
construct measures of transport costs at the 3-digit ISIC codes. We use trade with Canada only in
order to keep the export destination constant. Then, we split the sample into those industries with
relatively high unitary transport costs and those with relatively low transport costs. For the cutoff,
we use the 75th percentile of the 3-digit average U.S. transport costs (though results are robust to
other cutoffs, such as the median or the 60th percentile). We expect the “good apples” argument to
be stronger in the high transport costs industries. Results are reported in columns 3 (high transport
costs) and 4 (low transport costs) of Table 11. For the case of log wages (Panel A), we find that
exporting to high-income destinations raises skill utilization in both high and low transport costs
industries. We also find that the estimated coefficient is larger in high transport costs industries
(0.339) than in low transport cost industries (0.200), but they are not statistically different. In
the case of the share of non-production workers (Panel B), we find instead a stronger effect of HI
on skill utilization in low transport cost industries. Taken together, these results suggest that our
results do not appear to be driven by a transport-cost mechanism and thus reinforce the support
for the quality valuation argument.
    In columns 5 and 6 of Table 11, we further elaborate on this test with regressions only
for industries with larger scope for quality differentiation (as previously defined). Within these
industries, we find strong impacts of HI for both high and low transport costs industries for
the case of log wages. The estimated coefficients are larger than in our previous regressions and
statistically significant. While we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal, it is noteworthy
that the estimated coefficient is larger in low than in high transport costs industries (0.476 in
column 7 and 0.571 in column 8). This result goes against the transport cost mechanism, thus
providing additional support to the quality valuation hypothesis. Note, however, that sample sizes
are reduced significantly and thus the results become less robust. For instance, in panel B, we
find positive impacts of HI on the share of non-production workers, but these estimates are never
statistically significant.
    Another experiment that can shed light on the mechanisms is to exploit language differences
across destinations. A major rich-country destination for Argentina is the U.S., which has greater
linguistic distance than most of its neighbors in Latin America.         In consequence, exporting
to high-income destinations may matter just because of the skills associated with language
requirements rather than because of the quality valuation—an argument close to our modified


                                                 28
Matsuyama “required services” hypothesis. To explore this, we split the high-income countries
into those countries with low “language distance” (that is, countries where the main language is
Spanish, Portuguese or Italian) and those countries with high language distance (all others). The
low language distance countries are thus Spain, Portugal and Italy, while the high language distance
group includes the U.S., Great Britain, Germany, and so on. Then, we run our IV regression models
on the sample of firms that specialize in low language distance destinations (defined as firms that sell
more than 75 percent of their high-income exports to these destinations) and those that specialize
in high language distance countries.23 Results are in columns 1 and 2 of Table 12 (using the same
general specification from Table 11). Our typical finding that HI matters, while EXP does not,
survives for firms exporting to high language-distance countries (column 1). Instead, we find that
neither EXP nor HI are statistically significant explanatory variables for firms that specialize in
low language distance destinations (column 2). These results support the modified Matsuyama
story. Arguably, however, it is plausible that the valuation of quality in the U.S. is higher than the
valuation of quality in Spain or Portugal.
       An additional related test is to investigate whether the impacts of HI and EXP on skill
utilization change when we directly control for language and cultural distance, or proximity, in the
baseline regressions (from Table 5). We build a measure of linguistic proximity with the share of
a firm’s exports to countries that speak Spanish, Portuguese or Italian, but including all countries
instead of only high-income countries. We measure cultural proximity with the share of a firms’
exports destined to all other countries in South America (which are arguably culturally close to
Argentina). Results are in columns 3 and 4 of Table 12. In both cases, we find that exporters
to high-income destinations employ higher skills (while exporting per se does not lead to higher
skill intensity) even after controlling for language or cultural proximity. Furthermore, the point
estimates in panels A and B are similar to those from the baseline models. These results strongly
support the quality upgrading mechanism. Also, note that the coefficients for language/cultural
proximity, which are negative and statistically significant, indicate that exports to “low” distance
countries are correlated with lower skill utilization, a result that is consistent with the required
services mechanism.24
  23
     Results are robust to the cutoff (for example, 75 or 80 percent) and to adding France as a language (and culture)
close destination.
  24
     We should note, however, that to fully separate both forces in this regression would require the use of a compelling
instrument for the firms’ decision to export to countries with language differences, an instrument that we do not have.

5    Conclusions

In this paper, we elaborated upon a theory linking export destinations and skill utilization in
developing countries. We provided a unified theoretical framework to study the behavior of firms
that export to high-income countries in terms of the utilization of skilled labor. In our framework,
exporters to high-income destinations hire more skilled workers for two reasons.          First, since
valuation for quality is higher in high-income countries, high-income exporters engage in quality
upgrades, which are skill-intensive. Second, there are required services associated with exporting
to high-income countries, and these activities are also intensive in skills. Our model introduces
multi-dimensional firm heterogeneity in order to explain both the decision to export as well as the
decision to export to high-income countries. This heterogeneity is due to differences in the efficiency
in the use of skilled and unskilled labor across firms.
    Empirical evidence comes from a panel of Argentine manufacturing firms and matched customs
information on exports and export destinations at the firm level. The available data cover the
1998-2000 period and thus span the Brazilian devaluation of 1999, which provides a useful source
of identification of exogenous changes in exports and in export destinations to explore whether
firms choose the skill composition of their workforce based on the destination of their exports.
    The empirical models consistently suggest that exporting to high-income countries induces firms
to hire more skilled workers, but exporting per se does not. The reason is that the domestic markets
in Argentina are similar to export markets in middle-income countries and thus it is only possible to
observe differences in firm’s outcomes for firms specializing in exporting to high-income countries.
We find strong support for the quality valuation channel, and we cannot rule out the required
services argument.
    Our contribution lies in identifying, empirically and theoretically, mechanisms that explain how
the “act of exporting” to different destinations affects the behavior of firms. Our results clarify the
nature of this behavior and, in turn, this may prove useful in current research efforts to understand
factors driving firm choices of exporting and of exporting to different markets.
