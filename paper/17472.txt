                                              ABSTRACT

Several recent laboratory experiments have shown that the use of explicit incentives—such as conditional
rewards and punishment—entail considerable “hidden” costs. The costs are hidden in the sense thatthey
escape our attention if our reasoning is based on the assumption that people are exclusively self-interested.
This study represents a first attempt to explore whether, and to what extent, such considerations affect
equilibrium outcomes in the field. Using data gathered from nearly 3000 households, we find little
support for the negative consequences of control in naturally-occurring labor markets. In fact, even
though we find evidence that workers are reciprocal, we find that worker effort is maximized when
we use conditional—not unconditional—rewards to incent workers.

I. Introduction
        Behavioral economics has matured to the point where theorists are leveraging
psychological insights to improve their models and government officials are using behavioral
results to fine tune policy. One particular result that has attracted increasing attention is the
interaction of psychological and economic incentives (see, e.g., Frey, 1997; Gneezy and
Rustichini, 2000a, 2000b; Benabou and Tirole, 2003; Sliwka, 2007). For example, in a novel set
of experiments, Gneezy and Rustichini (2000a, 2000b) show that extrinsic incentives influence
effort in an unexpected manner—small monetary incentives can crowd out intrinsic motivation,
resulting in a perverse relationship between incentives and effort.1
        Complementing such insights is the line of work in the spirit of Fehr and Rockenbach
(2003) and Fehr and List (2004), who find that the use of control and explicit incentives entail
“hidden” costs: such control causes the principal’s actions to backfire, leading to lower profits.
As this literature points out, such effects are first order and should be a concern for economists
interested in studying labor markets. Yet, whether, and to what extent, such hidden costs
manifest themselves outside the confines of the laboratory remains an important open empirical
question (Levitt and List, 2007). Difficulties arise, however, in finding natural instances where
agents are randomly allocated to appropriate treatment groups to permit a clean test of the
relevant hypotheses. Because of these challenges, the literature has to date been unable to
provide tests of the major hypotheses of ‘control’ in the field.
        In this study, we make a first step in this direction. We present an empirical approach
that is composed of a set of field treatments that parallel the important economic features of the
environments in Fehr and Rockenbach (2003), Fehr and List (2004), and the literature that has
followed. To do so, we examine solicitor (worker) effort in a door-to-door capital campaign for
the Center for Natural Hazards Research at East Carolina University. Importantly, we use
natural incentives to exogenously change the action space of solicitors randomly assigned to one
of three treatment groups.2 In the baseline treatment, workers are provided a pre-announced,
fixed hourly wage of $10. In a second treatment, workers are provided an unconditional gift – a
1
  Such results have also been reported in the psychology literature—see Deci (1971) and Lepper et al. (1973) for
early studies. A more recent overview can be found in Tang and Hall (1995). The skeptical reader will enjoy
Cameron and Pierce (1994) and Eisenberger and Cameron (1996), who present a dissenting view of the empirical
evidence concerning intrinsic and extrinsic incentives.
2
  In this regard, our study shares similarity with Landry et al. (2011) who explore the effect of conditional and
unconditional gifts on the generosity of potential donors and attendant public good provision in a series of
temporally-linked field experiments.
copy of Freakonomics – in addition to the pre-announced hourly wage. In our final treatment,
the most opportunistic actions are ruled out by making the gift conditional – solicitors must raise
at least $10 per hour to obtain the copy of Freakonomics. If trust is a characteristic rewarded by
workers, then the control evoked in the final treatment might crowd out effort compared to the
second treatment – particularly amongst those who would have raised more than $10 if the gift
were provided unconditionally.
         Several insights emerge from our field experiment. First, unconditional gifts have the
ability to enhance worker productivity. Solicitors in our unconditional gift treatment were
approximately 56 percent more likely to elicit a contribution than counterparts in the baseline.
Similarly, solicitors in this treatment raised approximately 10.1 to 63.4 percent more per hour
than those in our baseline treatment. These results are consonant with the existing literature (see,
e.g., Gneezy and List, 2006; Bellemare and Shearer, 2009; Cohn et al., 2009; Kube et al., 2010)
and suggest that reciprocal motives are an important determinant of worker behavior.
         Second, conditionality proves a profit enhancing strategy. Participation rates and dollars
raised per hour in our conditional gift treatment are higher than those observed in both the
baseline and unconditional gift treatments. For example, solicitors in our conditional gift
treatment elicit contributions from nearly 26 percent of all households approached – a rate of
giving that is approximately 68 percent (8 percent) greater than that observed in our baseline
(unconditional gift) treatment. Similarly, solicitors in our conditional gift treatment raise
approximately 83 percent more per hour than counterparts receiving an unconditional gift and
more than double that observed in our baseline group.
         Finally, solicitors in the conditional gift treatment are approximately two and half to three
times more likely to raise at least $10 per hour – the required threshold for receiving the gift –
than are counterparts in our unconditional gift and baseline treatments respectively. As this
threshold corresponds with the level of productivity necessary to cover labor costs, conditionality
therefore has a positive effect on net revenues.3 Taken jointly, these data are at odds with
models suggesting that agents respond adversely to control. Accordingly, our data suggest that
hidden cost relationships identified in prior laboratory studies (see, e.g., Fehr and List, 2004) do
not arise in our field setting.


3
 This result is consonant with Landry et al. (2011) who find that conditionality is an effective technology to screen
donors and therefore provides a superior fund-raising mechanism in both the short- and long-run.
II. A Model of Gifts and the “Hidden Costs” of Control
          To fix ideas we present a simple, illustrative model of worker behavior under both
conditional and unconditional gifts. In our model, the worker’s effort decision is governed by
three key parameters: a cost of effort, a kindness parameter measuring the worker’s response to
gifts from the firm, and a conditionality factor that is designed to capture the “hidden costs”
relationship. Our approach to modeling worker utility as a function of kindness between the firm
and the worker is in the spirit of Rabin (1993) and Bellemare and Shearer (2009).
          We follow Bellemare and Shearer (2009) and assume workers have utility that is
additively separable over earnings, effort, and gifts:


                                  U(E, μG) = W(E) – C(E) + βYμG


where W(E) represents monetary earnings, C(E) is the worker’s cost of effort function, and
βYμG represents a kindness function that captures how workers respond to gifts from the firm.
Intuitively, the kindness function specifies that the worker receives utility from reciprocating
gifts and returning value to the firm (in terms of output Y). Importantly, we assume that C(·) is
twice differentiable and strictly increasing in E and that both W(·) and Y(·) are non-decreasing in
effort.
          To capture the “hidden costs” relationship noted in the prior literature, we assume that
feelings of reciprocity depend both on the consumption value of the gift, G, and its perceived
generosity – represented by a parameter           ,    . Throughout, we assume that   1 for a gift
provided unconditionally and that  is reduced if receipt of the gift is conditioned on specific
requirements.
          As a benchmark, consider the optimal effort choice of an agent with neoclassical
preferences – i.e., those for whom μ = 0. For such an agent, the optimal effort choice is given by
the solution to the following first-order condition:


                                                          0


Denote the solution to this problem as ENC.
       Consider now the optimal solution for an agent with reciprocal preferences receiving an
unconditional gift of value G. For such an agent, the optimal effort choice is given by the
solution to the following first-order condition:


                                                              0


Denote the solution to this problem as EUG. Assuming that output is strictly increasing in effort,
we thus have that EUG > ENC – i.e., providing a worker with reciprocal preferences an
unconditional gift leads to higher effort. Intuitively, the inclusion of the kindness function
introduces an added benefit of effort. Evaluated at ENC, we thus have that the marginal benefit of
effort exceeds the marginal cost and the agent will elect to increase effort.
       Consider now the case where the situation where receipt of the gift is conditioned on a
specific requirement. For an agent with reciprocal preferences, the optimal effort choice is given
by the solution to the following:


                                                               0


Denote the solution to this problem as ECG. Given our assumption that                      1, we thus
           CG     UG
have that E     <E     – i.e., the use of conditional gifts serves to crowd out effort. Moreover, if
one allows μ to take on negative values the optimal effort level would be less than that predicted
by the neoclassical model which assumes away reciprocal preferences. Such crowding captures
the “hidden costs” relationship that has been documented in prior laboratory studies.
III. Experimental Design
       Our natural field experiment attempted to follow the spirit of the laboratory experiments
while staying true to the naturalness of the environment. In this way, we conducted our
experiment as part of a door-to-door fundraising drive to support the Center for Natural Hazards
Research at East Carolina University (ECU). The Center for Natural Hazards Research was
authorized to begin operations in the fall of 2004. The Hazard Center was founded in respond to
the widespread devastation in eastern North Carolina caused by hurricanes Dennis and Floyd and
is designed to provide support and coordination for research on natural hazard risks.
         In each treatment, households in predetermined neighborhood blocks in Pitt County,
North Carolina were approached by a paid solicitor and asked if they would like to make a
contribution to support the Hazard Center using a simple ask strategy (or voluntary contribution
mechanism). Households that answered the door were provided an informational brochure
detailing the activities of the Hazard Center and read a fixed script that outlined the reason for
the solicitor’s visit. The script included a brief introduction that informed the resident of the
purpose of their visit and a short summary of the nonprofit organization.4 Potential donors were
informed that all proceeds raised in the fundraising campaign would be used to fund research
that benefits Pitt County and the surrounding area.
         As Table 1 reveals, we employed a within-solicitor design using a total of fifty-five
unique solicitors randomized into three treatment cells. Our baseline, No Gift, treatment
provided solicitors a flat wage of $10 per hour for working a two to three hour shift. Of the fifty-
five solicitors employed, twelve were initially assigned to this treatment. Solicitors in our
Unconditional Gift treatment received a copy of the book Freakonomics as a gift from the
Hazard Center in addition to the promised $10 per hour flat wage. Nineteen solicitors were
initially assigned this treatment. Of these, seven elected to work a second (or third) shift for a
flat wage of $10 per hour.
         Solicitors in our Conditional Gift treatment were informed that they would receive, in
addition to the promised $10 per hour flat wage, a copy of Freakonomics as a gift from the
Hazard Center should they raise at least $10 per hour. Twenty-four solicitors were initially
assigned to the Conditional Gift treatment. Of these, five worked a second (or third) shift for the
flat $10 per hour wage. Before proceeding, it is important to note that in both gift treatments,
solicitors did not learn that they would receive a copy of Freakonomics until arriving for work.
         Each solicitor’s experience followed four steps: (1) consideration of an invitation to work
as a paid volunteer for the research center, (2) an in-person interview, (3) a training session, and
(4) participation as a solicitor in the door-to-door campaign. All solicitors were recruited from
the student body at ECU via flyers posted around campus, announcements on a university
electronic bulletin board, and direct appeals to students during undergraduate courses. Potential
solicitors were informed that they would be paid $10 per hour during training and employment

 The design discussion follows Landry et al. (2006) since recruitment and training of the solicitors was similar. A
copy of the script and informational brochure are provided in the Appendix.
and would work a single shift lasting three to four hours. Interested students were instructed to
contact the Economics Department to schedule an interview.
         Initial ten-minute interviews were conducted in private offices of the Economics
Department faculty. Upon arrival to the interview, students completed an application form and a
short survey questionnaire. Upon concluding the interview, every applicant was offered
employment as a solicitor. Once hired, all solicitors attended a one-hour training session
conducted by the same researcher. The training sessions provided solicitors with background
information on the Hazard Center and an opportunity to practice the script in front of both the
trainer and other personnel in the Economics Department.
         Solicitors worked in three to four hour shifts starting between 9 and 10am on Saturday
morning, 1 and 2pm on both Saturday and Sunday afternoon, and at 5pm on both Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings.5 To control for any temporal differences in rates of giving, we were
careful to run multiple treatments in all weekend shifts.
         A few important design issues should be discussed before proceeding to the results
summary. First, we wanted to maximize the expected effect of the unconditional gift on worker
effort and, hence, associated scope for the hidden cost relationship to arise. As noted in Gneezy
and List (2006), gift-exchange has the greatest impact on solicitor effort during the first few
hours of work, thus we hired workers for 3 to 4 hours of work.6
         Second, in carrying out our door-to-door campaign we wished to solicit donors in a way
that matched how fund-raisers carry out the task in the field. Solicitors were therefore instructed
to distribute an information brochure after introducing themselves to potential donors. This
provided legitimacy to the fundraising drive, as brochures are a common tool in the industry.
Third, in order to provide a formal, standardized appearance, solicitors were given an attractive
ECU t-shirt and were instructed to wear khaki pants (or shorts) during their door-to-door
solicitations. Fourth, each solicitor wore an identification badge that included his or her picture,
name, and city solicitation permit number. Fifth, we randomly allocated solicitors across
neighborhoods.
5
  To minimize the number of drivers (monitors) required to shuttle solicitors between ECU and the neighborhoods in
which they were working, the start of weekend shifts were staggered by 30 minutes. Further, to prevent potential
contagion, solicitors riding in a particular shuttle met drivers at different locations on campus and were assigned the
same treatment.
6
  Solicitors in Gneezy and List (2006) participated in the Hazard Center’s initial door-to-door fund-raising campaign
which took place during the fall of 2004 and worked at least eight-hours. While gift-exchange has a significant
impact on worker effort in the three-hour block before lunch, the impact decays rapidly over time.
        Finally, to summarize, we have gathered a rich set of household level control variables.
Solicitors were provided with a record sheet that included columns to record the race, gender,
and approximate age of potential donors, along with their contribution level. The trainer stressed
the importance of recording the contribution (or non-contribution) data immediately following
the solicitation “sales pitch”.
III. Experimental Results
        Table 1 presents summary statistics including information on the success of solicitors
across treatments. For example, Table 1 indicates that solicitors in the baseline no-gift treatment
approached a total of 1022 households and spoke with 431 of them. Of those, approximately
13.7 percent (or 59 of 431) contributed to the Hazard Center. In total, solicitors raised $1998.84
(or approximately $1.69 per solicitation) for the Hazard Center: $477.46 ($1.11 per solicitation)
in the no-gift treatment, $456 (or $1.48 per solicitation) in the unconditional gift treatment, and
$1065.38 (or $2.40 per solicitation) in the conditional gift treatment.
        A quick summary of the empirical results highlight that there are signs of significant gift
exchange in the data: solicitors in the unconditional gift treatment are 56 percent more likely to
elicit contributions than counterparts from the control group. However, the hidden cost
relationship identified in prior laboratory studies does not arise in our setting. Participation rates
and dollars raised per hour in our conditional gift treatment are higher than those observed in
both the baseline and unconditional gift treatments. Moreover, solicitors in this treatment are
significantly more likely to elicit contributions in excess of $10 per hour and thereby generate
positive net revenues for the Hazard Center. Hence, ‘control’ as defined in the literature
provides a means to both stimulate worker productivity and enhance the profitability of fund-
raising efforts. Evidence for these empirical findings are described more fully below.
Unconditional Gifts and Reciprocity
        Table 1 provides a summary of average donation rates and average contributions per hour
across treatments. As noted in the table, solicitors in our unconditional gift treatment are more
likely to obtain a contribution than counterparts in the no-gift treatment. For example, as shown
in Figure 1, solicitors in the unconditional gift treatment elicit contributions from approximately
23.7 percent of all households that answer the door. In contrast, counterparts in our baseline, no-
gift, treatment are only able to elicit contributions from 15.2 percent of those answering the door.
A non-parametric Wilcoxon test indicates that this approximate 56 percent difference in
participation rates is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.7
         We observe a similar, albeit less pronounced, pattern when examining total contribution
levels. Solicitors in our unconditional gift treatment raise approximately 10 percent more per
hour ($8.61 versus $7.82) than counterparts in our baseline group. If we restrict the sample and
only consider outcomes from a solicitor’s first shift, the difference in dollars raised per hour
increases more than six-fold ($8.61 versus $5.27). Despite the magnitude of these differences,
non-parametric Wilcoxon tests suggest that they are not statistically significant at conventional
levels. Yet, the difference for the restricted sample is significant at the p < 0.10 if we use a
parametric t-test as an alternative to the Wilcoxon test.
         Interestingly, these differences are driven entirely by increased fund-raising success at
households who open the door rather than disparities in the number of households approached
per hour. In fact, households in our unconditional gift treatment approach approximately 8.1
percent fewer households per hour than counterparts in the no-gift treatment – a difference that is
significant at the p < 0.10 level. 8
         To complement these unconditional insights, we estimate a series of linear regression
models that explicitly control for unobservable differences across solicitors. Specifically, we
estimate regression models of donation rates and average dollars raised per hour for each
solicitor on dummy variables for our experimental treatments and other controls:


                                                Yi = Ziδ + Xiβ + εi


where Yi is the donation rate (average dollars raised per hour) for the ith solicitor, Z is a vector of
treatment group status indicators, and X is a vector of other covariates – including the proportion
of warm- and cold-list households approached by the ith solicitor. As noted in Landry et al.
(2010), warm-list (cold-list) households are significantly more (less) likely to contribute than the

7
  The unit of observation for all of these Wilcoxon tests is a solicitor-specific measure. Tests for the full sample are
therefore based on 28 observations in the no-gift treatment, 24 observations in the conditional gift treatment, and 19
observations in the unconditional gift treatment. Similar results are obtained if we used the household as the unit of
observation.
8
  It is important to note, however, that differences in the number of households approached per hour is a poor proxy
for effort. Solicitations to households that do not contribute are typically very quick compared to visits that yield
contributions. Households that make contributions require more time as the solicitor has to wait for the household to
write a check and must complete a receipt to give to the donors.
randomly approached individual. Although the proportion of such households approached
should be orthogonal to treatment, we include controls for these factors to account slight
imbalances across neighborhood blocks. To account for unobservable heterogeneity, we cluster
standard errors in the full sample on individual solicitors.
        Empirical estimates for the full sample are contained in Models A and C of Table 2. In
terms of donation rates, Model A provides evidence consistent with our non-parametric results:
solicitors in our unconditional gift treatment are approximately 60 percent more likely to elicit a
contribution than counterparts in the baseline group, with this difference being significant at the
p < 0.05 level. Yet, higher rates of giving in our unconditional gift treatment do not map into
higher average earnings. As noted in Model C, the approximate $1.79 difference in the average
dollars raised per hour across our unconditional gift and baseline treatments is not significant at
any meaningful level.
        Estimates for the restricted sample highlight similar data patterns. As noted in Model B,
solicitors in the unconditional gift treatment are more than twice as likely as counterparts in the
control to elicit a contribution – a difference that is significant at the p < 0.05 level. As noted in
Model D, however, the approximate $2.59 increase in dollars raised per hour is not significant at
meaningful levels. Taken jointly, these data suggest a first result:


Result 1: Reciprocal motives are an important driver of worker behavior. Workers who receive
an unconditional gift are more likely to elicit donations and raise more dollars per hour than
their non-gifted counterparts.


Importantly, Result 1 serves to reinforce conclusions from the laboratory and field experimental
literature, which finds that providing solicitors an unconditional gift leads to an approximate 72
percent increase in the dollars raised over the first three hours of work (see, e.g., Fehr,
Kirchsteiger, and Riedl, 1993; Fehr, Gachter, and Kirchsteiger, 1997; Fehr and Falk, 1999;
Hannan et al., 2002; Charness, 2004; and the field: Gneezy and List, 2006; Bellemare and
Shearer, 2009; Cohn et al., 2009; Kube et al., 2010).9



9
 Bellemare and Shearer (2009) double the daily wage for workers in a tree-planting firm and find an approximate
10 percent increase in the number of trees planted. Cohn et al. (2009) implement a wage increase during a
newspaper promotion and find that workers approach four to five percent more passers-by than counterparts in the
Conditional Gifts and the “Costs” of Control
         The third column of Table 1 summarizes donation rates and average dollars raised per
hour for solicitors in the conditional gift treatment. As noted in the table, solicitors in this
treatment are more likely to elicit a donation and raise more money per hour than worker
counterparts in either the baseline or unconditional gift treatment. For example, as shown in
Figure 1, solicitors in the conditional gift treatment are approximately 68.4 percent (8.01 percent)
more likely to elicit a contribution than are workers in our baseline (unconditional gift)
treatment. Using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test, the former difference is statistically significant
at the p < 0.05 level.
         Our data suggest similar differences for average dollars raised per hour: solicitors in the
conditional gift treatment raise more than twice the amount (approximately 83.4 percent more
than) earned by counterparts in the no-gift (unconditional gift) treatment. If we restrict the
sample and consider only outcomes from a solicitor’s first shift, this former difference doubles –
solicitors in the conditional gift treatment raise more than three times that raised by those in the
baseline group. Figure 2 illustrates these differences for both the full and restricted samples – all
of which are significant at the p < 0.05 level a non-parametric Wilcoxon test.
         To complement these unconditional non-parameteric results, we consider the regression
estimates contained in Table 2. In terms of donation rates, Model A provides evidence
consistent with the raw data – solicitors in the conditional gift treatment are approximately 67
percent (3.84 percent) more likely to elicit contributions than counterparts in our baseline
(unconditional gift) treatment. While this former difference is significant at the p < 0.05 level,
the latter is not significant at any meaningful level. Estimates for the restricted data sample in
Model B highlight similar data patterns. Solicitors in the conditional gift treatment are
approximately 140 percent more likely to elicit a donation than counterparts in the baseline
group – a difference that is also significant at the p < 0.05 level.
         Our data highlight similar differences for average dollars raised per hour. As noted in
Model C of Table 2, solicitors in the conditional gift treatment raise nearly $9.00 more per hour
than counterparts in the baseline and approximately 77.3 percent more than those receiving an
unconditional gift – differences that are significant at the p < 0.05 level. If, as in Model D, we


control group. Kube et al. (2010) find student workers receiving an unconditional gift – a plastic thermos bottle –
catalog 30 percent more library books than counterparts in the control group.
restrict the sample, the difference in average earnings per hour between the baseline and
conditional gift treatments increases.
       Taken jointly, these data suggest a second result:


Result 2: The hidden costs of control do not arise in our setting. Donation rates and dollars
raised per hour are greatest in the conditional gift treatment.
Result 2 is at odds with the existing evidence from the laboratory and opens up the possibility
that the hidden cost relationships may not generalize to field settings. For employers, this
finding is noteworthy as it calls into question whether agents respond adversely to control – a
premise from this line of work. Although data from our unconditional gift treatment suggest
reciprocal motives influence worker behavior, providing workers a conditional gift netted both
more donors and total contributions per dollar spent on labor.
       For fund-raising professionals, Result 2 is noteworthy as it suggests a fundamental
difference in the effect of incentivizing workers as opposed to potential donors. The gains to
donor-side incentives such as charitable lotteries, donor gifts, matching grants, and rebates
accrue largely along the extensive margin via increased participation rates (see, e.g., Landry et
al., 2006; Falk 2007; Karlan and List, 2007; Meier, 2007; Aplizar et al., 2008; Eckel and
Grossman, 2008; Landry et al., 2010). In contrast, our data suggest that linking worker
compensation to dollars raised generates gains along both the intensive and extensive margins.
The Likelihood of Exceeding the Target Threshold
       Falk and Kosfeld (2006) highlight an important channel through which control serves to
influence payoffs to the principal – agents pool at the minimum effort level. For example, in
their low-control treatment, over 50 percent of all agents provide the minimum effort level when
the principal elected to enact control. In contrast, median effort is approximately four times this
level when the principal elected not to enact control. As only 20 percent of the agents would
select effort levels below the minimum level in the absence of control, the net effect is a
reduction in earnings for the principal.
       Given this underlying data pattern, one might therefore intuit that crowding is most
pronounced for small incentives and associated levels of control. As such, one might question
whether the benefits from conditionality in our study only arise as our threshold is sufficiently
large. Yet, if this were the case, we would expect a non-trivial subset of agents in the conditional
gift treatment to pool at the $10 threshold.
       Importantly, however, we observe no such pooling in our data. Agents in our conditional
gift treatment are more likely to raise almost any amount above $10 per hour than counterparts in
either the baseline or unconditional gift treatment. As illustrated in Figure 3, the cumulative
distribution of dollars raised per hour for the conditional gift treatment lies everywhere to the
right of the corresponding distribution for the unconditional gift treatment. We observe similar
differences when comparing the distribution of dollars raised per hour across the conditional gift
and baseline treatments. The former lies to the right of the latter over all but the extreme right
tail of the support – i.e., contribution rates that exceed $30 per hour.
       Similarly, agents in the conditional gift treatment are significantly more likely to raise the
$10 per hour required to obtain the gift than counterparts in either the baseline or unconditional
gift treatment. For example, as illustrated in Figure 4, approximately 83.3 percent (20 of 24) of
all solicitors in our conditional gift treatment raise at least $10 per hour and thus receive a copy
of Freakonomics. This proportion is more than twice (three-times) that observed amongst
solicitors in our unconditional gift (baseline) treatment – differences that are significant at the p
< 0.05 level using a two sample test of proportions.
       To complement this summary of the raw data, we estimate a probit model that explicitly
controls for unobservable differences across solicitors. Specifically, we estimate whether a
solicitor raised enough per hour to receive the copy of Freakonomics on dummy variables for
our experimental treatments and other controls:


                                       $10      Ω                     $10


where Ti is the average contributions per hour for the ith solicitor, Ω is the standard normal
cumulative distribution, Z is a vector of treatment group status indicators, and X is a vector of
other covariates – including the proportion of warm- and cold-list households approached by the
ith solicitor. To account for unobservable heterogeneity, we cluster standard errors in the full
sample on individual solicitors.
       Empirical estimates are provided in Table 3 and provide evidence consistent with the raw
data summary. Using estimates from Model A, the predicted probability a solicitor in the
baseline (unconditional gift) treatment elicits contributions in excess of $10 per hour is
approximately 17.1 (36.8) percent.10 For solicitors in the conditional gift treatment, the
estimated 83.9 percent probability of eliciting contributions in excess of this amount is
approximately four-times (128 percent) greater than that observed in our baseline (unconditional
gift) treatment. Both of these differences are significant at the p < 0.05 level.
        We observe similar results if the sample is restricted to outcomes from a solicitor’s first
shift only. In this instance, however, the estimated six-fold difference in the probability of
eliciting more than $10 per hour across our baseline and unconditional gift treatments (4.6 versus
30.8 percent) obtains statistical significance at the p < 0.10 level. Moreover, the differences
between conditional and unconditional treatments and conditional and baseline treatments for the
restricted sample are large and statistically significant for p < 0.05.
        As workers in all three treatments were paid a fixed wage of $10 per hour, the Hazard
Center only earned positive net revenue on solicitors who raised at least this amount. Taken
jointly with the data summarized above, this suggests a third result:


Result 3: Controlling solicitors by providing a conditional gift, has a positive effect on net
revenue and is thus a profit enhancing strategy for the Hazard Center.


Net labor costs, the average solicitor in our conditional gift treatment raises approximately $5.79
per hour for the Hazard Center. In contrast, the Hazard Center loses an average of approximately
$2.18 per hour ($1.39 per hour) on solicitors in the baseline (unconditional gift) treatment. Thus,
in our setting, control provides a means to both stimulate worker productivity and enhance the
profitability of fund-raising efforts.
IV. Conclusions
        There is a growing body of laboratory evidence showing that the use of control and
explicit incentives entail “hidden” costs (see, e.g., Fehr and Rockenbach, 2003; Fehr and List,
2004; Falk and Kosfeld, 2006). Despite its profound implications, there is a dearth of
compelling evidence from naturally-occurring markets to support or refute this view. Finding
natural instances where agents are properly randomized into relevant treatment groups is


10
  The predicted probabilities are evaluated at the sample mean for the proportion of warm- and cold-list households
approached.
challenging, however. As such, determining the extent to which these laboratory results
generalize to real world setting remains unclear.
       We begin to resolve this uncertainty by exploring individual behavior in the labor market
for solicitors in a door-to-door fund-raising campaign. Our empirical approach is composed of a
set of field treatments that parallel the economic features of the environments in previous studies
examining the “hidden” costs of control: we use natural incentives to exogenously change the
solicitors’ action space. If trust is a characteristic rewarded by workers, then the control evoked
by restricting the solicitors’ action space should crowd out effort.
       Data from our natural field experiment suggest two main insights. First, unconditional
gifts enhance worker productivity. This result is consonant with a bulk of the existing literature
and suggests that reciprocal motives are an important determinant of worker behavior in this
setting. Second, conditionality is a profit enhancing wage structure for the Hazard Center.
Participation rates and dollars raised per hour in our conditional gift treatment are higher than
those observed in both the baseline and unconditional gift treatments. Accordingly, our data are
inconsistent with the notion that agents respond adversely to control, and suggest that the hidden
cost relationship does not arise in our setting.

Note: Cell entries are parameter estimates from a series of linear regression models examining two
different performance metrics for each solicitor – the percentage of HH’s that contributed to the Hazard
Center and total $’s raised per hour worked. Standard errors are in parentheses. We cluster standard
errors on individual solicitors. The restricted data includes only contributions collected during the initial
three hour solicitation shift worked.
