                                          ABSTRACT

Police use of force ‚Äì particularly lethal force ‚Äì is one of the most divisive issues of the twenty-
first century. To understand the nexus of race, criminal justice, and police brutality, academics
and journalists have begun to amass impressive datasets on Officer-Involved-Shootings (OIS). I
compare the data and methods of three investigative journalism articles and two publications in
the social sciences on a set of five rubrics and conclude that the stark differences between their
findings are due to differences in what qualifies for a valid research design and not underlying
differences in the datasets.

     In row (1), I calculate the likelihood as the ((Fraction of 15-34 black men killed by police/Fraction of 15-34 black men in population)/(Fraction of
     everyone else killed by police/Fraction of everyone else in population)). In row (2), I calculate the percentage of black civilians among unarmed
     men killed by police. In row (3), I calculate the percentage of unarmed civilians and black civilians in the sample. In row (4), I use the companion
     program to Ross (2015), available in R, to calculate the county-level risk ratios. To calculate this statistic, I collapse each OIS-level dataset to the
     county level (Post and Guardian) or the police department level (VICE and Fryer (forthcoming)). To collapse cities to the county level (Post and
     Guardian), I assign cities to the county that they fall the majority in. The VICE and Fryer (forthcoming) datasets provide the police department
     responsible for the OIS. I collapse these counts by police departments and assign each police department the population of the city or county that
     it has jurisdiction over. I take city and county populations by race from the 2011 ACS 5-year estimates. The Ross (2015) estimates may contain
     simulation error but are replicated using the exact program used in Ross (2015). In addition, the exact results are not reproducible because the
     program does not set a seed.
