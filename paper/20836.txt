Secular Stagnation: The Long View
Barry Eichengreen
NBER Working Paper No. 20836
January 2015
JEL No. E00,N1

                                           ABSTRACT

Four explanations for secular stagnation are distinguished: a rise in global saving, slow population
growth that makes investment less attractive, averse trends in technology and productivity growth,
and a decline in the relative price of investment goods. A long view from economic history is most
supportive of the last of these four views.

                                        Secular Stagnation: The Long View
                                                  Barry Eichengreen1

         What does history have to say about the dangers of secular stagnation? History doesn’t

actually “say” anything, but it points to observations, patterns, and discrepancies between past

predictions and outcomes that may be helpful for formulating answers to such questions.

         Historical investigation is complicated by competing definitions and hypotheses. Here I

define secular stagnation as a downward tendency of the real interest rate, reflecting an excess of

desired saving over desired investment, resulting in a persistent output gap and/or slow rate of

economic growth. I distinguish four tendencies that might explain such a phenomenon: a rise in

savings rates due to the emergence of emerging markets; a decline in investment rates due to

reflecting a dearth of attractive investment opportunities, a decline in the relative price of

investment goods, and a decline in the rate of population growth.

         Modern discussions of secular stagnation point to the decline in real interest rates since

1980. Thus, two Bank of Canada researchers writing in 2006 (Brigitte Desroches and Michael

Francis 2006) highlight the decline in long-term real interest rates in the G7 countries “over the

past 25 years.”2 IMF (2014) observes that “real interest rates worldwide have declined

substantially since the 1980s.” While there are hints that recent movements may, in part, reflect

mean reversion (Desroches and Francis write of how real interest rates have declined “to levels

not seen since the 1960s”), there is little consideration of the long-term record.3

  Desroches and Francis infer inflation expectations by estimating an autoregressive process based on the historical
behavior of inflation. The IMF estimates an autoregressive process using rolling windows and, alternatively, utilizes
survey data.
3
  Note however that Laubach and Williams (2003) extend the picture back to the 1960s.

                                                         1
        Figure 1 shows nominal and real interest rates for the United States over the last two

centuries: the yield on ten-year constant-maturity government bonds with and without

adjustment for realized consumer price inflation, where the adjustment involves subtracting a

seven-year moving average of CPI inflation (the current year and past six).4 For much of the 19th

century, when the U.S. was on the gold standard, the nominal interest rate may be more

informative, insofar as inflation was a random walk with expectation zero.5 The figure points to

an alternative interpretation, namely that the decline in real interest rates starting in the 1980s is

mean reversion after the exceptional period of high interest rates and inflation that preceded it.

        Turning to explanations, recent discussion highlighting the possibility of a rise in the

global savings rate emphasizes high savings rates in emerging-market economies. This was of

course the focus of Ben Bernanke’s (2005) “global savings glut” hypothesis and Alan

Greenspan’s (2005) “conundrum” of anomalously low long-term interest rates (another

incarnation of the same phenomenon considered here). Compared to the advanced economies,

emerging markets are financially underdeveloped, forcing households to substitute brute-force

accumulation for portfolio diversification. The public sector provides little in the way of a social

safety net, encouraging precautionary saving for contingencies and old age. Central banks and

governments in emerging markets rely on reserve accumulation for insurance against financial

shocks. In many cases, low old-age dependency ratios make for high levels of life-cycle savings.

The implication is that as the share of global GDP accounted for by emerging markets has risen,

so too have global savings rates.



4
  For the portions of the 1830s and 1840s when there was no federal debt, New York State canal bonds are used. It
makes very little difference to the picture when a five-year moving average is substituted and when the ex post real
interest rate is displayed as a five- or seven-year moving average.
5
  Some would argue that the price level was mean reverting under the gold standard – that inflation should have
given rise to expectations of subsequent deflation. The empirical relevance of the argument is disputed by Summers
(1983).

                                                         2
         Modern analyses focus on the period since the mid-1990s, the first point in time when the

vast majority of emerging markets and developing countries increased their output faster than the

United States. But for some countries it is possible to consider longer intervals. Historians of

the 19th-century United States (e.g. Frank Lewis 1983), for example, have pointed to the

country’s high immigration and low old-age dependency rates as explanations for relatively high

savings rates that allowed it, unlike other countries with extensive infrastructure needs, to meet

these without relying extensively on foreign capital. This 19th century “savings glut” explains

how it was that interest rates remained low despite pressure for capital deepening from biased

technological change. Analysts of other countries, such as John Hobson (1909), were concerned

in this period about the problem of “underconsumption” (read “oversaving”), attributable to the

increasing concentration of wealth and income in the hands of the “1 per cent.”6

         Figure 2 shows data on global savings rates from the early 20h century through 2013.

The pre-1970 estimates are assembled from national sources. These are GDP weighted average

across countries of domestic investment rates (using 2005 GDP in purchasing power parity

terms).7 While there is some evidence of an upward trend over the long term (interrupted by the

two world wars and the Great Depression), one has to look hard to see any evidence of a growing

savings glut after 1980, as opposed to a temporary bulge in the period of high Chinese savings

from the turn of the 21st century to the financial crisis.8




6
  Hobson pointed to imperialism and colonialism as creating an outlet for the resulting excess saving, analogous to
how Hansen (1938) pointed to the end of the frontier era as closing off a vent for excess savings some 30 years later.
7
  National savings rates are, of course, the sum of domestic investment and the current account balance, but current
accounts sum to zero across countries (in principle if not always in the data). The global current account
discrepancy and gaps in country coverage mean that what is shown here is necessarily an approximation.
Alternatively, the country data can be weighted by current year GDP in purchasing power parity terms from the
Maddison data base. While these show basically the same pattern, data are available only for a subset of countries.
8
  By limiting their analysis to the period since the early 1980s, Grigoli, Herman and Schmidt-Hebbel (2014) are able
to consider a wider range of countries. Their evidence and conclusions are consistent with mine here.

                                                          3
         Estimates of historical investment rates tend to derive from data on the output of

investment-goods industries, and the further one goes back in time the more investment is likely

to go through the informal sector or reflect household production (as with fencing, field clearing,

swamp clearing and barn raising in the agricultural sector) and therefore be missed by such

methods. For a very few countries like the United States, historians have augmented the output

of capital goods sectors with estimates of home manufacturing and the value of farm

improvements made with farm materials in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Figure 3 shows the

estimates of Robert Gallman (1966) spliced to the standard national accounts data since 1925.9

The U.S. in the 19th century displays the behavior familiar from 21st century emerging markets,

with investment rates rising from 16 per cent in 1834-43 to 28 per cent in 1899-1908.

Subsequently, U.S. savings rates headed back down. This is a hint as to what is likely to happen

in emerging markets as populations age and capital/labor ratios approach equilibrium levels. It

suggests that even if high global savings are a factor in current low real interest rates, they may

not remain so indefinitely.

         A second popular explanation for the low level of real interest rates is a decline in the

relative price of investment goods (think cheapening of personal computers). The same

investment projects can be pursued, it is hypothesized, by committing a smaller share of GDP,

and any additional projects that might be rendered attractive by this lower cost of capital are not

enough to offset the decline in the investment share. With less investment spending chasing the

same savings, the result can be lower real interest rates and, potentially, a chronic excess of

desired saving over desired investment.



9
  Gallman’s estimates are also adjusted for changes in net claims against foreigners (Table 3, column 2). I eliminate
this adjustment, since I am concerned with savings rates here. Refinements that reduce the estimated investment
rate slightly without changing the trend over time are in Gallman (1986).

                                                          4
        IMF (2014) has examined changes in the relative price of investment in the advanced

economies since 1980. It documents a downward trend that then levels off in the early 21st

century.10 In explaining this movement, it points to the work of Robert Gordon (1990), who

emphasizes the role of research and development that is embodied in cheaper, more efficient

investment goods. Finally, the IMF asserts that any induced increase in the volume of

investment was insufficient to offset the negative impact of this trend on real interest rates.

        There is little dispute that research and development activity has grown in the long run

time and that it has been disproportionately embodied in investment goods. But there is less

agreement on when this trend began or how long it is likely to persist. Focusing on the United

States, Jonas Fisher (2006) argues that the real price of equipment, which is closely related to the

real price of investment goods, has been falling since the early 1950s, but that its average rate of

decline accelerated in the early 1980s, coincident with the appearance of the downward trend in

real interest rates.

        Why there should have been this sharp break in the early 1980s, however, is not clear.

There is no obvious change in the level or composition of R&D spending between the quarter

centuries before and after this date.

        It may shed additional light on these issues to consider the relative price of investment

goods in the long run in countries like the United States for which we have long time series.

Figure 4 shows the available data from Kuznets (1961) and the national income and product

accounts after 1929.11 We see that while the relative price of investment goods rose as well as

fell for significant periods, there is a sharp fall in recent decades. One interpretation would


10
   Buiter, Rahbari and Seydl (2014), focusing on the U.S., extend the comparison back to 1970, showing that the
investment deflator grew on average by only 3.3 per cent per annum over the subsequent period, compared to 3.7
per cent for the GDP deflator.
11
   Spliced using the overlapping 1929 observation.

                                                        5
situate the break around 1980 (coincident with the timing of the fall in real interest rates, the cost

of capital being an important component of the cost of investment goods). Another

interpretation would put the break around 1950, with an interruption in the 1970s, investment

goods being energy intensive and the ‘seventies being the period of the oil shock. Data for 11

now-advanced countries from William Collins and Jeffrey Williamson (2001) show the same

thing (Figure 5).

         A limitation of the evidence is that these series are not adjusted for product quality

improvement, unlike studies for the post-World War II period which attempt to do so. Figure 6

shows Gordon’s quality-adjusted series through 1983 extended for two additional decades on the

assumption that the same relationship between the adjusted and unadjusted series that holds

through 1983 continues to hold thereafter.12 As expected, this makes the post-World War II

decline in the relative price of investment look even more dramatic.

         Evidently, R&D is not embodied more easily and fully in investment goods than

consumption goods in all times and places. The presumption behind “the Baumol effect” – that

consumption goods, and in particular that portion provided by the service sector, are difficult to

mechanize and therefore become relatively more expensive over time – may not hold in the

future as it has in the recent past. Even if the post-1980 decline in the relative price of

investment goods is part of the explanation for the concurrent decline in real interest rates, there

is no ruling out that it may be reversed in the future.

         A third possible explanation for secular stagnation, due originally to Alvin Hansen

(1938), is that the rate of investment is being dragged down by a low rate of population growth,

as first the advanced economies and now emerging markets undergo the transition to slower rates


12
  Regressing Gordon’s quality adjusted series on the NIPA series yields a coefficient of 0.57 with a t-statistic of 14
and an R-squared of 0.86.

                                                           6
of natural increase. The logic of Hansen and his followers was that slower population growth

meant that capital had less additional labor with which to work on the margin, resulting in lower

returns and lower investment. What Hansen did not emphasize was that slower population

growth and greater longevity also imply lower savings rates on life-cycle grounds. Charles

Goodhart and Philipp Erfuth (2014) question on this basis whether slower labor force growth in

the advanced economies has contributed to the recent decline in real interest rates; they predict

that as population growth and savings rates continue to fall, real interest rates will head back up.

       The historical data do not show any clear correlation between the growth rates of

population and GDP, whether the sample is global or limited to the now-advanced countries. My

own work with Molly Fifer (2002) suggests that increases in old-age dependency ratios have

approximately equal negative effects on savings and investment rates and minimal impact on real

interest rates and the current account of the balance of payments.

       A fourth popular if controversial explanation for low interest rates and the slow growth

with which they are evidently associated is a dearth of attractive investment opportunities. This

was, of course, the original conjecture of Hansen (1938), undermined by subsequent experience.

More recently, Robert Gordon (2012) has argued that the returns to innovation in the United

States, measured in terms of the impact on GDP growth, have slowed since the 1970s. Gordon

associates periods of relatively high investment and growth with key technological clusters:

steam and railroads in the early 19th century; electricity, chemicals, petroleum and the internal

combustion engine from the late 19th century through the mid-20th centuries; and computers and

related technologies since the 1960s. He argues that the slowdown in U.S. productivity growth

starting in the 1970s reflects the relatively limited impact of this third, computer-centered cluster,

aside from its application to retailing, wholesaling and finance centered in the decade 1995-2005.



                                                  7
       There is little disputing the historical record. Productivity and GDP growth were slower

before the late 19th century than subsequently. Productivity growth again slowed in the United

States starting in the 1970s, the visible acceleration in 1995-2005 notwithstanding.

       But different economic historians will have different views about what this history

implies for the future. In thinking about the impact of a cluster of innovations on output and

productivity growth, I like to distinguish two dimensions of the technology in question, which I

refer to as “range of applicability” and “range of adaptation.” Range of applicability refers to

the number of different sector or activities to which the key innovations can be productively

applied. Thus, the steam engine, the key innovation at the center of the first industrial

revolution, had only a limited impact on output and productivity growth because for many years

its productive application was limited to the textile industry and railways, which accounted for

only a relatively small fraction of economic activity (as documented by Nicholas Crafts 2002).

Electricity had a larger impact on output and productivity growth because it was possible to

apply the technology to a wide range of manufacturing industries, to the household sector and

elsewhere within decades of its development. The “computer revolution” of the second half of

the 20th century again had a relatively limited impact on economy-wide rates of output and

productivity growth because its productive application was largely limited to finance, to

wholesale and retail trade, and to the production of computers themselves.

       This perspective suggests that the implications for output and productivity growth of the

next cluster of innovations will depend importantly on their range of applicability. Optimists

point to the fact that currently promising innovations include new tools (quantum computers),

materials (graphene) and processes (genetic modification) which, by their nature, would seem to

have a broad range of potential applications. They point to the scope for robotics to supplement



                                                 8
human brain- and muscle-power in a wide range of activities. They point to the Internet of

Things as promising to connect embedded devices across the economy. This is not a prediction,

but a suggestion to look to the range of applicability of new innovations when thinking about the

prospects for output and productivity growth in the medium term.

       Range of adaptation refers to how comprehensively economic activity must be

reorganized before positive impacts on output and productivity growth materialize, In addition,

the greater the required range of adaptation, the higher the likelihood that growth may slow in

the short run, as costly investments in adaptation are sunk and existing technological

complementarities are disrupted (see Andreas Hornstein and Per Krusell 1996).

       Thus, the steam engine had an immediate positive impact on output and productivity in

textiles because until the 1830s its application was largely limited to textiles and a few other

activities like pumping water from coal mines that did not require widespread reorganization of

economic activity elsewhere in the economy. Similarly it had little tendency to depress

productivity growth in the short run because it did little to disrupt existing technological

complementarities, such as they were. In contrast, electricity and the internal combustion engine

required much more widespread adaptations before their positive impact on productivity could

be felt (see Christiano Ristuccia and Solomos Solomou 2014). Networks of roads and

transmission lines had to be built. Urban geography had to be redrawn and a wide range of

economic activities had to be relocated (see Frank Fetter 1924). Factory production had to be

systematically reorganized (see Paul David 1990). In the meantime existing technological

complementarities were disrupted. These facts are invoked to explain why productivity growth

in the U.S. lagged from the 1890s, from when this “second industrial revolution” dates, to the

1920s, by which time much of this adaptation had finally taken place.



                                                  9
       Here some observers will point to the fact that productivity growth in the United States

has been disappointing in recent years as having positive implications for the future. A wide

variety of connected activities and sectors, such as health care, education, industrial research and

finance, are being disrupted by the latest wave of new technologies. Even while expensive

investments are being sunk, existing technological complementarities are being disturbed. As a

result, productivity growth has had a tendency to disappoint. But once a broad range of

adaptations is complete, productivity growth will accelerate. The current slow rate of

productivity growth is, in this view, a harbinger of better things to come.

       Again, this is not a prediction but a suggestion to look to the range of adaptation required

in response to the current wave of innovations when seeking to interpret our slow rate of

productivity growth and when pondering our future.
