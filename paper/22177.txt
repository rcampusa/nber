Raise Rates to Raise Inflation? Neo-Fisherianism in the New Keynesian Model

                                          ABSTRACT

Increasing the inflation target in a textbook New Keynesian (NK) model may require increasing,
rather than decreasing, the nominal interest rate in the short run. We refer to this positive short
run co-movement between the nominal interest rate and inflation conditional on a nominal shock
as Neo-Fisherianism. We show that the NK model is more likely to be Neo-Fisherian the more
persistent is the change in the inflation target and the more flexible are prices. Neo-Fisherianism
is driven by the forward-looking nature of the model. Modifications which make the framework
less forward-looking make it less likely for the model to exhibit Neo-Fisherianism. As an
example, we show that a modest and empirically realistic fraction of "rule of thumb" price-setters
may altogether eliminate Neo-Fisherianism in the textbook model.

1       Introduction
    Short term interest rates in the United States and other developed countries have been
at or near zero for several years, yet inflation in these countries remains stubbornly low.
While conventional wisdom holds that low nominal interest rates are expansionary and lead
to an increase in inflation, recent experiences have led several prominent economists, most
notably John Cochrane and Steven Williamson, to advance a theory that has been dubbed
Neo-Fisherianism.1 The Neo-Fisherian hypothesis holds that central banks must raise interest
rates to raise inflation, and that extended periods of low interest rates are deflationary.
    The Neo-Fisherian hypothesis follows from the standard Fisher relationship relating
nominal interest rates to real rates and expected inflation, it = rt + Et πt+1 , where it is the
nominal rate, rt the real rate, and Et πt+1 expected inflation. The Fisher relationship was first
derived in Fisher (1896). It is an arbitrage condition between real and nominal assets that
holds in virtually every modern macroeconomic model. The majority of economists would
likely agree that, in the long run, the real interest rate is independent of nominal factors, so
that a long run increase in the nominal interest rate translates into a one-for-one increase
in inflation. But in the short run, many economists believe that nominal frictions permit
nominal shocks to affect real rates, which in turn affect inflation. Consequently, controversy
over the Neo-Fisherian hypothesis is centered mostly on the behavior of nominal interest
rates and inflation in the short run.
    The objective of this paper is to explore the Neo-Fisherian hypothesis in the textbook
New Keynesian (NK) model. This model is used extensively in central banks throughout
the world to inform policymaking. In its simplest form, the model is comprised of two
principal equations – an IS curve relating spending to the real interest rate, and a Phillips
Curve relating inflation to a measure of real activity. We assume that monetary policy is
set according to a strict inflation target. We derive an analytic expression showing how the
nominal interest rate must adjust to implement changes in the inflation target. For sufficiently
transitory changes in the target, the conventional wisdom holds – to implement an increase
in inflation, a central bank ought to reduce the nominal interest rate. However, as changes in
the inflation target become more persistent, the model may exhibit Neo-Fisherianism. For an
otherwise standard parameterization of the model, we show that a persistent but transitory
increase in the inflation target with a half-life of 1.5 or more quarters necessitates a short
run increase in the nominal interest rate. For a given amount of persistence in the inflation
target, the model is more likely to exhibit Neo-Fisherianism the more flexible are prices and

the higher is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.
    What is the intuition for the Neo-Fisherianism in the model? Consider first a very
transitory change in the inflation target, for which it is appropriate to treat expected inflation
as approximately fixed. With fixed expected inflation, an increase in current inflation
necessitates an increase in output from the Phillips Curve. Higher output requires a lower
real interest rate, which necessitates a reduction in the nominal interest rate when expected
inflation is fixed. As the change in the inflation target becomes more persistent, expected
inflation rises, the more so the more persistent is the change in the target. From the Phillips
Curve, this results in a smaller increase in current output. From the IS curve, this requires a
smaller decrease in the real interest rate. With expected inflation increasing, the requisite
decrease in the nominal interest rate to support a decrease in the real interest rate is smaller
the more persistent is the change in the inflation target, and may it be that the nominal
interest rate must increase.
    Neo-Fisherianism thus results from the forward-looking nature of the model, and in
particular is driven by the jumpiness in inflation expectations. Most empirical research
suggests that inflation expectations in the data are not as volatile, nor as influenced by
real variables, as the textbook NK model predicts – see, for example, Kocherlakota (2016)
and the references therein. We conjecture that the NK model is less likely to exhibit Neo-
Fisherianism when ingredients are introduced which make the model less forward-looking. As
an illustration, we augment the model to include a fraction of “rule of thumb” price-setters as
in Gali and Gertler (1999). For an empirically plausible fraction of rule of thumb price-setters,
the model ceases to exhibit Neo-Fisherian properties, regardless of how persistent a change
in the inflation target is.
    Though much of the discussion surrounding Neo-Fisherianism has taken place in the
economics blogosphere, there is a burgeoning academic literature exploring the Neo-Fisherian
hypothesis. Ours is not the first paper to explore the Neo-Fisherian hypothesis in the context
of the textbook NK model. Garcı́a-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) and Cochrane (2016) are
two recent examples. Both of these papers consider a permanent change in the nominal
interest rate and show that the standard NK model predicts that this results in an immediate
increase in the inflation rate. Garcı́a-Schmidt and Woodford (2015) propose a departure from
rational expectations which they call “reflective equilibrium,” and show that this different
equilibrium concept eliminates the Neo-Fisherian predictions of the basic model. Their
proposed “fix” is related to our analysis which suggests that the forward-looking nature of the
model drives its Neo-Fisherianism. Unlike them, we propose a simple fix which can eliminate
Neo-Fisherianism without departing from rational expectations. Cochrane (2016) provides an
extensive overview of the Neo-Fisherian predictions of the textbook NK model, and concludes


                                                2
that most potential fixes (including adding backward-looking terms to the Phillips Curve) do
not break the implication that a permanent increase the nominal interest rate results in an
immediate increase in inflation.
    The experiments we conduct in our paper differ from both Garcı́a-Schmidt and Woodford
(2015) and Cochrane (2016) in two subtle but important ways. First, whereas both of these
papers consider a permanent change in the nominal interest rate, we show that Neo-Fisherian
behavior is likely to emerge in the textbook model even after transitory (but sufficiently
persistent) nominal shocks. Second, whereas these papers consider the implications of a
nominal interest rate peg for inflation, we reverse course and instead examine the implications
of a desired change in inflation for the time path of the interest rate. Our approach has the
advantage of sidestepping the well-known issues related to equilibrium determinacy of an
exogenous interest rate peg.2


2       The Textbook NK Model
    We consider the textbook linearized NK model as laid out in Galı́ (2008). The model is
linearized about a zero inflation steady state.3 For ease of exposition, we assume that the
flexible price, “natural rate” of output is constant. This means that the output gap and
output are the same. The two non-policy equations of the model are:

                                        yt = Et yt+1 − σ (it − Et πt+1 )                                      (1)
                                        πt = λyt + β Et πt+1 .                                                (2)

    In these expressions yt is the log deviation of output from its steady state, it is the deviation
of the nominal interest rate from its steady state, and πt is inflation. The expectation operator
conditional on information available at time t is Et . Equation (1) is the NK IS equation,
derived from a household’s Euler equation. It expresses current spending as a function of
expected future spending and the real interest rate, equal to rt = it − Et πt+1 . Equation (2)
is the NK Phillips Curve. It expresses current inflation as a function of the current output
gap (equal to current output with a fixed natural rate) and expected future inflation. The
parameter σ ≥ 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, 0 < β < 1 is a discount factor,
and λ is a function of the degree of price rigidity and other deep parameters. In particular,

(1975). For more recent applications, see Benhabib et al. (2001), Bullard (2010), and Bullard (2015).
     3
       We have also experimented with higher order approximations or by approximating about a non-zero
inflation steady state. The results which follow are very similar under both modifications, with the exception
that output rises by less after a shock to the target inflation rate, because higher inflation raises price
dispersion, which is isomorphic to a reduction in productivity.

price in a given period and η is the Frisch labor supply elasticity.
    Monetary policy is characterized by an exogenous inflation target.4 The exogenous
inflation target follows a stationary AR(1) process. The monetary authority adjusts the
nominal interest rate in such a way as to be consistent with inflation equaling its target. In
particular:

                                              πt = πt∗                                                   (3)
                                             πt∗ = ρπ πt−1
                                                       ∗
                                                           + t                                          (4)

with 0 < ρπ < 1 and t ∼ N (0, s2 ).
   Given the specification of monetary policy characterized by (3)–(4), one can solve for an
analytic expression for the nominal interest rate as a function of the inflation target:

                                        (1 − ρπ β)
                                   it = [          (ρπ − 1) + ρπ ] πt∗ .                          (5)
                                            σλ
    The sign of the coefficient multiplying πt∗ in this expression is ambiguous. Given our
assumptions, the first term, (1−ρ  π β)
                                  σλ    (ρπ − 1), is negative while the second term, ρπ , is positive.
This coefficient is more likely to be positive (i) the bigger is ρπ (i.e. the more persistent is
the change in the inflation target), (ii) the bigger is λ (i.e. the more flexible are prices, with
θ closer to zero), and (iii) the bigger is σ.5
    Figure 1 plots the coefficient on πt∗ as a function of ρπ for different values of θ, the
parameter governing price stickiness. We assume that σ = η = 1 and β = 0.99. The coefficient
on πt∗ is everywhere increasing in ρπ – that is, it is more likely that it must increase to
generate an increase in inflation the more persistent is the desired change in inflation. When
prices are close to flexible, as with θ = 0.01, the model exhibits Neo-Fisherianism for any
value of ρπ . As prices get stickier, it is less likely that it must increase in order to generate
an increase in πt . For θ = 0.7, a common value used in the literature, the model exhibits
Neo-Fisherianism if ρπ is greater than about 0.6. An autoregressive coefficient of 0.6 implies
a half-life of inflation of only about one and a half quarters.6 When prices are very rigid, as
with θ = 0.9, the model only exhibits Neo-Fisherian behavior for nearly permanent changes in
the inflation target.

   4
      Our results are not dependent upon assuming a strict inflation targeting regime. As we show in Appendix
A, qualitatively the same results emerge when monetary policy is instead characterized by a Taylor rule with
persistent policy shocks.
    5
      Some care needs to be taken with regards to the effect of σ, as λ is a function of σ. However,
σλ = (1 − θ)(1 − θβ)θ−1 (1 + ση −1 ), so σλ is in fact increasing in σ.
    6
      The half-life of an AR(1) process is equal to ln(0.5)
                                                        ln ρπ
                                                              . Thus, for ρπ = 0.6, the half-life is 1.36.


                                                     4
    Figure 2 plots impulse responses of the nominal interest rate, output, and inflation to an
inflation target shock. The different panels correspond to different values of ρπ . In generating
this figure we assume that θ = 0.70. For low values of ρπ , the model responses accord with
conventional wisdom about the effects of nominal shocks – the nominal interest rate decreases,
while output and inflation increase. The output response is smaller the more persistent
is the shock. Output and inflation still increase after the inflation target shock for higher
values of ρπ , but the behavior of the nominal interest rate is different. In particular, for
ρπ = 0.7 or ρπ = 0.9, the nominal interest rate increases. In other words, implementing a
sufficiently persistent increase in inflation requires increasing, rather than decreasing, the
nominal interest rate.

            of ρπ for different values of θ, the parameter governing price stickiness. In generating this figure,
            we assume that σ = 1, η = 1, and β = 0.99.


   What is the intuition for the Neo-Fisherian behavior in the model? This intuition can be
best understood by focusing on the IS equation and Phillips curve, (1) and (2). Consider a
completely transitory change in the inflation target, with ρπ = 0. Given that there are no
endogenous state variables in the model, this means that Et πt+1 and Et yt+1 will be unaffected.
From the Phillips Curve, higher inflation necessitates an increase in output. The increase in
output is larger the smaller is λ. From the IS equation, an increase in yt , holding Et πt+1 and

                                                              5
Et yt+1 fixed, requires a reduction in it . As the inflation target shock becomes more persistent,
Et πt+1 rises by more and more. From the Phillips Curve, this results in a smaller increase in
yt . For a given Et yt+1 , a smaller increase in yt , coupled with an increase in Et πt+1 , results in
a smaller required decrease in it for the IS equation to hold. For a sufficiently large increase
in Et πt+1 , and consequently a smaller increase in yt , it may need to rise for the IS equation
to hold. There is also an effect operating through Et yt+1 , though this effect is non-monotonic.
One can show that Et yt+1 = ρπ (1 − ρπ β)λ−1 πt∗ . For low values of ρπ , the effect of πt∗ on Et yt+1
is increasing in ρπ , which means that an inflation target shock requires a smaller decrease in
it to be consistent with a given increase in yt .

3     Introducing Backward-Looking Elements into the NK
      Model
   The analysis from the previous section suggests that Neo-Fisherianism is driven by the
forward-looking nature of the NK model. If there were no forward-looking terms in the
IS equation and Phillips Curves, the intuition from a completely transitory change in the

                                                            6
inflation target would hold regardless of the persistence of the inflation target shock – an
increase in inflation would generate an increase in yt , which would require a reduction in it .
This suggests that breaking the Neo-Fisherianism of the model requires modifications to the
model which make it less forward-looking.
    One could envision many such modifications, such as adaptive expectations, habit for-
mation, or sticky information in place of sticky prices, as in Mankiw and Reis (2003). In
this section we consider one such modification shown to fit the data well – “rule of thumb”
price-setters. We follow Gali and Gertler (1999) in assuming that a fraction of firms, 0 ≤ ω < 1,
use a simple rule of thumb when setting prices, whereas the remaining fraction 1 − ω firms
behave according to the standard Calvo model. This modification to the model does not
affect the demand side, governed by the IS equation (1). The modified Phillips curve is:

                                     πt = λy yt + γf Et πt+1 + γb πt−1 .                      (6)

   The coefficients λy , γf , and γb relate to the underlying deep parameters of the model via:

                             φ = θ + ω [1 − θ(1 − β)]                                         (7)
                           λy = (1 − ω)(1 − θ)(1 − θβ)(σ −1 + η −1 )φ−1                       (8)
                           γf = βθφ−1                                                         (9)
                            γb = ωφ−1 .                                                      (10)

   It is straightforward to show that (6) reduces to the standard, purely forward-looking
Phillips curve, (2), when ω = 0. As ω gets bigger, coefficient on output gets smaller (in a way
isomorphic to having stickier prices), the coefficient on expected future inflation gets smaller,
and the coefficient on lagged inflation gets bigger.
   We again assume that monetary policy is set according to the exogenous inflation target
described in the previous section. One can express the nominal interest rate as a function of
the inflation target as:

                                 (ρπ − 1)(1 − ρπ γf ) − γb               γb ∗
                        it = [                             + ρπ ] πt∗ +    π .               (11)
                                          σλy                           σλy t−1
   This expression shares some similarities with (5) and reduces to it in the special case of
ω = 0. The nominal interest rate now depends both on the current inflation target as well as
the lagged inflation target. Focus first on the coefficient on πt∗ , which shows how it must react
                                                                        (ρ −1)(1−ρ γ )−γ
on impact to a surprise change in the inflation target. The term π σλyπ f b is negative
while ρπ is positive, meaning that it is ambiguous how the nominal interest rate must react
on impact in order to implement an increase in inflation. As in the purely forward-looking

                                                     7
version of the model, it is more likely that the coefficient on πt∗ is positive, and that the model
displays Neo-Fisherianism, the bigger is ρπ . The model is again less likely to be Neo-Fisherian
the stickier are prices (so the lower is λy ) and the bigger is the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution, σ.

            Notes: This figure plots the coefficient of it on πt∗ (i.e. the term in brackets in (11)) as a function
            of ρπ . Different panels correspond to different values of ω. In generating this figure, we assume
            that σ = 1, η = 1, β = 0.99, and θ = 0.70.



    In the hybrid specification of the model with some backward-looking elements, it is less
likely for the inflation target to have a positive effect on the nominal interest rate on impact
for larger values of ω. The fraction of firms who follow the rule of thumb affects this expression
in four different ways. First, a higher value of ω makes γf smaller, which makes the first
term in brackets more negative. Second, a higher value of ω makes γb larger, which also
makes it more likely that the coefficient on πt∗ in (11) is negative. Third, a higher value of ω
flattens the Phillips curve. A smaller value of λy also makes it more likely that it must rise
on impact so as to implement an increase in the inflation target. Finally, in a dynamic sense,
                                                                                                γb
future nominal interest rates will depend on the lagged inflation target via the coefficient σλ   y
                                                                                                    .
Larger values of ω make this coefficient bigger. This means that while large backward-looking
elements in the Phillips Curve make it less likely that the nominal interest rate must increase


                                                              8
on impact to implement an increase in the inflation target, in future periods the nominal
rate may have to increase.
    Figure 3 plots the coefficient on πt∗ as a function of ρπ for different values of ω. In other
words, this figure plots the impact response of inflation to an increase in the inflation target.
In generating this figure we continue to assume that σ = η = 1, β = 0.99, and we assume that
θ = 0.7. As in Figure 1, the coefficient on πt∗ is everywhere increasing in ρπ regardless of ω.
When ω = 0, the model exhibits Neo-Fisherianism for values of ρπ greater than roughly 0.6.
Interestingly the model does not exhibit Neo-Fisherianism, regardless of how persistent the
inflation target shock is, for values of ω greater than about 0.15. Gali and Gertler (1999)
estimate values of ω in the range of 0.25 to 0.50. This suggests that the model ceases to
exhibit Neo-Fisherian properties, regardless of the persistence of the inflation target, for an
empirically plausible fraction of rule of thumb price-setters.


4     Conclusion
    A textbook NK model may exhibit Neo-Fisherian behavior, by which we mean that a
central bank must increase, rather than decrease, nominal interest rates in the short run
in order to implement higher inflation. The standard NK model is more likely to have
Neo-Fisherian implications the more persistent is a change in the inflation target and the
more flexible are prices.
    Neo-Fisherianism in the New Keynesian model is a consequence of the forward-looking
nature of the model, wherein inflation expectations are volatile and spending depends not
just on current real interest rates but also on expectations of future real rates. The extreme
forward-looking behavior in the model is at the heart of other potential “puzzles” in the
NK model, including its tendency to produce large and explosive fiscal multipliers under an
interest rate peg (see, e.g. Carlstrom et al. (2014)) as well as the so-called “forward guidance
puzzle” (Del-Negro et al. (2015)), wherein extended periods of low interest rates can be wildly
expansionary. Features which dampen the forward-looking nature of the model have been
shown to help resolve some of these puzzles. In the context of our paper, we show that an
empirically realistic fraction of “rule of thumb” price-setters may eliminate Neo-Fisherianism
from the model altogether. We suspect, but have not verified, that other features – such
as habit formation, rule of thumb consumers, adaptive expectations, or sticky information –
would have qualitatively similar effects.

A      Analysis Under a Taylor Rule
    This appendix shows that our conclusions about whether a central bank must raise the
nominal interest rate to raise inflation do not depend upon our assumption that policy is
characterized by a strict inflation target. The IS equation and Phillips Curve are the same as
in Section 2, given by (1) and (2), respectively. Instead of an exogenous inflation target, we
assume that monetary policy is governed by a Taylor rule of the sort:

                                        it = φπ πt + φy yt + ut .                           (A.1)

   Variables here denote deviations from steady state. We assume that φπ > 1 and φy ≥ 0,
which is sufficient to assure equilibrium determinacy. ut is a persistent but stationary,
monetary policy shock, obeying:

                                     ut = ρut−1 + t , 0 ≤ ρ < 1.                           (A.2)

   Using the method of undetermined coefficients, we solve for analytic expressions for πt , yt ,
and it :
                                           −λσ
                        πt =                                   ut .                     (A.3)
                             λσ(φπ − ρ) + (1 − βρ)(1 + φy − ρ)
                                             −σ(1 − βρ)
                           yt =                                      ut .                   (A.4)
                                  λσ(φπ − ρ) + (1 − βρ)(1 + σφy − ρ)
                                       −λσρ + (1 − βρ)(1 − ρ)
                           it =                                      ut .                   (A.5)
                                  λσ(φπ − ρ) + (1 − βρ)(1 + σφy − ρ)
    A positive policy shock decreases both inflation and output on impact. It could result in
either an increase or a decrease in the nominal interest rate. This depends on the sign of the
numerator in (A.5). If ρ is small, it is likely that the coefficient in (A.5) is positive, so that
the conventional wisdom holds – to raise inflation, the central bank must lower the nominal
interest rate. For a given value of ρ, it is more likely that the nominal interest rate must
decrease to increase the the inflation rate the lower is λ (i.e the sticker are prices) and the
lower is σ (i.e. the lower is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution). These conclusions
are qualitatively the same as what is presented in Section 2 with policy characterized by a
strict inflation target. As ρ increases, it is increasingly likely that it must move in the same
direction as the desired change in inflation.
