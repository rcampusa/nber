                                               ABSTRACT

The failure of many paintings to sell in art auctions indicates the presence of reserve prices set by sellers.
This paper examines the relationship between sale rates and price surprises over time in art auctions.
Using data on contemporary and impressionist art, we show that while sale rates appear to have little
relationship to current prices, there exists a strong positive relationship of sale rates to unexpected
aggregate price changes, which is reminiscent of a Phillips curve. As a result, sale rates provide a
useful quantity indicator of the strength of the art market. The data also indicate that sale rates revert
to “normal” very quickly following a price surprise. We estimate an empirical model to measure normal
sale rates. We also find evidence that the reserve price is set on average at about 70% of the auctioneer’s
low estimate, as published in the auction catalog.

                      Sale Rates and Price Movements in Art Auctions

                          Orley Ashenfelter and Kathryn Graddy1

       While much attention has been given to studying price movements in the art market,

little attention has been given to studying sale rates.2 Because of the presence of sellers’

reserve prices, not all items that are put up for sale are sold. The variability in sale rates

provides a quantity signal that plays a large role in public discussions of the current state of

the art market. In this regard art markets, where the products on sale display considerable

heterogeneity, are similar to housing and labor markets, where quantity signals also play an

important role in discussions of the state of the market. An understanding of sale rates, as

measured by the number of items that actually change hands as a proportion of items that are

put up for sale, shows how quantity signals are formed even in the purest form of auction

market transaction.

       Sellers of individual art works usually set a confidential reserve price, and if the

bidding does not reach this level, the items will go unsold. An item that has not been sold

may be put up for sale at a later auction, sold elsewhere, or taken off the market. We begin

our study by looking in detail at sale rates, prices and unexpected price movements.

Unexpected price movements are defined as the average percentage difference between the

sale price and the pre-sale estimate as produced by auction house experts and published in the

pre-sale catalogue. We show that sale rates have shown no discernible trend or consistent

correlations with current price levels, but that sale rates and unexpected price movements

have a strong visible relationship, despite the efforts of auctioneers to produce accurate

estimates.

       The confidential reserve price is commonly thought to be related to an auctioneer’s

pre-sale estimated price. Indeed, the convention in art auctions is that the reserve price is set

at or below the auctioneer’s low estimate. We use this relationship to interpret our graphical

relationship between sale rates and unexpected price movements. Using a data set on

contemporary art in which we have prices for sold items and high bids for unsold items, we

estimate the average discount that the reserve is set below the low estimate. Our results

indicate that the reserve price is set at about 70% of the low estimate, which is consistent with

what little is known about reserve prices.

       In section I of the paper we describe the auction market and summary statistics on

sale rates, prices, and unexpected price movements. In section II we interpret the relationship

between sale rates and unexpected price movements. In section III we use sale rates and

unexpected price changes to estimate the relation between the auctioneer’s observable low

estimate and the seller’s observable reserve price.

I. Sale Rates and Prices in Art Auctions

       Art auctions are ascending price auctions, where the bidding starts out low and the

auctioneer subsequently calls out higher and higher prices. When the bidding stops, the item

is said to be “knocked down” or “hammered down”, and the final price is the “hammer

price.” Not all items that have been put up for sale and “knocked down” have been sold.

Sellers of individual items typically set confidential reserve prices, and if the bidding does

not reach this level, the items will go unsold. Auctioneers say that an unsold item has been

“bought-in.”



                                                4
         Prior to the sale, a pre-sale catalogue is published which includes high and low

estimates of the art work to be auctioned. The auction house does not publish, and indeed is

very secretive about, the seller’s reserve price for the work of art. The auction houses

observe an unwritten rule of setting the secret reserve price at or below the low estimate.3

         Our first dataset consists of objects sold in auctions of impressionist art at Christie's

and Sotheby's in London and New York. For the period 1980 to 1990, the dataset on

impressionist and modern art auctions was constructed by Orley Ashenfelter and Andrew

Richardson by looking through public price lists and auction catalogues from Christie's and

Sotheby's. For the period 1990 to July of 2007, the dataset was constructed by Kathryn

Graddy with the help of Ly Tran and Huong Nguyen by using a combination of Hislop's art

sales index database and the ARTNET database. Our dataset includes sales of 58 selected

impressionist and modern artists that took place at Christie’s and Sotheby’s auction houses in

London and New York. The artists in this sample were selected because their art is well

represented at auction.

         Our second dataset on contemporary art was constructed by Kathryn Graddy and

includes all sales of contemporary art at Christie’s auction house on King Street in London

between 1982 and 1994. The data were gathered from the archives of Christie’s auction

house, and for each item, the observable characteristics were hand-copied from the pre-sale

catalogues. For this dataset, we have observations both on the sale price for sold items and

on the high bid for unsold items, as reported in Christie's internal property system.

estimates are highly correlated with the prices of subsequently sold items.

         Table 1 presents summary statistics on the number of observations, the number of

auctions, the average prices for sold items, the high bids for unsold items in the

contemporary art dataset, the average of the high and low pre-sale estimates, and the sale

rates for 5 year periods. There are many more impressionist art auctions than contemporary

art auctions because of the way the data sets were constructed. The sale rate is largely

stationary over these five year intervals in both datasets. 4           The average sale rate over the

entire 27 year period is 69.8% for impressionist art, while it is 77% for contemporary art for

the period 1982-1994. For comparison the impressionist art sale rate is 68.5% over the same

1982-94 period, suggesting the “normal” sale rate is higher for contemporary than

impressionist art.

 Price estimates for impressionist art are missing for 105 out of 651 auctions. 80 of 105 of these missing price
estimates occur in the years 1992 to 1994.

         Figures 1 present’s sale rates and a yearly hedonic price index plotted over time and

demonstrates that these sale-rates fluctuate around a stable level, with no consistent

correlation with an index of prices5. The correlation of yearly sale rates with the current

impressionist index is -.24, and the correlation of yearly sale rates with the current

contemporary index is .26. There is a higher correlation of the lagged price indices with sale

 The impressionist art index is constructed by regressing log prices on 57 artist dummies, log height, log width,
and 27 year dummies. The contemporary art index is constructed by regressing log price on 119 artist
dummies, log height, log width, 20 medium dummies, log of years since painting was constructed, whether or
not the painting was subject to VAT, and 13 year dummies.

rates: for impressionist art the correlation is -.60 and for Contemporary Art the correlation is

-.58. During the 1989 crash, in both datasets prices and sale rates fell. The negative

correlations with the lagged yearly price index suggests that price surprises, or “price

shocks,” might be driving sale rates. We have a very good measure of price shocks on an

item by item basis because of the pre-sale estimates placed on items by experts at the auction

houses.

          In Figure 2 below, we plot the buy-in rate (which is calculated as one minus the sale

rate) against the price shock, by auction, for both impressionist and contemporary art. Price

shocks are calculated as the ratio of the sale price to the average estimate minus one for each

painting, and then averaged over each auction. For contemporary art, we separate the

unexpected shock for sold items from the unexpected shock for unsold items (using the high

bid price in place of a sold price). As would be expected, the price shock for unsold items is

consistently negative.

          The figures below show a strong relationship between buy-in rates and price shocks.

A regression of the buy-in rate on the price shock for sold items for impressionist art yields a

slope coefficient of -0.345 and a standard error of just 0.029. A regression of the buy-in rate

on the price shock for sold items for contemporary art yields a slope coefficient of -0.322

with a standard error of 0.050. The slope of the relationship is steeper for unsold items at -

0.759, but with a standard error of 0.399 it is not significantly different from the slope for

sold items.

          This strong observed correlation between unexpected price shocks and our measure of

   volume –the sale rate—is suggestive of a Phillips curve. Mortensen (1970) sets out an

   elegant model of reservation price determination in a labor market context and uses it to

   explain the nature of a Phillips Curve. With art, one can think of the buy-in rate as the

  unemployment rate for paintings. An unexpected positive price shock raises the sale rate



                                                 8
     because more owners of paintings receive price offers above their reservation price.

II. An Empirical Explanation of the Relationship of Sale Rates to Unexpected Price

Movements

       Before the auction, the auction house publishes a range of estimates of the value of

each item for sale, but does not reveal the reserve price, which by convention is at or below

the low estimate. Consistent with the common perception in art auctions, each reserve price,

Rit, which is both item specific and time specific, is related to each low estimate, LEit, by an




                                                9
individual reserve factor, θit, where Rit= θitLEit.6

        An item is sold when pit  Rit or pit  it LEit           ,   Now define the price shock psit for

that item as psit  ln pit  ln LEit and let yit  1 if the item is sold, yit  0 otherwise. Then,

y it  1 when psit  ln  it , where it is the reserve factor of the seller of item it. We model

the reserve factors for individual sellers as:

         ln  it  ln   u jt  it

where  an “average” reserve factor is for all sellers, u jt ~ IN (0,  u2 ) is a cluster effect. We

allow paintings to be clustered by auction date (t), artist (j), and jointly by artist and auction

date.  it ~ IN (0,  2 ) is an individual seller effect. Therefore,

         yit  1         psit  ln   u jt  it

Thus, we have a random effects probit model (REPM) specification, which we can use to

estimate the average reserve factor  and the standard deviation  across sellers. In the

special case of no auction/artist-specific reserve factor effects (ujt=0) we have the standard

Probit model for which:

                            ps  ln     
         Pr[ y it  1]   it           
                                        

where  is the standard normal distribution function.

III. Estimation

        In column 1 of Table 2 we present the standard probit estimates, and in columns 2-4

we present the random effects probit model (REPM) estimates. The coefficients are highly

significant in all models, and the results for both the standard probit and the random-effects




6
  Ashenfelter, Graddy, and Stevens (2004) show that under certain assumptions, the seller has an optimal reserve
price which is a constant proportion of the expected price. This proportion depends upon a seller's discount
factor, the expected price growth of art, and the variance of the unexpected price shock.


                                                      10
probit indicate that the reserve price is on average 71% of the low estimate.7 The estimates of

the standard deviation across sellers, σ, are also similar in the four models, ranging from

0.259 to 0.290. The intra-auction correlation (rho in column 2) equals 0.060 with an

estimated error of 0.020, the intra-artist correlation (rho in column 3) equals 0.037 with a

standard error of 0.030, and the intra-auction/artist correlation (rho in column 4) equals 0.231

with an estimated error of 0.052. Thus, in column 4, approximately 23% of the variance is

attributable to the same artist within an auction.

this sample, the mean price was 87% of the low estimate. The high bid for unsold items was

on average 72% of the low estimate. In impressionist and modern art, 37% sold at or below

the low estimate, and the mean price was 90% of the low estimate. The only evidence we

could find on any actual reserve prices is contained in a book by Peter Watson that

documents the selling of Portrait of Dr. Gatchet. For this picture, the secret reserve was

$35,000,000, 87.5% of the low estimate of $40,000,000.8

IV. Conclusion

         Unexpected price movements regularly occur in art auctions, and these price shocks

are highly correlated with art auction sale rates. The probability an item is sold in an auction

depends upon how low the reserve price is set. In data on contemporary art auctions, we

estimate the confidential reserve price to be set at approximately 70% of the low estimate.

Our results explain why sale rates in art auctions are considered so significant to market

observers: they indicate how aggregate prices are evolving.

  Using a very different method, McAndrew et. al. (2010) estimate that the reserve price is set at 73% of the low
estimate.
