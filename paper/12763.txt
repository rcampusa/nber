                                            ABSTRACT

Satisfactory calculations of the welfare cost of aggregate consumption uncertainty require a framework
that replicates major features of asset prices and returns, such as the high equity premium and low
risk-free rate. A Lucas-tree model with rare but large disasters is such a framework. In a baseline
simulation, the welfare cost of disaster risk is large -- society would be willing to lower real GDP by
about 20% each year to eliminate all disaster risk, including wars. In contrast, the welfare cost from
usual economic fluctuations is much smaller, though still important -- corresponding to lowering GDP
by around 1.5% each year.

       Lucas (1987, Ch. 3; 2003, section II) argued that the welfare gain from

eliminating uncertainty in aggregate consumption is trivial. He got this answer by using

parameters for the time series of real per capita consumer expenditure from U.S. post-

World War II macroeconomic data, along with plausible values for the coefficient of

relative risk aversion.

       One problem with this calculation, apparent from Mehra and Prescott (1985), is

that simulations with the same model and parameters do not get into the right ballpark for

explaining well-known asset-pricing puzzles, such as the high equity premium and low

risk-free rate. These failures with respect to asset returns suggest, as observed by

Atkeson and Phelan (1994), that the model misses important aspects of consumption

uncertainty. Hence, the model’s estimates of welfare effects from consumption

uncertainty are likely to be inaccurate.

       A possibly satisfactory framework, used here, is one with rare economic disasters,

as in Rietz (1988). Barro (2006) shows that this model replicates prominent features of

asset returns. Salyer (2007) demonstrates that the allowance for low-probability crash

states amplifies the welfare costs computed by Lucas. The present analysis builds on this

work to show that, in a rare-disasters setting, changes in consumption uncertainty that

reflect shifts in the probability of disaster have major implications for welfare.



I. A Lucas Fruit-Tree Model

       The initial model is a version of Lucas’s (1978) representative-agent, fruit-tree

economy with exogenous, stochastic production. Output of fruit in period t equals real

GDP, Yt. Population is constant. The number of trees is fixed; that is, there is neither
investment nor depreciation. (A later model allows for investment.) Government

purchases are nil. Since the economy is closed and all output is consumed, consumption,

Ct, equals Yt.

       The log of output evolves as a random walk with drift:

       (1)             log(Yt+1) = log(Yt) + ut+1 + vt+1 + g – (1/2) 2.
                                                                         2
The random term ut+1 is i.i.d. normal with mean 0 and variance               . This term reflects

“normal” economic fluctuations. The random term vt+1 picks up low-probability

disasters, as in Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006). In these rare events, output and

consumption jump down sharply. The probability of a disaster is the constant p                0 per

unit of time. The probability of more than one disaster in a period is assumed to be small

enough to neglect; later, the arbitrary period length shrinks to zero. In a disaster, output

contracts by the fraction b, where 0<b<1. The distribution of vt+1 is given by

                       probability 1-p: vt+1 = 0,

                       probability p: vt+1 = log(1-b).

       The parameter g          0 in Eq. (1) is a constant that reflects exogenous productivity
                                       2
growth. The subtraction of (1/2)           (quantitatively unimportant in the calibrations)
                            2
eliminates the effect of        on the expected growth rate of real GDP.

       Unlike Lucas (1987, Ch. 3), but in line with Obstfeld (1994), the shocks ut+1 and

vt+1 in Eq. (1) represent permanent effects on the level of output, rather than transitory

disturbances to the level. That is, the economy has no tendency to revert to a

deterministic trend line.

       Cochrane (1988, Table 1) used variance-ratio statistics for k-year differences to

assess the extent of reversion to a deterministic trend in the log of U.S. real per capita




                                                    2
GNP for 1869-1986. He found evidence for reversion in that the ratio of the k-year

variance (divided by k) to the 1-year variance was between 0.30 and 0.36 for k between

20 and 30 years. Therefore, at large k, the empirical variance ratio was much less than

the value 1.0 predicted by Eq. (1). However, Cogley (1990, Table 2) showed that the

Cochrane finding was particular to the United States. For 9 OECD countries, including

the United States, from 1871 to 1985, the mean of the variance ratio at 20 years was 1.1;

hence, close to the value 1.0 predicted by Eq. (1).

         Cogley’s results hold up for a broader sample comprising 19 OECD countries.

The data on per capita GDP are for 1870-2004 from Maddison (2003), updated from

World Bank, World Development Indicators (and using U.S. data from Balke and Gordon

[1989] before 1929). For k=20, the mean of the variance ratios for the 19 countries is

1.22 and the median is 1.00, while for k=30, the corresponding values are 1.30 and 0.96.

These values accord with Eq. (1). The United States—with variance ratios of 0.42 when

k=20 and 0.38 when k=30—has the lowest ratios at these values of k among the 19

countries.1 The critical factor for the United States is that the turbulence of the Great

Depression and World War II happened to be followed by the log of per capita GDP

reverting roughly to the pre-1930 and pre-1914 trend lines. Most other countries do not

look like this.

         My inference from the long-term GDP data for the OECD countries is that the

evidence conflicts with reversion to a fixed, deterministic trend. The key, counter-

factual prediction from this model is the comparatively low uncertainty about the distant

 The next smallest values for k=20 are 0.55 for New Zealand, 0.68 for Germany, and 0.77 for Switzerland.
At k=30, the next smallest values are 0.40 for New Zealand, 0.53 for Germany, and 0.54 for Canada. For
smaller values of k, the mean and median of the variance ratios are, respectively, 1.16 and 1.18 at k=2, 1.23
and 1.31 at k=5, and 1.13 and 1.06 at k=10. The U.S. ratios at these values of k are, respectively, 1.30,
1.34, and 0.94.

future. In contrast, the variance-ratio results are consistent with the stochastic-trend

specification in Eq. (1). Therefore, I use this model for the present analysis. Richer

models worth considering would allow for trend breaks (analyzed starting from Banerjee,

Lumsdaine, and Stock [1992]) and for gradual reversion to past levels after major crises,

such as wars.

         Previous research (Barro [2006, Table 1 and Figure 1]) gauged the probability and

size of disaster events from time series on per capita GDP for 35 countries for the full

20th century from Maddison (2003).2 For contractions of 15% or more over consecutive

years (such as 1939-44 for France and 1929-33 for the United States), 60 events were

found.3 For the 35 countries, the main global disasters were World War II (18 countries

with large GDP contractions), the Great Depression (16 countries), World War I (13

countries), and post-World War II depressions in Latin America and Asia (11 country-

events). The empirical frequency—60 events for 35 countries over 100 years—

corresponds to a disaster probability, p, of 1.7% per year.

         The contraction proportion b for the observed 20th century disasters ranged from

15% to 64%, with a mean of 29%.4 However, with substantial risk aversion (for

example, with a coefficient of relative risk aversion of 3 or 4), the effective average value

of b is much higher than the mean. It turns out that a constant b of around 40% generates


2
  In the fruit-tree model, GDP and consumption coincide. More generally, consumption would be more
appropriate than GDP for analyses of asset pricing and welfare costs. However, long-term data on real
consumer expenditure are not reported by Maddison (2003) and are not readily available for many
countries. In ongoing research, Jose Ursua and I are assembling a data set on long-term real consumer
expenditure for as many countries as possible.
3
  This analysis excludes five post-war GDP contractions that did not involve large declines in real
consumer expenditure. The lower limit of 15% is arbitrary. Extending to 10% brings in another 21
contractions for the 35 countries. However, the inclusion of these smaller contractions has a minor effect
on the results.

  The 29% figure refers to raw levels of per capita GDP. With an adjustment for trend growth, the mean
contraction size was 35%.

about the same equity premium and welfare effects as the empirically observed frequency

distribution of b.5

         The formulation neglects rare bonanzas. With substantial risk aversion, bonanzas

do not count nearly as much as disasters for the pricing of assets and for welfare effects.

Moreover, long-term data on annual growth rates of per capita GDP tend to exhibit

negative skewness. For 19 OECD countries from 1880 to 2004, 14 exhibit negative

skewness, and the only substantially positive values are for France, the Netherlands, and

Switzerland.

         The expected growth rate of real GDP depends not only on the growth-rate

parameter, g, but also on p and b. As the length of the period approaches zero, the

specification in Eq. (1) implies that the expected growth rate of GDP and consumption,

denoted by g*, is given by

         (2)                                 g* = g – p Eb,

where Eb is the expected value of b (0.29 in the sample of 60 observed crises).

         The representative consumer maximizes a familiar time-additive utility function

with iso-elastic preferences:

                                                 ∞          1
         (3)                        U t = Et                       ⋅ [(Ct +i )1−θ − 1] /(1 − θ ) ,
                                                 i =0
                                                        (1 + ρ ) i



where          0 is the rate of time preference, and > 0 is the coefficient of relative risk

aversion and the reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption.

(A later section revises the utility function to allow for departures of the coefficient of

relative risk aversion from the reciprocal of the elasticity of substitution.) The simplicity

 I neglect two other features of my earlier analysis that matter for the equity premium but not for the
welfare calculations—leverage in the ownership structure for trees and default possibilities on bonds.

of the underlying structure (i.i.d. shocks, representative consumer with time-additive and

iso-elastic preferences, closed economy with no investment) allows for a closed-form

solution for expected utility as a function of the underlying parameters of preferences and

of the stochastic process for output. Obstfeld (1994) derived analogous closed forms in a

model without disaster risk.

         A key variable is the market value, V, of a tree that initially produces one unit of

fruit. This value can be calculated by summing the prices of equity claims on future

“dividends,” Ct+i =Yt+i. (In order to correspond to the summation in Eq. [3], it is

convenient to treat Ct, rather than Ct+1, as the first payout on tree equity.) These prices

follow from the usual first-order conditions for maximizing Ut. As the arbitrary period

length approaches zero, the reciprocal of V turns out to be6
                                                                   2
         (4)               1/V = + ( -1) g – (1/2) ( -1)               – p [E(1-b)1- – 1],

where E(1-b)1- is the expected value of (1-b)1- . We can think of V as the price-dividend

ratio for an unlevered equity claim on a tree.

         The right-hand side of Eq. (4) equals the difference between the expected rate of

return on unlevered equity, given by7

         (5)      re =   + g - (1/2) ( -1)        2
                                                      - p [E(1-b)1- - 1 + Eb],

and the expected growth rate, g*, given in Eq. (2). The transversality condition, which

guarantees that the market value of a tree is positive and finite, is that the right-hand side

of Eq. (4) be positive—that is, re > g*.

         Expected utility as of period t, given in Eq. (3), can be determined to be8

  For =1, expected utility is Ut = (1/ ) log(Yt). The derivation of Eq. (6) depends on the condition Ct=Yt
and on time-additive, iso-elastic preferences but not on the particular stochastic process for output in


                                                       6

                                             1−θ

up to an inconsequential additive constant. Equation (4) determines V. However, for

subsequent purposes, we also want a formula for V in terms of the expected growth rate,

g*, rather than the growth-rate parameter, g. The result follows from Eq. (2):
                                                                   2
         (7)         1/V = + ( -1) g* – (1/2) ( -1)                    – p [E(1-b)1- – 1 – ( -1) Eb].

Note that, if >1, V rises with increased uncertainty, in the sense of an increase in                    or p

or a shift in the distribution of b toward larger values. This property depends on time-

additive, iso-elastic preferences, as discussed in section V.



II. Baseline Calculation of Welfare Effects

         Equations (6) and (7) determine the effects on expected utility from changes in

the expected growth rate, g*, and the parameters that govern consumption risk:                     , p, and

the probability distribution of b. These effects can be compared with those from

proportionate shifts in the initial level of GDP and consumption, Yt.

         The marginal effect on utility from a proportionate change in Yt is given from

Eq. (6) by

                                      ∂U t
         (8)                               ⋅ Yt = (Yt )1−θ ⋅ V .
                                      ∂Yt

The marginal effect from a change in g* follows from Eqs. (6) and (7) as

                                       ∂U t
         (9)                                = (Yt )1−θ ⋅ V 2 .
                                       ∂g *


Eq. (1). However, the constancy of the price-dividend ratio, Vt=V, depends on the i.i.d. form of the shocks,
ut and vt. A constant V conflicts with the observed volatility of price-dividend ratios for stock-market
claims. The model can match this volatility if the disaster probability, pt, moves around. Gabaix (2006)
shows that the main implications of the model for asset pricing go through if pt evolves exogenously in
random-walk-like fashion.


                                                      7
Therefore, the utility rate of transformation between proportionate changes in Yt and

changes in g* is given by

                                      − ∂U t / ∂g *
         (10)                                           = −V .
                                     (∂U t / ∂Yt ) ⋅ Yt

This result gives the proportionate decrease in Yt that compensates, at the margin, for an

increase in g*—in the sense of preserving expected utility. Equation (10) shows that this

compensating output change depends only on the combination of parameters that enter

into the price-dividend ratio, V, as determined in Eq. (4) or Eq. (7).

         To pin down a reasonable magnitude for V, start with the already mentioned

specification p=0.017 per year. The probability distribution for b is the historical one

mentioned before. The other parameters equal the values used in the main calibration

exercise in Barro (2006, Table 5, col. 2). The rate of time preference is =0.03 per year,

the coefficient of relative risk aversion (and reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution) is =4, the growth parameter is g=0.025 per year, and the standard deviation

of the ut shocks is =0.02 per year.9 These parameters imply that the expected growth

rate in Eq. (2) is g*=0.020 per year. The price-dividend ratio in Eq. (7) is V=19.7.

         With V=19.7, Eq. (10) implies that a small rise in the expected growth rate, g*—

for example, by 0.1% per year—has to be compensated by a fall in the initial level of

GDP, Yt, by 2.0%. Despite differences in specification, this result accords with the one

  The values for g and come from data on real consumer expenditure for 21 OECD countries for
1954-2004, a tranquil period with no disaster events for these countries. The largest contraction was 14%
for per capita real consumer expenditure (12% for per capita GDP) for Finland in 1989-93. For 1954-2004,
the median of the growth rates of real per capita consumer expenditure for the 21 countries was 0.026 per
year, and the median standard deviation of the growth rates was 0.024. The U.S. values were 0.024 and
0.018, respectively. With =4, the expectations associated with the historical distribution of disaster sizes,
b, are Eb=0.29, E(1-b)- = 7.69, and E(1-b)1- = 4.05.

found by Lucas (1987, Ch. 3, p. 24). An economy should be willing to give up a lot in its

initial level of GDP to obtain a small increase in its long-term growth rate.

         The Lucas calculations about consumption uncertainty relate in the present model

to the parameter . The marginal effect on expected utility, Ut, from a change in                    is

given from Eqs. (6) and (7) by

                                    ∂U t
         (11)                            = −(Yt )1−θ ⋅ θσV 2 .
                                    ∂σ

The utility rate of transformation between proportionate changes in Yt and changes in                        is

given by

                                     − (∂U t / ∂σ )
         (12)                                          = θσV .
                                    (∂U t / ∂Yt ) ⋅ Yt

This expression gives the proportionate increase in initial GDP required to compensate, at

the margin, for a rise in . The parameters specified before imply                  V = 1.58.

Therefore, to maintain expected utility, an increase in            by, say, 10% (from 0.020 to

0.022) requires a rise in the initial level of GDP by approximately 0.32%. Since the

expected growth rate, g*, is held fixed, this proportionate rise in GDP level should be

viewed as applying each year.10

         These calculations apply for small changes in . Large changes, considered later,

recognize that the utility rate of transformation rises with            on the right-hand side of

Eq. (12). This consideration means that the welfare gain from setting                  to zero is smaller

in magnitude than the amount—3.2%—that would be calculated from Eq. (12) if the

utility rate of transformation were constant.


10
  Obstfeld (1994) observes that Lucas (1987, Ch. 3) gets far smaller estimates for the welfare cost of
consumption uncertainty because he treats the shock, analogous to ut in the present model, as a transitory
disturbance to the level of output.


                                                     9
        Consider now the welfare consequences from a change in the disaster probability,

p, for a given distribution of disaster sizes, b. Equations (6) and (7) imply

                           ∂U t
        (13)                    = −(Yt )1−θ ⋅ V 2 ⋅ [ E (1 − b)1−θ − 1 − Eb ⋅ (θ − 1)] /(θ − 1) .
                            ∂p

This formula applies while holding fixed the expected growth rate, g*; that is, it does not

allow for the negative effect of p on g*, for given g, in Eq. (2). The utility rate of

transformation between proportionate changes in Yt and changes in p is given by

                            − (∂U t / ∂p )
        (14)                                  = V ⋅ [ E (1 − b)1−θ − 1 − Eb ⋅ (θ − 1)] /(θ − 1) .
                           (∂U t / ∂Yt ) ⋅ Yt

With the parameter values used before, the right-hand side of Eq. (14) equals 14.3. As

before, the result applies to small changes. An increase in p by 10% (from 0.0170 to

0.0187) matches up approximately with a proportionate rise in initial GDP by 2.4%.

Again, this change in GDP level applies each year.

        We can modify the calculations to allow for the growth effect from a change in p;

that is, for given g, g* falls with p in Eq. (2).11 Using Eq. (4), the result in Eq. (14) is

modified to

                            − (∂U t / ∂p )
        (15)                                  = V ⋅ [ E (1 − b)1−θ − 1] /(θ − 1) .
                           (∂U t / ∂Yt ) ⋅ Yt

With the same parameter values as before, the right-hand side equals 20.0. Therefore, a

rise in p by 10% now matches up with a proportionate increase in GDP by 3.4%— larger

than before because of the decline in g*.

        As already noted, the formulas in Eqs. (10), (12), (14), and (15) apply locally; that

is, to small changes in Yt, g*, , and p. We can instead use Eqs. (6) and (7) to assess the

effects on expected utility from large changes. Let V and Yt be the values that apply for

the baseline specification of parameters. Let V* and (Yt)* be values that apply in an

alternative situation that delivers the same expected utility, Ut. Then the formula for Ut in

Eq. (6) implies

         (16)                       (Yt)*/Yt = (V*/V)1/(     -1)
                                                                   .

         As an aside, Alvarez and Jermann (2004) try to go as far as possible to gauge the

welfare costs of consumption uncertainty by observing or estimating various asset prices.

Equation (16) provides insight for the present model on the extent to which welfare costs

can be assessed from observations of asset prices related to equity shares. The price V

may be observable—in the Lucas-tree economy, V is the price-dividend ratio for

unlevered equity claims on trees. However, the price V* is unlikely to be observable:

V* is the price-dividend ratio for unlevered tree equity in a hypothetical economy, such

as one with zero uncertainty. If V* could be observed or estimated, Eq. (16) shows that

the welfare cost, measured by the compensating output change (Yt)*/Yt, depends

separately on the parameter , for given V and V*.

         Lucas focused on the consequences of eliminating all consumption uncertainty

associated with usual business fluctuations—in the present context, this exercise

corresponds to setting =0. The formula for V in Eq. (7) implies for this case
                                                                       2
                                    1/V* = 1/V + (1/2) ( -1)               .

Substituting into Eq. (16) yields12
                                                                               2
         (17)                       (Yt)*/ Yt = [1 + (1/2) ( -1)                   V]1/(1- ).



12
  If the magnitude of (1/2) ( -1) 2V is much less than one, the result simplifies to log[(Yt)*/Yt]
-(1/2) 2V; that is, one-half the size of the local effect implied by Eq. (12). This approximation is
satisfactory at the baseline specification, where (1/2) ( -1) 2V = 0.047.


                                                     11
With the parameter values assumed before, (Yt)* is 1.5% below Yt. That is, society

would be willing to give up 1.5% of output each year to eliminate all of the customary

economic fluctuations represented by . As noted before (n. 10), this effect is much

larger than that found by Lucas (1987) mainly because the impact of a shock, ut, on the

GDP level is permanent in the present model.

       Setting the disaster probability, p, to zero (or, equivalently, the disaster size, b, to

zero) has much greater consequences for welfare. The formula, based on Eqs. (7)

and (16), is

       (18)            (Yt)*/Yt = {1 + pV [E(1-b)1- – 1 – ( -1) Eb]}1/(1- ).

Note that this formula holds fixed the expected growth rate, g*; that is, it does not allow

for the inverse relation between p and g* in Eq. (2), for given g. With the same

parameter values as before, (Yt)* is 16.7% below Yt. Hence, when gauged by the

compensating proportionate change in output, eliminating disaster risk is worth about 10

times as much as eliminating normal economic fluctuations.

       Using Eq. (4), we can allow also for the negative growth effect of p (in Eq. [2]).

The formula modifies Eq. (18) to

       (19)            (Yt)*/Yt = {1 + pV [E(1-b)1- – 1]}1/(1- ).

With the usual parameter values, (Yt)* is 20.9% below Yt. This result is larger than

before because the reduction in p raises g*.

       We can also consider the elimination of all consumption uncertainty by setting

 =0 and p=0 (or b=0) simultaneously. If g* is held fixed, (Yt)* is 17.4% below Yt.

Allowing for the inverse relation between p and g*, the result is 21.4%. Not surprisingly,

the main effects in each case come from setting p=0.




                                               12
III. Sensitivity of the Welfare-Cost Estimates

       The welfare-cost estimates, including the effects from eliminating all disaster risk,

depend particularly on the preference parameter, . In the baseline specification with

 =4, the elimination of all disaster risk (setting p=0) balances with a proportionate cut in

initial output by 20.9% (for the case that includes the inverse relation between p and g*).

       For lower , with the rest of the specification unchanged, the compensating

proportionate decline in initial GDP is 15.7% when =3, 14.8% when =2, and 18.6%

when =1. Thus, the results are not highly sensitive to variations in . The reason that

the impact of is non-monotonic is that this parameter picks up two effects—lower

means a smaller coefficient of relative risk aversion and a larger intertemporal elasticity

of substitution. The discussion in section V shows that these two forces tend to have

offsetting implications for welfare effects.



IV. A Model with Endogenous Saving

       In the endowment economy, agents do not react to changes in uncertainty—shifts

in , p, and the probability distribution of b—by altering saving ratios or other choices.

Generally, the potential for such adjustments affects the welfare costs—not at the margin

(by the envelope theorem) but for large changes in parameters. This section illustrates

this process by using a version of the tractable model of endogenous saving developed in

Barro (2006, section VIII).

       The quantity of trees is now variable and corresponds to the capital stock, Kt.

Production of fruit is given by an “AK” production function:

       (20)                            Yt = AKt.




                                               13
Unlike the previous model, the productivity level, A>0, is constant. Output can be

consumed as fruit or invested as seed. The creation of new trees through planting seeds

is rapid enough so that, as in the conventional one-sector production framework, the fruit

price of trees (capital) is pegged at a price normalized to one. This setting corresponds to

“Tobin’s q” equaling one—unlike in the previous model, where the market price of trees

was variable.

       The capital stock varies because of gross investment, It, and depreciation,                   t+1Kt:


       (21)                        Kt+1 = Kt + It –     t+1Kt.


The depreciation rate is stochastic and equal to

       (22)                         t+1   = + ut+1 + vt+1,
                                                                                             2
where 0< <1. The ut+1 shock, normally distributed with mean 0 and variance                       ,

represents normal fluctuations, as in the previous setting. The vt+1 shock represents rare

disasters, again as in the earlier model. With probability 1-p, vt+1 = 0, and with

probability p, vt+1 = -b; that is, the fraction b (0<b<1) of the trees is destroyed. The

analysis requires 0<    t+1<1.   However, this restriction holds with probability one as the
                                                                 2
length of the period approaches zero, assuming that                  and p are proportional to the

length of the period.

       Since the market price of trees is pegged at one, the expected rate of return on

equity shares is given immediately by

       (23)                        re = A – – p Eb.

Because the shocks, ut+1 and vt+1, are i.i.d. (permanent to the levels of capital stock and

GDP), the ratio of gross investment (and gross saving) to the capital stock will be

optimally chosen as a constant, denoted by . One way to determine is to use the usual




                                                   14
consumption-based asset-pricing formula for equity shares, combined with the condition

that the price of these shares equals unity. As the length of the period approaches zero,

the saving ratio is given by
                                                                       2
        (24)               = + (1/ ) [A – –          + (1/2) ( -1)         - p + p E(1-b)1- ].

If >1, rises with       and p (and with a shift in the distribution of b toward larger values).

The expected growth rate of the economy is

        (25)             Et(Kt+1/Kt – 1) = – – p Eb.

        I calibrate this model using the same parameter values as for the endowment

economy. To get a full match, the expected growth rate, given by Eq. (25), has to equal

the value g* = 0.020, given by Eq. (2). This condition pins down the parameter

combination A – , which turns out to equal 0.076 per year. It is then straightforward to

show that the expected rate of return on equity, the risk-free rate,13 and the equity

premium in the endogenous-saving model coincide with those in the endowment

economy. Substitution of the assumed parameter values into Eq. (24) yields a gross

saving ratio, , equal to 0.025 + . For example, if = 0.05, = 0.075. That is, annual

gross saving and investment equal 7.5% of the capital stock.

        The interesting new results on welfare costs apply to large changes; for example,

setting =0 or p=0. We can again express the effects in terms of proportionate declines

in levels of GDP (and capital stock) that would be willingly exchanged for each kind of

reduction in uncertainty. These welfare effects in the endogenous-saving model coincide

with those for the endowment economy if the gross saving ratio, , is constrained to

remain fixed at its initial value (0.075). Specifically, the offsetting proportionate


13
  In the endowment model, the risk-free rate is rf = + g – (1/2) ( +1) 2 – p [E(1-b)- – 1]—see Barro
(2006, Eq. [12]). The formula in the endogenous-saving model is rf = A – – 2 – p [E(1-b)- – E(1-b)1- ].


                                                  15
reductions in GDP are 1.53% for setting =0, 20.9% for p=0, and 21.4% for =p=0.14 In

effect, with held fixed, the endogenous-saving model operates like an endowment

economy.

         The results are different if the saving ratio, , is free to adjust to the changes in

and p, in accordance with the optimal response given by Eq. (24). Since the optimal

saving response cannot make the situation worse, the offsetting output variations for

eliminating uncertainty must be at least as large as those in the endowment economy.15

For the calibration parameters already mentioned, the results are

         setting =0, saving ratio, , falls from 0.0750 to 0.0744, welfare effect = 1.55%,

         setting p=0, falls to 0.0620, welfare effect = 26.1%,

         setting p= =0, falls to 0.0614, welfare effect = 27.0%.

         For the case where =0, the impact of allowing for the small decline in the saving

ratio (from 0.0750 to 0.0744) is minor. Hence, the welfare effect, 1.55%, differs

negligibly from that, 1.53%, in the endowment economy. However, when considering

p=0, the significant reduction in the saving ratio (from 0.075 to 0.062) raises the welfare

effect substantially. The output that would be willingly relinquished to eliminate disaster

risk rises from 20.9% to 26.1%. Note that we could instead start from =0 or p=0 and

compute the proportionate increase in GDP required to compensate for an increase in

or p. In this case, the optimal adjustment of the saving ratio (upward) reduces the welfare

effect in the sense of the compensating, proportionate change in GDP.




14
   These effects are the same as before if the calculation for the endowment economy (as in Eq. [19])
includes the growth effect from p through the term -p Eb in Eq. (2).
15
   If =1, does not depend on or p, and the results are the same as those as in the case where is
constrained not to vary.

V. Epstein-Zin-Weil Preferences

           The results apply thus far under time-separable, iso-elastic preferences, for which

the coefficient of relative risk aversion equals the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity

of substitution. Obstfeld (1994) observed that welfare effects from uncertainty differ

under the preference formulations of Epstein and Zin (1989) and Weil (1990), in which

the coefficient of relative risk aversion is de-linked from the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution.

           Using a minor modification of the Weil (1990) formulation, the utility formula is


           (26)     Ut =
                              {(1 − β )C          1−θ

                                                                                                         (1−γ ) /(1−θ )

                                                                                                                          ,
                                                                 (1 − β )(1 − γ )

where the discount factor                       equals 1/(1+ ), 1/ > 0 is the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution, and >0 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Equation (3) is the

special case of Eq. (26) with = .

           A key property of the Lucas-tree environment with i.i.d. shocks is that attained

utility, Ut, ends up as a simple function of contemporaneous GDP, Yt. Aside from an

inconsequential additive constant, the formula is

           (27)                                               Ut = Yt1- ,

where depends on the parameters of the model.16 Using Eq. (27), a standard

perturbation argument generates the first-order conditions for the maximization of Ut in

Eq. (26). The result is

                                                                1

where Rt is the gross, one-period return on any asset. A key property of Eq. (28) is that

the exponents on Ct and Ct+1 involve , the coefficient of relative risk aversion, not , the

reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. The second point is that the

effective rate of time preference, *, differs from                             when and diverge. Specifically,

 * is given (if            1) by

                                                                                  p

                                                                                γ −1

             Equations (28) and (29) imply that the asset-pricing formulas derived from the

model with time-additive, iso-elastic preferences continue to apply if replaces and *

replaces . The reciprocal of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, , affects levels

of rates of return and the price-dividend ratio, V—through influences on *—but not the

equity premium. Therefore, with =4 (and the same parameters as before for the GDP

process), the extended version of preferences in Eq. (26) fits the equity premium exactly

as the original model.

             The formula for the price-dividend ratio, V, changes (if                              1) from Eq. (4) to

                                                                                                θ −1

                                                                                                γ −1

Therefore, V now rises with uncertainty (an increase in                                or p or a shift of the b-

distribution toward higher values) only if >1. For example, for any , V is invariant

with the uncertainty parameters if =1.17



17
 In the AK model with endogenous saving from the previous section, the saving ratio under Epstein-Zin-
Weil preferences generalizes from Eq. (24) to
                                                                      θ −1

                                                                      γ −1
with more uncertainty (higher or p or a shift of the b-distribution toward larger values) if >1. That is,
this precautionary saving effect depends on intertemporal substitution, not risk aversion.

                                   ρ (θ −γ ) /(1−θ )
           (31)             Ut = (                   ) ⋅ V (1−γ ) /(1−θ ) ⋅ Yt1−γ .
                                      1− γ

Equations (30) and (31) can be used, as before, to assess welfare effects from changes in

parameters. The result is that the form of Eq. (16) continues to apply (see n. 18):

           (32)                        (Yt)*/Yt = (V*/V)1/(             -1)
                                                                              .

The difference from before is that has to be interpreted as the reciprocal of the

intertemporal elasticity of substitution, not the coefficient of relative risk aversion, .

However, affects the calculations of welfare effects through its influence on the price-

dividend ratio, V, determined in Eq. (30).

           Table 1 shows how the preference parameters, and , affect the computed

welfare effects from eliminating uncertainty (p=0 or =0). The first line, where = =4,

corresponds to the results derived before for the model with time-additive, iso-elastic

preferences. The welfare effect from setting p=0 corresponds to a proportionate

reduction in initial GDP by 20.9%. (This calculation includes the positive effect on the

growth rate, g*, in Eq. [2].) The next three lines stay within the time-additive, iso-elastic

model by reducing and together from 4 to 1. As noted before, the welfare effect from

setting p=0 is 15.7% at = =3, 14.8% at = =2, and 18.6% at = =1.

           The next part of the table considers reductions in from 4 to 1, while holding

fixed =4. Hence, these exercises isolate changes in the coefficient of relative risk

aversion, holding fixed the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Equations (30)

and (32) imply that a reduction in lowers the welfare effect from uncertainty—that is,

18
     As usual, cases where or approach 1 can be handled as limits.


                                                             19
lower risk aversion makes uncertainty less costly. Quantitatively, the table shows that the

effect from setting p=0 declines from 20.9% at =4 to 12.6% at =3, 8.5% at =2, and

6.3% at =1. A problem, however, is that decreases in substantially lower the equity

premium. The model’s predicted premium is 5.9% at =4, 2.5% at =3, 1.1% at =2, and

0.4% at =1. Hence, if is much below 4, the predictions deviate substantially from

observed equity premia of around 6% (see Table 2).19 The model’s implications for

welfare costs of uncertainty likely should not be taken seriously in the range of values for

     where the model fails to get into the right ballpark for explaining the equity premium.

          It is possible to restore reasonable predictions for the equity premium at low if

the disaster probability, p, is raised above 1.7% per year. At =3, p has to be 4.1% to

generate the same equity premium, 5.9%, as originally. But then the elimination of all

disaster risk (setting p or b to zero) turns out to balance against a proportionate decline in

initial output by 41.5%, well above the 20.9% calculated originally. The point is not that

this unrealistically high disaster probability—p above 4% per year—should be taken

seriously. Rather, the inference is that disciplining the model to be consistent with

observed asset returns, notably the high equity premium, tends to generate large estimates

for the welfare benefits from eliminating all disaster risk.

          The final lines of Table 1 consider reductions in from 4 to 1, holding fixed =4.

Hence, these exercises isolate changes in the intertemporal elasticity of substitution,

holding fixed the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Equations (30) and (32) imply that

a decrease in generally has an ambiguous impact on the magnitude of welfare effects.

However, in the relevant range, a reduction in raises welfare effects, along the lines


19
  The prediction is still sharply at odds with the data if one allows for leverage in the observed stock
returns.

discussed by Obstfeld (1994, section 3). In effect, a lower works like a lower in

magnifying the present value of the stream of welfare costs. Quantitatively, the table

shows that, if =4, the welfare effect from setting p=0 rises from 20.9% when =4 to

25.2% at =3, 31.9% at =2, and 43.7% at =1. Unlike the calculations for alternative

values of , these results do not interact with the equity premium, which depends on ,

not .



VI. Alvarez-Jermann and Risk-Free Interest Rates

        As mentioned before, Alvarez and Jermann (2004), henceforth AJ, gauge the

welfare cost of aggregate consumption uncertainty from an approach that tries to rely on

asset prices. In a general way, my analysis follows their idea that welfare-cost estimates

should be disciplined to be consistent with observed patterns in asset prices and returns.

An earlier expression of this idea is in Atkeson and Phelan (1994).

        AJ observe (p. 1225) that the “marginal cost of consumption fluctuations [equals]

the ratio of the values of two securities: a claim to the consumption trend … and a claim

to aggregate consumption …” In the Lucas-tree economy, the claim to aggregate

consumption corresponds to an equity share on a tree and has the price V determined in

Eq. (7) (for the case of time-additive, iso-elastic utility). This price is positive and finite

if the expected rate of return on equity, re in Eq. (5), exceeds the expected growth rate of

GDP and consumption, * in Eq. (2). This inequality is the transversality condition for

the model.

        A problem arises with the price of a claim to the consumption trend—the

payments on this claim would start at the initial level of per capita GDP and consumption




                                               21
and then grow at a constant rate, g*=2% per year in the models considered before. The

rate of return on this security equals the risk-free rate, rf. The price of such a claim is

finite only if rf > g*. However, there is no reason for this inequality to hold—in fact, rf

can be negative. In the baseline calibrations of the endowment and endogenous-saving

models, rf turns out to be positive—1.2%—but less than g*, 2.0%.

        Table 2 shows growth rates and real rates of return for 1880-2004 for 11 OECD

countries with available data.20 The table reports four concepts of growth rates: for per

capita and levels of real consumer expenditure and GDP. In the Lucas-tree model with

constant population, the four concepts coincide. When consumption and GDP diverge,

consumption—proxied by real consumer expenditure in the data—would be the relevant

variable for asset pricing. However, this distinction is empirically unimportant in the

present context, because the long-term growth rates of real consumer expenditure and

GDP are similar.

        When population is growing, assets would still be priced in relation to variations

over time in per capita consumption. However, if new people enter the economy as

children tied altruistically to parents, the AJ claim to the consumption trend would relate

to the trend of the level of consumption, not consumption per capita. (A family dynasty

would want to provide in a risk-free way for new members as well as for rising

consumption per person.) Thus, in this context, the relevant growth rates in Table 2 are



20
  I excluded countries that were missing data on asset returns during major crises—Austria, Belgium, and
the Netherlands around World Wars I and II; Finland, New Zealand, Portugal, and Switzerland around
World War I; and Spain during the Spanish Civil War. See the notes to Table 1 for a listing of years of
missing data for the 11 included countries. From a selection standpoint, the most serious concerns are the
missing data on bond returns in Germany for 1880-1923 and Sweden for 1880-1921. These omissions
cover World War I and the German hyperinflation and, therefore, miss times of low real rates of return on
bonds. The mean values shown in Table 2 for bond returns in Germany and Sweden for 1880-2004 use bill
returns for the periods of missing bond data.


                                                   22
those for the levels variables. These growth rates include population growth and are, not

surprisingly, substantially higher than the per capita growth rates.

           Table 2 shows three real rates of return—on stocks, short-term bills (analogous to

U.S. Treasury bills21), and long-term bonds (typically 10-year government bonds). The

first observation is that the average real rate of return on stocks—7.4% per year—clearly

exceeded the average growth rates. This pattern would still hold if we took account of

leverage to estimate the average real rate of return on unlevered equity. A second

observation is that the average real rate of return on bills—1.0%—fell short of the

average growth rates. Finally, the average real rate of return on bonds—2.2%—was

close to the average per capita growth rates—1.9% for consumer expenditure and 2.1%

for GDP—but less than the average growth rates of levels—2.8% and 3.0%, respectively.

           In the models (with i.i.d. shocks to GDP and consumption), the term structure of

risk-free rates is flat. Therefore, in this setting, one could equally well examine short-

term or long-term risk-free rates. More generally, a long-term risk-free rate would be

relevant for pricing a claim on the consumption trend. A problem in the data is the

absence of risk-free assets—indexed bonds issued by the U.S., U.K. and other

governments come close, but these securities exist only recently. The observed real

returns on conventional short-term bills or long-term bonds are not risk-free returns,

given especially the uncertainty about inflation. Unexpected inflation amounts to a form

of partial default on nominal debt and tends to be high in bad economic times, especially

wartime economic crises. This pattern means that hypothetical risk-free rates tend to be

lower than observed averages of real rates of return on bills and bonds. Thus, my

inference from Table 2 is that, for the OECD countries in the long run, risk-free rates
21
     In some cases, such as the United States before 1922, the data are for commercial paper.


                                                       23
were likely lower than expected growth rates, particularly growth rates of levels of

consumption and GDP.22

         When the risk-free rate is below the expected growth rate, the AJ measure of the

“marginal cost of all consumption uncertainty” is infinity. AJ demonstrate (section V)

that their marginal cost is an upper bound for the total cost of all consumption uncertainty

in the sense of Lucas (1987) and in my estimates (with p and                  both set to zero).

Obviously, this result is consistent with the finding that the AJ measure of the marginal

cost of all consumption uncertainty is likely to be infinite. My conclusion is that it is

unclear, at this point, how to estimate welfare costs purely from observations of asset

prices (even ones on hypothetical claims).



VII. Concluding Observations

         The baseline parameter value =0.02 per year represents the extent of business

fluctuations during the tranquil post-World War II years in the United States and other

OECD countries. This period was calm for the OECD countries when considered in

comparison to the first half of the 20th century, a turbulent time that featured World

Wars I and II and the Great Depression. Hence, a reduction in                   amounts to making

milder the business fluctuations that were already strikingly tame. Not surprisingly, the

benefit from this change—corresponding to around 1.5-2% of GDP each year—is only

moderate (though still important).

         In contrast, the probability parameter p and size parameter b refer to major

economic disasters, such as those that occurred in many countries during World Wars I


22
  Another consideration that reinforces this conclusion is that after-tax real returns tend to be lower than
the measured gross returns.


                                                      24
and II and the Great Depression. Outside of the OECD, we can also think of p and b as

relating to events such as the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, the Latin-American

debt crisis of the early 1980s, and the Argentine exchange-rate crisis of 2001-02. A

reduction in p amounts to lowering the chance of repeating these kinds of extreme events,

and a fall in b amounts to decreasing the likely size of these events. To go further,

decreases in p or b constitute reductions in the probability or size of disasters not yet seen

or, at least, not seen in the 20th century. Included here would be nuclear conflicts, large-

scale natural disasters (tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, asteroid collisions), and

epidemics of disease (Black Death, avian flu). My estimates indicate that the welfare

effects from eliminating all uncertainty of this kind are large—10 times or more the

effects for normal economic fluctuations.

       Macroeconomic stabilization policies, including monetary policy, relate to both

types of uncertainty— on the one hand and p or b on the other hand. The policies may

also affect the long-term expected growth rate, g*. Well known is the success of OECD

countries in achieving low and stable inflation since the mid-1980s. This success is

sometimes argued to have contributed to milder business fluctuations (lower ) and

perhaps to stronger average economic growth (higher g*). However, commentaries on

monetary policy frequently also stress the roles of central banks in exacerbating or

moderating major economic crises. For example, Friedman and Schwartz (1963) blame

the Federal Reserve for the severity of the Great Depression in the United States, as well

as for the sharp recession of 1937-38. Observers of Alan Greenspan’s tenure as Fed chair

often focus on his role in apparently moderating the consequences of the global stock-

market crash of 1987 and the Long-Term Capital Management/Russian crisis of 1998.




                                             25
These policy actions—if they really were effective—have more to do with lowering p

and b than decreasing . A key, unresolved issue is whether and how a monetary

authority can act to reduce the probability, p, and size, b, of economic collapses.

       Other governmental institutions and policies can also affect disaster probabilities

and sizes. For example, the formation of the European Union and the adoption of the

euro have often been analyzed as influences on the extent of business fluctuations ( ) and

the average rate of economic growth (g*), sometimes focusing on the role of international

trade in goods and assets. However, from a political perspective, the main force behind

the adoption of these institutions was likely the desire to avoid a repetition of World

War II; that is, to reduce the disaster probability, p, applicable to war. This perceived

impact on disaster probability related to war is likely to be a key element in explaining

why these institutions exist in Western Europe. Of course, this perception may be

inaccurate—forcing Germany and France to share monetary, fiscal, and other policies

may ultimately create more conflict than it eliminates. Thus, an important research topic

is the actual influence of various policies and institutions on the probability and size of

disasters, including wars.
