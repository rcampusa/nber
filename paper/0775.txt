                    MONETARY AGGREGATES AS TARGETS:
                       SOME THEORETICAL ASPECTS




                               ABSTRACT




             In the mid—1970s the Bank of Canada, along with a number

of other central banks, began to set explicit targets for monetary growth

and to emphasize the long—run role of monetary aggregates in controlling

the rapid upward trend of prices.

            There are three distinct ways of viewing and interpreting

a policy of setting growth targets for monetary aggregates. The first

is associated with the work of William Poole, the second is derived from

the reduced—form model initially developed at the Federal Reserve Bank

of St. Louis, and the third, which the author has labelled the feedback—

rule approach, is related to the techniques developed within central banks

to implement the policy of monetary targeting. In this paper the author

sets forth the logic and examines the implications of these three methods

when the principal aim of policy is reducing the rate of inflation. He

also examines the question of gradualist versus Tlcold_showerht policies

and the criteria for selecting a monetary aggregate as a policy target.

     In the mid—1970s the Bank of Canada, along with a number

of other central banks, began to set explicit targets for
monetary qrowth and to emphasize the lonq—run role of monetary

aggregates in controlling the rapid upward trend of prices.

The central banks were respcnding in large measure to a change
in the environment in which economic policies were being

formulated. Whereas for most of the postwar period policy had
been concerned with unemployment and stabilization of the

cycle, events of the late 1960s and early 1970s had brought
inflation to the fore as the main economic challenge. The
change in policy thrust was backed up by a great deal of
theoretical and empirical work that provided both the
rationale for the new policies and the confidence that they

could be applied in a sensible fashion.1

     In examining the research underlying the policy of
setting monetary targets one finds three distinct ways of
viewing and interpretinq the rationale of such a policy. The
first is associated with the work of Poole, the second is

derived from the reduced—form model initially developed at the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and the third, which I have


1.   For a discussion of the Canadian approach to policy in
     the 1970s see Freeman (1978), Bank of Canada (1975, 1976,
     1977, 1978, 1979), Courchene (1976, 1977), and the
     symposium on monetary policy in Canada in the November
     1979 issue of the Canadian Journal of Economics by
     Courchene, Fortin, Sparks and White (1979). A brief
     overview of the U.S. approach to policy can be found in
     Friedman (1977a).
labelled the feedback—rule approach, is related to the

techniques developed within central banks to implement the

policy of monetary targeting. In this paper I set forth the
logic and examine the implications of each of the approaches

when the principal aim of policy is reducing the rate of
inflation. Although the issues discussed will reflect the
kinds of problems that have arisen in Canada in the mid— to

late—1970s, the focus of the analysis will be theoretical; I

will not attempt to assess the actual events and policies of
this period.
     I begin in   Section   2 with the simple IS—LM model of the
static economy that underlies at least some of the academic

discussion of a monetary aggregates policy. Although useful
as an expository device for introducing the three ways of

interpreting an aqqregates policy, this model has very severe
limitations in   that   it does not allow for the existence of

inflatinn. In Section 3 of the paper I therefore extend the
model to include an augmented Phillips curve and inflationary

expectations. Although still relatively simple and easy to
manipulate, the extended model is sufficiently rich to allow
us to derive the implications for output, unemployment,

inflation rates and interest rates of a policy of gradual

deceleration over time of monetary growth. Both theory and
the results of simulating various empirical models are used in
the analysis to investigate the nature of the time paths that
arise from such an anti—inflationary policy.
                             —3—

     Next, this model is used to analyze the three different

ways of interpreting monetary aggregates in the context of an

inflationary setting.   I also examine the question of

gradualist versus "cold—shower" policies and, in Section 4,

suggest criteria for selecting the appropriate monetary
aggregate. Although the model and the discussion assume a

closed economy, the extension to an open economy with flexible
exchange rates will be referred to in passing and in
footnotes. 2


2.   The important operational question of whether the central
     bank uses base control or interest rate control as its
     mechanism for affecting the growth of the monetary
     agqreqate will not be addressed in this paper. See
     Freedman (1981) for an analysis of some of the
     implications of using the monetary base or bank reserves
     to control a monetary aggregate.
      2 MONETARY POLICY IN A SIMPLE NON-INFLATIONARY MODEL

      To date, research on the use of monetary aggregate

targets as control mechanisT h'iS followed three main routes
of inquiry. These can be                       t:ue Poole approach, the
reduced—form     approach,      and   i:    approach. To
                                              edhack—rule
analyze these approaches 1 :S    tns section a simple model
without inflation; in the ne: section the same three
approaches will he anayze:                 te context    o a somewhat more
complex   model with inflation.

2.1   The Model

      Begin with the followitiq standard IS—LM model of a
non—inflationary economy:

      lnY(t) =   a(t)    -
                             bR(tI                                        (1)

      lnM(t) = c —      dR(t)   + elnY(t) + v(t).                         (2)


All coefficients throughout tee paper are postulated to be
positive, Equation (1), the IS curve, relates nominal income
(Y), which is equivalent to            real   output in a world without

inflation, to government expenditure (included in a(t)),
nominal interest rates (R) and a non—observable random

variable term (u). A non'-ioqai-ithmic equation of this type

can easily be derived from a simple Keynesian—style model of

commodity demand with a consumption function, an investment
function (with investment inversely related to the interest
rate) and an income equilibrium condition in which income
                                         —6—

equals the sum of consumption, investment, and government
expenditure. Since there is no inflation in the model, no

distinction needs to be made between nominal and real rates of

interest in the determination of real output. Equation (2)
equates the supply of money CM) with the demand for money,

which is a function of income, interest rates and a
non—observable random variable (v). The demand for money can
be derived from either a transaction approach as analyzed

originally by Baumol (1952) and Tohin (1956) or a

choice—theoretic approach as exposited by Friedman (1959).
     Equations (1) and (2) are the structural equations of the

IS—LM framework. If the exogenous variables of the system are

money and government expenditure then the reduced—form
equations express Y and R as functions of a and M.



      lnY(t) =              [da(t)   -   bc + blnM(t)        -    bv(t)   +    du(t)}    (3)



     R(L) =
              d+be [ea(t) +
                            c            -   lnM(t)       v(t)     +   eu(t)].           (4)




Alternatively, if the exogenous variables are interest rates

and government expenditures, then the reduced—form equations
express Y and M as functions of a and R:


     lnY(t) =    a(t)   —    bR(t)   +   u(t)                                           (5)

     lnM(t) = c +       ea(t)   —    (d+be)R(t)       +   eu(t)    +   v(t).            (6)



3.   For an up—to—date survey of money demand equations see
     Laidler (1977).
                                      —7—
     Before proceeding to analyze this static IS—LM system, I
set out the equations for a system with an identical economic

structure in which the effect on left—hand--side variables of a

change in right—hand-side variables occurs with a distributed

lag. This system will prove useful later in the analysis.
The easiest way to represent and solve such a system is via

the use of lag operator notation.4 In this notation,

     LkX =   X(t-k)
     B(L)R =     (B0L° + B1L'     + B2L2 +     ... + BL)R
                B0R(t) +   B1R(t-1)    +   B2R(t-2)   +   ... + BR(t-n)   -




The sum of the coefficients in the distributed lag is

represented by


     B(l)       B0l° + B111 + B212 +       ... + BJ
            =B0 +B1 +B2 +          ... +B.
Equations (1) and (2) can be rewritten with lags as equations

(1') and (2').

     mY = A(L)a     —   B(L)R +   u                                       (1')

     lnM = c — D(L)R +      E(L)lnY   +    v                              (2')


The reduced—form equations in which M and a are treated as
exogenous variables are shown in (3') and (4').

4.   For a good discussion of lag operators see Griliches
     (1 967).

5.   For the sake of simplicity u and v are introduced without
     distributed lags.
                                 —8—

     mY =
             (L)E(L)       [D(L)A(L)a -       B(L)c      B(L)lnM              (3')

                            -   B(L)v   +   D(L)u]

     R =                                                +v   +   E(L)U]       (4')
           D(L)+B(L)E(L) [E(L)A(L)a
                                    + c         1fl14                     .




Finally,   for purposes of future discussion I take the first

difference of equation (3') and present it as equation (3").

      AmY =                     [i)(LjA(L)a     + B(L)A1nM                    (3")

                                 -   B(L)Av + D(L)Au].


2.2 The Poole Approach
     In    a pair of pathbreakinq    articles, Poole (1970a, 1971)
analyzed   the question of whether the authorities should use

the interesb rate or the money supply as their instrument,
given a target level of income, YT, and known parameters of

equa: (1) and (2).6 it is easily shown that, if there
were nc random errors, then it would not matter in the least
which one was used. As can be seen in Figure 1, Chart A, the
appropriate setting of the interest rate (denoted as RT) is

that which intersects the IS curve at YT; similarly the
appropriate setting of the money supply is that which causes

the LM curve to intersect the IS curve at YT.


6.   For an analysis of policy setting when parameters are not
     known with certainty, see Brainard (1967).

     However, when error terms are assumed to shift the IS
curve and/or the UI curve in ways that cannot be directly

observed, the choice of instrument wi.l1 have substantive

implications for the economy. This can be seen intuitively in
the two polar cases usually focused on in this type of
discussion.7 In one the LM curve is stable (v = U) and the
IS curve shifts (Chart B) in the other the IS curve is stable
(u = 0) arid the UI curve shifts (Chart C). In Chart B the IS
curve is assumed to shift between IS1 an 152 and the UI curve
is stable. If the authorities set R at RT, income will
fluctuate betwcen Y1 and Y2. On the other hand if M is set at

MT (giving IT when IS is at it normal IS0 position) then
income will fluctuate on'y between 13 and 14. Obviously in
this case the authorities should set M and let R fluctuate,

and monetary policy will act as an automatic stabilizer of

econom fluctuations.
     Nc uppose instead that, as the demand for money shifts,
the LM curve fluctuates between LM1 and LM2 and the IS curve

is stable. s shown in Chart C, setting the money supply at
MT will lead to shifts in income between 11 and      If the

authorities set the interest rate at RT, income will remain
unchanged at YT regardless of the movements of the LM curve.

Thus the intuition to be qained from Poole is that the
authorities should use the money supply as an instrument


7.   See Poole (1970a, 1971) and LeRoy and Lindsey (1978).
                              — 11 —



if   the IS curve is volatile and the rM   curve is stable, and
the interest rate as an instrument if the demand for money is
volatile and the IS curve is stable.8
      Poole extends the analysis to deal with the more general

case in which both curves shift and their shifts can he
positively or negatively correlated with each other. One can

ue equations (3) and (5) to calculate the variance of income
around its target level when M or R are set at MT or RT to

achieve YT for u = v = 0.   Minimization of income variance,

the criterion for choice between M and R as instrument,

involves comparing expressions that contain the variance of u,
the variance of v, and the covariance between them as well as
the coefficients d, h, and e. The amount of information
required to implement this approach is thus rather substantial

since one has to know the size of error variances and

covariances and the crucial structural parameters of the

system. Further, if this knowledge is available, one can
carry out short—run fine tuning in response to any known shift

in any of the exogenous variables of the system. For example,

if the aggregate expenditure curve shifted upward (upward
shift in a(t)), this model indicates that M should be reduced

so as to offset the increase in Y that would occur if policy


8.    If the demand for money were volatile in the very short
      run, say over a week, hut quite stable over the longer
      run, say over six months, the analysis would imply
      emphasis on interest rates in the very short run and on
      the money supply in the longer run.
                               — 12 —



were left unchanged. Similarly in the extension to a system
with lags, a change in an exogenous variable whose effect was
expected to persist for more than one period would likely

entail a series of offsetting changes over time in the policy
instrument, whether M or R.9
     This activist element in the formal Poole approach can

also be interpreted in terms of the indicator or information

role of financial variables in the absence of complete
information.0 Suppose, for example, that both the money
supply numbers and interest rate data are available with

virtually no lag but that GNP data are available with only a
substantial lag. One cannot use equations (1) and (2) to
deduce the values of u or v in the period in which they occur
because the value of Y is not available. The problem then
becomes one of trying to use the information contained in
movements of the financial variables M and R, as well as


9.   Poole himself clearly points out the implied activist
     nature of his model in the section entitled "A Dynamic
     Model" in Poole (1970a). It is rather curious that his
     approach has become associated with the notion of a
     passive setting of the instruments of policy, a result
     that holds only in the simple static version of the
     theory. The other element of the Poole approach that has
     usually been neglected in later discussions is the
     "combination policy" in which the central bank in effect
     calculates a money supply rule that is generally superior
     to the constant R or the constant M policy discussed
     above.
10. A formal analysis of the problem that has been couched in
     these terms can be found in Kareken, Muench and Wallace
     (1973) and in Friedman (1975). For a simple diagrammatic
     analysis of the role of the information variable, see
     Mitchell (1980).

 knowledge of past behavioural and stochastic relationships, in
 order to act in such a way as to minimize the variance of Y

 over time. Thus, in an economy with a volatile IS curve and a
 stable demand for money, an incipient increase in M will
 inform the observer that the [S curve has shifted to the right

and hence that monetary policy should be tightened (R up or M
down). On the other hand, in an economy with a stable IS
curve and a volatile money demand, an incipient increase in N
will indicate a random increase in money demand and hence will

entail an increase in money supply (i.e., P constant). With
both IS and LM curves volatile, knowledqe of past variances
and covariance of the error Leri u and v will be needed to
deduce the optimal policy that will minimize the variance of
income. 1 1


       The literature derivin from the Poole approach has
branched in two directions. The first deals with the question
of whether the authorities should use reserves or interest
rates as their instrument, in aiming at the money supply

intermediate target.12 This has in turn led to an
examination of the logic of a two—stage procedure in which,

11. Note the implicit assumption in this analysis that there
     can be substantial deleterious effects on income from not
     adjusting the policy settings over the period in which
     the income data are unavailable. There exists research
     in Canada indicating that a less—than—optimal setting of
     the instruments for short periods of time has only
     relatively small effects on the economy. See Duquay and
     Jenkins (1978).

say, interest rates are used to aim at money and money to aim
at income (Friedman (1975, 1977a)), and of the general role of

information in setting policy (Kareken, Muench, and Wallace
(1973), Friedman (1975)).13 The second extension has been to
add an external sector to the model and examine the role of

exchange rates in the analysis (Henderson (1979), Boyer
(1978), Sparks (1979)). Since exchange rate data are also
available with virtually no lag, one can treat the exchange

rate as a possible intermediate target or as an information

variable.


2.3 The Reduced—Form Approach
     The second approach to monetary targeting is based on the
reduced—form analysis of the effects of the money supply on
income. Equations (1) and (2) can he solved to give Y as a
function of M as shown above in equation (3). However, since
the reduced—form model has empirically been implemented in
terms of a distributed lag model, it makes more sense to
derive it in terms of equations (1') and (2') that allow for
lags. As shown in equation (3'), Y can be written as a
distributed laq on M, u and v, and in a more general model on

any shift in a(t) caused by, for example, changes in taxes,

13. This strand of the literature has shifted the focus of
     attention away from the optimal instrument towards the
     question of how new information should be used. One
     conclusion of these articles is that all available
     information should be looked at in the setting of policy.
                                   — 15 —



government expenditures, or exports.14 If equation (3') is
first—differenced, we have the more usual St. Louis type of

equation with nominal income growth written as a function of
the growth of money as shown in equation (3").

      An equation such as (3!) is sometimes used as the basis
for the argument that if the growth of money is held stable

then the growth of income will he stable.15 The emphasis on
the reduced—form equation (3w) rather than on the structural

equations (1') and (2!) 'erives from the belief that it is
much more difficult empirically to       capture   the IS curve

directly than it is to capture it indirectly via equation
(31).16 The reasons for this belief range from the

difficulty of finding appropriate measures for all the
interest rates entering into the determination of consumption

and investment to the possibility that money has a direct
effect on expenditure that cannot be encompassed easily in an

equation such as (1 '   ) but   whose effect on income will show up
in a reduced—form equation.17 It is worth noting in

14. The seminal article on reduced—form models is Anderson
     and Jordan (1968). For the application of such models to
     Canada see Duguay (1978).
15. In a non—inflationary, non—growth world the argument
     would be couched in terms of levels of money and levels
     of income.
16. One of the conditions necessary for equation (3") to fit
     well is that Av be small relative to A1nM, i.e., that the
     demand for money be reasonably well defined.

17.   In Section 3.3 I discuss some empirical problems related
      to the estimation of reduced—form models.
                             — 16 —



connection with this approach that if equation (3') or (3")
were really well specified one could implement a counter—
cyclical activist policy in which changes in money growth
rates were used to offset exogenous shifts in expenditure and

other shocks to the system.18 Despite the inherent logic of
this point, believers in reduced—form models tend to oppose

the use of monetary policy for countercyclical purposes.


2.4 The Feedback—Rule Approach
     In a third approach9 to monetary targeting, interest
rates are set on the basis of a tendency of money growth to

diverge from its target growth path.2° Thus if money
incipiently grows faster than desired, the authorities will
raise interest rates and this will push money back down to its


18. See White (1978).
19. Although I treat the feedback rule as a separate
     approach, one might consider it as an offshoot of the
     Poole approach to policy in which attention is focused on
     th polar case in which, over the medium run, the LM
     curve is relatively stable and the IS curve is volatile.
     The principal additional elements in this approach are
     (a) the assumption that the authorities do not know the
     parameters of the IS curve and hence cannot implement an
     activist policy and (h) the attention paid to practical
     problems such as the means of avoiding instrument
     instability.
20. In the implementation of this approach, the authorities
     are likely to use a fan or band around the target growth
     path and change interest rates only when money moves
     outside the fan or the band. However, for expositional
     purposes I ignore the subtleties connected with the use
     of a fan or band.
                                       - 17   —




target.21      Conversely, when money incipiently grows more
slowly than desired, the authoriLies will reduce interest

rates and this will tend to raise money back to its target.

        There are two variants of this approach. In the ficst
and less interesting the authorities act to hold M equa to
its target regardless of whether the source of the increase in
morley demand is a random ;hift in money demand or an undesired
increase in income. In the second variant the authorities set
target money growth equal t tarqet income qrowth (A1nYT )22
times   the appropriate elasticity plus (less) any random
increase (decrease) in money demanded that can he identified.

I-ience it is only undesired increases in income that give rise

to interest rate changes.

        In the simple static model described above, this approach

can he formalized by setting money supply at its target level,

MT, in equation (2), first-differencing, and transposing
terms. This gives


        AR =                                                   (7)
                [eAlnY   + Av   —
                                    AInMT1



21.   Note that there is no independent role for the money
      supply in this approach. The authorities use interest
      rate changes to move along the money demand curve and
      money demand is assumed always to equal money supply. In
      the very short run the authorities use the setting of
      excess cash reserves at the chartered banks to influence
      short—term interest rates. See Dingle, Sparks, and
      Walker (1972) and White and Poloz (1980) for a detailed
      discussion of the technique of setting excess cash
      reserves by the Bank of Canada.

22. This would he zero in a completely static model.
                               — 18 —



The formalization of the second variant of the policy rule
discussed in the preceding paragraph is shown as equation (8).

   A1nMT = eA1nYT + Av.                                      (8)


Substituting (8) into (7) we have

   AR =   [AmY   -   A1nYT].                                 (9)


Thus the money rule can be shown to be formally equivalent to
a feedback rule on income growth. When income grows faster
than desired, interest rates are increased and when income

grows more slowly than desired, interest rates are

decreased.23 This policy can be treated as a form of


23. Given the formal equivalence of a feedback rule on money
     growth and another on income growth, one might wonder why
     the authorities do not dispense with the intermediate
     money tarqet and focus solely on a nominal income
     target. Indeed, this approach has been suggested by
     Tobin (1980). There are, however, good reasons for
     continuing to use an intermediate money target. In a
     world with lags the change in interest rates resulting
     from the movement of income away from its target will
     cause income to return to its target but only with a long
     lag. The same change in interest rates is likely to
     cause money to return to its tarqet much more quickly
     especially if the intermediate target is a narrow
     monetary aggregate, because both the movement of income
     back to its target and, as a separate factor, the change
     in interest rates, act in the same direction on money
     growth. The argument has often been made that it is
     important, both from the standpoint of the credibility of
     the authorities and as a means of ensuring their
     accountability, to choose a target that can be achieved
     within a reasonable horizon. Money fulfils this role
     whereas nominal income does not. An additional factor in
     reducing the usefulness of nominal income as a target is
     the large revisions that have taken place over the years
     between the preliminary national accounts data and the
     final numbers.
                                 19 —



proportional   stabilization rule of the sort discussed by
Phillips (1954) in his classic article. Note that for the
policy to make sense one must assume that there exists an IS
equation such as that depicted in equation (1) in which an

increase in interest rates tends to reduce the demand for
goods but that the authorities do not know the values of the

parameters of this equaticn,24 Hence the authorities dc not
have sufficient knowledge t calry out an activist

countercyclical policy in the face of an exoqenous shift in
the demand for goods.

     In implementing the feedback policy the authorities are
continually faced with the question of whether an increase in

actual money has been caused by an increase in Y (the data for
which are unavailable because of the lag in producing the

numbers) or by a random movement in the demand for money, v.
In the first case interest rates should he raised; in the

second, they should not he raised and the money supply target
should be adjusted to accommodate the random movement. All
available information, both real and financial, should be

brought to bear in order to distinguish between the two

hypotheses.
     In the case of lags in the economic system, as depicted

by equations (1') and (2'), there is a distinct possibility

24. Similarly, the authorities either do not possess or do
     not believe in estimated reduced-form equations of the
     sort shown in equations (3') or (3").
                              — 20 —



that   attempts to respond to increases in Y by forcing M back

to target in the very short run will lead to substantial

interest rate volatility and possibly to the explosive
oscillation in interest rates that has been termed instrument

instability (Holbrook (1972)). This can be shown by using
(2'), the LM curve with lags, to solve for the feedback rule.

       AR =    [E(L)A1nY + Av - AInMT   -   D*(L)AR].          (71)


Here d0 is the lead coefficient in D(L), i.e., the coefficient
on current R, and n*(L) is the rest of the distributed lag
with d0 omitted. The movement of R in response to an increase

in income growth is thus determined by this nth order

difference equation in AR.    If d0 is small relative to the

coefficients in the rest of D(L), there is likely to be
substantial volatility in interest rate movements when income

starts to grow faster than desired.25

25. The pattern will also depend on the lag structure of
     E(L). Empirically the mean lag on income can he
     estimated to be smaller than the mean lag on interest
     rates. In these circumstances the assertion in the text
     about volatility will hold true. It is worth pointing
     out that the implied volatility in interest rates is the
     result of the lag structure of the money demand equation
     and not of the choice of interest rates rather than money
     as the instrument. If the authorities held money
     constant in the face of an increase in income the same
     interest rate pattern would result as that indicated by
     equation (7'). Diagrammatically, this can he shown by
     the movement of the short—run LM curve in response to
     past interest rate changes in the presence of long lags.
     See Meyer (1974).
                                 — 21 —



     The way out of this difficulty is to use interest rates

to bring the money supply back to its target level, not each
period (e.g., month) but at the end of a period of, say, six

months (White (1976)), This 'ill result in the money supply
being away from its taLqet tor a period of time; howejer, the
interest rates will always be acting in the direction of

moving it back towards the taqet.

2.5 Summary
     The above analysis ot e Lhree approaches to setting
targets for monetary aqgrecates can be summarized as follows.

The formal Poole approach rd most of its offshoots require
knowledge of the parameters and error variances and

covariances of both   the   IS and LM curves. The approach
focuses on the period when    information   on   income   is

unavailable, indicates the way in which information can be
used, and implies short—run fine tuning as information becomes

available. The reduced-form approach requires knowledge of
the reduced—form equation in which nominal income is a

function of money hut does not require knowledge of the
underlying structural equations. Logically, it can be used to

justify fine tuning in response to shifts in exogenous
expenditures. The feedback—rule approach, which can be
treated as an extension of one of the polar cases of the Poole

approach, requires knowledge of the parameters of the LM curve
but not the parameters of the IS curve. It qives the
                              — 22 —



authorities   a rule for changing interest rates as money moves

away from target but requires a judgment as to whether the
source of the change in money is a random shift in the demand

curve for money or an increase in income.   It: doesnot entail

an activist monetary policy since the information is not

available to implemert such a policy.

             3    MONETARY POLICY IN A MODEL WITH INFLATION


     In this section I examine the logic of a monetary

aggregates target and the implications of implementing a
policy of reducing the rate of growth of the monetary

aggregate in a model of a world with inflation. The model
used in this section of the paper, although still very simple,

represents in a not unreasonable way the thinking of many
mainstream economists about the inflationary process.
Although the model reflects a closed economy, extension to an
open economy is not difficult and will be discussed in
footnotes.


3.1 The Model
     The model has four equations: the income—expenditure

relation (IS), the money market equilibrium (LM), the
augmented Phillips curve with a natural rate interpretation,

and the expectations—formation equation:


    lnQ =    A(L)a   -    B(L)   (R_(/.1flP)e) +              (10)
    lnM = c - D(L)R +            E(L)lnQ + F(L)lnP + v        (11)

    AmP =        (AlP)e    + G(L) (lnQ-1nQF) + w              (12)

    (AlflP)e =     H(L)A1nP      +   z.                       (13)



    Equation (10) relates real output (Q) to the real
interest rate defined as the nominal interest rate minus the
                             — 24 —



expected rate of inflation.26 In equation (11) the demand
for money is a function of real output, the price level and

the nominal interest rate. For both theoretical and empirical
reasons, I assume F(1) = 1; i.e., in the long run a doubling
of the price level leads to a doubling of the quantity of

money demanded. In equation (12), the augmented Phillips
curve,27 the rate of inflation is equal to the expected rate

of inflation plus a function of the difference between output

and full—employment output (QE'). This equation is equivalent
to the usual relationship between inflation, unemployment, and
expected inflation since ln(Q/QF) is linearly related to the
difference between actual unemployment and the natural rate.

In the way it has been specified, the equation implies a
linear relation between unemployment and inflation whereas
many empirical studies have found a non—linear relation—
ship.28 For analytical convenience I will use the linear

formu1't ion but will point out in passing the circumstances
where the non—linearity would make a difference to the

analysis. Finally, equation (13) relates the expected rate of

26. In a more sophisticated model one might use a long—term
     interest rate in equation (10) and a short—term rate in
     equation (11).
27. Usually the Phillips curve is defined in terms of wages.
     If one assumes that prices are determined by marking up
     wages (or standard unit labour costs) one can easily
     derive equation (12) by solving out the wage Phillips
     curve and the mark—up equation.
28. See, for example, Freedman (1976).

inflation     to past rates of iiflation.      This    foLniuiation rules

out both rational expectations29 and the possibility that the

announcement of polic' may have a direct effect on expec-
tations.30 In equation (13) it   is assumed that H(1) i;31
this assumption is necesar:y tor the model to have bug—run

natural rate properties.32
     Before I go on to anovze the properties ot the above
model, I present the teduced—forn equations that car be
derived from equations (10) to (1 3) . The thrue that are
needed for future nalyis show the reJationsiip between money
supply growth and the rate of inflation, the rate of growth of
output, and the growth of nominal income.

29.   See, however, Friedman (1979) for discussion of the
      possibility that truly rational expectations are really
      adaptive after all.

30. See footnote 41 for further discussion of this point.

31. Note, however, the arguments against this hypothesis in
     Sargent (1971).
32. A simple way of introducing the exchange rate into the
     above model is to postulate that the level of the
     exchange rate is a function of the level of prices in
     Canada vis—à—vis the level of prices in foreign
     countries, especially the United States, and of the
     differential in the real interest rate between Canada and
     foreign countries. A more realistic analysis of the
     determinants of the Canadian dollar can be found in Haas
     and Alexander (1979) or Freedman (1979).

     Thu; in the long run the rate of inflation and the rate
of growth of nominal income will be equal to the rate of

growth of money. The role of the exogenous expenditure term,
a, is easy to interpret in economic terms. Only if the real
value of automonous expenditures rises continually can it have
a permanent effect on inflation. But in a non-growth model
with QF constant it is impossible to envisage such a situation

occurring.

3.2     Effects of a Deceleration
        in Money Supply Growth
        I begin the analysis o the above model by assuming that

the economy is experiencing a persistently high rate of
inflation (say 8 per cent and thet       priority   is   given   to

bringing down the rate of inflation to a much lower rat: (say
2 per cent). There are two main     types   of decelerationay
paths   that might he considered:(1 ) a gradual reduction in
the targeted rate of growth : money (instrument gradualism);
(2) a sharp reduction in the targeted rate of growth of money
(instrument cold shower).33 if che preferred policy is to be
one of gradualism, it is ao necessary to specify how gradual
the policy is to be, ie., how many years will be required to
achieve the final target of 2 per cent. growth in the money
supply. The choice among the    options   will   depend in large
part on the movements of outhut, prices, and interest rates
(also the exchange rate) that are expected to result from the

policy implemented by the anthorities. The movement of these
variables is basically an empirical question and hence one

must have recourse to empirical models in order to get some
feel for the kinds of results that can be expected from

different policies. I first examine the results of
implementing a policy of gradual deceleration of the money

33. One might also consider a gradual reduction in the rate
     of inflation (goal gradualism) and a sharp reduction in
     the rate of inflation (goal. cold shower). See Poole
     (1970b) and Freedman (1978b) for a discussion of these
     concepts.
                               — 28 —



supply   (instrument gradualism) in an economy of the sort

depicted by structural equations (10) to (13), given plausible

estimates of the coefficients and lag   structures, and then
turn   briefly to the policy of a sharp reduction in the rate of
growth of money.34
     Suppose one starts from a qrowt;h rate of money of, say,
8 per cent, and reduce: thl3 g(owLn rate by 1 percenraqe point
per annum for six ycurs until L': eaches a rate of 2 per cenr
consistent with the desired 2 per cent infiation The results
of such a deceleration are shor in. igure 2 for interest
rates, price inflation, real output. and nominal income
growth.35 Clearly gradualism in bringing down the instrument
(money) leads to a cyclical pattern in all the endoqenous
variables of the system. Nonetheless, the underlying movement
of   all the nominal variables is downward; i.e., despite the
cyclical nature of the outcome, there is a clear downward

trend over time. The time paths portrayed in Figure 2
indicate, however, that a policy of instrument gradualism

34. A somewhat more complex model with an external sector was
     developed in Freedman (1978a). This model, along with
     some others, was subjected to a policy of decelerating
     money supply growth in Freedman (1978b) and the results
     reported in that paper are the basis for the analysis of
     this section. A similar analysis using an even simpler
     model can be found in Tobin (1974). For a more recent
     exercise of this sort see 4eyer and Rasche (1980).

35. I also graph 1nPFX, the exchange rate, based on the
     equation sketched out in footnote 32. I assume that the
     foreign inflation rate is constant at 2 per cent
     throughout the entire period.

requires   patience since the decline in inflation rates is

initially rather small and some time is required before the

effects on inflation of the deceleracon policy become

sizable.

      What   are the economics inderiyinq these results? Given
the 8 per cent inflation rate, the      decline    in the rate of
growth   of the money supply initially leads to a rise in
interest rates, With price inflition continuing at 8 per cent

this rise in nominal rates also   implies a       rise   in   real   rates
of   interest, which brings about &   decline     in real

expenditure.36 This in turn leads to a decline in output, an
increase in unemployment above the natural rate, and a
decrease in both wage and price inflation. The decrease in
price inflation feeds gradually into expected inflation,

putting further downward pressure on wage inflation, and so
on. In the course of the downward movement nominal interest
rates begin to fall after their initial rise; this occurs
first as a result of the decline in real income and later as a

result of the slowdown in the rate of price inflation. The

36. For a large model such as DX2, 'which has an external
     sector, the explanation can be expanded in a number of
     directions. The most important ones are the multifaceted
     effect of real interest rates on expenditure via real
     fixed investment, consumption, and housing, and the
     effect of a rise in interest rates on the exchange rate.
     The implied appreciation of the Canadian dollar leads to
     a reduction of the real current account balance, thereby
     accentuating the effects on real expenditure of the rise
     in interest rates and also has a direct downward effect
     on Canadian prices via its effect on the Canadian dollar
     prices of traded goods. See Freedman and Lonqworth
     (1975) for a detailed analysis of the monetary policy
     mechanism in RDX2.

interest   rate finally settles at a new lower level that

reflects the reduced rate of inflation. Thus the model gives
rise to the three classic eftects of a money supply decline on

the nominal rate of interest s discussed, for example, by
Friedman (1968): the liquidiry effect (the initial rise in the
nominal interest rate), the inconie effect (the subsequent

decline as income falls) and h: iflatonary effect (to the
new level consistent with th       .ower rote of inflation).
      The existence of cycles c;ri the      downward path   follows   from

the   lags inherent in the syse described in the structural
equations (10) to (12) and those, in the expectations formation
equation (13). But what are tine irain determinants of the
characteristics of the cycle5 resuitinq from the deceleration
in the rate of growth of money? What determines peak

unemployment rates and speeds of response of inflation and
other variables? ExperimenLs r:arried out with a relatively
simple   model that incorporats the characteristics of
equations (10) to (13) but ciiso         has an international sector
(Freedman (1978a)) indicate that         the   characteristics of the

wage—price sector are the   most significant elements in the
development of   the cyclical response of the economy.37 The
two crucial parameters ar€ th size and speed of the response
of prices to the product gap or of wages to the unemployment

gap) and the mean lag in expectations formation. The greater
the response of inflation to economic slack and the shorter

the mean lag on expectations formation, the smaller the peak

unemployment rate associated with any given path of money
supply deceleration. It is interesting to note that it is not
so much the path of inflation that changes when coefficients

are altered as the paths of real output and employment. These
move in such a way as to bring about the price deceleration
consistent with the deceleration of the rate of growth of the

money supply.38
     There is a further important characteristic of the
decelerationary path that is worth stressing at this point.

Since the nominal rate of interest will decline eventually in
response to the decline in the rate of inflation, there will

be an increase in the demand for real money balances. To
satisfy this increase, the rate of price inflation must
decelerate somewhat faster on averaqe than the rate of nominal

money supply growth. For example, consider a case in which

the money supply growth rate was reduced 1 percentage point
per year for six years (from 8 per cent to 2 per cent) and
interest rates fell from 12 per cent to 6 per cent over this

same period.   If the semi—elasticity of demand for money

38. See Freedman (1978b) for the analysis summarized in this
     paragraph. The importance of the two coefficients is
     also emphasized in Freedman (1977).

with    respect to interest rates (the coefficient d in equation
 (2)) was about          real balances would have to rise by

 [(12—6) x 0.02] or 12 per cent over the period. To achieve
this rise, the average rate of   inflation would      have to be 2
per cent less than the averaje rate of growth of the money
supply over the Six—year period, Since initially the growth
of the money supply falls rioce haci does price inflation
(implying an initial fall in        money    balances),   at some
later   point in the cycle pe ifiaton would have to be
decelerating substantially f:t than the money supply in
order to permit the necessary crowtb of real money        balances.
Without   such an "overshoot" l inflation rates, the amount of
real   money balances at the nd of the six—year period of money
supply deceleration would be lower than needed in long—run
equilibrium. This insufficiency would result in higher
interest rates arid thus lead to the     onset   of secondary cycles
despite the fact that the more growth rate had stopped
declining. To prevent such a situation from arising, policy
might allow for an increase in the level of money balances

once and for all (but not in their rate of growth) in order to
Supply the economy ith the ceal balances demanded at

39. This would correspond to an elasticity of 0.24 at 12 per
     cent interest rates and 0.12 at 6 per cent interest
       rates.

the new equilibrium lower rates of interest.40
      The system of equations under discussion can also be used

to compare the merits of instrument gradualism and instrument
cold shower as a policy response to inflationary conditions.
Because of the lags in the economic system, both types of
policy give rise to cyclical movements in the key economic

variables. But a cold—shower policy involving a sharp decline

in the rate of growth of the money supply (say a permanent
decline from 8 per cent to 2 per cent in one year) would lead
to a much sharper initial cycle than that portrayed in

Figure        The far sharper initial increases in interest
rates and unemployment rates that would result from such a

policy might be considered a less desirable outcome than that

40. A detailed theoretical discussion of this point can be
     found in Freedman (1978c).

41.   If the announcement of a cold—shower policy had direct
      effects on expectations this Oonclusion would be
      substantially modified. Fellner (1976, 1979) has
      enunciated the credibility hypothesis in which he argues
      that the expectations that enter into the decision making
      of the private sector can be strongly affected by the
      policy announced by the authorities, to the extent that
      the authorities have gained credibility by achieving
      previously announced targets. Fellner argues that
      estimated lags overstate the true lags in such a case and
      hence gi'7e an overly pessimistic picture of the
      difficulty in brinqing down the rate of inflation. There
      may be some merit to the argument offered by Feliner
      although very little empirical evidence has been
      presented to support the approach. Lucas (1976) has also
      argued that estimated structural coefficients will change
      in response to a change in policy and that simulated time
      paths in response to policy shocks should take this into
      account, thereby modifying the conclusions. The
      practical importance of these roints remains an open
      question.

achieved by a gradualist policy in spite of the more rapid
decline in inflation.42

     Furthermore, and perhaps more important, empirically
wages and prices have generally been found to be more closely

related to the   reciprocal   of the unemployment rate than to its

level. This implies that the      increase   in the unemployment

rate resultinq from a sharp cold—shower decline in the rate of

growth of the money supply would he larger than that implied
by a cold—shower policy in a system with a linear Phillips
curve.   The reason for this result is that with a non—linear

Phillips curve the extra deflationary effect on prices arising

from a given increase in unemployment is less, the higher the

unemployment rate; hence, to get an extra 1 percentage point
decline in the rate of inflation requires a larger increase in

the unemployment rate. Thus the argument against cold—shower
policies, which rests on the resulting excessively large
movements of interest rates and the unemployment rate (also

the exchange rate), gains' dded strength if the Phillips curve
is non—linear.
     The principle underlying the choice of an appropriate

period of time over which to implement a policy of

42. A further element that is important in the real world but
     not in the model is the existence of long—term
     contracts.  If many people have locked themselves into
     such contracts it will he more costly to bring down the
     rate of inflation very quickly. For example, long—term
     borrowers who are paying high nominal rates of interest
     would incur a substantial loss if the rate of inflation
     fell dramatically as a result of a cold—shower policy.
                              — 36 —



deceleration   is not very different from that underlying the

choice between instrument gradualism and instrument cold

 shower. The shorter the period chosen, i.e., the greater the
rate of deceleration of the money supply, the sharper (at
least initially) will he the movements of the interest rate

and the unemployment rate (and also the exchange rate). On
the other hand, the decline in the rate of price inflation

will also be more rapid in the case of a more rapid rate of

deceleration of the money supply. Views regarding the desired
speed of deceleration would be based on judgments of the

desirability of the implied paths of inflation, unemployment,
etc., of the sort that have been presented above.

3.3 The Three Interpretations
     of a Money Supply Rule

     In the light of the above discussion I now return to the

three approaches to monetary targeting of Section 2 and

analyze them in terms of implementing an anti—inflationary

policy.
     The Poole approach, which focuses on the short—run
unobservable shifts in IS and LM curves, cannot deal with

strategic problems such as the appropriate rate of
deceleration of the money supply. It can help only in dealing
with tactical problems that arise on the deceleration path,
such as the use of money and interest rates as information
variables that indicate the growth of nominal income in the
period before the income data become available.
                                        — 37 —



       By way of contrast, both the reduced—form approach and
the feedback—rule approach can be used to address the

strategic questions that arise in the course of implementing
an anti—inflationary monetary policy. In the reduced—form
model (equations (14) to (16)) one solves for the growth of
real output, inflation, and nominal income as distributed lags

on past growth of the money supply as well as other
variables. The estimated coefficients that appear in
regressions based on these kinds of equations for Canada tend

to imply relatively small output cycles and a fairly rapid
decline in price inflation in response to a deceleration in
the growth rate of money.43 Given this result even

cold—shower policies or a policy of very rapid deceleration of
money can be justified in that the unemployment rate needed to
put downward pressure on inflation rates is not very large.

Moreover, virtually no secondary cycles appear in the
simulation of reduced—form models, in contrast with simulation
results from the system of structural equations.44

43. See Anderson and Jordan (1968) and Duguay (1978) for
     standard reduced—form models explaining nominal income
     and Selden (1977) for an equation explaining the rate of
     inflation. See Freedman (1978b) for the paths of
     variables such as unemployment and inflation that arise
     from a deceleration of money in the Duguay model and in a
     simple reduced—form equation for inflation.
44. See Meyer and Rasche (1980) for a similar comparison of
     structural and reduced form models in the United States.
     Dewald (1980) finds substantially higher unemployment
     rates along the deceleratioriary path in his version of
     the St. Louis model.
                              — 38 —



      The reduced—form type of analysis, however, does have two
main drawbacks.    First, there is a long literature on the

empirical problems inherent in estimating the reduced—form
model that at the very least suggests caution about the

conclusions.45 Second, the empirica1 results in virtually
all estimated reduced—form models are inconsistent with the

underlying building block of a stable demand—for--money
function. This point is closely related to the argument made
above that if the rate of growth of the money supply is
reduced by one percentage point, not only does inflation

eventually have to fall by one percentage point in the long

run, but at. some intermediate point the rate of inflation must

temporarily fa3.i by more than one percentage point to permit
real money balances to rise by the amount needed to satisfy
demand at the lower oominal interest rate in the new
equilibrium. It can be shown46 that for this result to
occur, the coefficients on the distributed lag in the
regress ons of inflation and of nominal income growth on money

growth must fulfil two conditions. The sum of the
coefficients must be one, and the mean lag must be equal to
the value of the semi—elasticity of the demand for money with
respect to interest rates, i.e. —D(1). This in turn entails

that a series of negative coefficients follow the positive

45.   See, for example, Davis (1969), Friedman (1977b),
      Modigliani and Ando (1976), and Wurzburger (1978).
46. See Freedman (1978c).
                               — 39 —



coefficients   in the distributed lag. Whether because of the
empirical difficulty of finding such a pattern, or because of

the tendency to truncate distributed lags too early, or
because of the fact that it was not obvious to researchers

that such negative coefficients are required for theoretical
reasons, one does not typically find such patterns in the
empirical literature. Hence the reduced--form models as
estimated are not consistent with the standard demand—for—

money equation and this throws some doubt on the usefulness of

the results.

     The feedback rule once again assumes that one can place

more confidence in the estimates of the demand—for—money
equation than in the empirical estimates of the other
equations. It is further assumed that one believes firmly in

the existence of the relationships expressed in equations
(10), (12) and (13) without being confident of the magnitude
of the coefficients and lags or the exact specification of the
equations. Thus one can make statements with some degree of
confidence about the long run——such as that a decelerating
path for money will eventually reduce the rate of price
inflation——without necessarily being clear in advance about
the time paths of the variables that are of interest over the

short to intermediate run.
     The argument for gradualism in this context is in the

main based on the view that   knowledge about the detailed
structure of the economy is rather limited.    In implementing a
                              — 40 —



policy   of gradually reducing the rate of qrowth of the money

supply, a relatively rapid decline in prices might be achieved

with only a small decrease in output if the coefficients in
G(L) were large and if the mean lags on G(L) and H(L) were

small. The same policy would lead to a rather sharp decline

in output and only slow progress initially on price inflation
if these conditions did not hold. A reasonably cautious
approach to policy would therefore suggest a fairly gradual
deceleration with periodic reexamination of the results to see

if the outcome is roughly consistent with one's prior beliefs
about the non—monetary side of the economy. For example, if
unemployment rose substantially more (less) than expected and

inflation fell less (more) than expected this would imply,.
other things being equal, that the coefficients in G(L) and

H(L) were less (more) favourable to a rapid decline in
inflation than originally believed. This in turn would

suggest a slower (faster) rate of deceleration of the money

supply than originally intended or accepting higher (lower)
amounts of economic slack than originally intended. The logic
of a periodic retargeting rather than an initial announcement

of the entire money supply path thus derives mainly from the
uncertainty regarding the non—financial side of the economy

and the need to take into account in setting policy any new
information that becomes available regarding the response of

the economy to the changes in financial variables brought

about by the monetary deceleration.

               4   SELECTION OF A MONETARY AGGREGATE


     There has been much debate in the past five years over
the question of which monetary aggregate the central bank

ought to use for targeting purposes.47 It is worth
emphasizing that the criteria for choice differ according to

the approach to monetary aggregates one is taking.
     In the reduced—form approach the preferred aggregate is
the one whose movements b±5t explain future movements in
nominal income.48 Duguay (1978) has shown that in the case
of Canada Ml is the preferred measure from this point of
view. If one adopts the feedback-rule approach to policy,
then the best aggregate is the one that gives rise to the most

desirable movements of output, interest rates, exchange rates,
etc.49 White (1979) has argued strongly that Ml is the
preferred monetary aggregate from this standpoint also. The
arguments for targeting on the narrow monetary aggregate in
Canada are buttressed by the fact that Ml is at least as
stable as the broader aggregates and less susceptible to
shifts arising from unpredictable movements among financial


47. See, for example, Courchene (1976, 1979) and White
     (1979).
48. It is also necessary to take account of the control-
     lability of the money supply in choosing among the
     aggregates.
49. The notion of most desirable movements should take into
     account the desirability of avoiding the secondary cycles
     discussed in Section 3.2.
                               — 42 —



 instruments.   Furthermore, the broader monetary aggregates
would return to a target path at about the same rate as would
nominal income following a shock to spending because of their
very low interest rate elasticity. In contrast, Ml would
return to its target path much more quickly than income
because of its relatively high interest rate elasticity. As

discussed above,50 the argument has often been made that this
is a desirable characteristic for a monetary target from the

standpoint of both the credibility and the accountability of
the authorities.

     Using the Poole approach in a simple static model, one
can show that it the demand for money is perfectly stable the

authorities should set policy in terms of the monetary

aggregate that implies a vertical LM curve (i.e., that has

zero interest rate elasticity of demand); in such a case
shifts of the IS curve would not result in any change of

income. It would thus appear that a broader aggregate ought
to be preferred to Ml. However, even in a simple static
model, Poole has shown that if the demand—for—money equation

has any stochastic error attached to it "a small amount of
interest sensitivity is better than none" (Poole (1970a), page

206). Furthermore, once lags are added to the system one must
be concerned with the nature of the resulting time paths of

50. See footnote 23.
                             — 43 —


the endogenous variables. For example, if interest rates
affect the real economy only with a one—period lag (i.e., the

IS curve is vertical in the short run), then implementation of

a money target using an aggregate with zero interest rate
elasticity implies that no equilibrium exists in the short
run. Even if the IS curve had a negative slope in the short

run, adhering to a constant money supply target using an
aggregate with zero interest rate elasticity might imply
explosive oscillations in the interest rate if lagged interest

rates had a substantially larger effect on real expenditure
than did current interest rates.
     The extension of the Poole approach to the question of
the information content of different economic variables
suggests that the authorities ought to pay most attention to

the aggregate that yields the most information about current

movements of income for which data are as yet not available.

It does not follow, however, that targets should be set in
terms of this or any other monetary aggregate (Friedman

(1975)).
     As White (1979) has pointed out, many criteria have been

suggested as a basis of choice among monetary aggregates. The
various criteria reflect differences in the approaches to

policy. The choice of a monetary aggregate presupposes a
priori selection of one of the approaches to policy as the
preferred approach, or at least a weighting of the usefulness
of the three approaches. Many of the arguments regarding the
                             — 44 —



choice of a monetary aggregate are at cross purposes because
the protagonists are implicitly or explicitly using different
policy approaches as the basis for analysis.
