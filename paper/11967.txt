                                               ABSTRACT

Shimer (2005) pointed out that although we have a satisfactory theory of why some workers are unemployed
at any given time, we don?t know why the number of unemployed workers varies so much over time.
The basic Mortensen-Pissarides (1994) model does not generate nearly enough volatility in unemployment,
for plausible parameter values. This paper extends the Mortensen-Pissarides model to allow for informational
rents. Productivity is subject to publicly observed aggregate shocks, and to idiosyncratic shocks that
are seen only by the employer. It is shown that there is a unique equilibrium, provided that the idiosyncratic
shocks are not too large. The main result is that small fluctuations in productivity that are privately
observed by employers can give rise to a kind of wage stickiness in equilibrium, and the informational
rents associated with this stickiness are sufficient to generate relatively large unemployment fluctuations.

1. Introduction
    The standard view of unemployment is that it takes time for workers to find the right job, and for
employers to find the right worker. Fluctuations in the productivity of jobs naturally give rise to
fluctuations in the number of workers looking for jobs, and in the number of employers looking for
workers. High productivity is associated with a tight labor market in which more workers have jobs and
fewer workers are looking for jobs, while employers are keen to hire more workers, so vacancies are
plentiful; conversely, when productivity is low, unemployment is high and there are few vacancies.
    This simple description of the source of unemployment fluctuations suggests that it should be
possible to measure the variability of productivity and use this to explain the variability of
unemployment, to a rough approximation. The Mortensen-Pissarides (1994) model is the natural
framework for such a calculation, since it gives a precise account of the relationship between productivity
and search on each side of the labor market. Shimer (2005) showed that the basic Mortensen-Pissarides
model in fact translates fluctuations in labor productivity into unemployment fluctuations that are very
much smaller than those seen in U.S. data. Thus although we have a satisfactory theory of why some
workers are unemployed at any given time, we don’t know why the number of unemployed workers
varies so much over time. To a substantial extent the number of unemployed workers varies because of
movements into and out of the labor force, which are not included in the Mortensen-Pissarides model.
But even for people who are firmly attached to the labor force, the variations are large. For example, in
the U.S. over the period 1967-2006, the median annual unemployment rate of white men aged 35-39 was
3.65%; in 10 of these 40 years, the rate was 4.4% or higher, while there were 11 years with a rate of 2.6%
or lower. The basic reason for unemployment in this group is that no two workers are the same, and no
two jobs are the same. Given that job separation rates are relatively stable, the unemployment rate is a
measure of how long it takes to match workers and jobs. The question then is why the matching process
should be so much slower in some years than in others.
    Hall (2005) argued that this volatility problem can be fixed if the Nash bargaining component of the
Mortensen-Pissarides model is replaced by a “sticky” wage-setting process. Brügemann and
Moscarini (2007) showed that the volatility of unemployment remains implausibly low for a broad class
of surplus-sharing rules: the Nash bargaining rule is not an isolated case. On the other hand when there is
some stickiness in wages, the employers’ incentive to create vacancies is magnified when the economy
improves, and this increases unemployment volatility. Brügemann and Moscarini (2007) show that




                                                      1
unless there is enough stickiness to generate countercyclical fluctuations in the rents accruing to workers,
the job creation incentive cannot vary enough to match the unemployment volatility data.
     As Rotemberg (2006) points out, the basic Mortensen-Pissarides model also predicts procyclical
wages, which are not seen in the data, and this problem persists in the more general model developed by
Yashiv (2006). Wage stickiness helps to resolve this discrepancy as well, but of course this is useful only
if we understand why wages are sticky. Hall (2005) assumed that the wage level in a previous contract
establishes a “social norm” that largely determines the wage in the next contract. In the absence of a
theory of social norms, this explanation is incomplete. Similarly, Gertler and Trigari (2006) showed that
staggered wage contracts magnify the incentive to create vacancies, but did not try to explain why
workers and employers who are interested only in the present value of income would negotiate contracts
that constrain the division of the surplus in matches that have not yet been made.
     This paper shows that an extension of the Mortensen-Pissarides model in which some productivity
fluctuations are privately observed by employers can explain the volatility of unemployment in a more
parsimonious way. The introduction of private information precludes the Nash bargaining rule; instead,
the surplus is divided using Myerson’s Neutral Bargaining Solution, which generalizes the Nash
bargaining solution to allow for private information. There are two main results. First, the extended
model has a unique equilibrium. Second, this equilibrium exhibits a kind of wage stickiness, and the
informational rents associated with this stickiness are sufficient to translate small fluctuations in
productivity into large unemployment fluctuations.2
     Brügemann and Moscarini (2007) consider generalizations of the Mortensen-Pissarides model in
which both employers and workers have private information about the job match surplus, and they
analyze a representative selection of bargaining models that yield procyclical worker rents, and therefore
insufficient unemployment volatility. But their analysis is confined to situations in which the extent of
private information does not change over the cycle, so there is no scope for procyclical informational
rents, which is the main focus of the analysis in this paper.

      Menzio (2005) develops this idea in great detail, and derives a bargaining equilibrium in which transient productivity
fluctuations that are privately observed by employers are not transmitted to wages.

                                                                  2
2. A Model of Sticky Wages with Private Information and Aggregate Shocks
    A successful job match generates a surplus to be divided between the worker and the employer. The
value of the worker’s output is the sum of two components, p + y, where p is common to all matches, and
y is a random idiosyncratic component whose realization (“L” for low or “H” for high) is observed
privately by the employer when the match is made. The aggregate component p is a publicly observed
Markov pure jump process with two states (s = 1 in the bad state and s = 2 in the good state), and exit
hazards 81 and 82. The high value of y has probability Js , depending on the aggregate state. The flow
surplus is p + y - y0 > 0, where y0 > 0 is the flow value of unemployment (including unemployment
benefits and the value of leisure). The expectation of the surplus is assumed to be higher in the good
state.
    When the joint continuation value from a match falls below the joint opportunity cost, the match is
destroyed. The job destruction hazard rate is a constant, *, and there is a constant returns matching
function that generates a flow of new matches M(NU,NV) from unemployment and vacancy stocks NU and
NV. There is an infinitely elastic supply of potential vacancies, and the actual number of vacancies posted
is such that the expected profit from a vacancy is zero. Workers and employers maximize the present
value of net income, using the interest rate r.
    In the Mortensen-Pissarides model, the match surplus is divided according to the Nash Bargaining
Solution. In the model considered here, the surplus is not common knowledge, so this solution is not
applicable. What is needed is a generalization of Nash’s argument to cover bargaining problems
involving private information. A natural choice is the Neutral Bargaining Solution (NBS) developed by
Myerson (1984). The NBS coincides with the Nash solution under complete information, and in the
more general case it divides the surplus equitably while respecting the incentive compatibility constraints
arising from the existence of private information. Myerson (1984) shows that a Neutral Bargaining
Solution always exists, and provides a characterization that is relatively tractable in simple cases.
    In Appendix A it is shown that for the bargaining problem considered in this paper, the Neutral
Bargaining Solution is unique, and it can be implemented by Myerson’s Random Dictator mechanism.
This means that the surplus is divided in the following way. Either the employer or the worker is
randomly selected to make an offer, and if this offer is rejected the match dissolves. Clearly, the
employer’s offer will just match the worker’s reservation level, which is the value of searching for
another match. The worker effectively has two choices: an offer that exhausts the low surplus, with a sure
acceptance, or an offer that exhausts the high surplus, with acceptance only if the high surplus has


                                                      3
actually been realized. It is assumed that the parameters are such that the worker always finds it optimal
to demand the low surplus, conceding the difference between the high and the low surplus to the
employer as an informational rent.


Match Surplus
    The match surplus depends on whether the idiosyncratic component of output is high or low, and it
also depends on the aggregate state. Let SLs be the surplus when the idiosyncratic component is low, and
the aggregate state is s, and similarly when the realization of y is high; and let yLs = ps + yL, and
yHs = ps + yH , with )y = yH - yL.
    Let U denote the state-dependent continuation value of an unmatched worker, and let G denote the
joint continuation value of a matched worker-employer pair. When y = yL, the joint match values are
determined by the following asset pricing equations

                                              (           ) (
                          rG1L = y1L − δ G1L −U1 + λ1 G2L − G1L              )
                                          − δ (G       − U )− λ ( G       −G )
                                                                                                          (1)

                                                                      L
                                                                      2       1
                                                                               L




and similarly when y = yH. This specification rules out two interesting alternatives. First, the flow value
of a match is the same for all workers. Nagypál (2005) shows that heterogeneity in workers’ (private)
evaluations of nonpecuniary job characteristics can substantially increase the volatility of unemployment.
Second, there is no possibility of switching from low to high output, once the match has been made.
Even in the absence of informational rents, this tends to increase unemployment volatility, by
strengthening the incentive to create vacancies when a high-output match is more likely because the
aggregate state is good. Costain and Reiter (2005) show that this vintage productivity effect can
potentially explain the volatility of unemployment, but Brügemann (2005) shows that this effect is quite
weak in the model considered in this paper.
    It is assumed that there is free entry of employers, so that the continuation value of an unmatched
employer is zero in all states. Thus the (state-dependent) match surplus S is the difference between G and
U, and the match value equations can be rewritten as

                     ( r + δ )( S1L + U 1 ) = y1L + δU 1 + λ1 ( S 2L − S1L + Δ U )
                                                                                                          (2)
                     ( r + δ )( S 2L + U 2 ) = y 2L + δU 2 − λ2 ( S 2L − S1L + Δ U )

where )U = U2 - U1. This implies

                                        y 2L − y1L + δ ΔU
                           S − S + ΔU =

                                                                                                         (3)

Using these equations, and the analogous equations for a high-output match, the effect of the aggregate
state on the match surplus is given by

                                                         y 2L − y1L − (r + Λ )ΔU

                                     =S −S =   L     L
                                                                                                         (5)
                                                                  r +δ + Λ
                       2       1              2     1


Thus even if an unmatched worker has better prospects when the aggregate state is good, the match
surplus might be lower, for a given output draw. On the other hand there is a higher probability of
drawing a high output value in the good aggregate state.
    The effect of the output draw on the match surplus is given by

                                                                       Δy
                              S 2H − S 2L = S1H − S1L =                                                  (6)
                                                                      r +δ


Unemployment Continuation Values
    The rate at which unemployed workers find new matches is M(NU,NV)/NU = m(2), where 2 = NV/NU
represents market tightness, and m(2) = M(1,2). The job-finding rate function m(2) is assumed to be
increasing, and strictly concave, with m(0) = 0.
    When a match is made, the worker is selected to make an offer with probability <. In this case, the
worker gets the low-output surplus, and the employer gets an informational rent if the realized output
value is high. If the employer is selected to make an offer, the worker gets the reservation level U and the


                                                         5
employer gets the whole surplus. So an unmatched worker’s continuation values are determined by the
asset pricing equations

                          rU 1 = y 0 + m(θ1 )ν S1L + λ1 (U 2 − U 1 )
                          rU 2 = y 0 + m(θ 2 )ν S − λ2 (U 2 − U 1 )
                                                                                                           (7)

Thus


                             r + λ2                                     λ1

                             r + λ1                                     λ2
                rU 2 = y 0 +        m(θ 2 )ν S 2L +                           m(θ1 )ν S1L

Vacancy Creation
     Employers post new vacancies to the point where the net profit from doing so is zero. When a match
is made, the employer gets an informational rent if the match value is high, and also gets a fraction 1-< of
the low-output surplus (in expectation). The value to the employer of a filled vacancy in state s is given
by

                                        (               )
           J s = τ s (1 − ν ) S sH + τ sν S sH − S sL + (1 − τ s )(1 − ν ) S sL + (1 − τ s )ν × 0

                                   (                )
                                                                                                           (9)
               = (1 − ν ) S1L + τ s S sH − S sL


Thus the zero-profit conditions implied by free entry are

determine the low-state surplus values:

Since m(2) is strictly concave, with m(0) = 0, the ratio m(2)/2 is strictly decreasing, so the function
d = 2/m(2) has an inverse, 2 = H(d). Using equations (14) and (15) to eliminate U1 and U2 , and making
the substitution m(2s) = H(ds)/ds to eliminate 2, gives the following equations determining d1 and d2

3.Existence and Uniqueness of Equilibrium
     It is assumed that the function 2 = H(d) is convex, with H(0) = 0.3 Under this assumption, it will be
shown that an equilibrium with informational rents exists, and that it is unique.


Proposition 1
     If the function 2 = H(d) is convex, and if H(0) = 0, then there is a unique vector d* = (d*1, d*2) such that
R(d*) = 0.


The proof uses the following result.


Lemma 1
     Suppose H is a twice differentiable function, with H(0) = 0, H'(x) > 0 and H''(x) > 0, for x > a > 0.
Define the function h, on the domain [a,4), as


      3
        This assumption holds in the Cobb-Douglas case. The condition H(0) = 0 means that the expected vacancy duration shrinks to
zero as the number of vacancies per unemployed worker shrinks to zero. Although this is a reasonable condition, it effectively rules
out any constant returns CES matching technology except for the Cobb-Douglas case. Indeed if the matching function is defined by
(M/:)k = "Uk + (1-")Vk, then a positive value of k is ruled out because it implies that matches can be made even if there are no
vacancies. On the other hand a negative value of k is ruled out by the condition that 2/m(2) shrinks to zero as 2 decreases to zero.
This is a case in which local behavior around 2 = 0 has global implications because the CES parametric family is inflexible. It is not
difficult to stitch together a Cobb-Douglas and a CES with negative k, so that the function is Cobb-Douglas near zero, with
H(0) = 0. Then if k < -1, the function H(d) is not convex.

                                                                  8

                                         h( x ) = ⎜ − 1⎟ H ( x )                                             (18)
                                                  ⎝x ⎠

Then h'(x) < 0 and h''(x) < 0.


Proof
    The first and second derivatives of h are as follows

                                  ⎛a ⎞              a
                       h ′( x ) = ⎜ − 1⎟ H ′( x ) − 2 H ( x )
                                  ⎝x ⎠             x
                                  ⎛a ⎞                 a              a
                      h ′′( x ) = ⎜ − 1⎟ H ′′( x ) − 2 2 H ′( x ) + 2 3 H ( x )                              (19)
                                  ⎝x ⎠                x              x
                                ⎛a ⎞                 a
                              = ⎜ − 1⎟ H ′′( x ) + 2 3 ( H ( x ) − xH ′( x ))
                                ⎝x ⎠                x


    Since x $ a, and H'(x) > 0, it is clear that h is decreasing. Any convex (differentiable) function H that
passes through the origin has the property that xH'(x) $ H(x). Thus h''(x) # 0.


Proof of Proposition 1
    First it will be shown that R(d*) = 0 implies d* > D. Indeed if d1 # D1 and d2 $ D2 then R1 (d) > 0; and
if d1 $ D1 and d2 # D2 then R2 (d) > 0. If d # D, write R(d) as

                                       H (d 1 )
      ψ 1 (d ) = Z1 + ( ρ1 − d 1 ) ν
                                         d1
                                                                           [
                                                  − (r + δ )(d 1 − ρ1 ) + λ1 (d 2 − ρ2 ) − (d1 − ρ1 )]
                                                                                                             (20)
                                       H (d 2 )
     ψ 2 (d ) = Z 2 + ( ρ2 − d 2 ) ν
                                          d2
                                                                               [
                                                   − (r + δ )(d 2 − ρ2 ) − λ2 (d 2 − ρ2 ) − (d 1 − ρ1 )  ]

These equations show that either R1(d) or R2(d) is a sum of four positive terms: the first three terms are
positive in both equations, and if the last term is negative in one equation, it is positive in the other. Thus
R(d) … 0 if d # D.
    Next it will be shown that a solution exists. Note that R(D) = Z > 0. Define b as the solution of the
linear equations obtained by setting H = 0. Then

                                                                                                              (22)

                                                 r + δ + λ1 + λ2

Thus b > D and R(b) < 0.
    Since R1 is increasing in d2 and decreasing in d1, the equation R1(d) = 0 can be solved to obtain d2 as
an increasing function of d1. Write this as d2 = K1(d1). Since R2 is increasing in d1 and decreasing in d2,
the equation R2(d) = 0 can also be solved to obtain d2 as an increasing function of d1. Write this as
d2 = K2 (d1). Define the function K0(x) = K2 (x) - K1(x). Since R1 (D1 ,K1(D1)) = 0, and R1(D1 ,D2) > 0, and
R1 is increasing in d2 , it follows that K1 (D1) < D2. Also, since R2 (D1 ,K2 (D1)) = 0, and R2 (D1 ,D2) > 0, and
R2 is decreasing in d2 , it follows that K2(D1) > D2. Therefore K0(D1) is positive. By a similar argument,
K0(b1) is negative. Also, K0 is continuous (since R1 is linear in d2 and R2 is linear in d1). So by the
intermediate value theorem K2 (x) = K1(x) for some x 0 (D1 , b1). This means that R(x,K1(x)) = 0,
showing that a solution d* = (x,K1(x)) exists (with d* > D).
    To show uniqueness, define the function g(z) = R(D + z). Then g(0) > 0, g1 is increasing in z2 and g2
is increasing in z1, and both g1 and g2 are concave by Lemma 1. Therefore, by Theorem 1 in
Kennan (2001), g has at most one positive root, meaning that R has at most one root above D. Since it has
already been shown that R does have a root above D, and no roots anywhere else, the proof is complete.


Optimality of Pooling Offers
    It has been assumed that when a match is made in the good aggregate state, and the worker is selected
to make an offer, it is optimal to demand the low surplus, rather than demand the high surplus at the risk
of destroying the match. Thus the equilibrium surplus values must satisfy the following no-screening
conditions

Since Ds = 0 for Js = 0, Proposition 1 implies that a unique equilibrium satisfying the no-screening
conditions exists if J1 and J2 are small enough. Conversely, the no-screening condition fails as Js
approaches 1 (as of course it should). Also, the condition necessarily holds if the expected cost of filling
a vacancy is high enough. The choice between pooling and screening depends on how big the difference
is between the good idiosyncratic draw and the bad draw, relative to the surplus associated with the bad
draw. A screening offer risks losing the low surplus, in exchange for a chance of getting the high surplus.
When the expected cost of filling a vacancy is high, the free entry condition implies that the surplus
associated with a filled vacancy is high. The effect of this is to increase the opportunity cost of screening,
without changing the benefit, so pooling becomes more attractive.
    The main theoretical result is Theorem 1, which characterizes a set of parameter values for which an
equilibrium exists, and shows that if the parameters lie in this set, the equilibrium is unique.

Theorem 1
    If H(d) is a convex function, with H(0) = 0, and if R( D
                                                           6 ) $ 0, then a unique equilibrium exists.


Proof
    By Proposition 1, there is a unique vector d* such that R(d* ) = 0. Since R( D
                                                                                 6 ) $ 0 and R(b) < 0, the
argument in the proof of Proposition 1 can be used to show that R has a root in the rectangle [ D
                                                                                                6 , A], and
since there is only one root above D, this root is d*. The no-screening conditions are satisfied because
d* $ D
     6 . Therefore d* is the unique equilibrium.


4. The Effects of Informational Rents
Suppose that there are no transitions, and that the wage rate is fixed, as in Hall (2005). Then the free
entry condition is

                                            y L − w + τΔy
                                       cd =                                                                (27)
                                                 r +δ

The right side of this equation is the capital gain from a filled vacancy, and the left side is the flow cost of
maintaining the vacancy, multiplied by the expected vacancy duration. A higher productivity level, with
a fixed wage, is offset in equilibrium by an increase in duration. If the profit flow is small (because the
wage is high), a small productivity change implies a large proportional change in profits, and therefore a
large proportional change in the rate at which vacancies are filled, which implies a large change in the
unemployment rate.
    The following lemma characterizes the wage as a nested weighted average of the productivity levels
while employed (y) and while unemployed (y0). This characterization applies to the standard Mortensen-
Pissarides model, and in the informational rents model, the wage is determined in exactly the same way,
assuming the low realization of the productivity shock (yL). Let N = m(2) be the job-finding rate, and
define w0 as the wage such that the worker’s share of the flow surplus is <:

                                  w0 = ν y L + (1 − ν ) y 0                                                (28)




                                                      12
Lemma 2
      If the aggregate state is permanent, the equilibrium wage is given by

                                     w = Ωy L + (1 − Ω)w0                                           (29)

where
                                             φ                    r +δ
                                     Ω=             ;        A=                                     (30)
                                           φ+A                     ν



Proof:
      From equation (7), the continuation value of an unemployed worker is

                                       rU = y 0 + φν S L                                            (31)

Equation (4) gives the surplus as

                                    (r + δ ) S L    = y L − rU                                      (32)



Solving these equations for U and SL yields

                                               y L − y0
                                          νS = L
                                                                                                    (33)
                                                A+φ

and

                                     rU = Ωy L + (1 − Ω) y 0                                        (34)

The continuation value of an employed worker is E = U + <SL. The wage that delivers this value satisfies
the asset pricing equation

                                       rE = w − δ ( E − U )                                         (35)

Thus the wage is given by




                                                        13
                               w = ( r + δ ) E − δU
                                 = rU + (r + δ )ν S L
                                                                 (           )
                                                                                                           (36)
                                 = Ωy L + (1 − Ω) y 0 + (1 − Ω)ν y L − y 0
                                 = Ωy L + (1 − Ω)w0




which proves the result.


    Using Lemma 2, the free entry condition can be written as

                                     1 1− ν L         τΔy
                            cd =
                                    φ+ A ν
                                            y − y0 +    (
                                                     r +δ
                                                                     )                                     (37)


The result for the standard model (with J)y = 0) differs from the fixed wage result in two respects. First,
if the job-finding rate is held constant, a large proportional change in d requires a large proportional
change in the flow surplus from employment (rather than in the flow profit). This means that small
productivity shocks do not cause large unemployment movements unless the flow surplus is small, as in
Hagedorn and Manovskii (2006). Second, this exaggerates the relationship between productivity and
unemployment, because the job-finding rate does not in fact stay constant when d increases. An increase
in d implies an increase in N, and this dampens the relationship between productivity and unemployment:
workers receive a larger share of the flow surplus when an increase in the job-finding rate increases the
continuation value of being unemployed, and this diminishes the incentive to create vacancies.
    Informational rents affect unemployment in much the same way as fixed wages, because small
productivity changes that are observed privately by employers do not affect wages. The wage is close to
the low productivity level, for standard parameter values, so the profit flow yL - w is small in equation
(27). Since J)y is also small (in the sense that the no-screening condition is satisfied), changes in J)y
therefore give rise to large proportional changes in profits, and in the unemployment rate.


The Cobb-Douglas Case
    The equilibrium relationships between productivity, informational rents and the unemployment rate
can be characterized more explicitly in the case of a constant-returns Cobb-Douglas matching function,
M = :U"V1-", with m(2) = :21-". In this case the equilibrium conditions (16) can be stated as

The effect of productivity variation with a square-root matching function (" = ½) and no informational
rents is illustrated in Figure 1, which plots the quadratic function on the right side of equation (40) against
the constant on the left side, with R set to zero. Productivity changes move the horizontal line up and
down in this figure, and the equilibrium job-finding rate adjusts along the quadratic curve. For standard
parameter values, this curve is steep at the baseline equilibrium, and small productivity differences
therefore have little effect on the job-finding rate.4

        In this figure, :0 is chosen so that the job-finding rate in the good steady state matches the data. Using the baseline parameters

     The elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to productivity with no informational rents is

This elasticity is not large unless the match surplus is small.
The effect of informational rents is shown in Figure 2. When R is positive, the quadratic curve shifts
to the right (in the relevant region), and a comparison of the two curves shows that a small informational
rent has a large effect on the equilibrium job-finding rate. On the other hand, the effect of (publicly
observed) productivity movements remains small.5

5. Wages
    Pissarides (2007) has recently argued that wage stickiness is not the answer to the unemployment
volatility puzzle, simply because wages are not in fact sticky: the wages of job-changers vary
procyclically, and there is also evidence (due to Beaudry and DiNardo, 1991) that wages in continuing
matches depend on labor market conditions at the time the match was made. In this paper wages are
sticky in the sense that they do not respond directly to improvements in the distribution of the
idiosyncratic component of match productivity, and the informational rent associated with this stickiness
provides an incentive to create vacancies. But this does not imply that wages are acyclical: the
informational rent has an indirect effect on wages by increasing the job-finding rate, and thereby
increasing the continuation value of an unemployed worker. When the aggregate state is permanent
(81 = 82 = 0) the magnitude of this effect is given by Lemma 2. More generally, the cyclical variation of
wages can be analyzed using a matrix version of Lemma 2.
    Suppose U# is the continuation value of an unemployed worker, starting from the end of the job (that
is, assuming that wages are zero on the present job from now on). Then




                                                     17

                            ⎜                                   ⎟ ⎜     ⎟ = δ ⎜ ⎟

This can be written in matrix form as 'U# = *U.
    A job that starts in state s is worth Us + <SLs to the worker. This is delivered in two parts:
                                                           ~
                                              U +ν SL = W +U

Thus the present value of wages is

                                                       ~
                                          W = ν SL +U −U

where W is the vector (W1 W2 )'.
    The surplus in a match with a low idiosyncratic component is given by equation (2):

                                                (
                                              Γ SL +U = yL +δU             )
The continuation value of an unemployed worker is given by equation (7):

                                       (Γ − δ I )U = y0 + ν Φ S L
where M is a diagonal matrix with elements N1 and N2 . Combining these equations gives

                              S L = (Γ + ν Φ )

                                                                      − y0         )
                               U = (Γ − δ I )
                                                    −1
                                                         (y   0   + ν Φ (Γ + ν Φ )
                                                                                                        −1
                                                                                                             (y      L

Thus the present value of wages is

Thus

where the weighting matrix S is defined by

In the one-dimensional case, this reduces to S-1 = 1 + (r+*)/(<N), as in Lemma 2, while 'W = (r+*)W
when 81 = 82 = 0, so that this represents the flow value of wages.
    There are of course many ways to specify a wage flow that adds up to the required present value of
wages. The simplest way is make the wage constant for the duration of the job, in which case the flow
wage is ws = (r+*)Ws . Alternatively, the wage might be state-dependent, meaning that when the
aggregate state changes, the wage changes to match the wage paid to new hires. In that case, the flow
wage is given by w = 'W, so it is a weighted average of yL and y0 , as was just shown. This has the rather
implausible implication that the wage in continuing matches falls when there is a transition to the bad
aggregate state. The simplest way to avoid this is to specify a wage that is constant for the life of the
match if the match begins in the good aggregate state, with a lower wage initially for matches that begin
in the bad state, followed by a wage increase when there is a transition to the good state. In this case the
flow wages are given by
                                w2 = (r + δ )W2
                                                                                                                    (50)
                                w1 = w2 − (r + δ + λ1 )(W2 − W1 )

The quantitative implications of these results are illustrated below (in Table 2).

6. Unemployment Volatility
     The volatility of unemployment can be analyzed by comparing the steady-state levels of
unemployment associated with each aggregate state (rather than measuring standard deviations in
simulated data). Although this ignores movements along the transition paths from one steady state to the
other, these transitions occur very rapidly, since the job-finding rate in the data is about 50% per month.
     Standard parameter values are used as far as possible, following Shimer (2005) and Hall (2005). The
interest rate is set at 5% per annum, and the job destruction rate * is set at .35 per annum, so that the
monthly rate is about 3%. The flow value of nonemployment is set initially at 40% of the flow value of
employment. The matching function is Cobb-Douglas. The exit rate from unemployment is about 50%
per month in the data, so :0 is chosen to solve the equilibrium equations with N182 + N281 = 6 (82 + 81),
meaning that the average job-finding rate is 6 per annum, the average being taken with respect to the
invariant distribution of the Markov process. The expected cost of filling a vacancy in state s is given
                    α

by cd s
           (φ ) 1−α
          = s           .
               μ0

     In the NBER postwar data, the average duration of a recession is about a year, and the average
duration of an expansion is about 5 years. This implies that the exit hazards are 82 = 1/5 and 81 = 1.
Shimer (2005) reports summary statistics for detrended labor productivity (output per person), using an
HP filter with smoothing parameter 100,000: the standard deviation is .02 log points. Since the model in
this paper assumes that productivity is a two-state process, it is perhaps better to measure volatility as the
difference between the average levels of productivity during recessions and expansions. Using the same
detrended productivity series, this difference is .028 log points. Letting Y1 and Y2 denote aggregate state-
contingent productivity levels, this implies that Y2 should be about 3% above Y1 , so Y2 is set to 1.03,
with Y1 normalized at one.6
     The variation in the informational rent is chosen so as to match the fluctuations in productivity. A
simple way to do this is to set (J2 - J1))y = .03, with yL1 = yL2, so that the common component of the
surplus does not depend on the aggregate state, but the probability of drawing the high idiosyncratic
component is higher in the good state. For example, if there is no informational rent in the bad state



     6
      Productivity could alternatively be measured as output per hour, and smaller smoothing parameters could also be justified.
Since output per hour varies less than output per person, and smaller smoothing parameters (like the conventional choice of 1,600)
attribute more of the variance to the trend component, these alternatives would give smaller volatility estimates. The point is that by
any reasonable measure, labor productivity is not very volatile.

                                                                  20
(J1 = 0), the rent in the good state is enough to account for the observed variation in aggregate
productivity levels.
    The parameter values are summarized in Table 1.

    In the case of a (Cobb-Douglas) matching function that is symmetric in unemployment and vacancies
(" = ½), the equilibrium values of N1 and N2 for the parameters in Table 1 can be obtained from the
following equations:

                             138μ 0 = 200φ22 + 240φ2 − 80φ1 − 15μ 0φ2

    Table 2 shows that informational rents can generate realistic variations in the unemployment rate.
Even though the informational rent is only 3% of the productivity level, it moves the unemployment rate
by about 40%. To put this in context, the table also shows the unemployment rates for a baseline
parameter set that matches the variance of aggregate productivity by letting the match surplus depend on
the aggregate state, with no idiosyncratic variation. These baseline parameter values are as in Table 1, but
with yL1 = p1 + yL = 1, yL2 = p2 + yL = 1.03, and yL = yH = 0. In this case, the unemployment rate is virtually
constant. The table includes results for a symmetric Cobb-Douglas matching function, with < = ½, and
also for the labor share and matching elasticity parameters used by Shimer (" = < = 0.72). Although these
parameters affect the level of unemployment, they have little effect on volatility.

 Note:
 The “flat rate” wage is given by ws = (r+*)Ws , where Ws is the present value of wages.
 The “nondecreasing rate” is given by w1 = (r+*)W1 - 81(W2 - W1), as explained in Section 5.


    Table 2 also shows that even though wages are sticky with respect to cyclical changes in the
distribution of the idiosyncratic component of productivity, there is nevertheless substantial cyclical wage
variation. Thus although ad hoc sticky wage models have been strongly criticized by Pissarides (2007)
on the grounds that they generate too little wage volatility, this criticism does not apply to the
informational rents model. The present value of wages is about 1% higher in the good aggregate state,
and if the wage contract delivers this present value by specifying a single constant wage for all matches
when the aggregate state is good, and a temporary initial wage for matches made in the bad state, then the
wage rate (in new matches) is about 3.5% higher in the good state.
    Hagedorn and Manovskii (2006) have argued that the Mortensen-Pissarides model can generate
realistic unemployment fluctuations if the value of the worker’s outside option is close to the value of
production. In the model considered here, this means setting y0 near 1. Hagedorn and Manovskii

                                                       23
calibrated y0 as .955, with < = .052. Table 3 explores the implications of these parameter values, in the
model with no informational rents.

    When the workers’ outside opportunities are almost as good as their market production opportunities,
unemployment is indeed more volatile. Mortensen and Nagypál (2007) argue that this is quite unrealistic,
since it implies that the average worker has little to gain from employment. Moreover, as Costain and
Reiter (2006) and Hornstein, Krusell and Violante (2005) point out, it also implies implausibly large
changes in unemployment rates in response to small changes in unemployment benefits. And even the
rather extreme value of y0 advocated by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2006) generates only about a 20%
difference between the unemployment rates in the two states. The last column of the table shows that
volatility increases sharply as y0 approaches 1. It might seem that everyone should be unemployed in the
bad state if y0 = 1, since this means that jobs produce no surplus, and in order to move workers into jobs,
it is necessary to expend resources on vacancy costs. But in fact the bad state is not expected to last very
long, and jobs generate a (small) surplus in the good state. Moving some workers into jobs in the bad
state reduces congestion in the matching process when the economy switches to the good state. From the
employer’s point of view, it is worthwhile to create vacancies in the bad state in anticipation of a
transition to the good state, because when that transition occurs the aggregate component of productivity
will increase. If the transition to the good state is unlikely, the unemployment rate in the bad state will be
high. But in the data, recessions are relatively short-lived, so the Hagedorn and Manovskii calibration
yields a relatively small difference between the unemployment rates in the good and bad states.




                                                      24
     Table 4 shows that in a comparison of steady states with no transitions, the Hagedorn and Manovskii
calibration gives much more volatility.7 But this is largely beside the point, since the volatility in the data
is generated by a single economy with transitions between states, while Table 4 compares the steady
states of two different economies. This is illustrated by considering the effects of the very low value for
the labor share parameter used by Hagedorn and Manovskii. Although this generates additional volatility
in the comparison of two unrelated economies shown in Table 4, it actually reduces volatility in the more
relevant comparison of steady states of a single stochastic economy, as shown in Table 3. Again, the
reason for this is evidently that when the employer gets most of the surplus there is a stronger tendency to
create vacancies in the bad state in anticipation of a transition to the good state, and this effect is absent in
the model without transitions.

Cyclical Movements in the Dispersion of Productivity
     It has been shown that small variations in informational rents generate large variations in the
unemployment rate. It is of course difficult to obtain evidence that such variations actually occur,
precisely because they are due to private information. But it seems reasonable to suppose that procyclical
variations in informational rents would be associated with procyclical variations in the variability of labor
productivity across employers. Figure 3 shows some evidence in favor of such variations. Dunne, Foster,
Haltiwanger and Troske (2004) analyzed productivity dispersion across manufacturing plants over the
period 1975-1992. As Dunne et al point out, dispersion increased over this period, especially from 1986

      Here :0 cannot be chosen so as to equate the average job-finding rate in the model with the empirical value, because each
realization of the aggregate state is permanent, so there is no invariant distribution that can be used to take an average. Instead, :0 is
chosen to solve the equilibrium equations with N1 + N2 (81/82) = 6 (1 + (81/82)) , where 81/82 = 5, as in the baseline model. This
corresponds to taking a limit as the transition rates become small, while their ratio stays fixed.

                                                                   25
to 1992. Figure 3 shows the Dunne et al productivity dispersion series, overlaid on a Hodrick-Prescott
estimate of the trend, in relation to the U.S. unemployment rate. Productivity dispersion is clearly
procyclical over this (admittedly short) period.

7. Are Informational Rents Bigger when More Information is Private?
    A key feature of the model is that the dispersion of the privately observed component of the match
surplus increases in the good aggregate state, and this increased dispersion gives rise to an increase in
informational rent. An important theoretical issue is then whether the increase in informational rent arises
merely from the assumption that the privately observed portion of the surplus takes just two possible
values, with the worker optimally choosing to demand one of these values or the other. Given just two
possible realizations, a small increase in the probability of the high surplus is not enough to induce the
worker to switch the optimal demand from the low value to the high value, but in the case of a more


                                                     26
general distribution an improvement in the distribution would induce the worker to make a more
aggressive demand, and it is not clear that this would leave a larger informational rent for the employer.
    One way to analyze this is to consider an alternative situation in which the surplus is distributed
continuously over an interval. Without loss of generality, the lowest possible surplus can be taken to be
0. Thus consider a worker making a take-it-or-leave-it demand to an employer in a match where the
surplus is a + s, with a > 0 and s distributed over the interval [0,b]. Let y = s/b, distributed on [0,1]
according to the distribution function F. The worker’s payoff from a demand a + bx is zero if this
demand exceeds the actual surplus, which is the case if x > y. Thus the worker’s expected payoff is
(a+bx)(1-F(x)).
    A simple way to formulate the question is to ask whether an increase in b leads to an increase in the
informational rent. An increase in b, with F fixed, magnifies the surplus in every state of the world. This
is known to the worker, and it is assumed that the employer’s only options are to say yes or no to a single
offer made by the worker. The question is whether the employer’s expected payoff increases when the
distribution improves in this way, even though the change in the distribution is common knowledge, and
the worker has all of the bargaining power. In the absence of private information, the employer would get
no surplus in this situation. So any positive payoff for the employer arises solely from the employer’s
informational advantage, and is thus an informational rent.
    The informational rent when the worker demands x is R = b[E max(y,x) - x], which can be written as


                                        R = b ∫ [1 − F ( t ) ] dt
                                                 1
                                                                                                            (52)
                                                 x




The worker’s problem can be stated as


                                   max ( c + x )(1 − F ( x ) )                                              (53)
                                   x ∈[ 0 ,1]




where c = a/b.
    First, it is clear that an increase in b implies an increase in the worker’s optimal demand. Indeed
suppose that b increases from b0 to b1 , meaning that c decreases from c0 to c1 (with a fixed), and let the
corresponding optimal choices of x be x0 and x1. Then optimality implies


                                                       27
                         (c + x )(1 − F ( x )) ≥ (c

                                                                + x1 ) 1 − F ( x1 )

                          (c + x )(1 − F ( x )) ≥ (c            + x )(1 − F ( x ))
                                                                                                            (54)

Since the expected payoff is positive for x = 0, and zero for F(x) = 1, it follows that 1-F(x) is positive at
the optimum. Thus the above revealed preference inequalities can be written as


                                c0 + x 0   1 − F ( x1 ) c1 + x 0
                                         ≥             ≥
                                c0 + x1 1 − F ( x 0 ) c1 + x1
                                                                                                            (55)



which implies )x)c # 0. Thus an increase in b implies an increase in x.
    Next, the pooling solution (x = 0) is optimal if the opportunity cost of screening is high relative to the
expected gains. Indeed pooling is optimal if and only if


                                                 ⎛ 1          ⎞
                                      max x⎜               − 1⎟ ≤ c                                         (56)
                                      x ∈[ 0 ,1] ⎝ F ( x )    ⎠

For example, if F is the uniform distribution, pooling is optimal if c $ 1. On the other hand, if F is
differentiable at 0, then F(x) . xF'(0), for x near 0. Thus if F has zero density at the origin, then pooling
cannot be optimal for any value of c.
    Obviously, if pooling is optimal, and remains so after an increase in b, then the informational rent
increases with b, just as in the case of the two-point distribution analyzed above. The issue considered
here is whether this result is limited to the case where pooling is optimal. In fact, it is not: it is shown in
Appendix B that it holds for a reasonably broad class of distributions.
    If pooling is not optimal, and if F has a density f, the optimal choice of x must satisfy the first-order
condition

This can be written as


                                                       28

                                                      h( x ) b


where h is the hazard function.
     The simplest example is the uniform distribution. In that case if b < a, pooling is optimal, so a (small)
increase in b necessarily gives an increase in the informational rent. For some distributions, when b
increases to the point where screening becomes optimal, there is then a downward jump in the rent. The
two-point distribution has this property: when the probability of the good state or the size of the surplus in
the good state rise beyond a certain point, the informational rent disappears. But it will be shown that in
the case of a uniform distribution there is no downward jump, and that further increases in b lead to
increases in R, even though the worker screens more aggressively.
     For a uniform distribution with b > a, the optimal screening price is

                                                            1⎛  a⎞
                                                     x=      ⎜1− ⎟                                                                 (59)
                                                            2⎝  b⎠


Thus the rent is given by

                                                             ⎛1     1 ⎞

                                                                                                                                    (60)
                                          a⎛   b a⎞
                                         = ⎜2 + + ⎟
                                          8⎝   a b⎠


which is increasing in b (when b > a). Thus when the surplus is magnified, the informational rent
increases, regardless of whether pooling or screening is optimal.8




     8
       More general versions of this result for a class of beta distributions are given in Appendix B. Thus the result for the case of a
two-point distribution of the private information variable is reasonably robust. But it should be noted that the result certainly does
not hold for all distributions, or even for all beta distributions. For example, if F(y) = y¾, with a = 1, screening becomes optimal
when b = 2.1165. There is a downward jump in the informational rent at this point, and after this the rent continues to fall until
b = 2.2684; beyond this point the rent is increasing in b.

                                                                   29
8. Alternative Explanations of Unemployment Volatility
    Starting with Shimer (2005) and Costain and Reiter (2005), the literature on unemployment volatility
has developed very rapidly. The main developments have recently been reviewed by Mortensen and
Nagypál (2007), and by Pissarides (2007). The focus has been largely on modifications of the wage-
setting mechanism that increase the elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to productivity. The
main point is that if the profit margin associated with a filled job is very small, then small changes in
productivity can have large effects on profits, and therefore on vacancy creation.
    As a point of reference, consider a simple wage-setting mechanism in which the wage is set one day
at a time. Each day, either the worker or the employer is selected to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer
setting the wage for that day. Wages and profits are then given by

                                 w0 = ν y + (1 − ν ) y0
                                 π 0 = y − w0 = (1 − ν )( y − y0 )

where < is the probability that the worker makes the offer. Thus w0 is a weighted average of the worker’s
productivity inside and outside of the match. It was shown in Lemma 2 above that the Nash bargaining
mechanism used in the M-P model yields a wage that is an average of y and w0 , with weights that depend
on the job-finding rate. Thus the wage is a nested weighted average of y and y0 , and since M is close to 1
for standard parameter values, the Nash wage is heavily influenced by the worker’s job-finding prospects.
The worker gets a bigger share of the surplus when the job-finding rate increases, but even in a recession
the worker gets a very large share.
    The elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to productivity is governed by the free entry
condition. Not much is lost by assuming that the matching function is Cobb-Douglas, and that it is
symmetric in the number of vacancies and the number of unemployed workers, so that N = :%&
                                                                                         2 . In this
case the free entry condition can be written as

                                              c             y−w
                                                   φ=
                                             μ   2
                                                            r +δ

Thus the volatility of the job-finding rate is the same as the volatility of the profit flow (with * fixed).
Using Lemma 2, the elasticity of N is given by


                                                       30
                                             ∂ log( φ )            y      1
                                                            =
                                             ∂ log( y )         y − y0 1 + Φ


This elasticity is not large unless an unmatched worker is almost as productive as a matched worker, as in
Hagedorn-Manovskii (2006).
     If the wage is fixed, then

                                                    d log(φ )    y
                                                              =
                                                    d log( y ) y − w

Thus, as Hall (2005) pointed out, if the wage is sticky the response of the job finding rate to productivity
may be very elastic; but this is true only if the wage is set at a level that is close to the productivity level.
     If the wage is negotiated every day, then y-w = (1-<)(y-y0), so

                                                   d log(φ )     y
                                                             =
                                                   d log( y ) y − y 0

This is closely related to the point made by Hall and Milgrom (2007): if the worker’s option to find
another match is regarded as being irrelevant, then there is no link between N and w, and so the elasticity
of the job finding rate is increased. But again, the elasticity is not large unless the value of the worker’s
outside option is almost as good as the value of working.9
     Nagypál (2005) and Mortensen and Nagypál (2007) develop an extended version of the Mortensen-
Pissarides model that is capable of matching both the volatility of unemployment and the observed
negative correlation of unemployment and vacancies. They introduce four modifications of the basic
model. First, exogenous job destruction shocks provide an additional source of unemployment
movements, (without being so large as to overturn the negative U-V correlation generated by productivity
shocks). Second, there are substantial job-to-job flows. Although the job separation rate is relatively
constant, as was argued by Hall (2006), the flow from employment to unemployment increases in
recessions, as was shown by Elsby, Michaels and Solon (2007), because the job-to-job flow decreases.


     9
      In the Hall-Milgrom model, the employer pays a bargaining cost ( each day until a wage agreement is reached. Thus on a day
when the worker is selected to make the offer, the wage is y+( (leaving the employer indifferent between saying yes or no), and
when the employer makes the offer the wage is y0. The average profit flow is then (1- <)(y-y0-(). Thus the elasticity N can be made
large even though y0 is not close to y, by choosing a suitable value of (.

                                                                31
Third, in order to post a vacancy, the employer must pay a lump sum hiring cost (in addition to the flow
cost of maintaining the vacancy). Fourth, the wage bargaining is day-to-day (as described above), so the
wage is not affected by the job-finding rate. Taken together, these four modifications lead to a model that
can match the data if the lump sum hiring cost is sufficiently large (about nine months worth of profits).
But the extended model is unwieldy, and the empirical plausibility of the required hiring costs is
questionable. Moreover, as Pissarides (2007) points out, if the observed fluctuations in the job
destruction rate are interpreted in the context of the original Mortensen-Pissarides model (rather than
being treated as exogenous changes in the rate at which matches are destroyed), they do not generate
much volatility in unemployment, because they are not associated with changes in the job creation rate.
The informational rents model developed here introduces just one modification of the standard model,
and thereby explains the same facts in a more parsimonious way.


9. Conclusion
    Rent is a powerful economic force, and private information is a pervasive rent source, so it is
plausible that private information can help to explain features of the economy that are otherwise difficult
to understand. It has been shown here that the introduction of private information in an otherwise
standard model of unemployment fluctuations provides a reasonable explanation for the volatility of
unemployment. In the standard Mortensen-Pissarides model, unemployment fluctuations are driven by
labor productivity shocks. In the data, these shocks are small, and the implied fluctuations in
unemployment are also small, and much smaller than the fluctuations in the data. But if the productivity
realizations are privately observed by employers, the implications for unemployment fluctuations are
quite different. Small productivity shocks generate informational rents for employers, and small rents are
a powerful job creation force. Thus privately observed productivity shocks of the magnitude seen in the
data can generate realistic unemployment fluctuations.

             The Neutral Bargaining Solution: One-sided Private Information with 2 types
    Myerson (1984) proposed the Neutral Bargaining Solution as a generalization of the Nash bargaining
solution suitable for a broad class of two-person bargaining problems with private information. There is a
finite set of decisions, D. A direct revelation mechanism : specifies the probabilities of the various
decisions, conditional on information reported by the players. The payoff for player i, ui(d,t), depends on
the decision d, and on the vector of reported types, t. Thus the expected payoff of player i of type ti is

                               U i (μ |ti ) =   ∑ ∑ p(t | t )μ(d , t )u (d , t )
                                                                      i   i
                                                t ∈T d ∈D

where p gives the probability of the type vector t, conditional on ti, and :(d,t) is the probability that the
decision d is chosen, given that types are reported as t.
    Consider a two-player bargaining problem in which the surplus to be divided is either SH or SL, with
probabilities J, and 1-J, where the realization of S is known to player 1, but not to player 2. There are
three decisions, D = {d0,d1,d2}, where d0 is the conflict outcome in which each player gets zero, d1 means
that player 1 gets S, where S is the realized value of the surplus (and player 2 gets zero), and d2 means
that player 2 gets SH, and player 1 gets S-SH. Thus the payoffs depend on whether player 1 is of type H or
type L, as follows

 (u1,u2)                     d0                                  d1                  d2

 1H                          (0,0)                               (SH,0)              (0,SH)

 1L                          (0,0)                               (SL,0)              (-)S,SH)

where )S = SH - SL.


It is not difficult to show that there are incentive-efficient mechanisms that select d0 with positive
probability if and only if J $ SL/SH (see Kennan (1986)). This condition does not hold in the model
considered in this paper. Incentive compatibility then requires that the probability of choosing d1 is the
same in both states, since player 1’s payoff is increasing in this probability, regardless of the state. Let "
be the multiplier associated with this constraint, and let :(di) be the probability of choosing decision i, for
i 0 {1,2}.
    Myerson’s Theorem 5 gives a set of conditions which must hold for every mechanism : in the set of
neutral bargaining solutions. It will be shown that there is only one mechanism that satisfies these


                                                            33
conditions. Since the NBS set is not empty (according to Myerson’s Theorem 2), this is a neutral
bargaining solution, and it is unique.
    The conditions are as follows. The mechanism : is incentive-efficient, and there exist 8 0R3, T 0R3

                 = min α ≥0 max(λ1 H + α , λ2τ )S H + λ1L S L + max(λ2 (1 − τ ) − λ1L ,−α )S H   )

    In the low state, it must be optimal to choose d1, since otherwise the mechanism would choose d2 with
probability 1 in the low state, and then UL would be negative, so the mechanism would not be feasible. It
must also be optimal to choose d1 in the high state. Otherwise :H(d1) = 0, and then the incentive
compatibility constraint implies :L(d2) = 1, which is impossible, as was just shown.
    The dual problem can therefore be written as


                                                            35
                    (                                                     )
          min α ≥ 0 V1H (d 1 ) + V2 H (d 1 ) + V1 L (d1 ) + V2 L (d1 ) = λ1H S H + λ1 L S L


The optimality of d1 also implies that the warrant equations can be written as
                                                    1           1
                                 λ1 Lω1 L − αω1H =    λ1 L S L − αS H
                                                    2           2

                                   (λ1H   + α )ω1H = (λ1H + α )S H
                                                    1
                                                    2
                                                    1           1
                                             λ2ω 2 = λ1 L S L + λ1H S H
                                                    2           2

If 81L = 0, then optimality of d1 in the low state implies " = 0, and 82 = 0, and then the third warrant
equation implies 81H = 0, which is a contradiction (since the theorem requires (8,") … 0). Thus 81L is
strictly positive, which implies T1L = U1L . And because 81L is strictly positive, the third warrant equation
implies that 82 and T2 are also strictly positive, and so T2 = U2.
    Since both decisions are optimal in both states, " must satisfy the equations

                                          α = λ1 L − λ2 (1 − τ )
                                            = λ2τ − λ1H

Thus

                                          λ2 = λ1 L + λ1H > 0

The complementary slackness conditions require either 81H = 0, or T1H = UH . Suppose 81H > 0. Then
T1H = UH = :1SH and the warrant equations can be written as
                                                     1           1
                                 λ1 LU 1 L − αU 1H =   λ1 L S L − αS H
                                                     2           2

                                   (λ1H   + α )U 1H = (λ1H + α )S H
                                                     1
                                                     2
                                                     1           1
                                             λ2U 2 = λ1 L S L + λ1H S H
                                                     2           2

Adding the first two equations here gives


                                                       36
                                                           1           1

and since 81L > 0 and 81H > 0 this implies :1 = ½. But then the third warrant equation gives

                              (λ 1L   + λ1H ) S H = λ1 L S L + λ1H S H
                                             1
                                             2
                                                   1
                                                   2

                                                              2

which is a contradiction, since SH > SL.
    Therefore 81H = 0, which implies 81L = 82 and " = J82, and the warrant equations reduce to
                                                       1           1

                                                       2


Since 81L > 0, UL = T1L, and the first two equations here imply T1L = ½SL, and this implies

                                                         1 SL
                                                μ1 = 1 −
                                                         2 SH

Finally, the second warrant equation implies T1H = ½SH, while UH = :1SH = SH - ½SL. So T1H < UH, and
all of the conditions of the theorem are satisfied.
    Thus it has been shown that the Neutral Bargaining Solution is unique, and that it gives player 2 half
of the low surplus, with player 1 getting the residual. Since JSH < SL, the optimal mechanism for player
two is a pooling demand, with :1 = 1-SL/SH, while the optimal mechanism for player 1 sets :1 = 1. So the
NBS is implemented by the random dictator mechanism (i.e. by randomly selecting the optimal
mechanism for one player or the other, with equal probabilities).

                                                  Appendix B
                  Are Informational Rents Bigger when More Information is Private?
    When an uninformed seller makes offers to a buyer whose valuation is drawn privately from some
known distribution, the optimal offer for the seller may be a pooling offer that concedes an informational
rent to the buyer. In that case a small improvement in the distribution of the buyer’s valuations implies an
increase in the informational rent. More generally, one might expect that when the buyer’s informational
advantage increases, the informational rent increases as well. But this is not always true. For example, a
large improvement in the distribution may cause the seller to switch from a pooling to a screening offer,
and in some cases this completely eliminates the informational rent. And in the case where partial
pooling is initially optimal, even a small improvement induces the seller to screen more aggressively,
with the possibility that the informational rent is reduced. The purpose of this Appendix is to examine
this possibility, for a limited but interesting class of distributions.
    Consider a seller making a take-it-or-leave-it demand to a buyer whose valuation is a + s, with a $ 0
and s distributed over the interval [0,b]. Let y = s/b, distributed on [0,1] according to the distribution
function F. The seller’s payoff from a demand a + bx is zero if this demand exceeds the actual surplus,
which is the case if x > y. Thus the seller’s expected payoff is (a+bx)(1-F(x)). The question is whether an
increase in b leads to an increase in the informational rent.
    Suppose that F is a beta distribution, with density



                                       Γ (α + β )
                                                       x α − 1 (1 − x )
                                                                          β −1
                           f ( x) =
                                      Γ (α ) Γ ( β )
                                                                                                      (79)




where ' is the gamma function, with " > 0, and $ > 0. Two subsets of this class of distributions will be
analyzed, one (Case A) defined by taking $ = 1 with " > 1, so that x has a power distribution with an
increasing density, and the other (Case B) defined by taking " = 1 (with no restriction on $), so that 1-x
has a power distribution. The uniform distribution is included in class B (and it is on the boundary of
case A).
    The following lemma will be used in the analysis of Case A.

Lemma
    The function

                                                          1 − zα
                                               f (α ) =                                                   (80)
                                                               α

is decreasing in ", for z > 0.


Proof:
    The derivative of f is


                                               − (1 − zα ) − αzα log( z)
                                  f ′ (α ) =                                                              (81)
                                                              α2

Let y = -"log(z). Then


                                 α 2 f ′ (α ) = e − y (1 + y ) − 1 ≤ 0                                    (82)


where the inequality holds because ey $ 1+y (with equality when y = 0, which means z = 1).


Case A
    Suppose F is a beta distribution with $ = 1 and " > 1. In this case pooling is never optimal, since
f(0) = 0. Let z be the optimal screening price. The seller’s objective function is strictly concave, and z is
the unique solution of the first-order condition

                                                              ⎛a   ⎞
                                       (1 − z ) − αz
                                               α       α −1
                                                              ⎜ + z⎟ = 0
                                                              ⎝b   ⎠
                                                                                                          (83)




This equation can be rewritten as




                                                          39
                                                      aα
                                      b=                                                                     (84)
                                             z 1−α   − (1 + α ) z



This gives b as a strictly increasing function of z, meaning that the optimal screening price is strictly
increasing in b. That being so, the informational rent R is increasing in b if and only if R is increasing in
z. Using equation (84), the relationship between R and z is given by



                                          (α − (1 + α ) z + z1+ α )
                                       b
                                R=
                                     1+ α
                                                                                                            (85)
                                      aα α − (1 + α ) z + z1+ α
                                   =
                                     1 + α z1− α − (1 + α ) z

Taking derivatives and simplifying the result gives


           1 + α dR α − 1 − (1 + α )( z − z + z         ) + 2z 1+α
                                           α      1+ 2α

                   =
                                (1 − (1 + α ) z α ) 2
                                                                                                            (86)
            aα dz


Thus R is increasing in z (and therefore in b) if and only if numerator of the expression on the right side
of this equation is nonnegative.
    The first-order condition determining the screening price implies that



                                         1 − (1 + α ) z α ≥ 0                                               (87)



Thus

                                      z1+ α − (1 + α ) z1+ 2α ≥ 0                                            (88)




                                                      40
So it is enough to show that

                            ψ ( z) = α − 1 − (1 + α )( z − z α ) + z 1+ α ≥ 0                         (89)



The derivative of R is given by



                                  ψ ′ ( z) = (1 + α )( zα + αzα −1 − 1)                               (90)



Since R'(0) < 0 < R'(1) and R''(z) > 0, the function R has a unique minimum, say at z0. So it is enough to
show that R(z0) $ 0. Note that


                      ψ ( z0 ) = ψ ( z0 ) + z0ψ ′ ( z0 ) = α − 1 − αz0 + z0α                           (91)


Thus R(z0) $ 0 if and only if

                                                   1 − zα0
                                            α≥                                                        (92)
                                                      1 − z0

This is an immediate implication of Lemma A, because f(1) $ f(") for " > 1.
    Thus it has been shown that although pooling is never optimal for a power distribution with exponent
greater than one, the informational rent nevertheless increases when the extent of the employer’s private
information is magnified.


Case B
    Suppose F is a beta distribution with " = 1. The simplest example is the uniform distribution (with

    The derivative of the worker’s objective function is given by


                          H ′ ( x ) = (1 − x ) − β (1 − x ) (c + x )
                                                 β                   β −1

                                                                                                             (94)
                                   = (1 − x ) (1 − βc − (1 − β ) x )

where c = a/b. If $c $ 1 then H'(x) # 0 for all x, so pooling is optimal. If $c # 1 then H'(x) > 0 for all
x < x*, and H'(x) < 0 for all x > x*, where x* is given by

                                                     1 − βc
                                           x* =                                                              (95)
                                                     1− β

Also, H(x* ) = 0, so screening at x* is optimal. Thus the mapping from b to R is given by

                                    ⎧                        b
                                    ⎪                                       b ≤ aβ
                                    ⎪                      β +1
                             R(b) = ⎨                 β +1    β +1
                                    ⎪ b ⎛ β ⎞ ⎛⎜ 1 + a ⎞⎟                   b ≥ aβ
                                    ⎪ β + 1 ⎜⎝ β + 1⎟⎠ ⎝   b⎠
                                    ⎩

The function R(b) is obviously increasing in the pooling region. To show that it is increasing in the
screening region, it is enough to show that
                                                             β +1
                                                 ⎛    a⎞
                                                b⎜ 1 + ⎟
                                                 ⎝    b⎠


is increasing in b, for b $ a$, or equivalently that the function
                                                                    β +1
                                                      ⎛ 1⎞
                                           ω ( z ) = z⎜ 1 + ⎟
                                                      ⎝    z⎠


is increasing in z, for z $ $ > 0. The derivative of this function is




                                                      42
                                                             β +1                        β
                                                ⎛ 1⎞                         ⎛ 1⎞ 1
                                      ω ′( z) = ⎜ 1 + ⎟             − (β + 1)⎜ 1 + ⎟
                                                ⎝    z⎠                      ⎝    z⎠ z
                                                            β
                                                 ⎛ 1⎞ ⎛     β⎞
                                               = ⎜1 + ⎟ ⎜1 − ⎟
                                                 ⎝   z⎠ ⎝   z⎠

So the function is increasing.
    Thus it has been shown that for any beta distribution with " = 1, the informational rent increases
when the extent of the employer’s private information is magnified, even though this induces the worker
to switch from a pooling price to a screening price.10

      Note that the rent function R(b) is continuous (but not differentiable) at the point where screening becomes optimal.
