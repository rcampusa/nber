             Post—War Capital Accumulation and the Threat of Nuclear War



                                     ABSTRACT



     The hypothesis of this paper is that the performance and, in par-
ticular, the rate of capital accumulation of the post—war U.S. economy
has been influenced by the changes in the public perception of the threat
of a catastrophic nuclear war. An increased threat shortens the expected
horizon of individuals and firms, and thus reduces the willingness to
postpone present consumption in favor of investment.
     The hypothesis is tested by expanding a standard savings function
estimation technique to include a measure of the perceived threat of
nuclear war. Four alternative measures of the perceived threat are con-
sidered, all of which are based on the setting of the clock published
monthly in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists which reflects the editors'
judgment about the likelihood of a nuclear conflict. The tests all support
a large and statistically significant impact of the threat of nuclear
war on the rate of private saving.

     These tests are not viewed as conclusive evidence in favor of the
economic impact of the perceived threat of nuclear war. Nevertheless,
this research suggests that economists may have been overlooking an im-
portant source of variation in the post—war, post—nuclear U.S.
                                                               economy.
Conceivably, it could affect not only the private savings rate but also
such things as the level of investment in human capital, the level of
asset prices, the term structure of interest rates, and the rate of
inflation.

      Most economists would not quarrel with the statement that desired

 saving by households is potentially sensitive to changes in expected

 life span and the ability to leave bequests. After all, life cycle

 saving and saving for bequests are two of the most important motives

 for accumulating wealth. From this perspective it is notable that

 recent attempts to explain variations in post—war rates of capital

 accumulation (Boskin, 1978; I-Iowrey and Hymans, 1978) have failed to

 consider a potentially significant contribution to changes in expected

life span and the perceived ability to leave bequests      the threat

of nuclear war. Popular perception of the likelihood of a nuclear war

is by no means insignificant. A recent Associated Press/NBC News

public opinion survey found that 76 per cent of Americans believe war

is likely within a few years.-1 Moreover, when asked if, in the event

of a world war, nuclear weapons would be used on the U.S., typically

70 per cent of Americans answer in the affirmative.-' Finally,

in 1963, 89 per cent of Americans perceived their chances of surviving

a nuclear war to be 50—50 or less.-'Apparently, a significant fraction

of Americans take the threat of a life—threatening nuclear war in the

not—too—distant future to be a real possibility. There is also evidence,

to be discussed later, that the perceived threat of nuclear war has

varied quite a bit since the end of World War II. The hypothesis of

this paper is that these changes in the perceived threat of nuclear war

have had a significant impact on the rate of capital accumulation in

the U.S. in the past thirty—five years.

     The remainder of this paper is divided into five sections. Section I

develops some simple economic reasoning about the expected impact of a

threat of nuclear war. In Section II, I present a measure of the
                                   —2—
threat of nuclear war, describe a test of the hypothesis, and describe

the data to be used in the test. Section III describes the results

of the test, and in Section IV the plausibility of the estimated effect

is considered. Some concluding remarks are offered in Section V.

I. Savings, Investment, and the Threat of Nuclear War

     Consider an individual who dies a natural death at the end of T

periods.-" At the end of the ith period there is a probability p.

of a nuclear war which kills the individual and any of his potential

heirs. If the individual is still alive as of period I , there is a
                 T
                       that death will occur at the end of that
probability

period, unless I = T — 1       ,   in   which case the probability is unity.

     The individual maximizes expected utility which J given by

where C. is consumption and U(C1) is the utility enjoyed during

and V(B) is the satisfaction dervied by the bequeathor. Let the

      It is assumed that life insurance and annuity contracts written

 concerning death due to nuclear war are not available. Also it is not

 required that the individual at all times maintain non—negative

wealth, thus allowing the possibility of dying with outstanding

debts. It is, though, required that the consumer have non—negative

wealth if and when he or she reaches period T        .   Under these conditions

the sole constraint on the maximization problem is that



      (3)      A(l + r)T +              (1 + r)T(Y. — C.) —   B =   0



where A     is initial assets, Y1 is labor earnings during period i         ,


and   r is the rate of interest per period. Maximizing (2) subject to

(3) implies the following first—order conditions:


            U'(C.)                         q.

            V'(B)




Thus, an increased probability of future nuclear war (that is, a decrease

in q, if j > 1)     has the effect of increasing the effective

discounting of the future. The individual will tend to substitute

earlier consumption for later consumption and thus reduce the rate of

wealth accumulation.—

       Nuclear war, as opposed to the natural death of human beings,

will   doubtlessly destroy capital goods. This would reduce the
expected present value of investment projects, especially for long—lived
projects. If the present discounted        value of the project's income stream

is

 any interest rate will decline.

        Straightforward economic reasoning has led us to the conclusion

 that an increase in the perceived likelihood of nuclear war would

 reduce ceteris paribus, both desired saving and desired investment.

 In    the context of an equilibrium model of a growing economy, this
 would lead to a reduced rate of capital accumulation. Depending on
 the    detail and characteristics of the particular model chosen, it could
                              —5—

also decrease the market value of long—lived assets, alter the

term structure of interest rates, and have other impacts on the state

of the economy. In this paper I have chosen to concentrate on the

possible relationship between the threat of nuclear war and the rate

of capital accumulation. In the next section I begin the task of

investigating whether such a relationship can be detected in the

post—war U.S. economy.

               II. Data and Methodology

     The approach adopted here is to compare the time series of the

annual rate of capital accumulation with the time series of a measure

of the perceived threat of nuclear war. The choice of this latter

measure is discussed first.

     Public opinion survey data seems a reasonable source of information

about public perceptions of the likelihood of war. Unfortunately,

although relevant questions have been posed in national surveys, in

no case has the same question been asked over a long stretch of time since the

end of World War II. There does exist, though, a continually

available series which represents a professionally informed opinion

about the state of international tensions and the likelihood of a

nuclear war. Since 1947, the Editorial Advisory Board of the Bulletin

of the Atomic Scientists has printed on its editorial page a clock whose

hands are set at a time approaching midnight. Just how close to midnight

the hands are set represents the Board's judgment about how great the

danger of nuclear war is. When it first appeared in 1947, the clock

stood at seven minutes to midnight. It has since been moved ten times.

It has come ominously close to "doomsday": three minutes to midnight
                                  6—

in 1949, after the first Russian atomic bomb test, and two minutes to

midnight in 1953 in response to U.S. and Soviet development of the

hydrogen bomb. It was then gradually moved back in appreciation of the

thawing of the Cold War and, in particular, because of the Partial

Test—Ban Treaty (1963), the Nuclear Non—Proliferation Treaty (1969), and

the SAlT I agreement (1972). From June of 1972 to September of 1974

the clock stood at twelve minutes to midnight. However, since 1974,

the clock has been moved closer and closer to midnight, reflecting the

intensification of the nuclear and conventional arms races and the

apparent possession of nuclear weapons by a growing number of countries.

The last time it was moved was in January of 1981, to four minutes to

midnight .-i

       Although this variable is not directly a measure of the average
individual's perceptions of the danger of nuclear war, it does represent

informed opinion and should therefore be highly correlated with the

general perception. In addition, it has the advantage of being

available without interruption since 1947. The average setting of the

clock for each year beginning in 1947 is given in Table 1.

      One problem with using the clock's setting as an index of the

 nuclear threat is that, in order to enhance its public impact, the

Editorial Board seems to favor infrequent, large changes in the clock's

hand. Thus, the clock's movements may lag behind the actual changes

in the state of international tensions and also overstate the current

escalation or de—escalation of tensions. To account for this possibility,

a five—year moving average of the clock setting is considered as an

alternative measure of the perceived threat of nuclear war.2-"

     Although the clock setting seems to be a reasonable measure of

the likelihood of international conflict, what we are really interested

in measuring is the probability of annihilation due to a war. This

likelihood may be thought of as the product of the likelihood of nuclear

war and the probability of death/destruction from a war. From this

perspective, the clock's setting fails to account for the fact that the

size of the nuclear arsenal of the Soviet Union (and the United States)

has not remained constant in this period, and the probable destructiveness

of a nuclear war has no doubt greatly increased since 1947. To reflect

this aspect of the nuclear threat, I have constructed an index of the

likely devastation of a nuclear war, which is equal to the estimated

total of Soviet         submarine—based missiles, and long—range bombers.

These estimates are available annually since l947.-' Using these figures,

(denoted WEAP), a measure of the likelihood of destruction due to

nuclear war is formed as (NIN_MIN)            where
                                      WEAPt ,             MINt refers to the

minutes from midnight the clock is set at in year t   ,   and   HIN is an

arbitrarily chosen standard indicating no threat of war. This constructed

variable thus increases either when the clock moves closer to midnight
                              —8—

or the Soviet nuclear arsenal expands. The value of MIN used is 17;

this implies that at the most threatening period (two minutes to

midnight) the probability of nuclear war was three times as great

as in the least threatening period (twelve minutes to midnight).

     Figure 1 plots the path since 1947 of the first measure of the

threat of nuclear war, the clock setting, shown as a dotted line.

Measured on the vertical axis is the number of minutes from midnight

the clock is set at; thus, higher values correspond to a lower

perceived threat of nuclear war. Also plotted on Figure 1 is a measure

of the rate of capital accumulation, the ratio of net private saving to

disposable income plus retained earnings. According to the theory,

there should be a positive association between this measure of capital

accumulation and a perceived low probability of nuclear war. In fact,

the two variables apparently exhibit a positive association. Both

start high in 1947, decline and stay approximately constant until 1960.

Beginning in 1960 there is a diminution in the threat of nuclear war

and a concurrent increase in the rate of saving. Both reach a peak

in the mid 1960's, decline sharply in the late 1960's and early 1970's.

Another local peak is attained in both series around 1973. Beginning

in 1974, the threat of nuclear war has increased, while the rate of

saving has steadily declined. Clearly several of the turning points

and local extrema of the two series nearly coincide. The main

disparity comes from the comparison of the 1970's to the 1950's.

According to the clock, the threat of war was lower in the 1970's

than in the 1950's. The average savings rate in the 1970's, though,

was no higher than in the 1950's. However, in those twenty years the

nuclear arsenals of both countries greatly expanded, and thus the

probability of death due to nuclear war wsa no doubt higher in the

1970's than in the 1950's. This aspect of the changed international

situation would be picked up by the constructed variables which

include a measure of the Soviet nuclear capability.

      This apparent parallel movement between the rate of saving and

the freedom from the threat of nuclear war depicted in Figure 1 is

tested by estimating a standard savings function. The standard

specification is extended by adding one of the indices of the threat

of nuclear war discussed earlier. The specifications investigated

have the basic form

This is similar tD the specification estimated by Boskin (1978) and

Howrey and Humans (1978)2'. The dependent variable is the ratio of

net private saving to disposable income plus retained earnings. LNY

is the natural logarithm of real per capita disposable income plus

retained earnings)' LNW is the logarithm of real per capita non—human

wealth. (Non—human wealth is defined as the sum of net financial

assets at the beginning of the year and noncorporate and household

capital at replacement cost. The series is taken from }Iayashi (1981)).

LNUNEM is the logarithm of the unemployment rate, included to pick up any

 cyclical    variation in savings behavior. The final two independent

 variables  refer to one of the four measures of the threat of nuclear
 war. In the case of the unaveraged measures          and PWAR , defined
                                                             (MINt
 below) a lagged value is included to pick up any delayed response of
 saving and also to reflect the fact that all                the variables are annual

 averages.        Savings in January will not reflect changes in the explanatory
variables        that occur   later in the year, but will respond to those changes
that   occurred in the previous year. For the moving average measures,

only the current value is included.

                                 III. Results

       Equation (8) was estimated using ordinary least—squares for the

period 1948 to 1979. The results of estimating four separate regression

equations are presented below, each one corresponding to a different

index of the threat of nuclear war. The four indexes are (1) the average

clock setting in the current year, called                MIN (ii) the five—year
moving average of the clock setting, called MINAVt (iii) the constructed

variable (l7_MIN) x WEAPt          ,   called    PWAR    and (iv) the constructed

variable using themoving average measure of the threat of war, called

PWARAVt .        Standard errors are listed in parentheses below the estimated

coefficient.

       In all four equations one of the nuclear war variables has

the expected sign, which is positive for equations (9) and (10) and

negative for equations (11) and (12). In equations (9) and (11) it is
                              — 12 —


 the lagged value which has the explanatory power. In all the equations,

 the 95% confidence interval of the appropriate variable does not include

 zero. Furthermore, in all cases the magnitude of the estimated effect

 of the threat of nuclear war on the savings ratio is large relative to

 the average observed ratio and its variation in the post—war period.

 Consider first equations (9) and (10), where the nuclear war variable

has the units of a number of minutes to midnight. The estimated effect

 (which is the sum of   a5 and a6 for equation (9)) of about 0.0017

implies that a change from the period of lowest nuclear threat in the

post—war period (twelve minutes to midnight) to the greatest threat

(two minutes until midnight) implies a decline in the savings ratio of

0.017, or 1.7 percentage points. This compares to an average post—war

value of 0.102 and a standard deviation in post—war       of 0.011.

     Now consider the estimated coefficients of the nuclear threat

variable in equations (11) and (12), which are on the order of 3 x io_6

In 1979, the value of MINE was 9.0 and the value of    WEAPt was 2582.

The estimated coefficients thus imply that an increase in international

tensions equal to a drop of MINt to 4.0 (which is where it stands as

of 1981) would at the current level of weaponry be associated with a

decline in the saving ratio of 0.039. At the 1979 value of
                                                               MINt ,   a
50 per cent increase in Soviet weaponry would imply a decline in the

saving rate of 0.031.

     The estimated wealth and unemployment effects have mixed success

in meeting prior expectations. The coefficient on the wealth variable

is never statistically significant, and has the expected negative

sign only in equations (11) and (12). The coefficient on the
                             — 13 —



unemployment variable in all cases has the expected negative sign,

but is significant only in equations (9) and (10).

     Several variants of the basic equations (9)—(12) were investigated.

Two are worth mentioning here. The first applied a first—order

autocorrelation connection procedure to equations (9) and (10), the

cases where the Durbin—Watson statistic indicated the presence of

positive autocorrelation. The new estimates were not substantially

different from those presented above. The only change of note is that

the estimated coefficient of PWARt in equation (10) had a t—statistic

of 1.76, making it significantly different from zero with 90 per cent

confidence but not 95 per cent confidence.

     The other important extension of the basic equations entailed

adding other independent variables which may be expected to influence

aggregate savings behavior. The additional variables considered

were (1) a demographic variable, the logarithm of the ratio of the

population over 20 which are between the age of 45 and 64, the group

with the highest saving propensity; (ii) the logarithm of the effective

tax rate on capital income in the non—financial corporate   sector',
included in order to pick up variations in the after—tax rate of return

on a major form of investment; and (iii) the ratio of defense spending

to GNP, in order to pick up any interaction between the threat of war,

the level of exogenous spending, and the macroeconomic impact of that

spending. Jhen these variables are added to the basic specifications,

the significance of the nuclear threat variables is not disturbed

in any case except equation (10), where the coefficient of EWARt

while positive, becomes insignificantly different from zero. In the
                               — 14 —



 other   three cases, the magnitude of the estimated nuclear threat

 coefficients is not substantially different from those reported above.

The additional variables themselves have mixed success in adding

explanatory power to the equations. The demographic variable is the

most successful, always attracting the expected positive sign and

always significant at least at the 90 per cent confidence level.

However, the tax and defense spending variables are in all cases

insignificant.

     These results establish that the apparent inverse relationship

between savings rates and the perceived threat of nuclear war noticed

in Figure 1 survives a standard statistical test which includes other

possible influences on savings. In addition, there is reason to

believe that the regression analysis understates the explanatory

power of the nuclear war variable. The clock setting changed only

eight times during the thirty—two years sample period, and thus

cannot possibly account for "within—an—era" Variations in the

savings rate. A more sensitive measure of the perceived threat would

reduce the measurement error problem and could reasonably be expected

to have more explanatory power and a larger estimated absolute effect.

                  IV. Are the Results Plausible?

     In this section I will attempt to convince the reader of the

plausibility of such variations in saving rates in response to changed

perceptions of the likelihood of nuclear war. First, do people perceive

nuclear war to be a likely possibility over the near future? The answer,

if we are to believe the answers people give in public opinion polls,

is a definite yes. During the fifties and sixties, people were asked

whether they thought there would be a world war in the next five years.

Of those having an opinion, the percentage answering yes ranged from
                                   — 15 —



forty   to sixty—five. Most recently, 76 per cent of Americans said that

war was likely within five years. Also, people were asked whether in

the event of a world war the hydrogen bomb would be used against the
U.S. The percentage answering yes to this question varied between

sixty and seventy—five per cent from the mid—1950's to 1973. Combining

these    responses leads quickly to the conclusion that during this era
it is plausible that between one—quarter and one—half of all Americans
believed    that a nuclear war was likely within the    coming five years
The proportion who believe it      likely   over the next thirty years must
                                               12/
surely be significantly higher than that.—

        These figures establish that nuclear war is considered to be a

plausible event for the near future by a large number of Americans.

The renaming question is whether variations in its perceived likelihood

over the post—war period can explain significant changes in the saving

rate, Of course, the analysis presented earlier above establishes a

statistically significant association. But are the estimated magnitudes

consistent with other evidence about the interteraporal elasticity of

substitution and the degree of risk aversion?

        To investigate this question, consider a two—period life—cycle model

with a cardinal utility function of

(13)                          C)

The    implied intertetuporal elasticity of substitution is 1/(1 — a)
If    there is a probability p of a nuclear war at the end of the
first period,    the individual   will maximize expected utility, which
is equal to

 where W is the present value of the endowment stream. It is

 which is

and the dependence of C* on p                ,   which    is

                                  [(1+r) +


        The dependence of saving on the probability of nuclear war can

be quantitatively evaluated by inserting reasonable numbers into this

expression. As an illustration, I have chosen r                         ,   the interest
rate for a period approximating thirty years, to be one, and                               ,


the pure discount rate for this same time period, to be 0.75. Finally,

I let the first—period endowment be equal to four—fifths of the

present value of the earnings stream (Y1                       .8W) .       Using these
parameter values, the responsiveness of the first—period saving

ratio,    (Y1 —
                  C1)/Y1    ,   to p when p is close to zero cn be written

In order to judge whether a swing in the rate of saving of 0.017 or more is a

plausible response to the maximum variation in the threat of nuclear

war since 1947, we need to know what a reasonable value of a is

and also we need to translate the variation in the threat of war into

variations in the value of p .         Econometric evidence on a , or the

intertemporal elasticity of substitutiOn 1/(1 — a)         ,   has not centered

as of yet on a particular value. Therefore the implications of three

values of a are studied. These values are 0, —.1, and —4, which

imply intertemporal elasticities of 1, 0.5, and 0.2, respectively)'

Similarly, three values of the post—war variation in p are studied:

0.2, 0.1, and 0.05. Note that these correspond to the probability

of a nuclear holocaust before the "second period" is reached, which

may be conveniently thought of as lasting thirty years.           Table 2

presents the implied range in the savings rate corresponding to the

three elasticities of substitution and the three values for the

post—war variation in p ,          denoted

 The pairing of the assumptions most favorable to
                                                  a large shift in
 saving (a = 0   ,   p = 0.2)   imply a response (0.0624) nearly four

 times the response estimated in equations (9) and (10). The least

 favorable assumptions (a = —4, p = 0.05)      imply a shift of 0.0038 or
 about one—quarter of the estimated effect.     Assumptions in the middle

 range imply responses quite consistent with the econometric estimates

 derived in (9) and (10).

      Of course, these calculations ignore the behavior of individuals

who have already aged one period as well as the induced shift in desired

 investment or any general equilibrium adjustments.
                                                        Nevertheless, they
are suggestive that the econometric estimates have
                                                       a plausible magnitude.

                           V. Concluding Remarks

     The hypothesis examined in this paper, if correct, has far—reaching

implications for our understanding of the performance of the post—war,

or post—nuclear, U.S. economy. It suggests that the threat of nuclear

catastrophe has influenced the growth path of the economy and will

continue to affect the willingness of individuals
                                                     to postpone consumption
for the sake of capital accumulation, Such behavior would be a rational

response of a society faced with the changing probability of a limited

future. The estimates developed here indicate that a change in the

perceived threat of nuclear war from its lowest post—war level to

its highest level is accompanied by a decline in the annual savings

ratio of at least 1.7 percentage points, a significant amount compared

to the amount of observed post—war variation. It also suggests that

the increase in international tensions since late 1979 to 1981 may have
                              — 19 —



caused a decline of at least 0.8 percentage points in the savings
      14/
rat io.—

     I do not believe that the evidence presented in this paper decisively

establishes the impact of the threat of nuclear war on post—war

U.S. economic performance. Much more research is required, not only

concerning aggregate savings behavior,but on other aspects of the

economy. The perceived threat of nuclear war would, if the hypothesis,

is correct, influence the post—war behavior of stock market and other

asset prices, the term structure of interest rates, the rate of

investment in human capital, the mix of investment between long— and

short—lived assets, among other phenomena. At the least, though,

this research suggests that any time—series analysis of these and

sinilar phenomena which do not treat this consideration may be

ignoring a significant factor in the performance of the U.S. economy

since the beginning of the nuclear age.

 Barro and Friedman (1977).


      This model does not consider other possible respones to the threat

of nuclear war which may offset the tendency to slow the accumulation of

wealth. Two such responses are moving up the planned age of retirement

 (or, in general, changing the lifetime pattern of labor supply) and

protecting oneself against the effects of a nuclear war by, say, building

a bomb shelter.

tax rate on corporate capital income, is included in an alternate

specification discussed below. On the problems of measuring the

real after—tax return to saving, see Howrey and Hymans (1978) and

the comments that follow.


     All   variables   reflect the revision of the national income and

product accounts released by the Department of Commerce in late 1980.

     The tax variable is the one calculated in Feldstein and Poterba

(1980). Since the tax rate series begins in 1953, this series was

extended by extrapolating the trend behavior to the end of the sample

period. Details of this extrapolation procedure can be obtained

from the author.

     Hausman (1979) finds evidence that individual subjective discount

of energy—using durables. Although Hausman does not appeal to the

perceived threat of nuclear war, such high discount rates are compatible

with the evidence cited in the text which document high public concern

about a future world war.

      The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists clock stood at nine minutes until

 midnight during 1979. As of January, 1981, it was set to four minutes

 until midnight. The estimates derived in this paper suggest that this
