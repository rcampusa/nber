                                                ABSTRACT


        A decade ago the Economisl           began an annual survey of Big Mac prices as a guide to

“whether     currencies   are trading at the right exchange rates.”   This paper asks how well the

hamburger standard has performed.      Although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are

large for several currencies, once estimates of these average deviations are removed from the data,

the evidence suggests that convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. The half-life of

deviations   from Big Mac parity appear to be about 1 year, which is considerably        shorter than

estimates of the half-life of deviations from purchasing power parity (4-5 years) that are reported in

the literature.    In addition, deviations    from relative Big Mac parity appear to provide useful

information for forecasting exchange rates. After accounting for currency-specific    constants, a 10

percent undervaluation      according to the hamburger standaid in one year is associated with a 3.5

percent appreciation over the following year, Finally, deviations from relative Big Mac parity seem

to be helpful in forecasting relative local currency prices. When the U.S. dollar price of Big Mats

is high in a country, the relative local currency price of Big Mats in that country is likely to fall

during the following year.

       In 1986 the Economist began publishing a survey of prices of Big Mats in a number of

countries as a rough (or as they characterized it, a “medium rare”) guide to “whether currencies

are trading at the right exchange rates.”1 It seems natural to examine how the hamburger

standard has pefiormed.

       A casual reader of the Economi@ knows that deviations horn Big Mac parity in any given

year can be sizable. But if those deviations tend to die out quickly, the hamburger standard may

provide a useiid guide to underlying currency values. In this paper I ask three questions about the

behavior of deviations from Big Mac parity. First, are deviations from Big Mac parity permanent

or is there a tendency toward a return to Big Mac parity? If there is a tendency toward Big Mac
                                                                                        .
parity, what is the nature of the adjustment?    If part of the adjustment comes through exchange

rate changes, deviations from Big Mac parity might be usefid in forecasting exchange rate

changes. This raises the second question.    Do current deviations from Big Mac parity help

forecast fbture exchange rate changes?      A tendency toward Big Mac parity may also arise if

deviations influence local currency pricing decisions.   If current deviations from Big Mac panty

influence local currency pricing decisions, current deviations should help predict fbture relative

price changes. This suggests a third question.    Do deviations from Big Mac parity forecast

changes in the relative local currency prices of Big Mats?

       When using the hamburger standard data to answer questions about the dynamics of

deviations from Big Mac parity and the usefidness of these deviations in forecasting fiture

exchange rate and relative price changes, one is inevitably confronted with the relatively short

time series available. These short time series make it diflicult to draw conclusions about the


    1Economist, September 6, 1986, p.77.
dynamic behavior of deviations from Big Mac parity and the forecasting power of these

deviations.   I attempt to overcome the difiicukies raised by the short sample by exploiting the

panel aspect of the data. Although the Economist has published data for only a relative short

period of time, it provides similar data for a number of currencies.   This yields a substantially

larger data set for inference and facilitates more precise estimates of the dynamic relationship

followed by exchange rate changes and deviations from Big Mac parity than is possible using only

time series evidence.

        I. Data

        The Econo mi@ introduced its annual survey of the ‘hamburger standard” in its September

6, 1986 issue with data submitted by its “Golden Arches” correspondents.       The initial piece

contained price data on Big Mats from fifteen countries along with the corresponding fourteen

exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. They followed this piece in the January 12, 1987 issue

with price data from nine countries, seven of which were included in the September 1986 survey.

Denmark and Italy were added. The survey has been repeated annually in April from 1988

through 1996 with its coverage expanded from seventeen countries in 1988 to thirty-three

countries in 1996.

        Because the 1986 and 1987 surveys were much closer together than the subsequent

surveys (one quarter rather than one year apart) and the coverage of the 1987 survey is much

narrower than the others, I combine the two by taking the 1987 data when available and the 1986

data otherwise.   Over time countries have been added to the survey and some have been dropped.
The sample I use consists of the fourteen countries that have the fidl ten years of data.2 I then

have a panel consisting of thirteen exchange rates and ten time series observations.        One

observation is lost because a lag is needed for the regressions, so there are effectively nine time

series observations for each currency.




        1. The Dynamics of Deviations from Big Mac Parity

        Let EL,be the exchange rate between currency i and the U. S. dollar at time t, expressed as

units of currency i per U.S. dollar.   Next, let Pj~be the local currency price of a Big Mac. Define

the Big Mac parity exchange rate, EBMPL,, between currency i and the U. S. dollar as the
                                                                                       .
exchange rate that equates the U.S. dollar price of Big Mats in country i with the U.S. price of

Big Mats.   Thus, EBMPL, = Pi/Pu~,, and ~~ = ln(EBMP@Lt)              is approximately the percent

deviation horn Big Mac parity. Equivalently, ln(EBMPi/Ei,)            is the logarithm of the real Big Mac

exchange rate.

        Standard augmented Dickey-Fuller (1979) tests for the stationarity of deviations from Big

Mac parity are based on the autoregression,


                                                           1

Unfortunately these test have notoriously low power, a problem that is likely to be especially

severe a sample of 10 annual observations.    The panel nature of the data may, however, allow for

greater power.        @ Pesaran and Shin ( 1995) propose a test for unit roots in a heterogeneous panel.

Their test of the null hypothesis that pi= 1 for i = 1,...,N is based on the average t-ratio from ( 1),

‘N=   N-’   ~!=I   (bi - l)i~;.   ~eY   show that the Statistk




is distributed asymptotically as a standard normal. The mean and variance of the average t-ratio,

a~ and b~ depend only on T and k (the average of the ~ ) and are tabulated by @ Pesaran, and

            The results of the augmented Dickey-Fuller and@       Pesaran, and Shin tests are reported in

Table 1. The first column contains the sample means of the deviations from Big Mac parity, the

second and third columns report the estimates of the intercept and the autoregressive coefficient,

p, computed with& set to zero. The fourth column contain the augmented Dickey-Fuller t-ratio

computed with the number of lags, & (reported in column 5), determined using the general-to-

specific procedures suggested by Hall (1994) and Ng and Perron ( 1995).          The estimates of the

autoregressive coefficient are all far from one. In fact, none is significantly different from zero at

conventional levels. But, due to the small sample and the consequent lack of precision in

estimating p, only four of the augmented Dickey Fuller tests point to a rejection of the null




    3 The asymptotic distribution is obtained by letting N-m, T-co, and N/T+oo and assuming that
the data are generated independently across i. They suggest taking out common time effects by
using time dummies or (equivalently) computing the test statistics using deviations from cross
section means to account for correlation across cross section units.

hypothesis that p = 1.0.’ The greater power derived from exploiting the panel aspect of the data

is apparent in the results of the @ Pesaranl and Shin tests, which yield standard normal statistics

around four both with and without common time dummies.s

        The results in Table 1 clearly indicate that deviations from Big Mac parity are transitory,

but the estimates of p are too imprecise to get a clear idea of rate of convergence.    In order to get

a better estimate of the dynamics of deviations from Big Mac parity I next pool the data and

estimate the regression,

        I.fordinary least squares is to yield valid inference, the errors in (2) must be uncorrelated

across currencies.   This is unlikely to be the case since some shocks are likely to affect all

exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.   As a result, the covariance matrix obtarned from

ordinary least squares will not be correct.   In order to remove these aggregate shocks and obtain

valid inference, I include time dummies common to each currency in the regression.        By using the

time dummies, I separate the innovations for each period into a common component and

orthogonal currency-specific components. The common component is estimated as the

coefficients on the dummy variables.    The resulting currency-specific forecast errors will have

mean zero and will mutually uncorrelated.     The model then becomes,




    4 In only one instance, Sparn, is the number of lags nonzero. Although the null of p= 1.0 is
rejected in this instance, the estimate is unreliable as the regression with two lags has only three
degrees of freedom The Dickey Fuller t-ratio for Spain with k set to zero is -1.752.

   5 When the number of lags is set to zero for Spain, the hq Pesaran, and Shin statistics are
about -3.5 and therefore still strongly reject the null hypothesis of a unit root.

        Another problem with ordinary least squares estimation of the pooled model is that there

may be persistent, currency- speciiic effects. Because Big Mac production and sale involves inputs

ofnontraded    goods and domestic labor, differences in, for example, per capita income may lead to

persistent deviations from Big Mac parity. In addition, trade barriers and diilerence in indirect

taxes will also lead to persistent deviations fi-om Big Mac parity.b This concern that persistent

currency-specific effects might be important is reinforced by wide range of intercepts reported in

Table 1 and the extensive variation in sample average deviations.

The standard tied-effects     estimator, which is the ordina~ least squares estimate of(4), is biased

downward in dynamic panels. Although the bias goes to zero as T+@, it can be substantial when

T is small.   Fortunately for the simple autoregressive model considered here,Nickell(1981            ) has

computed bias analytically for large N and the bias has a particularly simple form.




        An alternative is to take fus difllerences to remove the intercepts.         The model then

that high rates of value-added taxation in Sweden and Denmark raise the price of Big Mats and,
therefore, the Big Mac parity exchange rate for those two currencies.

Because the regressor is a lagged endogenous variable, first difFerencing induces correlation

between ~t-l and qt., and an instrumental variables estimator is required to obtain consistent

estimates.   In addition, as is clear from(5), the error is a iirst-order moving average. On the basis

of a wide range of Monte Carlo experiments, Kiviet (1995) argues that instrumental variables

estimators of first-differenced fixed-effects models have considerable dispersion.                  He concluses

that the finite sample properties of bias-corrected the least squares with dummy variables

estimator are superior to those of instrumental variables estimators.                 I therefore focus on the least

squares estimates of(2), (3), and (4).7

        The results of the pooled estimates are reported in Table 2.8 The simple pooled estimate

(with no time or currency dummies) suggests that convergence to Big Mac parity is quite slow.

Only about 10 percent of a deviation is eroded each year so that the half life of a deviation from

Big Mac parity is nearly seven years. The estimated rate of convergence slows when common

time dummies are added. The size of the ~erence              between these two pooled estimates of the

rate of convergence and the estimates of the country-specific autoregressive coefficients in Table




    7 As Kiviet’s Monte Carlo evidence would suggest, instrumental variables estimation of (5)
yields standard errors that are so large that no meaningful hypothesis can be rejected. The
problems with instrument variables estimates are almost certainly aggravated by the small N in
this sample.

    8 I report both ordinary least squares estimates (with a heteroskedasticity consistent standard
error) and weight least squares estimates based on the residual variances for each of the countries.
Because ~ = O in the augmented Dickey-Fuller tests, I make no correction for serial correlation.

                                                         7
2 raises serious questions.   These questions are resolved when the fixed effects model (rncluding

both time dummies and currency dummies) is estimated.        The estimated value of p drops

dramatically to 0.275.

        The diilierence between the simple pooled and tied     effects estimates of the autoregressive

parameter is illustrated in Figure 1 where I plot the current deviation from Big Mac Parity against

the lagged deviation for four currencies.   As is reflected in the regression results, pooling the

deviations across currencies without taking account of currency-specific means yields a much

higher estimate of the autoregressive   coefficient than is characteristic of any one of the

currencies.9

        This fixed effects estimate overstates the rate of convergence because of the downward

bias in the fixed effects estimate of p. For a sample size of 9 observations and a true value of p of

0.45, for large N, the least squares estimate of p tends toward 0.277. Thus the fied effects

estimates are consistent with an autoregressive coefficient around 0.45 and a half-life of

deviations from Big Mac parity of just under one year. This is considerably shorter than the 4 to

5 years found by Lothian ( 1994) and Frankel and Rose ( 1995) using aggregate price levels and by

and Wei and Parsley ( 1994) using sectoral prices.

        But these calculations are valid for large N and, in this sample, N is only 13. In order to

determine the magnitude of the bias for a sample with N= 13 and T=9, I perform Monte Carlo

experiments by generating 1000 replications of panels with a true value of p = 0.45 and with




    9 The figure also shows that the negative estimate p for Hong Kong is due to an outlier. This
outlier arises because of a somewhat anomalous price reported for Big Mats in the United States
in 1988. The effect of this price is common to the deviations for all currencies and is thus
removed by the common time dummies.

                                                     8
intercepts equal to the mean deviations from Big Mac parity reported in Table 1. The mean

estimate of p from these experiments is 0.274. This estimate of the bias in the fixed effects

estimator diftlers from its large-N value only in the third decimal place.

        One puzzle remains. The bias-adjusted fixed effects estimate of the autoregressive

parameter exceeds the estimates from the currency-specific autoregressions         reported in Table 1.

In fact, even the unadjusted fixed effects estimate exceeds the average from Table 1. The reason

for this difference is that the bias in the autoregressive parameter in a single autoregression is even

greater that it is for the fixed effects estimator.   Nickell ( 198 1) shows that for reasonably large T,

the bias of the fixed effects estimator is approximately -( l+p)/(T- 1) while the bias for the single
                                                                                             .
autoregression is approximately -( l+3p)/(T- 1).




III. The Adjustment of Exchange Rates and Relative Local Currency Prices

        The results discussed in section II suggest that deviations from Big Mac parity are

transitory and have a halfl&e of about one year once allowance is made for nonzero mean

deviations.   Therefore either exchange rates or relat~e local currency prices must be adjusting

toward Big Mac parity. This adjustment implies that current deviations from Big Mac parity

should be usefid for predicting exchange rate and/or relative local currency price changes over the

subsequent year. In this section we examine the value of current deviations from Big Mac parity

in forecasting these changes.

        The information content of deviations from Big Mac parity for forecasting fbture

exchange rate changes is examined with the regression:

If ~ # O, deviations from Big Mac parity provide usefhl information in forecasting exchange rates.

In addition to testing the hypothesis that the deviation from Big Mac parity provide no

information usefid in forecasting exchange rates (~ = O), it might also be interesting to test

whether a currency that is undervalued according to the Big Mac standard(EBMPL1.I< EL,.l) is

likely to appreciate between t- 1 and t ((3>0) or even whether the appreciation between t- 1 and t is

proportional to the deviation at t- 1 (~= 1).

        Table 3 presents the estimates of three versions of(6): the siile         pooled estimates (~i=b,
                                                                                                .
~,=o), tie estimates wkh time dummies only (~i=~), and the fixed effects estimates (with time and

currency dummies). 10 Once again, the importance in taking account of currency specific

intercepts is strikingly apparent.   When only time dummies are used, the estimates suggest that a

currency that is undervalued according to the hamburger standard is likely to appreciate slightly

but the point estimates are less than their standard errors. Including currency-specific intercepts

raises the slope estimate dramatically and the estimates are highly significant. According to this

estimate, a 10 percent undervaluation leads to a 5 percent appreciation in the subsequent year.

        Nthough    the regressor in (6) is not a lagged left-hand-side variable, it is predetermined


    10Chamberlain (1984) argues that aggregate shocks may lead to inconsistent estimates in a
models like (6) and (7), thereby providing another reason to include time dummies in (6) and (7).
In a time series context, ordinary least squares is assumed to lead to consistent estimates in (6) or
(7) because the deviation horn Big Mac parity at t- 1 is assumed to be in the t- 1 tiormation set of
agents. An assumption of rational expectations is generally used to assume that the error and any
variables in the information set have a sample covariance that converges to zero as the number of
observations in the time series gets large. The time t- 1 deviation is therefore uncorrelated with
the errors in (6) or (7). In a panel with relatively few time series observations, however, the least
squares estimates may be inconsistent.

                                                    10
rather than exogenous and a small-T bias in the fixed effects estimator remains a potential

problem     Unilortunately, the magnitude of the bias does not have a simple form and I must rely on

Monte Carlo evidence to determine the likely magnitude of the bias. I estimate a vector

autoregression    for exchange rate changes and deviations from Big Mac parity and use the

estimates to generate 1,000 panels with N= 13 and T=9, I then compute the fixed effects

estimator of the slope of a regression of exchange rate changes on lagged deviations from Big

Mac parity. In these Monte Carlo experiments the mean estimate of the slope is 0.53 and the

“true value” (computed from the VAR parameters) that is used in generating the data is .38. Thus

it appears that the fixed effects estimate of the slope of(6) is biased upward by approximately

0.15. Adjusting the e~imates from Table 3 by this estimate of the bias yields a bias-adjusted slope

of about O.35. After adjusting for the bias then, a 10 percent undervaluation in one year leads to a

3.5 percent appreciation in the subsequent year.

          Finally, I ask if current deviations from Big Mac parity are usefhl in forecasting changes in

relative Big Mac prices and estimate the regression,

If a currency appears to be overvalued according to the hamburger standard (Big Mac prices

measured in a common currency are high), the deviation maybe subsequently reduced by a

decline in the relative local currency prices of Big Mats.    Ifx<O, current deviations from Big Mac

parity are usefkl m predicting changes m relative local currency prices.

          Panel B of Table 3 presents the results for the three versions of (7). In all versions, a

deviation from Big Mac parity in one year tends to be reduced by changes in the relative local


                                                    11
currency prices over the following year. When both time and currency dummies are included, the

estimated slope rises sharply in absolute value. The fixed effects estimates suggest that a country

in which the currency is overvalued by 10 percent in a given year will tend to experience about a 2

percent decline in relative local currency prices over the following year. This finding that relative

local currency prices appear to adjust to reduce deviations from Big Mac parity is consistent with

the tidings   of Wei and Parsley ( 1995) who look at industry level prices.

        Once again, a small-T bias of the slope is a potential problem that I address with a Monte

Carlo experiment similar to the one described above. In this instance, the bias is considerably

smaller (about -0.06) so that adjusting the fixed effects estimate of-0.24 by this estimate of the
                                                                                           .
bias yields an adjusted slope of -0.18. In this instance, the bias adjustment does not change the

conclusions from the estimates in an important way.




        lV. Concluding Remarks

        In this paper I examine the dynamics of deviations from Big Mac parity. In addition to

asking if obsewed deviations from Big Mac parity are permanent or transitory, I examine the

adjustment toward parity. In particular I ask if observing an overvalued currency according to the

hamburger standard (a high U. S. dollar price of a Big Mac) allows one to forecast a subsequent

depreciation of the currency and/or a subsequent decline in the relative local currency price of Big

Mats.

        The evidence points to three main conclusions.    First, deviations from Big Mac parity are

temporary rather than permanent.     The half-tie of deviations from Big Mac parity appear to be

about 1 year, which is considerably shorter than estimates of the half-life of deviations from


                                                   12
purchasing power parity (4 -5 years) that are reported in the literature.   This estimated half tie

and the corresponding rate of convergence to Big Mac parity must be interpreted cautiously.           The

estimates are derived after allowing for non-zero currency-specific average deviations.     These

average deviations vary substantially across the countries in the sample and are frequently quite

large. The evidence thus suggests that there are significant deviations from absolute Big Mac

parity, but that once estimates of these constant deviations are removed from the data,

convergence to constant-adjusted     parity is quite rapid.

        Second, deviations from Big Mac parity appear to provide usefhl information for

forecasting exchange rates. Afler accounting for currency-specific constants, a 10 percent
                                                                                        .
undervaluation according the hamburger standard in one year is associated with a 3.5 percent

appreciation over the following year. Third, deviations from Big Mac parity do seem to be helpfi.d

in forecasting relatie   local currency prices. When the U.S. dollar price of Big Mats is high in a

country, the relative local currency price of Big Mats in that country is likely to fall during the

following year.

        It would be cowardly not to offer hamburger standard forecasts of next April’s exchange

rates. Based on the April 1996 deviations from Big Mac parity (afier adjusting for time and

currency effects) and the bias-adjusted slope ofO.35, the forecasts clearly point to a stronger

dollar. The largest predicted moves are appreciations of the dollar of 13 percent against the yen

and nearly 8 percent against the DM and the Belgian fhmc. The fhll set of forecasts is below.

But, as the Economist warned m the initial Big Mac survey, “caveat hamburger.”
