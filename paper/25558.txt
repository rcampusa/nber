                                         ABSTRACT

This paper provides a non-technical review of the literature and issues related to the measurement
of aggregate productivity. I begin with a discussion of productivity measures, their performance
in recent decades, and key measurement puzzles that emerge from the data. The remainder of the
review focuses on two important questions. First, how do we make more accurate the measures
of prices used to deflate nominal output so as to win (or at least not lose) the race for economic
measurement to keep up with a changing economy? This section frames the issues and points to
the most important and promising areas for further research. Second, what does or should GDP
measure? I defend GDP as a valuable measure of production and offer suggestions for improving
it. At the same time, I emphasize the importance of measuring economic welfare (well being)
and highlight the value of supplementing GDP with a satellite account that measures economic
welfare.

1. Introduction

Sluggish economic growth since the Financial Crisis and widespread criticism that GDP

is no longer an adequate measure of economic activity and welfare have re-focused

attention on measurement of GDP and productivity. Indeed, the Journal of Economic

Perspectives recently included a symposium titled “Are Measures of Economic Growth

Biased?” While the included articles presented a range of views, Martin Feldstein (2017)

argued that “official data understate the changes of real output and productivity … [and]

provide at best a lower bound on the true real growth rate with no indication of the size of

the underestimation.” (p. 145) Going further, Diane Coyle (2014) says, referring to GDP,

that “… it is a measure of the economy best suited to an earlier era.” (p. 125)

   These views represent a serious criticism of conventionally-measured GDP and, by

implication, measures of aggregate productivity that rely on components of GDP. Of

course, questions about the quality and accuracy of economic statistics are not new. Even

at the dawn of national income accounting in the 1930s, questions about how best to

measure economic activity and welfare were front and center as described by Coyle

(2014). And, in the decades since then, several official commissions in the United States

have evaluated the price statistics that are a key ingredient in calculating productivity

growth, including the Stigler Commission (1961), the Boskin Commission (United

States. Congress. Senate. Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index.,

1996), and the Schultze Commission (2002).

     Beyond these official reports, researchers in academia and government agencies also

have looked intensely at many of the same and related issues over the decades. There are

far too many papers to cite, but a comprehensive view of the challenges and progress can




                                                                                            1
be gleaned from the collection of conference volumes published over the years by the

Conference on Research in Income and Wealth and the National Bureau of Economic

Research. These volumes include such titles as Fifty Years of Economic Measurement

(Berndt and Triplett, 1990), New Developments in Productivity Analysis (Hulten et al.,

2001), Price Measurements and their Uses (Foss et al., 1993), Output Measurement in

the Service Sectors (Griliches, 1992), Measuring Capital in the New Economy (Corrado

et al., 2005), and Price Index Concepts and Measurement (Diewert et al., 2010). Hulten

(2015) provides a brief review of these volumes. As for the specific improvements made

by statistical agencies Groshen et al. (2017) and Moulton (2018) provide excellent

summaries.

   A reader with just a little knowledge of economic measurement looking back at this

literature would find much that is familiar—even in papers that are 50 or more years

old—with discussions of quality change, accounting for new goods, pricing of services,

the proper design and scope of price indexes, choice of formula for combining prices, the

best approach and frequency for collecting data, and a host of other issues that remain

salient today. This persistence of issues over the decades highlights the difficulty of the

challenges – it is relatively straightforward to describe the issues but solving them

continues to be a daunting task.

   As hinted at above, the literature relating to productivity measurement is vast. To

limit the scope, this paper provides a non-technical review of issues related to measuring

aggregate productivity and skips over industry- and firm-level productivity. Accordingly,

the focus is on value-added measures of output rather than gross output as might be used

in assessing disaggregated measures. Two broad and important questions facing the




                                                                                              2
measurement community are emphasized in this review: First, how should we get

accurate price measures to deflate nominal output and capital that adequately capture

changes in the quality and variety of goods and services in an ever-changing economy?

Second, what should GDP measure and how should we measure economic welfare? An

important theme that runs through both of these questions is the importance of

developing better measures of the knowledge economy. Without a doubt, this focus

omits important topics such as measuring labor input, the role of changes in labor quality,

and productivity at the industry or firm level.1

    To set the stage, Section 2 briefly describes aggregate measures of productivity and

their performance in recent decades, highlighting key measurement puzzles raised in

different time periods. This section also reviews recent work investigating whether

mismeasurement can explain the slowdowns in U.S. productivity growth in 2004 and

2010. In short, the story is that, although understatement of growth (especially for high-

tech and knowledge-related products) likely is substantial, this mismeasurement cannot

explain the productivity slowdowns. Nonetheless, mismeasurement does affect the

allocation of multifactor productivity growth (MFP) across sectors, and the evidence

indicates that the pace of MFP growth and innovation has been more rapid in the high-

tech sector (and less rapid elsewhere) than would be inferred from official statistics. This

result deepens the puzzle of the recent productivity slowdowns.

    Section 3 focuses on the question of obtaining good price measures. While statistical

agencies and academic researchers have made considerable progress in recent decades,

 Many of these other topics are covered concisely in the OECD Manual Measuring Productivity by
Schreyer (2001).


                                                                                                 3
the issues are difficult (and fascinating) and continued progress must be made in order to

keep up in the race to maintain the quality of economic data.

   Section 4 turns to the questions of what GDP measures and how to measure economic

welfare. This section defends GDP (as a measure of production) against some recent

criticism and highlights areas where the GDP accounts could be improved as a measure

of production: more comprehensive inclusion of intangible capital, more regular updates

of satellite accounts that cover household activities, and fuller capture of new

developments related to the digital economy. This section also reviews different

approaches to measuring economic welfare that have been proposed in the literature, and

highlights the value of a supplemental measure of economic welfare or well being.

   Section 5 concludes with directions for future work. Two areas are highlighted.

First, the need for continued progress on measuring quality change so that the race to

keep up with a changing economy can be won (or at least not lost). Second, the potential

benefit of the measurement community forging a consensus on how best to develop a

satellite account for economic welfare.



2. Productivity Measures, their Performance, and Mismeasurement

Measures of Productivity

In principle, measuring productivity is easy. For labor productivity, divide a measure of

real output by a measure of labor input. For MFP, divide real output by an appropriately

weighted average of all inputs. In practice, obtaining accurate measures is a daunting

challenge. To highlight the key measurement issues, I start with a review of different

measures of productivity.




                                                                                            4
      Labor productivity (LP) is the ratio of real output (Y) to hours (H) or sometimes the

number of workers when data on hours are not available. Using hours, labor productivity

is:

                                         LPt = Yt / H t                                    (1)

Real output, of course, is defined as the ratio of nominal output (YN) to the price deflator

(P):

                                         Yt = YN t / Pt                                    (2)

This review focuses mostly on obtaining accurate measures of the denominator in

Equation 2 and what should be included in the numerator.

      Before moving on, a few brief comments about the nominal output measure used in

official measures of labor productivity. Productivity calculations often use business or

nonfarm business output rather than GDP. Relative to GDP, these measures exclude the

output of general government and households and institutions. The logic of using

business sector output is that the economic forces driving the productivity of non-

business sectors are quite different from those driving the productivity of the business

sector and likely would generate quite different productivity trends. That being said,

when considering changes in living standards over time, real GDP per person often is the

preferred productivity measure because it indicates, on average, the resources available to

each person.

      In official measures, output is based on product-side GDP (the sum of final

expenditures), though some researchers—for example, see Fernald (2015)—prefer to use

an output measure that is the average of product-side and income-side GDP. The logic of

using an average is that both product- and income-side measures of aggregate output



                                                                                              5
convey useful information about economic activity and their average, arguably, better

captures all available information.

    Conventional MFP is defined as the ratio of real output to an income share weighted

average of capital (K) and labor inputs. Typically, MFP is defined and calculated in

growth rate terms (where dots over variables indicate growth rates):

                                  ! = Y! − a K! − (1− a ) H! − LQ
                                 MFP                           !                                      (3)
                                            t t        t    t    t


where a is the income share of capital (typically calculated as the average of the current

and prior year’s (or quarter’s) capital income shares), K is capital services, and LQ is the

contribution of labor quality.2

    Capital services (as distinct from the capital stock) captures the service flow from

capital and is a share-weighted average of capital stocks for individual types of capital

using marginal products of each type of capital as weights (measured as income shares).

The underlying idea of the weighting is that one dollar of computer capital generates a

larger service flow in a year than does one dollar of office building capital because the

service-life of the computer is so much shorter than that of an office building. Capital

services typically is calculated as a Törnqvist aggregate, using the average of the current

and prior year’s income shares for each type of capital. In many analyses, capital

services is disaggregated into key components, including information technology capital,

intellectual property capital (intangibles), other equipment, structures, and other capital.

    The labor quality term aggregates the service flow from different types of labor, using

wages as weights. This term picks up the productivity contribution of shifts in the

 The shift to growth rates in Equation 3 from levels in the Equations 1 and 2 follows from Jorgenson and
Griliches (1967). They also emphasize the importance of measuring capital services.


                                                                                                           6
education, experience (age), and gender mix of the workforce. It is based on the

difference between the growth rate of a wage-weighted aggregate of hours (dividing the

workforce into education, age, and gender cells) and the growth rate of unweighted total

hours.

   At the industry level, MFP growth can be calculated using Equation 3, with industry

value added as the numerator. More typically, though, industry-level MFP is calculated

using a KLEMS variant that includes a wider set of inputs. For output, the KLEMS

variant uses gross output rather than value added in the numerator in order to include

inputs beyond the primary inputs of capital and labor. For inputs, it uses capital (K),

labor (H), energy (E), materials (M), and services (S). KLEMS calculations also typically

include a term for labor quality (LQ). The widespread use of this variant is summarized

by Jorgenson (2017) and the articles included in that special issue of the International

Productivity Monitor. Over the years, Jorgenson has undertaken an extraordinarily

successful effort to persuade statistical agencies and academics in many countries to

calculate KLEMS measures.

   Aggregate MFP often is taken—at least by macroeconomists—as a rough gauge of

the pace of technological progress averaging across the entire economy. However, the

MFP expression in Equation 3 must be interpreted cautiously as a host of other factors—

such as varying utilization, non-constant returns to scale, and adjustment costs—can

affect it. Elaborations on Equation 3 that account for these factors have been developed

in an effort to extract a pure measure of technological progress as described in Basu,

Fernald, and Kimball (2006). That being said, many estimates of aggregate MFP—

including official estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)—rely on Equation




                                                                                           7
3 rather than the more complicated formulations, and the numbers presented below also

rely on Equation 3.

   The measurement of each variable in these productivity definitions has been the

subject of extensive research. As noted, this review focuses on getting reliable measures

of prices and determining the proper scope of nominal output (what should be included in

GDP) in Equation 2. Researchers have investigated several other important topics not

covered in this review, including labor quality and the measurement of hours. (For

example, are employees with devices enabling greater connectivity working more

unrecorded hours?) Bosler et al. (2016) assess labor quality, and Eldridge and Pabilonia

(2007) discuss questions around unmeasured hours. On another topic not covered here,

Syverson (2011) reviews the literature on productivity at the firm level.



Productivity Performance in the United States

Historically, the U.S. economy has experienced alternating periods of faster and slower

productivity growth, and these developments have affected the questions asked by

measurement researchers. Figure 1 shows average growth rates of labor productivity and

MFP over selected periods, relying on the decomposition:

                         ! = Y! − H! = a ( K! − H! ) + LQ
                         LP                            ! + MFP
                                                            !                           (4)
                               t    t   t    t    t      t    t



where the term with K! − H! is capital deepening. Following this decomposition, Figure 1

shows contributions to labor productivity growth from MFP, changes in labor quality,

and capital deepening. As shown, productivity growth was quite strong in the decades

after the Second World War, exceeding an average annual rate of 3 percent. Then, the

pace of productivity growth stepped down dramatically in the early 1970s to a pace of



                                                                                           8
only about 1½ percent. This slowdown generated a great deal of attention and many

papers attempting to explain it are summarized in a Journal of Economic Perspectives

symposium [Fischer (1988)].

   Mismeasurement of output was one of the hypotheses put forward. One idea

emphasized at the time was that the development of new technologies (computers) and

other changes in the economy were making output more difficult to measure and,

accordingly, that official measures of GDP were understating economic growth. Solow

(1987) captures the puzzlement related to computers with his famous quip “You can see

the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” And, Griliches (1994)

highlighted the increasing share of hard-to-measure sectors of the economy—including

many types of services—as a possible contributor to the slowdown, though Sichel (1997)




                                                                                                          9
showed that the effect on productivity growth of a larger hard-to-measure sector was

quantitatively small around the time of the 1970s productivity slowdown. More

generally, gradual shifts in the structure of the economy—such as the rising share of

services over many decades—are unlikely to be good explanations of sudden shifts in

productivity growth.

    Ultimately, economists never satisfactorily explained the 1970s slowdown and

moved on to other questions as the mid-1990s resurgence in productivity growth took

hold, with productivity growth averaging over 3 percent from 1995 to 2004. Yet,

measurement questions remained in the fore, with the reports mentioned above from the

Boskin and Schultze Commissions in 1996 and 2002, respectively.

   Productivity growth took a big step down around 2004 and another around 2010,

averaging barely over ½ percent per year from 2010 to 2017. Fernald (2015) was the first

to decisively document the slowdown around 2004 (with earlier versions of his paper

circulating well before it was published). As is evident from Figure 1, that slowdown

reflected, in large part, a dropback in MFP growth. The further collapse in productivity

growth around 2010 was associated with a cessation of capital deepening that reflected

very weak business investment. With these developments—along with the seemingly

rapid change arising from the digital revolution—researchers again focused on the degree

to which measures of productivity and GDP are understating growth rates.



How Much Is Real GDP Growth Understated?

Researchers largely agree that mismeasurement of productivity and GDP growth is

substantial, based mainly on concerns about price deflators—especially for products




                                                                                         10
associated with the digital revolution and health care—and on the increasing prevalence

of free goods (such as Facebook and Google’s search and mapping tools) that are not

counted as final output in GDP calculations.3 The specifics of these issues are discussed

in the next two sections. Here, I focus on selected estimates of the overall magnitude of

mismeasurement and how this affects our interpretation of the productivity slowdowns

after 2004.

      Table 1 reports selected estimates of bias in growth rates of real GDP, based on the

current definition of what is included in GDP.4 As shown in the first column of numbers

in Table 1, Moulton (2018)—the most detailed and comprehensive recent analysis—

estimates that bias in the growth rate of real nonfarm business output amounted to 0.65

percentage point in 2017. (If the components of GDP outside of nonfarm business output

current bias is similar to Moulton’s, reporting that real GDP growth currently is

understated by ⅔ to ¾ percentage point a year.

  Another interesting estimate of bias, which is not reported in Table 1 because it is not

directly comparable, is from Aghion et al. (2017). Their paper examines what happens

when a product disappears and is replaced by a new product produced by a different firm.

Statistical agencies often use the price change of related, surviving products to link the

prices of the old and new products. (This methodology is called imputation.) As it turns

out, however, the imputed price based on these related products often is higher than what

the price would have been for the product that disappeared from the market if its price

had still been observable and so the link from the old to the new product is made with a

price that mischaracterizes the price difference. The authors estimate that this bias led

growth of nonfarm business productivity to be understated by roughly ⅔ percentage point

a year in 2008.

  As noted, the estimates in Table 1 do not account for any mismeasurement of free

goods, including the cornucopia of information available on the Internet via search

engines, social media, and free apps. More pointedly, if a good is free and its use is not

mediated by a market transaction, then any value created by that good beyond the cost of

its production will not be counted in GDP. To be clear, the cost of producing these

products is already included in GDP. Consider Google Search. Google makes this

product available to users for free and funds its provision through advertising. Further,

the payments that, say, an auto company, makes to Google to advertise its cars, are




                                                                                             12
considered an intermediate input for the automaker and their cost is reflected in the value

of cars sold. Thus, in terms of the final expenditure measure of GDP, the cost of this

advertising is captured as part of household or business purchases of automobiles just as

would be the case for, say, print advertising. And, in terms of the income measure of

GDP, the cost of this advertising is captured in wages paid by Google or in the

company’s profits. However, if the free good, Google Search, provides additional value

to consumers, that extra value is not captured in GDP.

    But, what about this seemingly substantial value and economic welfare that is created

by these goods beyond their production cost? Although calculating this value is difficult,

researchers have developed a number of techniques to obtain estimates.

   Nakamura, Samuels, and Soloveichik (2017) focus on the resource cost of producing

free (advertising-supported) digital media and adjust the national accounts to include this

value as final output consumed by households and businesses. This adjustment boosts

real GDP growth by about 0.1 percentage point over 2005-2015. Another approach

estimates demand curves for free goods and the attendant consumer surplus and gets

significantly larger figures than did Nakamura, Samuels, and Soloveichik. For example,

Brynjolfsson and Oh (2012) estimate that the incremental consumer surplus from free

services obtained on the Internet averaged more than $100 billion per year in the United

States from 2007 to 2011. Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) also use data on time spent on

the Internet to estimate a demand curve, and they estimate that the Internet generated

significant amounts of consumer surplus. Brynjolfsson, Eggers, and Gannamaneni

(2018) use massive online choice experiments to gauge consumers’ willingness to pay for

these products. Their estimates are substantial (median valuations add up to tens of




                                                                                         13
thousands of dollars per person in 2017), with the largest valuations for search engines,

email, and digital maps. And, Diewert and Fox (2017) provide an analytic framework for

incorporating zero-price products into the national accounts.

  The profession has not yet developed a consensus on the best way to measure the

value of these products or on how much of that value belongs in a production-based

measure of GDP. One view is that much of the extra value is consumer surplus that does

not belong in a production-based measure of GDP. Another view is that consumers’

willingness-to-pay for this extra value should be included in GDP. In any case, most

would agree that the extra value or consumer surplus created by these goods belongs in a

measure of economic welfare. (More on that in section 4 below.) These issues are an

important topic for the measurement community.



Can Mismeasurement Explain the Productivity Slowdowns After 2004?

The bulk of the evidence indicates that mismeasurement is not a good explanation for the

slowdowns in productivity and real GDP growth after 2004. To sharpen focus on the

relevant question, consider this simple example. Suppose real GDP growth were

understated by 1 percentage point before 2004 and by 1 percentage point after 2004 as

well. Then, that mismeasurement cannot explain an observed decline in real GDP growth

around 2004 because any drop in growth rates must be reflecting the drop in actual GDP

because the amount of mismeasurement did not change. To explain a slowdown in

observed real GDP growth, the magnitude of mismeasurement must have increased

around the time of the slowdown. Accordingly, the key question for the mismeasurement

hypothesis is whether the amount of understatement of growth has increased.




                                                                                        14
     As reported in the second column of Table 1, Moulton concludes just the opposite—

that the amount of mismeasurement has fallen in recent decades. This decline reflects

improvements in measurement methodology implemented by the statistical agencies as

well as a shrinking GDP share of some badly measured sectors such as information

technology (where a larger fraction of domestic demand is imported than in the past). In

contrast, Goldman Sachs (2018) estimates that amount of mismeasurement has risen.

However, Goldman Sachs' estimate of the amount of mismeasurement a couple of

decades ago is at variance with Moulton’s estimate as well as most other estimates,

including that from the Boskin Commission report.

     Other evidence supports the view that mismeasurement cannot explain the

productivity slowdowns after 2004. Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016a) focus on

information technology products. They present alternative price indexes for high-tech

products that fall more rapidly than official price measures, implying an understatement

of productivity and real GDP growth. Yet, they find that the contribution of this price

mismeasurement to the understatement of growth was even larger in the past (similar to

Moulton’s conclusion). Using a completely different approach, Syverson (2017) also

makes the case that mismeasurement cannot explain the productivity slowdown after

2004. He calculates the amount of output that must have been missing each year if the

productivity slowdown were entirely attributable to mismeasurement. He then shows that

none of the mismeasurement hypotheses put forward can plausibly explain that amount of

missing output. For the United Kingdom, Oulton (2013) shows that mismeasurement

does not provide an explanation for the U.K. productivity slowdown.




                                                                                          15
   But, what about free goods? Could a surge in the value of and consumer surplus

associated with free goods imply that increases in economic welfare have not slowed

down as much as implied by the dropback in the growth of productivity or GDP per

person? Here too, the evidence suggests that the explosion of free goods is not sufficient

to explain away the puzzle of the productivity slowdowns after 2004. Syverson (2017)

makes the case that even the largest estimates of consumer surplus arising from these

goods are too small to offset the magnitude of the productivity slowdown. And, it stands

to reason that past innovations—such as the telegraph, radio, and television—likely also

generated significant amounts of consumer surplus. Thus, until researchers reach back to

obtain historical estimates for earlier innovations, we should not jump to the conclusion

that consumer surplus is growing more rapidly now than in the past. As for the

Nakamura, Samuels, and Soloveichik (2017) approach to valuing free digital media, they

find that free digital media has increased while other free media (such as print) has

declined. Accordingly, they estimate that the amount of bias from this source has not

increased very much.



But, Biases Imply Faster Innovation in Tech and a Deeper Puzzle

As described above, the consensus of the literature is that mismeasurement, although

substantial, is not a good explanation of the slowdown in productivity growth.

Nonetheless, mismeasurement does have important implications for how we should think

about sectoral MFP growth, and accounting for this mismeasurement deepens the puzzle

of the productivity slowdowns after 2004.




                                                                                        16
Here’s the story. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017b) and others have shown that the

mismeasurement of prices of high tech-products has a much smaller effect on aggregate

MFP growth than on labor productivity growth. Equation 3 above illustrates why.

Mismeasurement of high-tech prices implies that output growth is understated, but it also

implies that capital services growth (which is subtracted output growth to calculate MFP

growth) is understated. As it turns out, for high-tech price mismeasurement, these two

effects are pretty close in magnitude so the understatement in aggregate MFP growth is

smaller than that in labor productivity growth. However, as Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel

show, the mismeasurement of the prices of high-tech goods—with actual prices falling

faster than captured in official measures—implies a different pattern of MFP growth

across sectors.5 In particular, the dual approach to productivity analysis indicates that

faster relative price declines for high-tech products reflects a faster pace of MFP growth

in that sector, as shown in figure 2.6 The key result is plotted in figure 2. The red bars

show MFP growth in the tech sector using the new, or alternative prices. These growth

rates are well above those for MFP growth base on official prices (blue bars). Moreover,

their analysis indicates that MFP growth outside the tech sector is much slower using the

alternative prices than with the official prices. This result follows given that aggregate

MFP growth is little affected by the mismeasurement so faster MFP growth in tech

necessarily implies slower MFP growth elsewhere.

  Oulton (2016) highlights the likely mismeasurement of MFP in business services and finance and its
implications for the pattern of MFP growth across sectors.
6
  The dual approach to production analysis relates the growth rate of prices for a product to a weighted
average of its input costs minus MFP growth. The logic is that if prices are falling for a product, either
input costs must be falling or MFP must be rising. Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) provide one of the
clearest explanations of the dual approach.

   To the extent that MFP trends provide information about the underlying pace of

innovation, this result implies faster innovation in the tech sector but slower

innovation elsewhere. This finding for the tech-sector innovation runs counter to recent

narratives about its disappointing performance, such as in Gordon (2017) and raises a

further puzzle: Even with notably faster growth in innovation in the tech sector since

substantially.


3. The Price Isn’t Right: Measuring Quality Change

    This review focuses on the quality change issue for two reasons. First, it is,

quantitatively, one of the most important sources of bias in growth rates of real GDP.

According to Moulton (2018) mismeasurement of prices coming from quality change and

the introduction of new goods amounts for more than 70 percent of the overall bias in

consumer price inflation. Second, I would argue that capturing quality change is the most

challenging measurement issue to fix and, at the same time, one on which significant

progress can be made.

    In this section, I review key issues in price measurement, especially regarding quality

change, and highlight important progress that has been and is being made by U.S.

statistical agencies.



What are the issues?

In principle, constructing the rate of change in a price index is simple. Just collect prices

of every good and service in the relevant bundle and weight them appropriately to

construct an index. Then, calculate the change over time in the index. However, in

practice, problems emerge at nearly every turn, both in getting weights right and in

making “like-to-like” product comparisons so that measures of price change over time are

meaningful.

    Many of these problems were well documented in the report of the Boskin

Commission (1996)—and other reports and reviews—which often have focused on the



                                                                                           19
Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Boskin report identified four sources of bias in the

CPI—substitution, outlet substitution, quality change, and new goods.

    Before discussing these specific biases in more detail, I want to emphasize that

statistical agencies in the United States and other countries have made significant

progress in improving economic statistics in recent decades. For reviews of this progress,

see Moulton (2018), the symposium on the Boskin Commission in the International

Productivity Monitor as summarized in Sharpe (2006), and Gordon (2006). Despite

significant progress, many of the issues highlighted by the Boskin Commission remain

important challenges, especially for knowledge-related products.

    Substitution bias occurs in a fixed-weight price index, such as the CPI, when

consumers adjust their purchases in response to price changes but the weights used to

aggregate prices are fixed. Lower-level substitution bias arises from the aggregation of

prices within an expenditure category. The BLS largely eliminated lower-level bias in

1999 through the adoption of a geometric means formula for prices within an expenditure

category. Upper-level substitution bias occurs because the CPI uses fixed-weights for

aggregating expenditure categories. This source of bias remains in the CPI; however, the

price index for Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) produced by the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA) allows these weights to change over time and therefore

eliminates this source of bias. As for the CPI, in 2002 the BLS began producing an

experimental superlative index that also eliminates upper-level substitution bias. Because

the statistical agencies largely have eliminated this source of bias, I do not consider

substitution bias further.




                                                                                          20
   The other sources of bias are more closely related to the need for like-to-like price

comparisons. Outlet substitution bias arises when consumers shift purchases toward

lower priced outlets (say to Walmart rather than a local store or to Amazon rather than

Walmart); the CPI considers items purchased from these different outlets as different

products so any drop in the price paid by consumers is missed. However, if the products

really are the same—that is, just purchased through a lower-price channel—then a

relevant price decline is being omitted from CPI calculations. Moulton (2018) suggests

that this source of bias is relatively small, though continuing shifts to online purchases

could make it more salient. A related type of bias (known as offshoring bias) occurs

when a buyer shifts its purchase from a domestic producer to a foreign producer, as

discussed by Houseman et al. (2011). The BLS would consider the domestic and foreign

items as different products; therefore, any price decline would be omitted from official

price indexes.

   Quality change bias occurs when the CPI is not able to capture the change in a

product’s quality and so is not comparing like-to-like prices. If an item’s quality

improves (or diminishes), then part of any price change reflects that improvement (or

reduction) in quality and that portion of price change should be removed to obtain a like-

to-like price comparison. For example, if an iPhone 6s was $549 and an iPhone 7 was

$649, an adjustment for improved quality must be made because the two products are not

directly comparable. With this adjustment, a quality-adjusted or constant-quality price

index can be constructed so that the prices compared across time periods are for

comparable amounts of “quality.” Significant efforts have been made to control for




                                                                                             21
quality change, but the problem is difficult to solve, and in a dynamic economy with

frequently changing products new challenges will continue to emerge.7

    Bias from the introduction of new goods is closely related to that from quality

change.8 New goods bias occurs when an item is different enough from prior items to be

called a new product rather than a change in quality. One way to think about this

difference is that a new good includes new characteristics rather than just more of

previously-present characteristics. So, a faster laptop is an example of quality change,

but the first smartphone is a new product. New goods raise two issues for price

measurement. First, it may take some time for a new product to be included in the

official price indexes and so a price index may miss price changes early in a product’s

life cycle. (Famously, cell phones were not included until 1998). Second, a new good

may provide significant value that far exceeds its introduction price. In principle, this

value can be incorporated by estimating a reservation price for what consumers would

have been willing to pay for the product in the period before its introduction as in

Hausman (1996) and then including in the price index the change from that reservation

price to the product’s price at introduction. But, the use of these calculations and the

magnitudes generated are controversial. Indeed, while the Boskin Report (and many

other economists) argued that declines from the reservation price should be incorporated

in the CPI, this view is not universal. The Schultze Commission (2002) report argued

that declines from reservation prices should not be included. In any case, given the


7
  As discussed by Moulton (2018), the BLS may also miss quality change because the agency makes
quality adjustments only when a product disappears from the market and must be replaced by a new
product. The BLS does not make quality adjustments at the time of routine sample rotation. As Moulton
highlights, when smartphones became available, basic cellphones did not disappear so no quality
adjustment between smartphones and basic cell phones would have been made.
8
  Recent evidence on new goods bias is provided in Goolsbee and Klenow (2018). They also highlight
possibilities for using big data from online retailers to measure consumer prices.


                                                                                                    22
difficulties of obtaining estimates that would be seen as a consensus of the profession, I

judge this issue largely to be moot in that there is little prospect of an adjustment for new

goods to be introduced into the CPI anytime soon.

   These challenges also apply to price indexes for components of GDP beyond

consumption. While deflators for business investment (especially high-tech products)

have received attention from researchers, price indexes for exports and imports as well as

government purchases generally have been more neglected. Moulton (2018) estimates

that biases affecting business investment are sizable, while those affecting other

components of nonfarm business output are modest. He may be right, though with more

research, I would not be surprised if additional concerns about these other indexes

emerge.



Controlling for Quality Change

Economists have struggled with the issue of quality at least since Smith (1963) [1776],

who said about prices of cloth in the Wealth of Nations that “Quality, however, is so very

disputable a matter that I look upon all information of this kind as somewhat uncertain.”

(p. 195) Notwithstanding Smith’s caution, statistical agencies must confront the issue.

The work-horse method to control for quality change is the matched-model methodology.

To see how this procedure works, consider tracking the price of a single product, say a

personal computer (PC). The price of a particular PC model would be tracked over time

for as long as that model was observed in the market. Because the characteristics of that

PC were not changing, each price change recorded would reflect a like-to-like

comparison. Then, when that model disappeared from the market, the price of a new




                                                                                           23
replacement model—typically of higher quality—would be tracked over time. For

matched-model indexes to control correctly for quality change, the difference between

the price of the exiting and entering model must reflect only the difference in quality. Put

another way, the market for quality must be in equilibrium so that the price-performance

ratio of the exiting and entering models are the same. For example, the availability of a

new, higher-quality model at a price similar to what the old model had been selling for

must sufficiently drive down the price of the old model.

    Of course, in practice, this procedure can break down because price-performance

ratios of exiting and entering products may differ for a host of reasons such as, for

example, the price of the old model exits the market before its price has dropped enough

to equilibrate price-performance ratios. If so, the implicit assumption that the price

difference between the exiting and entering models reflects a quality difference is not

valid; in this case, a matched-model price index would inadequately adjust for quality and

therefore would be biased. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2018) demonstrate how this

assumption broke down for microprocessors in the mid-2000s and led to significant

biases in official estimates.



Hedonics

Hedonic techniques provide a solution to this problem by explicitly controlling for

quality change. Drawing directly from Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2018) consider a

simple dummy-variable hedonic specification:

                            ln(Pit ) = a + ∑ bk X k ,i,t + ∑ dt Di,t + ei,t               (5)
                                            k               t




                                                                                          24
where Pi,t is the price of model i in period t, Xk,i,t is the value of characteristic or

performance metric k for model i in period t (measured in logs or levels, as appropriate),

Di,t is a time fixed effect that equals 1 if model i is observed in period t and zero

otherwise, and ei,t is an error term. In this equation, the X variables directly control for

quality change, and the coefficients on the time fixed effect estimate quality-adjusted

price changes.

    A potential shortcoming of Equation 1, highlighted by Pakes (2003) and Erickson and

Pakes (2011), is that the coefficients on the characteristic or performance variables are

constrained to remain constant over the full sample period. One response to that concern,

as described by Aizcorbe (2014) and Triplett (2006) is to run a cross-section regression

for every time period and then to use predicted values from those regressions to build up

a price index. Such an approach is appealing because it provides maximum flexibility for

estimated coefficients to change over time and allows the results to be used in any price

index formula. For further background on hedonic price indexes, see the Handbook on

Hedonic Indexes prepared for the OECD by Jack Triplett (2006).

    Court (1939), Griliches (1961) , and Chow (1967) were among the first to empirically

implement hedonic methods, applying these techniques to automobiles (Court and

Griliches) and mainframe computers (Chow). These efforts picked up steam with the

further application of hedonic methods to computers in the 1970s and 1980s. These

efforts ultimately led the BEA to introduce a hedonic index for computers into the

national income and product accounts in 1985. For reviews of early research on hedonic

indexes for computers see Gordon (1987) and Triplett (1989). For early work on PC




                                                                                               25
prices, see Berndt and Rappaport (2001) . For more recent work on PC prices, see Byrne,

Oliner, and Sichel (2016b) .

   Hedonic indexes have been developed for many other products as well, and, over the

past two decades the BLS introduced hedonic indexes or made other quality-related

improvements to price indexes for many products (especially electronics-related

products). Interestingly, as reported by Moulton (2018) , the hedonic adjustments outside

of computers had relatively little effect on price trends. This result is somewhat puzzling.

On the one hand, it certainly is possible that the old-style matched-model indexes were

correctly capturing quality change. On the other hand, it also seems possible that the

hedonic indexes, at least as implemented, still are not fully capturing quality change.

   The efforts to improve price measures of high-tech products quieted down for a time

after 2000 or so, but were revived in the 2010s, including work by various combinations

of Byrne, Corrado, Oliner, and Sichel, as well as many other authors. In particular,

Byrne and Corrado (2017) develop new price indexes for high-tech products and pull

together other work to provide an overview of bias for business investment in

information and communications technology products. Their price indexes are

significantly different from those in official measures and were the basis for the

alternative MFP calculations in Section 2 and for the Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf paper

on why mismeasurement cannot explain the productivity slowdown.

    Despite this progress, more needs to be done. Byrne (2015) highlights the need for

additional measurement attention to special-purpose equipment containing significant

electronics components, including medical equipment, military gear, aerospace

equipment, and a host of other products. Price indexes of these products generally have




                                                                                          26
moved higher in recent years—despite their significant electronics content—in contrast to

sharp price declines for computers and other high-tech products whose price and quality

changes have been extensively researched. This discrepancy raises the possibility of

significant bias in official measures of these prices.

    In addition, recent advances in robotics and artificial intelligence raise a new set of

challenges. On robotics, recent papers assessing its economic impact often rely on

simple counts of industrial robots, as in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017). The capability,

size, and mobility of robots surely have improved over time, yet, very little is known

about their prices, let alone prices on a quality-adjusted basis. For artificial intelligence,

the challenge of measuring prices and quantities is the latest incarnation of earlier

struggles to develop price indexes for software. Price indexes for software have been

developed for narrowly-defined products—such as prepackaged PC software—but it has

remained difficult to obtain reliable quality-adjusted indexes for larger, more

idiosyncratic software projects (including artificial intelligence). Brynjolfsson and

Kemerer (1996) , Gandal (1994) , and Oliner and Sichel (1994) provide early estimates of

prices for prepackaged PC software. Abel, Berndt, and White (2003) and Copeland

(2013) provide somewhat more recent estimates. Software has become an increasingly

large share of total information technology investment so making further progress here is

essential.

    More generally, the growing recognition of the role of intangible capital in advanced-

market economies as described in Haskel and Westlake (2017) highlights the need for

better price measures for intellectual property products such as for research and

development, organizational capital, and, as noted above, software.




                                                                                              27
Services

Hedonics also have been used for prices of services. Byrne, Corrado, and Sichel (2017a)

develop hedonic price indexes for cloud computing services available from Amazon Web

Services. Hedonics are readily applicable to this application because cloud providers rent

virtual machines to users, and these virtual machines are configured to have

characteristics much like those of PCs so the same types of characteristics used for PC

hedonics can be used for cloud computing services. Their paper finds double-digit price

declines for cloud services for computing, database, and storage in recent years.

    Developing hedonic price indexes is often more challenging for a variety of other

services than even for dynamic high-tech products. Defining the good to be priced can be

difficult. For example, the output of health care is the improvement in health outcomes

so that, in principle, it is simply necessary to measure the amount of that improvement

and the price of achieving it. Yet, even in cases where the improvement in health

outcomes and associated prices can be measured, how should the observed price change

be allocated between quality change and pure price change? What is the role of the

provider’s skill, the patient’s prior health status, the patient’s willingness or ability to

comply with recommended treatment, and a host of other difficult-to-measure factors?

Moreover, the nature of markets for health care—with third-party payments, asymmetric

information, changes in channels of provision, and other features—raises many additional

challenges about how much of a price change reflects quality change.

    Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made. For example, on health

care measurement, Berndt et al. (2001) and Aizcorbe et al. (2018) summarize key issues




                                                                                               28
and progress. One central idea is to price disease episodes (such as a heart attack) rather

than specific inputs into (such as an aspirin, a doctor’s visit, or a medical device) into

medical care. This idea allows changes in treatment—such as a shift from a surgical to a

pharmaceutical intervention—to be captured. And, the BEA has begun publication of a

satellite health care account that tracks spending for treatment of diseases (rather than

individual inputs). Dunn et al. (2015) provide an overview of these new accounts. (The

original idea for pricing disease episodes appeared in Scitovsky (1964)).

   Yet, this methodological advance does not solve the quality adjustment problem.

Dauda et al. (2018) provide a recent assessment of alternative approaches to measuring

quality change (and cites to earlier papers). They consider four alternative approaches to

quality change and show that, perhaps not surprisingly, quality change is a big deal.

Indeed, on their preferred estimates, the annual average growth rate of TFP for hospitals

and nursing homes from 2001 to 2014 is 2.9 percent, a far more credible figure than the -

0.3 percent figure reported in official statistics. However, the alternative approaches

deliver different answers and the profession has not yet reached a consensus on the best

approach.

   Other services—such as education and financial services—pose their own set of

unique measurement challenges, both in defining the service that is provided and in

developing an appropriate technique for quality adjustment. Just as in the case of health

care, the quality-adjustment techniques used for other products—such as electronics or

apparel—generally are not directly applicable. The measurement of education and

financial services are vast topics that I will not cover in any detail. For an overview of




                                                                                             29

financial services, see Diewert et al. (2016).



4. Production or Welfare: What does/should GDP Measure?

What does GDP measure? The short answer: Production. Although real GDP is highly

correlated with measures of welfare and components of GDP should be key ingredients

of any welfare calculation, real GDP is designed to be a measure of production: that is, a

measure of the quantity or volume of goods and services produced within a country in a

given period of time. Although many commentators have criticized GDP and suggested

that economic measurement should shift its emphasis from production to economic

welfare or well being (for example, Stiglitz et al. (2009)), measuring production remains

an important task for statistical agencies. It is a crucial metric for monetary and fiscal

policymakers to track, it is more highly correlated with employment than are many

proposed measures of welfare, and it is useful in times of national emergency to gauge an

economy’s productive capacity. (See Coyle (2014) for a discussion of the original

motivations for measuring production.)

   If real GDP measures production, what about measuring economic welfare? Later in

this section, I highlight the potential value of supplementing GDP with a satellite account

measure of economic welfare. But first, I focus on how the GDP accounts could be

improved as a tool for measuring production.




                                                                                             30
Where could Nominal GDP be improved as a measure of production?

GDP could be improved as a measure of production in three particularly important areas.

First, including a more complete set of intangible capital—known as intellectual property

products in the GDP accounts—as investment. Second, regularly updating and

expanding a satellite GDP account for to better account for the full range of non-market

household activity. Third, by sorting out the issues surrounding a host of new goods

arising from the digital economy.



Including a Fuller Set of Intangible Capital as Investment

Business investment occurs when a firm devotes resources to acquiring or building an

asset that is expected to generate a revenue stream in a future period. Traditionally,

statistical agencies included only investment in tangible capital—such as machines and

buildings—as business investment in GDP. Purchases of intangibles—such as software

as well as R&D—were considered intermediate inputs that were used up in the current

period and whose value would be incorporated into other products, on par with the

purchase of pencils and paper. Thus, intangible capital did not get counted as investment

in GDP.

   With the rise of information technology and the digital economy, intangible capital

has become increasingly important. Indeed, as documented in Corrado, Hulten, and

Sichel (2009) and Haskel and Westlake (2017), intangible capital is now more important

than tangible capital in many advanced-market economies. And, statistical agencies

have, over time, adjusted the asset boundary to include more types of intangible capital as

investment. In the United States, the BEA began counting software as business




                                                                                         31
investment in 1999 and began counting R&D and the creation of entertainment and

artistic originals as investment in 2013. However, the current asset boundary still

excludes several important types of intangible capital that were identified in the

framework developed by Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2004) and (2009). The excluded

categories include nonscientific product development, brand equity, training, and

organizational capital. Investment and capital stocks for these excluded assets are quite

substantial—as highlighted in Corrado et al. (2012) and the databases referenced in that

paper—and counting these assets as investment would significantly boost the level of

GDP. Moreover, because these assets often are associated with innovative activity and

the knowledge economy, including them would facilitate tracking and understanding

these dynamic contributors to economic growth and welfare.

   There is significant agreement in the measurement community that a fuller range of

intangibles should, in principle, be counted as investment. In practice, however, the

statistical agencies face both conceptual and data challenges. Indeed, the investment and

capital stock estimates in Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) for the types of intangible

capital currently outside the asset boundary for GDP—such as organizational capital—

were generated with some strong assumptions to overcome conceptual and data issues.

Moreover, getting deflators to translate nominal to real values for these intangibles is

particularly challenging. Accordingly, there is less of a consensus on how to measure

these types of capital than was the case for, say, R&D when it was brought inside GDP’s

asset boundary.




                                                                                           32
Household Activities

By design, GDP focuses on market-mediated activities. While this makes sense, it

excludes important economic activity that occurs within households. These activities

include, among other things, meal preparation, childcare, elder care, the service flow

from household durables, time spent shopping, and human capital accumulation.

Another type of household activity that has received attention recently is household

production of a particular intangible asset—household R&D; that is, the dedication of

household resources to create a product or idea that will generate a service flow to the

household (or other households) in the future. For example, as documented by von

Hippel (2017), a parent hacked a simple device for monitoring blood sugar levels of a

diabetic child to make readings trackable remotely via the Internet (and posted the hack

on the Internet for others to use).

   Household production has long been of interest to economists with mentions as early

as Gilman (1898). Estimates of human capital accumulation were pioneered by

Jorgenson and Fraumeni (1989). More recently, BEA and others have periodically

developed satellite accounts for household production and human capital, with recent

versions in Bridgman (2016) for household production and Fraumeni, Christian, and

Samuels (2017) for human capital formation. And, the BEA currently is exploring the

feasibility of updating these accounts on an annual basis. For household R&D, Sichel

and von Hippel (2018) present estimates—following the methodology used for business

investments in intangible assets—and make the case that it is large enough to be

consequential.




                                                                                           33
   Although it makes sense to measure these non-market household activities in satellite

accounts outside the scope of official GDP, tracking them is important for understanding

the full range of economic activity and sources of economic welfare. In particular,

regularly tracking these activities would help to elucidate the full welfare effect of

changes over time in the structure of the economy. For example, the dramatic increase in

women’s labor market participation in the United States was accompanied by a shift of

many activities from non-market to market-mediated, including, for example, childcare

and meal preparation. GDP as currently defined will be affected by these shifts from

non-market to market activity even if the overall amount of activity is not changing. A

full understanding of the effect of such shifts on economic welfare requires measures of

non-market household activity.



The Digital Economy

The ongoing evolution of the economy will always present new measurement challenges.

Three examples of that are mentioned here. First, as discussed above, the increasing

prevalence of free goods raises the question of how much of the value created by these

goods should be included in GDP. Second, tax shifting by multinational firms likely has

led to an undercount of value added located in the United States and, accordingly, has

been a source of bias in nominal GDP as discussed by Guvenen et al. (2017). Third,

high-tech firms—such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft—have been

assembling a significant quantity of investment goods from purchased electronic

components, that is, own-account investment just as when a business constructs a

building on its own account. Because these capital goods are not mediated through




                                                                                          34
market transactions, they likely are not fully counted as business investment in GDP, as

discussed in Byrne, Corrado, and Sichel (2017a). Fortunately, the BEA partially

accounted for this own-account investment in the latest comprehensive revision.



If GDP measures production, what about economic welfare?

Measuring economic welfare is vitally important. After all, providing economic welfare

or well-being is the ultimate objective of economic systems, and recent criticisms of GDP

highlight the demand for such measures. As noted, however, measuring production

remains a key objective of statistical agencies. Moreover, many measures of welfare rely

on components of GDP as key ingredients. Thus, a powerful argument can be made that

GDP should not be scrapped or replaced, but rather should be supplemented with a

measure of economic welfare. In this section, I first discuss how GDP relates to

economic welfare and then review alternative possible approaches to measuring

economic welfare that have been proposed in the literature.9



How does real GDP relate to economic welfare?

    In popular accounts, real GDP or real GDP per person, often is taken as a measure of

economic welfare. Understandably, that approach has generated considerable criticism.

However, a combination of GDP components is pretty closely related to many measures

of economic welfare. After all, it is consumption of goods and services—whether

purchased or produced by a household or provided by the government or other



9
 Even broader measures of well-being that incorporate factors such as environmental quality and climate
change can be constructed. Those considerations are beyond the scope of economic welfare measures
considered here.


                                                                                                      35
institutions—that generates utility. Dynan and Sheiner (2018) highlight that a broad

measure of consumption—they label it aggregate economic well-being—can be built up

from components of GDP—including personal consumption expenditures and some other

pieces of GDP—along with some measures of non-market activity. Dynan and Sheiner

also show that real consumption and real GDP have tracked pretty closely during the past

several decades, indicating that, even though GDP measures production, it appears to be

well correlated with, at least, the consumption piece of economic welfare. Oulton (2012)

makes an even stronger case that GDP is an important component of welfare and a useful

indicator of welfare.

   These connections highlight the importance of GDP and associated measures, for

measuring both production and economic welfare. They also reify why it is important to

supplement, rather than to replace, GDP. More generally, Jorgenson (2018) provides a

detailed evaluation of the relationship between measured GDP and economic welfare,

highlighting both linkages of the sort described by Dynan & Sheiner and Oulton as well

as how ingredients beyond GDP can be used to create other measures of economic

welfare.



Measuring Economic Welfare

   One approach for measuring economic welfare is to use a “dashboard” of economic

and social indicators. Examples include the Human Development Index published by the

United Nations Development Programme, a proposal from Coyle and Mitra-Kahn (2017),

and the OECD’s Better Life Initiative. Each of these measures is a weighted average of

various social and economic indicators. Although this approach has the virtue of




                                                                                       36
incorporating any indicators of interest beyond GDP—such as the distribution of income,

social and institutional capital, environmental quality, and life expectancy—they suffer

from two problems as highlighted in the essay I co-wrote with Carol Corrado, Kevin Fox,

Peter Goodridge, Jonathan Haskel, Cecelia Jona-Lasinio, and Stian Westlake [Corrado et

al. (2017)]. In particular, the weighting across components can seem arbitrary, and they

may double count some components. On double counting, the OECD Better Life index,

for example, includes measures of housing and also includes household income (which

itself would include measures of rent and an imputation for the income stream from

owner-occupied housing).

   Other approaches rely more on economic theory to construct measures of welfare and

explicitly avoid double counting. Nordhaus and Tobin (1972) proposed a measure of

economic welfare building on components of GDP. More recently, Jorgenson and

Slesnick (2014) use individual and social welfare functions to create a measure of welfare

that is based on per capita consumption and its distribution across the population, thereby

very neatly incorporating distributional factors into a welfare measure. Jones and

Klenow (2016) create a welfare measure using the standard economics of expected utility

to combine data on consumption, leisure, inequality, and mortality. Interestingly, while

they find that welfare and per capita GDP are highly correlated, there are differences,

with countries in Western Europe looking more similar to the United States on a welfare

basis than on a GDP per capita basis. Corrado et al. (2017) propose a measure of welfare

that (using the insight of Weitzman (1976) that net national product is a proxy for the

discounted value of future consumption) combines net product with measures of leisure

and security along the lines of Jones and Klenow. Corrado et al. also propose more




                                                                                           37
completely incorporating the value of “free” goods, relying on online experiments of the

type implemented by Brynjolfsson et al. (2018) and coauthors to assess consumers’

willingness to pay for free goods. Finally, Hulten and Nakamura (2017) propose an

approach to measuring consumer welfare that draws on Lancaster’s (1966) consumer

theory and accounts for how consumer utility is affected not only by how much we

consume but also by the technology that transforms goods and services into utility. And,

new digital products appear to be dramatically changing these consumption

technologies.10

     These latter approaches have considerable merit. They incorporate important

information beyond GDP into a measure of economic welfare in a way consistent with

generally accepted principles of economic measurement and welfare analysis. Moreover,

the pieces of these measures related to GDP (or its components) avoid the problems of

the dashboard approach because GDP is designed to avoid double counting and, rather

than use arbitrary weights, they use prices to aggregate different components. Prices are

very appealing weights given that they represent valuations based on interactions of many

buyers and sellers.

      I believe that a powerful case can be made for the measurement community to forge

a consensus about the best way to develop satellite accounts that provide a welfare

measure, considering proposals along the lines of Jorgenson & Slesnick (2014), Jones

and Klenow (2016), or Corrado et al. (2017). There is tremendous demand for such a

measure and if the measurement community does not come to together to take this on, the



10
  One other approach is to ask people how happy they are as described in Stevenson and Wolfers (2008).
This approach, however, is far removed from the topic of this essay.




                                                                                                    38
demand for welfare measures may create its own supply, perhaps leading to inferior

measures of welfare gaining traction among researchers and policymakers.



5. Conclusion

   This paper has selectively reviewed the literature on measuring aggregate

productivity growth. Through this review, I argue that productivity growth is understated

by a significant amount, especially for rapidly changing high-tech products, other

knowledge products (including intangible capital and free goods), and for hard-to-

measure services such as health care and education. However, biases in productivity

measures do not explain the slowdowns in productivity growth after 2004 and again after

2010 because, according to the best available evidence, there was considerable

mismeasurement of productivity growth in the past as well. Although not an explanation

for the productivity slowdown, mismeasurement—for which the evidence is particularly

strong for high-tech products—deepens the puzzle of the slowdown as the

mismeasurement implies that growth in innovation in the tech sector has been even faster

than would be inferred from official data and that growth of innovation elsewhere in the

economy has been even slower.

   Improving measures of productivity is difficult work. Indeed, the key issues were

documented decades ago. Much work has been done since then, and statistical agencies

in the United States and in other countries have made considerable progress in improving

economic statistics. That being said, the structure of the economy and the variety and

quality of products continues to rapidly change. As that happens, new measurement

challenges will emerge even as old ones are resolved.




                                                                                         39
    As for directions for research, reports of official commissions, even though dated,

still provide a useful roadmap of specific problems to be solved. In addition, Berndt

(2006), Moulton (2018), Diewert, Greenlees, and Hulten (2010), and many other papers

have provided sensible recommendations, and I will not reiterate those. Rather, I

emphasize here two broad areas where progress can be made. The first area is continuing

to develop the best adjustments for quality change. This cuts across almost all goods and

services in the economy and requires, in the words of Shapiro and Wilcox (1996),

“house-to-house combat”; that is, careful work for every product that undergoes

consequential quality change and for every new product. That is a big task. Nonetheless,

making progress is imperative to keep up in the race to ensure that the GDP accounts

retain a high degree of accuracy.

    The second area is in developing measures of economic welfare. Although real GDP

is very valuable as a measure of production, there is a growing recognition among the

public and policymakers that GDP does not measure welfare and, accordingly,

considerable demand for measures that do. As noted, I believe that the measurement

community should continue to build expertise on measures of welfare and to forge a

consensus about the best way to develop a satellite account that includes measures of

economic welfare.

    All of this work requires resources. At a time when government resources are likely

to be limited (at least in the United States), it is, perhaps, especially important for

academic and other researchers to contribute to this effort. Such contributions seem to be

increasingly occurring with a wider range of economists becoming interested in these

issues, as evidenced by the Brookings Institution’s recently launched Productivity




                                                                                          40
Measurement Initiative as well as ongoing efforts by the Conference Board and a host of

other organizations. These are welcome developments that have the potential to

significantly improve measures of productivity and welfare.
