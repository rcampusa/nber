       Researchers, commentators, and politicians have devoted steadily mote attention to

infrastructure in response to claims that inadequate accumulation of public capital has contributed

to substandard U.S. economic growth. Despite this, the link between infrastructure and

productivity growth remains controversial. In this regard, it is somewhat surprising that

infrastructure research has developed in isolation from the large literature on economic growth.

We develop a neoclassical growth model that explicitly incorporates infrastructure and is

designed to provide a tractable framework within which to analyze the empirical importance of

public capital accumulation to productivity growth. We find little support for claims of a

dramatic productivity boost from increased infrastructure outlays. In a specification designed to

provide an upper bound for the influence of infrastructure, we estimate that raising the rate of

infrastructure investment would have had a negligible impact on annual productivity growth

between 1971 and 1986.

I.      INTRODUCTION

       In recent years, researchers, commentators, and politicians have devoted steadily more

attention to the quality, quantity and financing of infrastructure capita] in the United States.

At the heart of this debate is the notion that infrastructure is an important input to economic

growth, with many participants in the debate attributing (at least in part) substandard United

States economic growth in recent years to inadequate accumulation of infrastructure capital.

       Not surprisingly, there has also been a sharp increase in research into the economic

impact of public sector capital. In an influential study, Aschauer [1989] included public

sector capital in an aggregate production function and found that it exerted a very large

influence on private sector productivity.' (Munnell [1990b], Garcia-Mila and McGuire

[1992], and Eberts 11986. 1990] reported qualitatively similar--if smaller—findings.) More

recently, estimates. of state-level cost functions suggest that public infrastructure is a cost-

saving input for manufacturing industries (see, e.g.. Morrison and Schwartz [1992]).

However, the finding that public sector capital accumulation has been a significant drag on

U.S. productivity growth is not uncontroversial. Holtz-Ealcin [1994] and Hulten and Schwab

[1991], for example, argue that the macroeconomic impact of public sector capital on private

productivity has been small.

       Concern over the pace of U. S. economic growth has motivated this line of research.

In this light, it is somewhat surprising that infrastructure research has developed in isolation

from the large literature on economic growth.2 The purpose of this paper is to take a step

toward closing this gap. In the remainder, we develop a neoclassical growth model that

explicitly incorporates infrastnicture as a component of aggregate production. Our


                                               —1—
specification is designed to provide a tractable framework within which to analyze the

empirical importance of public capital accumulation for productivity growth. Moreover,

because of the interest in the contribution of infrastructure provision to economic growth our

framework is designed to emphasize this issue, and thus provide a guide to the largest

plausible effect from this source.

       Section 2 describes the basic framework, specifies the role of public capital in our

model of the economy, and describes the evolution of public capital. In Section 3, we

analyze the evolution and steady state of the economy under our assumptions. In the

following section, we use panel data for the 48 contiguous states between 1971 and 1986 to

examine the degree to which the states' growth experiences are consistent with the predictions

of our model. Focusing on the states is attractive because the results are of direct importance

to the design of state and local government policies. Also, the free flow of technology across

state borders makes the assumption of identical production technologies more tenable; the

legal setting, political institutions, and tastes do not vary greatly across states; and state data

offer the opportunity to analyze reasonably large samples collected on a consistent basis. But

state data present difficulties as well. In particular, states are open economies with relatively

free mobility of factors. Hence in our empirical work we guard against the endogeneity of

labor force growth and investment patterns that mobility potentially engenders.

       To anticipate the major results, we find that even in those specifications in which

infrastructure enters the estimated production process significantly, there is little support for

claims of a dramatic productivity boost from increased infrastructure outlays. For example, in

the specification designed to provide an upper bound for the influence of infrastructure


                                                -2-
 capital, we estimate an output elasticity of 0.10. However, even this estimate implies that
 raising the rate of infrastructure investment by 10 percent would have had
                                                                                    a negligible impact
 on annual productivity growth between 1971 and 1986. The final section is a surnmaxy, with

suggestions for further work in this       area.



2.      INFRASTRUCTURE ACCUMULATION

        We follow the lead of others and speci the stock of public sector capital as a

component of the aggregate production function.3 With an eye toward the empirical work to

follow, we assume that the production function takes the form:

               = K,QG,P(4IL)1                                                                     (2.1)


where   Y,    is total output, K1 is private capital, G, is public capital. 4 is the physical quantity of

labor, w, is an index of technical efficiency that transforms physical units into effective units

of labor, and t denotes time periods.4 We assume that w, grows at the constant rate A, so:

               = w0e At                                                                            (2.2)


Similarly, 4 is assumed to grow at the constant rate . Dividing all variables by the effective

quantity of labor yields the production function in intensive form:

               =                                                                                   (2.3)
        Yer



where the subscript "c' denotes quantities per effective labor unit.

        Of central focus in the recent policy debate has been the fraction of resources devoted

to infrastructure investment. We summarize the propensity to invest in the public sector by




                                                   -3-
9. the fraction of output devoted to public sector capital accumulation, if we let 8 denote the

geometric rate of depreciation of capital, then public capital evolves according to the identity:

             =       — 8G,                                                                   (2.4)

where the    "" denotes derivatives with respect to time. Accordingly, the growth rate of g,

may be written as:

or,

              =   Okg'    - (fi +÷5),                                                        (2.6)


Equation (2,6) summarizes the dynamics of public capital accumulation. In the next section,

we turn to the behavior of the economy as a whole.



3.     EVOLUTION AND STEADY STATE OF THE ECONOMY•

       To close the model, we must specify the accumulation of private capital. A detailed

investigation of private investment behavior is beyond the scope of this paper; there exists a

large literature that focuses on this topic alone. Our strategy is to simply control for private

sector capital accumulation, without positing a specific model of the interaction between

private investment and the evolution of public capital.5 Such an approach has both merits and

drawbacks. One advantage is that it simplifies the analysis. But it also restricts one to

analyzing the behavior of public capital and economic growth conditional upon the level of


                                              -4-
 private capital, a drawback that precludes evaluating the degree to which public capital

enhances private investment. At the same time, nearly aM other empiricalanalyses in this

area make a similar assumption. Following this convention allows us to identify the extent to

which an explicitly dynamic framework affects the analysis of infrastructure, while leaving

other aspects of the analysis unchanged.



        3.1 Characteristics of the Steady State

        The long-run tendencies of the economy may be gauged by examining the steady state

of the growth model. Setting the growth rate of public capital in equation (2.6) equal to zero,
and solving for the steady state value yields:

            =                                                                               (3.1)
                 1
                 Tl ++5
where   the superscript *" denotes steady state levels. One can use equations (3.1) and (2.3)

to predict the steady-state level of labor productivity:

             /                  a
          •1                        .                                                       (3.2)
             iA.'-5)
        Thus, this simple approach leads one to expect that persistent, long-run differences in

the level of infrastructure per worker and productivity will be directly related to the

propensity to invest in public capital (6). Moreover, the closeness of the correlation between

g1 and yt will be a direct function of the size of . l'hat is, setting = 0 in equation (3.2)

indicates that 6 does not affect productivity, although it continues to (in part) determine g.

         3.2 Characteristics of the Growth Path Toward the Steady State

         It is useful to extend the theory to develop predictions concerning the path of the

economy as it converges toward the steady state. Equation (2.6) describes the accumulation

of public sector capital on the path toward the steady state. To make clearer its implications

for economic performance, consider a log-linear approximation to the equation in the vicinity

of the steady state. Using log-differences as growth rates, the left side of (2.6) is

approximately:

         — = ln(g,,,1)       —
                                 ln(g)

Similarly, a first-order approximation to the right side of (2.6), evaluated at the steady state

values, yields:6

                         -   (11   X8) (I -)ft ÷X.8)(In(g,') - ln(g,)).                        (3.4)


Combining these results, the growth of public capital is described by:

         ln(g,,1)   4'   ln(g')     + (1
                                             —4')ln(g_).                                      (3.5)


where:

         4'   (l—)(.)+ö)                 .                                                     (3.6)


By iterative substitution into equation (3.5), the level of public capital at time : may be

described as a point along the growth path from the initial level of public capital. g,0. toward

the steady state. That is:                                             -




         ln(g) = (i —(I —$y)ln(g1) +              (1 —$)'J.n(gd)   .                          (3.7)




                                                           -6-
Re-arranging equation (3.7) yields the familiar prediction of convergence in a neoclassical

growth model:

            ln(g,) —   ln(g) = (i —(1 —• )')(ln(g,') — In(g))   .                              (3.8)


That is. the growth rate of public capital between t=O and =t is inversely related to the initial

level of public capital. cezeris paribus.'

           It is useful to think of as a measure of the speed by which the economy converges

to the steady state; i.e., indexing the fraction of the distance to the steady state that is

travelled each period. To gain a feel for the magnitudes, consider the time necessary to close

50 percent of the gap between the initial level of public capital and the steady state value by

evaluating equation (3.8) under the assumption that:

           ln(g,) —            = 0.50   (ln(g') — ln(g))                                       (3.9)
                       ln(g)                               .



If population and technology each grow at 2 percent per year (i=X=0.02), depreciation is 5

percent annually (5=0.05). and 13=0.05. then the implied adjustment speed is 0.086. Under

these parameter values, the time required to adjust one-half of the way to the steady state is

just under 8 years. A higher value of 13 raises.the time necessary to reach the steady state; if

[3=0.25. G=O.068 and the corresponding time is roughly 10 years.'

           Our specification of the growth model deliberately emphasizes the role of

infrastructure. Indeed, in this specification the productivity of infrastructure (as measured by

[3), and   the size of 4 dictate the dynamics of the economy. Specifically, differentiating (3.8)

and using (2.3) indicates that the effect of devoting greater resources to infrastructure on

productivity growth is given by:


                                                  -.7-
          d(1n(y)— ln(y,))        =      -(1       k;(g;)-'                                     (3.10)


The larger the value of , given 0, the greater the direct impact of public-sector capital

outlays on productivity growth. Similarly, the larger the value of $, the greater is the effect

of increasing the infrastructure investment rate. In general, however, the effect on

productivity growth depends upon the full set of parameters in the model.



       3.3 Open-Economy Considerations

       The discussion thus far has treated each state as if in isolation. In practice, however,

states are open to flows of factors of production. How do these considerations affect the

analysis? To the extent that infrastructure investment induces flows of capital and labor,

these variables will be correlated. The correlation among these variables, however, will not

bias efforts to identify the impact of infrastmcture on productivity. However, to the extent

that high-productivity   states   attract factors, the direction of causality will be reversed, and

econometric inferences contaminated. In the empirical work that follows we attempt to gauge

the degree to which the results reflect these influences. Notice, however, that the most likely

scenario is that higher productivity permits a state to invest more in infrastructure, leading to

an upward bias. Hence, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in controlling bias due to

simultaneity, the results are likely to overstate the importance of infrastructure to productivity

growth.

 4.        ECONOMETRIC IMPLICATIONS AND TESTS

          The model of infrastructure and economic growth developed above
                                                                                      yields strong
econometric predictions. Indeed, the model predicts that the accumulation of public capital is

the source of intensive economic growth, conditional upon the level of private capital.

Accordingly, differences in output or productivity are the direct consequence of differences in

policies toward infrastructure, a hypothesis that we test using data on the 48 contiguous U.S.

states. (The data are described in the Appendix.)

          To do so. let i denote states. We must transform the predictions of the theory

regarding capital and output per effective labor unit (which are not observable) into testable

statements regarding capital and output per worker. Let g, denote public capital per worker.
and recognize that:

          ln(g,) = ln(g)   —
                               ln(qç) =   ln(g)ln(,)   —
                                                           A.t   ,                                    (4.1)

which provides a link between effective and observable quantities of public capital. In a

similar fashion, one may convert private capital and output from effective to observable units.



          4.1 Steady-State Predictions

          To begin, we look at the long-run tendencies predicted by the model. Taking the

logarithm of both sides of equation (3.1) and transforming variables into observable quantities

yields:


          ln(g) =   l-a- (1n0v0)+X:) +                     6             +
                                                                             lnk,).                   (4.2)
                                             _!,ln[                  ]


                                                -9-
This suggests a straightforward regression-based test of the theory. Consider a cross-section

regression of the form:

         ln(g,)   =
                      a0
                           +
                               a1ln(e1) + a.lnOi1+?c+6)             t
                                                                        a3ln(k,) +           .                    (4.3)


A   comparison of equations (4.2) and (4.3) indicates that one should expect a, and                      a2 to be of

equal   magnitude and opposite sign.               Moreover, each        serves as an   estimate of (l-'. Finally.


equation (4.2) indicates that both a, and a2 should exceed Gj in absolute value. Thus, the

regression provides a useful way to gauge the relative importance of private capital, public

capital, and labor inputs into the growth of state economies.

         As a further check on the theory, notice that the production function (2.3) implies:

         ln(y) =      czln(k,1)        ln(g1)       .                                                             (4.4)

which when transformed into observable units yields an equation predicting cross-state

differences in output per worker:

         ln(v)        L' + b1ln(O,) + b,ln(T1+A+5) + b3ln(k)
                                                             +                           .                        (4.5)


Again   the theory implies that b3           and   b2   should be   of equal magnitude and       opposite sign,

although in   this instance      it   does   not constrain the relative size of b,.


         Table 4. 1 contains the results of checking these predictions against data from the 48

contiguous    states for 1986.        It is not our intention to assert that the states in 1986 constitute a

sample   of steady-state       observations. Rather, we seek an initial check an the plausibility of

the framework: are cross-state differences in productivity correlated with the variables

predicted to be   of lasting importance?


         Consider first the estimates in column (1). The dependent variable is the log of state

and local government infrastructure capital per member of the labor force in each state. The

 infrastructure investment as a fraction of Gross State Product (GSP), and the Labor force

 growth rate, respectively. We assume that X + 8 = 0.07. Private capital per worker is based

on data in Munnell [l990b].'°

        The initial results generaJly support the model. The coefficients on 0 and (m + +

8) are correctly signed, precisely estimated, and of comparable size. Indeed, it is

straightforward to constrain the coefficients in accordance with the theory; these estimates

are shown in column (2). The coefficient on the private capital variable is positive, smaller

than the coefficient on 0, and precisely estimated in both columns. Finally, the fit is

relatively good, with an adjusted 1?2 over 0.70. In sum, the initial pass at the data suggests

that the model provides an empirically promising description of cross-state variation in public

sector capital.

        In columns (3) and (4), however, we move toward explaining productivity (OSP per

worker), and the results are decidedly less favorable. While the private capital variable

continues to have its expected sign, and is statistically significant, the remaining point

estimates are often of the wrong sign. In addition, the data reject the constraints suggested by

the theory at any significance level higher than four percent. (See the row labelled "Test" in

column (4).) Finally, the variables explain a relatively small fraction of cross-state variation

in productivity. Thus, the simple version of the theory seems relatively successful in

explaining public capital accumulation, but provides an unsatisfactory explanation of cross-

state differences in productivity."

          From another perspective, however, even the results in columns (1) and (2) do not

provide evidence that differences in infrastructure policy translate into differences in

economic performance.              In   column (1), a, and a2 each serve to estimate (j)'I, and   the


implied 's are negative. The same is true for the constrained estimates in column (2).12

Perhaps    not surprisingly, such a simple theory does not provide a powerful explanation of

productivity differences across states.

          Before leaving these estimates, it is worthwhile to investigate a potential econometric

difficulty. A look at equation (4.2) reveals the presence of '4o embedded in the intercept of

equation (4.3). (The same is true of (4.5).) One might suspect that there are state-specific

characteristics -- location, climate. etc. -- that generate permanent differences in productivity.

These differences across states manifest themselves as differences in the initial level of

productivity,           In turn, these productivity differences may affect the propensity to invest in

public capital, the accumulation of private capital, and the growth rate of the labor force. In

econometric terms, the equations may be contaminated by the presence of state-specific

effects that are correlated with the right-hand side variables, raising the specter of biased and

inconsistent parameter estimates.'3

          The theory itself delivers a straightforward means to circumvent this difficulty. One

may eliminate w0 by taking a linear combination of equations (4.3) and (4.5). Specifically.
we may estimate:
                   —                     +
                                             c,ln(e1) +
                               =                                       +                                (4.6)

Here, the theory again delivers strong predictions concerning the estimated coefficients,

leading   one to anticipate c, = -2 = I and c3              0. The final two columns of Table 4.1 show

the results of checking these predictions. In column (5), the estimates ofc, and c, are in

rough accordance with the theory. Although one may reject the hypothesis that c1 = -c, = 1,

the magnitudes are in the right bailpark and one cannot reject c1 - c2. The estimate of c3,

however, is clearly very different from the predicted value of c3= ,14

        As discussed in the Appendix, our measure of "infrastructure" is dictated in part by

data availability. As a check on the sensitivity of our results to this definition, Table 4.la

shows the implications of expanding the definition of 0 to include all capital outlays by the

state and local governments in each state. Correspondingly, we define the dependent variable

to be the log of total state and local government capital per worker. Qualitatively, this

change in definition has little impact. Indeed, to the extent that there is any effect, these

results are marginally closer to the theoretical predictions.



        4.2 Growth Path Predictions

       The empirical analysis thus far has focused upon the long-run behavior of state

economies, as predicted by the steady-state of the growth model. As noted earlier, we may

derive a prediction concerning the movement through time of each state economy along the

path leading to its steady state (see equation (3.8)). This serves to relax the assumption that

all cross-state differences in economic variables are due to differences in their predicted

steady states. Instead, we incorporate a second source of variation: cross-differences in the

time required to reach the long-run position. These differences may stem from either of two

sources. First, the starting point -- the initial level of public capital — may be higher (or

lower) than in comparison states. If all state economies converge to the steady-state at the


                                              - 13
same rate, a higher starting point would translate directly into a greater level of public capital

per labor unit. One would not expect all states to converge at the same rate, however. As

noted above (see equation (3.6)). the adjustment speed ($) will differ due to differences in the

rate of labor force growth. The result is that states with a faster adjustment process will have

greater levels of public capital and output, ceteris paribus. at any point in time.

        It is possible to put some econometric meat on this theoretical skeleton by converting

equation (3.8) into its observable counterpart. Specifically, using (3.8) along with (3.1) and

(4.1) yields:

                                                  U
        ln(g,) -ln(g) = (1 -(1           n[1            ln(w)
                                                                   +in[°i ]+ln(k.) _ln(i)]
                              -

        Notice that equation (4.7) contains both the cross-sectional differences among states

and the time-series variation within each state. Following a similar derivation, we may obtain

an equation tracking the dynamics of output growth that stem from the accumulation of public

capital. Specilicallv. our assumptions imply that:

        ln(,y) — lnQ<,)   =   (I   —(1 —4,) )   (lncy; —ln(y)),
                                                                                            (4.8)

           To begin, consider column (1) of Table 4.2. which displays the results of estimating

 the linear analogue to equation (4.7) using data for. 1986. The dependent variable is the log-

 difference of infrastructure capital per worker over the period 1971 to 1986. Thus, it

 measures the cumulative growth rate of public capital per worker over the period. The

estimates indicate that growth rises with the average rate of investment in the public sector

(8), declines with greater capital needs (1+X+8). and increases with the amount of private

capital per worker (Ic1). Importantly, the negative coefficient on ln(g) indicates that the data

support the notion of convergence in the provision of public capital; growth is inversely

related to the initial level of capital. Each of the parameters is significant at conventional

levels.

          Column (2) repeats the estimation exercise, using instead the cumulative growth in

productivity as the dependent variable. A comparison of equations (4.7) and (4.9) reveals the

theoretical prediction that each of the estimated coefficients should have the same sign as in

column (I), and that the coefficients on 9, and            + A + 5) should be smaller in absolute

value. As before, the estimated coefficients generally follow the predictions of the theory,

although the precision of the estimates is less than in column (I). The exception is the

(negative) estimated coefficient for ic. Overall, relaxing the constraints placed on the data to

permit adjustment toward the steady-state improves the performance of the model in

explaining the provision of public sector capital and the resultant level of productivity per

worker.

          These estimates, however, rely only on the predicted relationship between 1986 and

1971, and thus are based on only a small fraction of the panel data. It is tempting to pool the


                                              -   15   -
data for all the available years as a means of exploiting all the available information in the

data. In doing so, however, one must recognize that the "coefficient? in these regression will

change through time. For example, equation (4.7) indicates that the coefficient on ln(g,) in

any year will be (1 -(1 -J'), which changes through time. To use all the years appropriately,

then, one must impose the full set of non-linear restrictions and estimate directly the

underlying parameters of the model -- a, 13. A. and Wo• Moreover, because equations (4.7)

and (4.9) share the same underlying parameters, one may enhance the efficiency of the

estimates by estimating these equations jointly.

       Columns (3) and (4) of Table 4.2 contain the outcome of this procedure.'5 The

estimated elasticity with respect to private capital (a) is 0.32, with an estimated standard error

of only 0.01. An estimate of this magnitude is comparable to estimates of the share of capital

income in total income, and thus near conventional estimates of the elasticity of output with

respect to capital inputs. For our purposes, however, the most interesting result is the

estimated 13 of -0.04. Thus, the less restrictive specification yields the same result as the

steady state regressions in Table 4.1: the point estimate of f3 is negative and significant at

conventional levels. To complete the results, the implied estimate of the elasticity of output

with respect to labor inputs is 0.73 and the estimated growth in the technical efficiency of

labor A is 0.25 percent annually. The latter is broadly consistent with vesy slow growth in

productivity over the past two decades.

       As before, it is desirable to control for the presence of unobserved state-by-state

variation in productivity levels. Here, however, the explicit use of the time dimension

permits us to adopt a different strategy for eliminating the     than used in the steady-state



                                              -16-
regressions above. We begin by explicitly parameterizing the permanent variations in

productivity across states by interacting Wo with a dichotomous variable for each state in the

sample.

        As shown in columns (5) and (6) of Table 4.2, controlling for state-specific differences

in productivity in this manner has a dramatic impact on the estimated parameters. The

estimate of a falls to 0.07, while that of f3 rises to just under 0.05. The implied value for the

elasticity with respect to labor rises to 0.88. and the estimated growth in technical efficiency,

X, rises to 0.41 percent. In each case, the precision of the estimated coefficient is good.

        What should we make of these changes in the estimates? The use of state

dichotomous variables effectively identifies the remaining parameters via year-to-year

fluctuations about state-specific means. As a result, the large implied elasticity with respect

to labor inputs likely reflects the dominance of employment in short-run output fluctuations.'6

A second issue is the degree to which parameters identified in this way are subject to

simultaneity bias. Recall that factor mobility across states might lead to circumstances in

which relatively high-productivity states attract inflows of capital and labor, thus implying

reverse causation. Controlling for state effects eliminates productivity differences across

states that do not change through time. This leaves, however, the possibility that changes in

productivity over time will lead to simultaneity problems.

       Reasoning in this way suggests that if simultaneity is quantitatively important in our

data, then the history of productivity in a state should improve one's ability to predict the

future path of 0 and t. That is, one should find that productivity "Ciranger-causes" these

variables. We investigate this possibility using the estimation and testing procedures


                                             -17-
developed by Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen [19881 for vector autoregressions in panel data.

Specifically, we specify an equation for 0,, that contains a dummy variable for each year. two

lags of 0,. two lags of ii,, and two lags of y0." The parameters are estimated using

insti-urnental variables to control for the difficulty presented by serial correlation in the error

term and the presence of lagged dependent variablesi8 We test the null hypothesis that past

changes in y, may be excluded from the equation. The test statistic for this hypothesis,
distributed as a chi-square with 26 degrees of freedom, is only 0.42. Thus, we fail to reject

the null hypothesis of no causal relation between past changes in statest productivity and the

rate of investment. We follow a similar procedure for liAr In this instance, the test statistic.

also distributed as a chi-square with 26 degrees of freedom, is 9.7. Once more, we fail to

reject the null hypothesis of no causal relation.

       Thus, within the context of our empirical analysis, the data do not suggest that the

estimate of J3 is plagued by a great degree of simultaneity bias. Of course, these diagnostics

do not constitute a complete investigation of factor mobility across states. For this reason, we

also examine an alternative means by which to eliminate state-effects -- by subtracting

equation (4.9) from equation (4.7). This approach has a cost, however, Ic,, is eliminated and it

is no longer possible to identify a.

       Since    is the central parameter for purposes of this study, we proceed in column (7)

to estimate the difference between these two equations. In effect,       is identified by

examining the degree to which the difference between growth of infrastructure and the growth

of output is correlated with the infrastructure investment rate. The resulting parameter




                                                -   18
estimate is substantially larger than in earlier columns -- roughly 0.10 — and precisely

estimated.

        As before, we check the sensitivity of these results to our definition of infrastructure

capital by re-estimating the equations using all state-local public capital. These results are

presented in Table 4.2a. In general, there are few differences in the parameter estimates.

While the point estimates differ, the qualitative nature of the results is robust with respect to

alternative measures of the inputs from the public sector. The two tables share a second

characteristic. In each case, the model does a relatively good job of explaining variations in

infrastructure capital per worker. The fit for productivity, however, is much worse. This

pattern of parameter estimates calls into question the importance of infrastructure in

explaining productivity growth.



       4.3 Implications

       What do the estimates imply about the productivity effects of spending on public

capital? To explore this issue, we compute the effect on productivity growth of raising the e

for each state by 10 percent. which corresponds to about $10 billion (measured in 1982

dollars) of new spending in 1986. By differentiating equation (4.9) with respect to 0 and

evaluating using j3 = 0.10 and data for 1986. we compute the effect on cumulative

productivity growth.'9 As a preliminary, note that the productivity effect depends in part on

the adjustment speed. 4i. We display the estimated values in Table 4.3. The mean value of

the adjustment speed is 0.069, with a low value of 0.055 (in Pennsylvania) and a high value

of 0.096 (in Arizona). Measuring things slightly differently, the mean numbers of years


                                              -19-
required to adjust one-half of the way to the steady state is 9.9. Here the range is from 6.8

years in Arizona to 12.4 years in Pennsylvania.

       What are the estimated productivity effects? In general, they are quite modest,

averaging 1.02 percent. Notice that these are the effects on total productivity growth over the

1970 to 1986 period, so that the effect on avenge annual productivity growth is quite small.

Even the maximum effect in the sample -- 1.08 in Arizona -- implies a trivial impact on

annual productivity growth. Thus, even if our point estimates are evidence of a qualitatively

important role for public sector capital in the production process, they do not suggest a

quantitatively important impact on the productivity problem. Moreover, we have deliberately

chosen the parameters underlying our calculations to maximize our estimate of the impact.



5.     SUMMARY

       The purpose of this paper has been to assess the empirical contribution of

infrastructure accumulation to productivity growth using an explicit model of economic

growth and a panel of state data. To do so, we introduce infrastructure capital into a

neoclassical mode! of economic growth in a fashion symmetric to private capital

accumulation, and examine the empirical implications.

       From the perspective of public sector capital accumulation, a robust bottom line

emerges: the data do not assign an important quantitative role in explaining the growth

patterns of states. In this respect, the results echo those of Evans and Ka.rras [1992], Holtz-

Eakin (1994] or Hulten and Schwab [1991].




                                             -20-
         Using the predictions of growth models to guide infrastructure analyses appears to be

a   promising avenue for further research. As noted earlier, the analysis presented in this paper

controls for the level of private capital accumulation, but does not mode! the interaction

between infrastructure and investment incentives. An obvious and important extension,

therefore, is estimation of the joint evolution of output, private capital accumulation, and

infrastnicture accumulation in the context of a well-specified model. Further, in the context

of state economic growth, factor mobility is an important issue. For the purposes of this

paper, our strategy has been to employ econometric techniques designed to minimize the

influences of factor mobility on our estimates. The next step. however, is to develop a

framework based on mobile factors to serve as the basis for empirical work.

        Output for each state is taken from the estimates of Gross State Product (GSP)

produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The labor force for each state was

constructed from data on unemployment rates and total employment1 also from the BEA.

Productivity is defined as the ratio of output to the labor force. Real private-sector capital in

each state is taken from Munnell [1990]. The estimates of investment in infrastructure are

based on real capital investment for state and local governments from Holtz-Eakin [1993aJ.

"Infrastructure" is defined as capital devoted to streets and highways, sanitation and sewage,

and electric, gas, and water utilities, while "all capital" encompasses all capital owned by the

state and local governments in a state. Sample statistics for the data are shown in Table Al.

 1.    Indeed, Aaron [1992] and Hulten and Schwab [1991] argue that the impacts are
       implausibly large.
 2.    Duffy-Deno and Eberts [1989] estimate dynamic equations to quantify the impact of
       public sector capital spending. They do not, however, explicitly link their empirical
       investigation to a model of economic growth.

3.     See, for example, Aschauer [1989], Munnell [1990], Holtz-Eakin [1994], or Morrison
       and Schwartz [1992].

4.     Holtz-Eakjn [1994] finds that the data is consistent with the constant returns to scale
       assumption in (2.1). Also, the results in Young [1992] argue against a specification
       with increasing returns to scale in capital inputs.

5.    With an eye toward factor mobility, we experimented with a specification in which the
      adjustment of private capital was not costly, and capital flows instantaneously equated
      the net (of taxes and depreciation) return to the marginal investment in all locations.
      In this context, taxes reduce the incentive to invest, while infrastructure raises the
      marginal product of private capital, and hence raises investment incentives. In
      practice, however, the assumption of instantaneous adjustment appears too extreme to
      capture the dynamics of state-by-state capital accumulation, leading to computational
      difficulties and implausible parameter estimates.

6.    Complete derivations of all results are available from the authors.

7.    See Mankiw, Romer. and Weil [1992] for an investigation of the convergence
      hypothesis in an international context. Holtz-Eakin [1993b] follows a similar approach
      using state data.

8.    In the limit, when (3 is equal to 1, $ is equal to 0. As a result, the economy does not
      converge to a steady state. Instead it grows continuously at a rate directly related to
      9. See below.

9.    The results are not sensitive to this assumption.

10.   We thank Alicia Munnell for providing these data to us.

11.   An alternative strategy for checking the long-run predictions is to use the (steady state)
      condition that the private capital-output ratio is constant to eliminate k, from the
      regressions. This approach yields results essentially the same as those in Table 4.1.
      For example, in the analogue to column (1) of the table, the coefficient onO, is 0.83
      and that on (;+ X + 8) is -0.61. Moreover, the data do not reject the constraints; the
      constrained point estimate is 0.81 with a standard error of 0.096. As in the table,


                                            - 29 -
      explaining productivity is less successful; both coefficients are of the wrong sign and
      insignificant. We thank a referee for suggesting this approach.
12.   Holtz-Eakin [1994] often finds point estimates of to be negative (while insignificant)
      in his estimates of state production functions.

13.   Holtz-Eakin [1994] emphasizes the importance of controlling for state-specific effects.
14.   As above (see note 11), we estimated the differenced equation (comparable to column
      (6)) imposing a constant private capital-output ratio. The estimated coefficient is 0.89
      (with a standard error of 0.065), which is close to the predicted value of 1.0. In
      general, however. imposing more theoretical structure on the cross-state regressions
      does not alter our conclusion: the variables suggested by the theory are relatively
      successful in explaining public capital accumulation, but unsuccessful in predicting
      differences in productivity.

15.   The equations were estimated using a non-linear, seemingly unrelated regressions
      (SUR) technique.
16.   Holtz-Eak.in [1994] reports a similar phenomenon.
17.   The results are not sensitive to the lag length chosen for the vector autoregression.
18.   See Holtz-Eakin, Newey, and Rosen [1988] for details. We use lags two and three of
      O, rj,, and y as instrumental variables and do not constrain the coefficients of the
      equation to be time-invariant.

19.   In the computations, we set S = 0.05, X = 0.04063, and     equal to the avenge labor
      force growth rate between 1971 and 1986.
