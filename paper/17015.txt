                                              ABSTRACT

This paper seeks to explain the key two stylized facts of fundamental reforms to social security systems
worldwide: Why have so many countries reformed when traditional systems seem, at first glance,
to have a higher probability of delivering a secure retirement income? Why have these reforms been
larger in developing countries facing less severe demographic problems? We show that an OLG voter model
can answer both questions. Larger reforms are motivated by a fundamental breakdown in intergenerational
trust while smaller reforms are caused by a lack of trust in the ability of the government to save. Empirical
analysis seems to support the model.

1.      Introduction

        One of the most far-reaching shifts in fiscal policy worldwide during the past two

decades has been the fundamental restructuring of public pension systems. At least 28

countries spanning five continents have converted, partially or completely, from pay-as-you-

go defined-benefit public pension systems to systems based on funded, defined-contribution

accounts. Reforms appear to be imminent in several more countries, while other countries

like the United States have seriously debated converting their public pension systems as well.

        These conversions are potentially the most significant policy reform during the past

century. Such a claim might at first seem to be a stretch. There have been many large public

policy changes during the past century: Trade barriers have been curtailed; price controls

have been dropped across many sectors; major industries have been deregulated; and, high

tax rates levied on narrow bases have been replaced with lower, broad-based taxes. But their

gains likely pale in comparison to pension reform.

           Previous simulation analyses suggests that moving the United States Social Security

system from pay-as-you-go financing to full funding could produce as much as a 30 percent

or more increase in the size of capital stock as well as increase potential (full) lifetime

income by over 20 percent.3 These potential gains are much larger than those associated with

fundamentally reforming the US federal income tax (Altig et al 2000), and potentially larger

than most other types of fiscal reforms, including even the adoption of free trade.4

           While pension fund conversions from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution

(DC) plans in the private sector have been largely motivated improving labor market

mobility within a country, this explanation does not hold for public pension systems. In fact,

the public plan conversions seem fairly puzzling at first glance. A traditional public DB plan

can be funded like a standard DC plan. Moreover, in the presence of economic uncertainty,

traditional plans more easily allow for inter-generational risk sharing. The additional

problems of financial illiteracy, moral hazard and adverse selection seem only to buttress the

case for the traditional pension system.

           This paper examines the two key stylized puzzles of pension reform. First, why have

so many countries moved, or are in the process of moving, away from unfunded DB plans

towards at least partially funded DC plans? Second, why have these reforms typically have

  motivating the reform debate in developed countries?

            Table 1 gives an overview of reforming countries: the date of reform, the degree of

  privatization and whether participation in the reformed system was voluntary or required. To

  estimate the degree of privatization, we developed an actuarial model for each country that

  incorporates that country’s specific reform rules, income distribution, life expectancy and

  other key economic and demographic variables (Appendix B). The degree of privatization is

  then calculated by estimating the annuitized fraction of retirement benefits provided by the

  new defined contribution system relative to total benefits for the median worker. Figure 1

  plots the reform size against the per-capita income for each country. Notice that larger

  reforms typically occur in countries with lower per-capita income.

                          One central theme emerges from our study: the public pension conversions reflect a

fundamental mistrust in the ability of the government to provide secure retirement resources.

The exact nature of the distrust, though, typically differs between reforming countries.




                                                                              5
        In more developing countries where reforms have been “fundamental” (i.e., large),

the traditional pension systems where often originally created by autocratic regimes who

wanted to consolidate power among various stakeholders. As these countries turned more

“democratic-like” over time, the will of the “median voter” became more influential. But

median voters often lacked or eventually lost trust in the government to run even a basic pay-

as-you-go system that appealed to them. The base system, therefore, is replaced wholesale by

personal funded DC accounts that give workers greater transparency and control. While

personal accounts can be subject to their own political risks, government interference

becomes more obvious. To be sure, the shift toward DC accounts might increase national

saving as many of the DB plans were not funded. But a greater level of funding per se is not

the primary object of reform itself. Personal accounts would have been created even without

demographic concerns. Rather, the increase in personal funding is required to secure a

retirement without trusting a pay-as-you-go scheme that only the government can run.5

        In contrast, in more developed countries where reforms have been “partial” (i.e.,

smaller), the role of core political instability is less important. Instead, the primary objective

is to pre-fund future benefits since many of these countries face severe demographic

problems. The government is trusted to run a strict pay-as-you-plan if demographics were

stationary. But the government is not trusted to properly save the additional resources that

are needed to pre-fund future benefits in the presence of non-stationary demographics. So

the creation of personal accounts is a byproduct of attempting to increase funding. If these

countries faced no demographic pressures, there would be little incentive to reform.


5
  A couple of countries have adopted unfunded ‘notional’ defined-contribution accounts, sometimes in addition
to funded defined-contribution accounts. While a notional account does create a clearer contract with the
government, the lack of funding still requires a lot of trust that future governments will fulfill previous
promises.

                                                      6
       Section 2 of this paper critically analyzes previous attempts to explain conversions to

personal accounts. Common rationales include: higher returns; improvements in domestic

financial institutional development; improving labor supply and retirement incentives; and

hedging demographic changes. In each case, a politically-stable and transparent government

could have achieved similar results within the traditional system. The traditional system also

tends to have lower transaction costs, less adverse selection, and other costs (Diamond 1996).

       Section 3 presents a simple model of a pension system as a game between median

voters of successive generations. The model incorporates the potential for a fundamental

reform, when inter-generational trust completely breaks down as well as the potential for

only a partial reform when additional savings are required to buffer demographic shocks.

       We then turn to empirical estimation. Section 4 then presents reduced-form empirical

tests on a data panel of reforming and non-reforming countries, across several statistic

methods. While we certainly are not the “last word” on measurement in this complicated

issue, our evidence seems fairly consistent with our model. Section 5 concludes.



2.     Review of Common Explanations of Reform

       We now critically examine several traditional reasons for pension reform. In each

case, we argue that they fail to explain fundamental or even partial reforms.

2.1.   Pursuing Larger Returns

       As traditional public pension systems around the world begin to mature, it is clearer

that they provide poor returns. Privatization, it is sometimes argued, can improve returns.

       Figure 2 reports the average effective (or “internal”) annualized rates of return earned

in the United States Social Security system by generation over time. Effective rates of return



                                               7
have declined dramatically over time. The composite average U.S. worker who began to

collect a benefit at age 65 in 1941 received a 36½ percent effective annual rate of return on

his pension contributions. In sharp contrast, a person born today into the mature U.S. Social

Security system is projected to receive less than a 2 percent effective rate of return.

       But the declining rate of return stems directly from pay-as-you-go financing itself:

money flowing into the pension system gets distributed immediately as benefit payments to

retirees. Early retirees receive a windfall that is matched in present value by payments made

by future generations. Since these windfalls have already been consumed, there is no


                                                             8
potential for recovering them.6 Increased returns only comes from current generations

sacrificing some of their consumption today, which they can do without privatization.


2.2.       Improvements in Financial Markets

           Another commonly cited reason for pension reform is to deepen the domestic capital

markets. Figure 3 shows the amount of private credit as a share of GDP in several countries

before and after pension reform (a hash mark indicates the respective reform dates for

reforming countries). Private credit includes the total financial resources provided to the

private sector through loans, purchases of non-equity securities, trade credits and other

accounts receivable that establish a claim for repayment. Private credit is one of the most

commonly used metrics in the literature for indicating an economy’s level of financial

sophistication, especially for less developed countries in which equity financing is less

common. But changes in private credit also reflect the changes in the private savings level

following pension reform rather than just changes in financial market institutions. Hence, we

also show the private credit levels for several reforming more developed West European

countries -- where financial markets were already sophisticated before reform -- in order to

better isolate out the commingled saving effects.

           Private credit levels in Western European countries are much higher relative to Latin

America and Eastern Europe.              Even these differences underestimate the greater capital

market development in Western European countries where investments tend to be relatively

more equity financed. Notice also that private credit indeed expanded in each country

following reform -- except for Mexico and Argentina, both of which suffered currency and

other financial crises. This evidence would seem to buttress the case for the hypothesis that


6
    This zero-sum condition can be traced back to Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965) and has been explored

                                                      9
           domestic capital market development was a major influence in reform. Many reforming Latin

           American and Eastern European countries also instituted restrictions that prevented workers

           from investing their money abroad, also seemingly consistent with this hypothesis.

                                                                      Figure 3

       But notice that the post-reform rise in private credit tended to be sharper in Western

European countries despite the smaller size of their pension reforms relative to the Latin

American and Eastern European nations. Since most Western European countries already

had sophisticated financial markets prior to reform, much of their increase presumably

stemmed purely from increases in the amount of capital, since pension reforms likely had

little impact on the relative reliance on equity financing. This result suggests that the

increase in private credit in Latin American and Eastern European nations might also have

been driven by the saving effect rather than by direct financial institution development.

       Moreover, except Mexico and Argentina, the availability of private credit began to

increase in most Latin American and Eastern European countries before the introduction of

personal accounts. (Since the personal accounts are unlikely to have a large effect for several

years, the effective pre-reform trend is even longer.) Indeed, the introduction of personal

accounts does not seem to increase the pre-reform trend in most countries, suggesting that

other factors might also be playing an important role in the expansion of private credit.

       Pension reforms in developing countries were typically part of larger reforms that

spurred capital market development. As discussed by Walker and Lefort (2002), the largest

reforms in developing countries include: macroeconomic stability; tax incentives; capital

control liberalization; deregulation and competition in the financial services; property rights,

bankruptcy legislation and investor protection; and, privatization of state-owned enterprises.

When controlling for country-specific factors, Walker and Lefort also find little evidence that

pension reform improved financial market development, including the cost of capital, stock

market volatility and other measures. Only when other factors are ignored does pension

reform seem to have some effect in developing the domestic capital market. Consistently,



                                              14
our own more formal empirical estimation (reported in Section 4) provides only weak

evidence that public pension reform was motivated by shallow financial markets.

       Moreover, personal accounts were not the only way to develop financial institutions.

Pre-funding existing traditional public pension systems could, in theory, have also done the

job by restricting investments domestically. In fact, using the public pension system to do the

“dirty work” would have avoided the appearance of a direct “tax” on workers’ investment

returns if they were forced to invest domestically within a privatized system. (Some

developed countries like Singapore, for example, invest their public pension funds in

domestic projects.) In contrast, a home bias in investments has no direct effect on a worker’s

pension benefit within a traditional system where benefits remain defined by law. Any

reduction in returns largely accrues as a hidden actuarial obligation on future generations.



2.3.   Enhancements to Labor Supply

       Payroll taxes in a traditional defined benefit system are distorting for several reasons.

First, workers are forced to invest into a pay-as-you-go public pension “asset” that pays a rate

of return below what they could have earned in the private sector. Second, redistribution

produces larger rates of returns for lower-income workers along with smaller returns for

higher-income workers. Third, borrowing constrained workers might not wish to make any

contributions at younger ages, even at a market rate of return. Fourth, particular features of

the program, such as a spousal benefit, cause additional distortions. Fifth, as documented by

Gruber and Wise (1998, eds. 1999), specific rules encourage early retirement.

       Private accounts are argued to ameliorate these tax-like disincentives to labor supply.

Each of these distortions, however, can be just as easily addressed with the traditional



                                              15
pension system with pension reform. Inferior rates of return are a natural outcome of pay-as-

you-go financing or redistribution; similarly, tax-induced distortions caused by redistribution

are simply the cost of redistribution, which would also exist in a private pension system that

maintained the same level of redistribution.7 Borrowing constraints could be lessened by

starting payroll tax rates at a low level early in life and increasing them with age in order to

collect the same present value of income from each worker on average (Hubbard and Judd,

1987). The other distortions are consequences of the rules specific to different public pension

systems and can also be addressed within traditional pension systems.



2.4.     Addressing Demographic Changes

         It is also commonly claimed that traditional public pension systems are unable to deal

effectively with demographic problems since payroll taxes must increase sharply or benefits

decrease sharply as the ratio of retirees to workers increases. In contrast, private accounts

should be less vulnerable to demographic changes since retirement benefits are directly tied

to previous savings. Demographic concerns, though, are unable to explain reform, at least

outside of considerations tied to political trust. Let’s first consider the empirical evidence.

         As shown in Table 2, higher-income countries tend to face the largest predicted

declines in worker-retiree ratios; but, higher income countries are also those with the smallest

pension reforms. In fact, as Figure 4 shows, among actual reforming countries, there appears

to be an inverse correlation between demographic problems and the size of actual reform.

The direct empirical evidence, therefore, does not seem that supportive at a high level.

  In fact, actual implementations of privatization actually reduce labor supply distortions. Smetters (2006)
derives the neutrality of labor supply to pension reform under the “carve out” scenario; he also demonstrates
that “shutdown” reforms actually reduce labor supply incentives.

                           Moreover, in theory, a traditional system could effectively deal with changes in

fertility rates by accumulating large reserves when the worker-retiree ratio is large and then

spending down the reserves as the ratio decreases. (Since 1983, the United States has been

building up its Social Security “trust fund” in an attempt to buffer future costs associated

with the retirement of baby boomers.) If these reserves were truly saved, then taxes would

remain roughly flat throughout the entire period, as collections would initially exceed costs

and then fall below. A personal account system would do no better in hedging demographic

risk. However, creating an additional reserve within a traditional pension system requires a

level of trust that the money will be saved, a consideration to which we now turn.

                                                                             18
3.      A Model of Trust

        We now show how a full breakdown of the inter-generational trust produces large,

fundamental pension reform; demographics play little role. However, smaller reforms are

motivated by a lack of trust of a different sort: while the government is trusted to run a strict

pay-as-you-go system, it might not be trusted to truly save the additional reserves that are

required to hedge a demographic shock. Smaller reforms are, therefore, demographic driven.

        Consider a simple overlapping-generations model. There are N t first-period agents

                                                            Nt
alive at time t. Population at time t grows at rate nt ≡                  . The total wage base at time t
                                                                 N t −1

grows at a gross rate Gt ≡ (1 + g t ) ≡ (1 + nt )(1 + x ) , where x is the exogenous and constant

rate of technological change between time periods. We initially assume that the population is

stationary and so we often drop the time subscripts for N and G. The gross rate of return to

risk-less capital is R = (1 + r ) , where r is the net rate of return. The wage rate at time t is wt ,

which grows at rate x, i.e., wt +1 = (1 + x ) wt . Factor prices are (trend) stationary, as in a small

open economy or with linear technology.

        An agent born at time t lives for three periods. The agent has exogenous levels of

productivity of α1 and α 2 in the first and second periods, respectively. Productivity in the


                                                                              ∑β u (c           ,1 − lk ,t ) , where:
                                                                               3
                                                                                     k
third period is zero, when he retires. Lifetime utility is given by                      k ,t

β is the growth-adjusted discount rate; ck ,t is the level of consumption at age k at time t; and,

lk ,t is the respective level of labor supply, where the total time endowment each period is

normalized to unity. The function u(,) is increasing and concave in both arguments. Lifetime

utility is maximized subject to the following budget constraints:

                                                 19

(3)            c3,t + 2 = Ra2,t +1 + bt + 2

Variable a represents private assets while b is the social security benefit received in the third

period that is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis by a proportional tax τ on labor earnings.

               For expositional simplicity, social security benefits are proportional to previous social

security contributions. In the case of stationary demographics, every agent, therefore, earns

the same gross “internal” rate of return G on their contributions, equal to the growth rate of

the wage tax base. The pay-as-you-go social security benefit received by generation t equals8

3.1.           A Theory of Fundamental Reforms: Voting Over Pay-as-you-go Financing

               Suppose that the population growth rate, n, is not very large, so that

(1 + n )       < (1 + n ) + 1 = ( 2 + n ) . Then, the age-2 agent is the median voter that determines
           2




whether the policy control of the pay-as-you-go system. Since the median voter is not yet

retired, he will vote to continue the system if and only if two conditions are satisfied:



                                                          bt + 2 G τα1 wt l1,t + Gτα 2 wt +1l2,t +1
                                                                  2

(A)            (Incentive Compatible) τα 2 wt +1l2,t +1 <       =
                                                           R                    R

(B)            (Continuation) The current age-1 agent, generation t, votes for τ .




8
    I.e., in a stationary economy, equation (4) can be rewritten as the standard pay-as-you-go constraint,
N t bt + 2 = N t + 2 τα1wt + 2l1,t + 2 + N t +1τα 2 wt + 2l2,t + 2 .

                                                                       20
        Condition (A) says that the present value of the future social security benefits that are

paid to the median voter must exceed the value of the second-period taxes that he would save

today from abandoning the system. Even though pay-as-you-go social security is actuarially

unfair to age-1 households in a dynamically efficient economy where R > G, age-2

households have already contributed to the system in the previous year. Hence, this incentive

compatibility constraint can hold even if social security pays a lower internal rate of return.

        Condition (B) is the usual recursive “trigger strategy” belief that enforces cooperation

across generations in pay-as-you-go games (Verbon 1988a,b; Kotlikoff, Persson and

Svensson 1988; Drazen 2001; Cooley and Soares 1999; Rangel 2003). The current age-2

median voter won’t vote to support continuation of the pay-as-you-go system unless the next

median voter (who is currently age 1) also supports continuation, ad infinitum. Otherwise, the

current median voter would pay into the system but not receive any future benefit.

Cooperation is enforced with a simple trigger: Any age-2 agent that abandons the system will

be sufficiently punished by reducing his third-period social security benefit by more, in

present value, than his second-period tax savings, α 2 wt +1l2,t +1τ .

        Condition (A) is likely to hold in stable economies with a reasonable value of R. To

see this, suppose that α1 = α 2 (i.e., flat productivity profiles) and R = 1/ β (i.e., interest rate

equals the growth-adjusted rate of time preference). Then condition (A) can be simplified to:

             G G2 G + G2
(A’)    1<    +  =
             R R    R

The first term G R in equation (A’) corresponds to the tax payments paid in the second

period of life and represents the relative rate of return produced by pay-as-you-go financing

G relative to the rate R which could have been received in the capital market. In a


                                                  21
dynamically inefficient economy, G R < 1 , reflecting the opportunity cost of capital. In other

words, the median voter would have been better off if he could have invested his payroll

taxes into the capital market. The second term G 2 R reflects the fact that the age-2 median

voter, however, has already paid into the pay-as-you-go system in the first period, a

contribution that would be lost if he votes to abandon the system. The inequality shown in

equation (A’), therefore, holds, except for fairly large values of R >> G. In that case, the

opportunity cost of the median voter’s second-year contribution is large enough that he is

willing to forfeit his first-year contribution in order to obtain a larger rate of return.

        However, the pay-as-you-go system unravels if the discount rate R effectively

becomes too high, potentially in response to uncertainty about the future. Since the “trigger”

is recursive, the game collapses if it is not incentive compatible for any future median voter. 9



Proposition 1. A pay-as-you tax τ is a Nash, subgame perfect equilibrium if and only if

Conditions (A) and (B) hold for current and future median voters. Also, let [0, Rmax ] ∈ℜ+ be

the support over the values of R such that Condition (A) holds. Rmax is bounded above. □



        So we arrive at a theory for large social security reforms: the system unravels if a

current or future median voter faces a large enough value of R, which effectively causes them

to highly discount the value of future social security benefits. Proposition 1 shows that such a

value of R exists for any size of the pay-as-you-go system, τ .



Remark 1. Condition (A) can be generalized to the case of non-stationary demographics as:



                                                 22
                               Gt +1Gt + 2 τα1 wt l1,t + Gt + 2 τα 2 wt +1l2,t +1
(A’’)    α 2 wt +1l2,t +1τ <
                                                       R

Even with substantial deviations from stationary demographics (e.g., a “baby boomer

bulge.”), the median voter is age-2 and Condition (A’’) holds. To see the latter result, again

                                                                                          Gt + 2 Gt +1Gt + 2
suppose that α1 = α 2 and R = 1/ β . Condition (A’’) is simplified to 1 <                       +            . With
                                                                                           R         R

(trend) stationary factor prices, a demographic bulge, as witnessed in many developed

countries, implies Gt +1 > Gt + 2 > 0 .10 For some parameter values, the new maximum support

             ''
value of R, Rmax , might actually be larger than the support, Rmax , with stationary

demographics; for some parameter values, it is smaller. In either case, the prevalence of non-

stationary demographics does not play an important role in undermining the trigger. □



3.2.     An Extension to Partial Reforms: Including a Social Security “Reserve”

         The knife-edge nature of the trigger strategy used in Proposition 1, however, rules out

an explanation of partial reforms. Moreover, as explained in Remark 1, demographics alone

do not play a large role in explaining a collapse of intergenerational cooperation. So why

then do some countries reform but not completely abandon their social security systems?

         Consider now a dual fiscal policy space in which votes are also cast over an

additional proportional payroll tax, τa , which might be interpreted as being used to fund a

social security “reserve.” A direct majority (median voter) model also determines the level of

this payroll tax.11 If cohort t’s own future social security benefit is then increased by

  It can be shown that social security will continue provided that the probability of future collapse is not too
large. This type of result is fairly standard in dynamic reputation games.
10
   While n < 0 is possible, G > 0 since n > -1 for any population to remain.
11
   Alternatively, both issues could be voted upon as a bundle, as in a representative democracy model. The
solution that we derive extends to this case as well, with some fairly minor modifications.

                                                                   23
R 2 τa α1 wt l1,t + Rτa α 2 wt +1l2,t +1 then τa represents a pure “funded” portion of social security.12

Assuming that borrowing constraints are not binding, such a payroll tax, however, has no

impact on any household’s budget constraint; it just substitutes public saving for private. A

“partial privatization” that simply undoes this payroll tax, τa , is economically neutral.

           Suppose instead that the government contemporaneously redistributes τa instead of

saving it. Of course, a majority of voters might want redistribution for the usual reasons. But

our motivation in this setting is more practical: few people understand government budgetary

arithmetic. This revenue might, therefore, naturally be viewed as a part of general pool that is

up for grabs -- as enforced by standard accounting practices, including the “unified deficit,”

which is the headline measure reported in the U.S. But the nation does not literally need to

adopt reserve type of budget labels. We now show that non-stationary demographics can

generate apparent partial privatization simply based on how majority power shifts over time.

           To avoid Condorcet type of cycles, we need to consider voting over a specific

redistribution function.13 For simplicity, consider voting over a policy rule that distributes

these resources as a subsidy across the population on a constant per-capita (per vote) basis.

Alternative policy rules could be considered as well; the current rule simplifies the analysis.

           Assume that labor supply is inelastically supplied at one unit.14 Let st denote the per-

capita subsidy at time t, in the form of a rebate to each worker:

                   N t −1τa α 2 wt + N t τa α1 wt
(5)         st =                                  .
                         N t − 2 + N t −1 + N t

                                           τa is implement, benefits are not increase on the current age-3
     More technically, we require that, when
retirees. Current age-2 households then see their third-period benefit increase to Rτ α 2 wt +1l2,t +1 .
                                                                                     a

13
  This same issue arises with most fiscal policies: for example, we previously considered voting over a fixed
form of redistribution from workers to retirees. Voting over exogenous fiscal policy functions is commonly
assumed in the literature to avoid Condorcet types of voting indeterminacies.

                                                      24
The numerator in equation (5) equals the additional tax revenue collected from workers at

time t. The denominator is equal to the size of the population, including retirees at time t

( Nt −2 ), age-2 workers ( N t −1 ), and age-1 workers ( N t ). Workers who are age 1 at time t will

vote for this subsidy in a one-shot static game (we extend to a dynamic game below) if

(C1)        st > τa α1 wt .

In words, the value of the subsidy must exceed the taxes paid by the additional tax. Similarly,

workers who are age 2 at time t will vote for it if:

(C2)        st > τa α 2 wt .

Since factor prices are fixed, retirees will always vote for the subsidy, i.e.,

(C3)        st > 0 .

           With some algebraic substitution, Conditions (C1) and (C2) can be reduced to:

            α2                          α
               N t −1 > Nt −1 + Nt − 2 ⇒ 2 > 1 + (1 + nt −1 )

(C2’)
            α2                     α2

           In words, (C1’), for example, says that age-1 workers at time t are more willing to

support the social security reserve if age-2 workers, whom are also in the tax base, are

sufficiently more productive than age-1 workers, adjusted by the other population competing

for the transfer. Intuitively, given the simple per-capita rebate subsidy rule, age-1 households

want to effectively “pool” their reserves with more productive age-2 workers, provided that

there are not too many other competing voters, N t −1 + N t −2 , participating in the subsidy.




14
     The tax-subsidy distorts labor supply, which we want to abstract from for the sake of simplicity.

Lemma 1. (i) With non-negative population growth ( nt ≥ 0 ), age-1 and age-2 workers at

time t won’t both support a social security reserve, τa . (ii) The converse is not true: there is a

non-empty set of parameters, {α1 , α 2 , N t −1 , N t , N t +1 } , where both workers reject a reserve. □



           To    prove     part    (i)   of      Lemma     1,   insert   (C1’)    into    (C2’)    to   get

negative population growth ( nt ≥ 0 ). However, the converse is not true: workers of both ages

can vote to reject a reserve.15 Intuitively, redistribution between age-1 and age-2 workers is

not zero-sum since age-3 retirees receive transfers but don’t face payroll taxes. Hence, only

one age-cohort of workers (age-1 or age-2) could be better off, not both. However, if the

transfer to age-3 retirees is large enough, then both age-cohorts could be worse off.

           With non-negative trend stationary demographics (where nt = n ≥ 0 ), a reserve will

either always exist or not; a reversal of policy cannot occur.16 To see why, consider first the

case where age-1 workers favor the reserve. By Lemma 1 (i), age-2 workers will oppose:

           α2
              > 1 + (1 + n )
                             −1

                             −2
(7)
           α2

Aged-3 retirees, of course, still favor the reserve since it is redistributed. Combining their

votes with age-1 households will produce a winning coalition in favor of the reserve since


15
 For example, both aged workers will vote against a reserve for the following parameter combination:
α1 = 1.25 , α 2 = 1.75 , and Nt = N t −1 = N t − 2
16
     Technically, we only require nt = n ≥ − 1
                                                 2.
                                                      26
1 < (1 − n ) + (1 + n ) = 2 . Now, consider the case where age-1 households oppose the reserve

and age-2 workers favor it (i.e., the opposite signs in equations (6) and (7)). If n < 1 2 then

the winning coalition always favors the reserve since 1 + n < 1 + (1 − n ) ; if n > 1 2 then age-1

workers are plentiful enough to always vote down the reserve. Finally, by Lemma 1 (ii), both

aged workers can also reject a social security reserve under the right parameter combination

(e.g., α1 = 1.25 , α 2 = 1.75 ; n = 0 ), i.e., reverse the sign of the inequality shown in equation

(6). In particular, they always create a winning coalition that rejects the reserve since

1 − n < 1 + (1 + n ) when n ≥ 0 > −1 2 . We summarize as follows:




Proposition 2. (i) With non-negative trend stationary demographics ( nt = n ≥ 0 ) , a policy

reversal of social security reserving (i.e., τta > 0 ; τta+1 = 0 =0) cannot occur. (ii) However, with

non-stationary demographics, there exists a non-empty parameter set in which social security

reserving is eventually reversed, i.e., “partial privatization.” □



        We have already proven part (i) of Proposition 2. We only need one example to prove

Part (ii) under the fairly plausible restriction nt ≥ 0 , i.e., non-negative population growth.17




Example 1. Fix α1 = 1.25 and α 2 = 1.75 . To reduce notation, set τta = 1 = wt . Hence, an age-j

agent will support a social security reserve at time t, τa , if st > α j . Consider the following

sequence of cohort sizes: {30, 100, 200, 400, 450, 500}. In other words, sharp increases in

cohort sizes are followed by much smaller growth rates, near trend stationary:

A reserve is established (by +130 votes) at time t in face of a large demographic transition,

where the worker-to-retiree ratio is 10. As the population ages, the worker-to-retiree ratio

declines to 5 by time t+1, and the additional social security reserving is reversed (by 500

votes). Over the longer-term, the worker-to-retiree ratio settles a little above 2; the additional

social security reserves are not reintroduced. □



           In other words, our simple model explains why a reserve is initially created in the

presence of a forthcoming “baby boomer” type of demographic shock, eventually undone,

and never re-established. A “partial privatization” occurs and is driven by undoing the

redistribution of the additional payroll tax, τa . As noted earlier, if the government were able

to actually save the reserve rather than redistribute it, then the policy would simply be

mimicking private saving behavior and would be economically neutral (i.e., Ricardian-like).

           Importantly, the reversal of the reserve (“partial privatization”) does not need to

produce fundamental reform (“full privatization”). Specifically, there is a value of R such

that Conditions (A) and (B) still hold after a reversal of the reserve, thereby supporting the

continuation of the pure pay-as-you-go system. In particular, it is easy to construct examples

where the base pay-as-you-go τ can be supported by a trigger strategy (Conditions (A) and


17
     Part (ii) holds under an even larger parameter space if population growth is not non-negative.

                                                         28
(B) hold) while an additional social security reserve τa is created and then reversed. (In

Example 1, set R = 1.9.) This result is generally consistent with Rangel (2003) who shows

that a “Backward Intergenerational Good” can be supported on its own as a trigger strategy

whereas a “Forward Intergenerational Good” cannot be supported on its own.18



Proposition 3. (i) With trend stationary demographics, Conditions (A) and (B) can hold

(pay-as-you-go financing) with or without additional social security reserves. (ii) With non-

stationary demographics, a reversal of the additional social security reserving (“partial

privatization”) can occur even if pay-as-you-go finance remains (no “full privatization”). □



3.3.     Summary

         Our simple median voter model predicts that fundamental reforms to a public pension

system (“full privatizations”) are motivated by political and economic turbulences that

increase the effective discount rate, thereby undermining the inter-generational trust that is

required to enforce continuation of the traditional public pension system. Demographic

changes play very little role in motivating large reforms. However, smaller reforms (“partial

privatizations”) are more motivated by demographic concerns and are smaller in magnitude

since some fundamental inter-generational trust might still remain; the government is simply

not trusted to hold additional reserves against demographic changes. We now turn toward

investigating these predictions empirically.




18
  Rangel shows that a FIG, though, can be supported in equilibrium if bundled together as a single vote with a
BIG. In our voting model, allowing for bundled voting (as in a representative democracy) would not affect our
key results provided that the range of voting bundles is not restricted. Under the parameter conditions described

4.       Empirical Findings

         Our theoretical model produces two testable hypotheses. First, large reforms are the

result of a complete breakdown of the intergenerational game; they are primarily motivated

by political and economic turbulence and the associated loss of trust rather than demographic

pressure. Second, smaller reforms are more motivated more by demographic pressure rather

than a fundamental breakdown of intergenerational trust. This section tests these hypotheses

empirically.



4.1.     The Data

         We assembled a comprehensive list of 116 countries throughout the world with

current or historic pay-as-you-go systems.19 We excluded from our collection 21 countries

with provident fund systems.20 In addition, a few, mostly smaller, countries with pay-as-you-

go systems were excluded due to data constraints.21 The specific countries used in the

analysis are listed in Appendix A. Of the 116 countries included in our data set, only 26 are

reformers. Given the limited size of data, our results should be interpreted as only suggestive.



therein, a representative who favors a bundle of keeping pay-as-you-go financing while abandoning reserving
would obtain more votes than a representative who tries to maintain both.
19
   Our primary data source was Social Security Programs Throughout the World, published by the U.S. Social
Security Administration and the International Social Security Administration. This publication includes
information on almost all countries in the world, but does exclude some countries. Excluded countries consist
mostly of developing smaller nations, such as Bhutan and Guinea-Bissau, or countries wracked by conflict, like
Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Eritrea. Other excluded countries simply do not participate in the international
community, such as North Korea.
20
   The provident fund countries, many of which are former British colonies such as Singapore, Malaysia, and
India, operate a mandatory savings scheme similar in spirit to the private account reforms which are the subject
of this paper. However, unlike private account reforms, these provident fund systems typically offer little
individual control over investments. All the provident fund systems excluded from our analysis are systems that
are the original (often since state declaration of independence) pension systems of the countries concerned.
21
   These are the Bahamas, Belize, Barbados, Cape Verde, Malta, which are small nations for which sufficient
reliable data is not available. For Iceland and Luxembourg, we have insufficient political data available from
our primary sources because of their small size, although they are advanced economies. Hong Kong’s unique
political position also excludes it from the analysis. In addition, Cuba, Libya, Liberia, and Uzbekistan are
excluded because reliable economic data is unavailable.

                                                      30
       Our dependent (left-hand side) variable in our analysis is the degree of reform, as

shown previously in Table 1. We calculate the annuitized value of private account

components, as a percentage of the average retiree’s total pension income, based on the

published parameters of the pension system. The maximum degree of reform is achieved

when 100% of the average retiree’s state pension income is derived from private account

sources. Our calculations explicitly model the idiosyncratic features of each country’s

reform, including state financed minimum pension guarantees and old-age welfare programs,

both of which tend to reduce the degree of pension income from private sources, depending

on the income distribution in that country. Our actuarial model for each country incorporates

that country’s income distribution, life expectancy and other key economic and demographic

variables. Details of these calculations are in Appendix B. Appendix C explains the variables

used in our empirical estimation as well their sources in detail.

       To measure the degree of intergenerational ‘trust’ that is needed to continue a pay-as-

you-go system, we examine the amount of historic political instability within a given

country. Countries with significant historic political instability, due to concomitant regime

changes and systemic upheaval, should possess less inter-generational trust, and are more

likely to reform. We constructed an instability index based on data from the Polity IV

Project, a widely used panel containing political characteristics of 162 countries from 1800-

2006. Our historic instability index measures the number of times a country had a political

regime lasting at least 5 years, since the inception of the state pension system (summarized in

Appendix B). This index captures the frequency of regime change, while ignoring extremely

short and volatile regimes which would have insufficient time to disrupt existing institutions

severely.

       However, it is also likely that countries with a longer history of political freedoms are

more likely to have the political conditions necessary for the public to express their

preferences for reform in the face of instability. Toward that end, we include a measure of

“historic democracy” based on the Total Score from the Freedom House index that is popular

in the political science literature. Table 4 shows the corresponding values for reforming

countries in the year of their reform, although our empirical analysis, of course, includes the

values for non-reforming countries as well. To reduce the potential sensitivity of this variable

to a single year of data, we take the average of this variable for each country over the last

several decades (depending on the amount of data available for each country).

       Additional economic and demographic control variables are obtained from the World

Bank’s World Development Indicators database. We use per-capita GDP, measured in

purchasing power parity, as the indicator of the country’s wealth level. To control for a

country’s projected demographic constraints, we include the percentage of the population

that is projected to be above 65 in the year 2025, as estimated by the U.N. World Population

Prospects database. We also include credit provided by the private sector, scaled by GDP, as

a measure of the amount of financial investment and development of the local economy.

4.2.   Estimates

       We begin by investigating what motivates the decision to embark on reform itself,

regardless of the eventual degree of reform, through the following Probit model:

                          Yi* = β0 + β1INSi + β2DEMOi + βXi + ei

Yi* is the latent variable: Y=1 if country i has undergone social security system reform and

Y=0 otherwise. INS is our constructed measure of historic instability indicating the number of

times that country i has undergone a political regime change lasting at least 5 years since the

inception of its traditional public pension system. DEMO is the projected proportion of

country i’s population aged 65 and older in the year 2025. X is a vector of controls for

country i consisting of: Purchasing power-adjusted GDP; credit provided to the private sector

as a percentage of GDP; and, a measure of historic democratic freedom.

       The Probit estimates displayed in Column (1) in Table 5 demonstrate that, as

expected, larger degrees of historic instability and greater demographic pressure statistically

increase the probability of reform. In relative terms, an increase of one point in the index of

historic instability has roughly the same impact as a two percentage point increase in the

projected proportion of the population above 65; the marginal effect of the one-point

increase in the instability index (not shown) is to increase the probability of reform by 5.4

percentage points, which represents a one-third increase from the base probability of 14.7

percent calculated at the mean of the independent variables. The controls have the expected

signs; countries with larger pre-existing private sector capitalization have a lower propensity

for reform, while countries with higher values of historic political freedoms are more likely

to have the political conditions necessary for the public to express their preferences for

reform. Interestingly, per-capita GDP is not statistically significant, thereby suggesting that



                                              35
the other factors better explain the variation. The Probit model, though, while a useful first

cut, does not give information about the motivation behind the size of reforms.


       The Tobit estimator is useful for that purpose:


                          Yi* = β0 + β1INSi + β2DEMOi + βXi + ei

Yi* is the latent dependent variable. For values of Yi* above and below the censoring limits

of 0 and 1, we observe Yi which is the percentage of pension wealth derived from private

account sources on a 0% to 100% scale, which describes the extent of reform in country i.

The independent variables were described above. Column (2) of Table 5 reports the results.

       The Tobit estimator shows that an increase in the instability index of one point is

associated with an unconditional increase of 16.9 percentage points in pension wealth

derived from private account sources. In contrast, the impact of a one percentage-point

increase in the projected proportion of the population above 65 is 6.8 percentage points.

Thus, the estimated effect of a one point increase in the instability index is roughly two and

half times the effect of a one percentage point increase in demographic pressure.

       Judging the relative impact of instability versus demographic pressure, though, is not

possible based on these coefficients alone because the associated independent variables are

not identically normalized. To explore further, the mean value of the instability index is 2.65

for reforming countries with a standard deviation of 1.71, while the mean value of the

projected population above 65 is 15.26 with a standard deviation of 5.94. Assuming linearity

in effects, our coefficients therefore suggest that a one standard deviation change in

demographic pressures has an approximately 40.53% greater impact on the extent of reform

(conditional on the reform occurring) than a one standard deviation change in the instability

index. Still, even these numbers don’t directly test the part of our theory arguing that larger

                                              36
reforms are more likely caused by instability than demographics. These magnitudes are also

consistent with simply having more countries with smaller reforms (motivated by

demographics) in the data relative to countries with larger reforms (motivated by instability).

       We, therefore, also report Tobit estimates over restricted ranges of our dependent

variable, the size of reform.22 Column (3) of Table 5 reports the Tobit results with only

smaller reforming nations – those 13 countries in the bottom 50% of reform size -- included

as reformers. The role of demographics for small reformers is now much greater than

instability: a one standard deviation change in demographic pressures has a 117% greater

impact on the extent of reform than a one standard deviation change in the instability index.

       Column (4) of Table 5 reports the Tobit results with only larger reforming nations –

those in the top 50% of reform size -- included. Now, as suspected, the importance of the

roles is reversed: a one standard deviation change in the instability index has a 19% greater

impact on the extent of reform than a one standard deviation change in demographic.

However, neither statistic is significant at conventional levels (the p value for the instability

index is 0.126). This insignificance appears to be largely driven by a single outlier country

with a large reform despite the presence only one major period of instability: Kazakhstan. In

a rush to reform after the fall of communism, this country announced its private pension

system plans before its public safety net was formulated. Hence, to be conservative, we

coded Kazakhstan as a 100% reformer even though it has since announced a more traditional

public safety net (although the details still remain sketchy). Column (5) of Table 5 shows the

effect of dropping Kazakhstan: now instability is significant while the role of demographics

remains insignificant for large reformers. Taken at their reported values, a one standard




                                               37
deviation change in the instability index has a 99% greater impact on the extent of reform

than a one standard deviation change in demographic pressure.



4.3.     Robustness

         To check the robustness of our results, we first examine the effect of reducing the

impact of potential outliers, which is potentially quite important in light of our small dataset.

A standard way of examining the impact of outliers is with median regression analysis with

iterative weighting. However, our median country is non-reforming (the dependent variable

is 0%) and so weights cannot be accurately assigned; moreover, this procedure does not

respect the censoring at 0%.

         Instead, we examine the impact on the Tobit regression of simply dropping the top

and bottom 10% of reforming countries. Comparison of Column (1) of Table 5 and Column

(1) of Table 6 shows that the results are basically unchanged, although the importance of

instability relative to demographics becomes a little larger.




22
  A formal “quantile Tobit” estimator that has been recently developed does not solve for our dataset due to the
significant amount of censoring, as most countries are non-reformers. The restricted estimators that we report,
therefore, are not full information and are, therefore, not strictly comparable.

       We also estimate a Cox proportional hazard model with time-varying covariates:

                          Hit = β0 + β1INSit + β2DEMOit + βXit + ei

Hit is the log of the hazard ratio, the probability of “failure” (reform) at time t for country i.

Country i is modeled as “failing” in the year t at which that country undergoes pension

reform; otherwise, country i is assumed to continue without failure until the year 2003, when

our dataset ends. INS is the instability index of country i at time t, while DEMO is now the

life expectancy in country i at time t; we are not able to include the share of the population

that is projected to be above age 65 because a time series of historical population projections

are not available. The only other control contained in X is the purchasing power GDP in

country i at time t; our other covariates were not available over the relevant historical period.

       An advantage of the Cox specification is its ability to include the actual timing of a

reform. The key disadvantage is the required omission of many important control variables.

Nonetheless, Column (2) of Table 6 shows that both instability and increases in life

expectancy are associated with an increased hazard, or probability, of reform. In terms of

relative effects, an increase in our instability index of one unit increases the risk of reform by

the same amount as a 1.5 year increase in population life expectancy.

       Finally, we test the importance of the “Latin America” effect. Brooks (2007) argues

that peer effects are an important factor behind the adoption of pension reforms with other

countries following Chile’s pioneering reform. Under this view, reforms are transmitted

between countries through formal and informal links, which are more pronounced among

geographic and cultural peers.

        Of course, peer effects are not inconsistent with our model: similar to our “historic

 democracy” variable, peer effects potentially help enable voters to push for large reforms in

 the face of instability. Nonetheless, Table 7 reveals a striking pattern. The majority of

 reforming countries with severe demographic problems are located in Europe and the former
                                              41
Eastern Europe, while countries with relatively young populations are mostly in Latin

America. By contrast, no such strong pattern is present in the instability index. Significantly,

it is largely those countries in Latin America with high instability and relatively young

populations, who have undertaken the largest degrees of reform.

       Column (3) of Table 6, present results from a modified Tobit model with the

interaction terms “Latin America X Historic Instability” and “Latin America X Projected %

Population 65+ in 2025.” The coefficient for the Latin America instability interaction term is

large and statistically significant at the 10% level while the Latin America population

interaction term is not. (The previous control for Historic Instability now becomes

insignificant and the “wrong” sign.) Hence, instability in “Latin America” is associated with

reform whereas demographics in Latin America seem to play a smaller role.

       Column (4) of Table 6 then adds a fixed-effects indicator for “Latin America” to

allow for a different intercept for Latin America. Since there are just 14 non-Latin American

reforming countries and 12 Latin American reformers, this additional control substantially

slices the data. So, our empirical results, which should already be interpreted with some

caution, become a bit more suspect. With that caveat in mind, we find a strong and highly

significant pure “Latin American” intercept effect. This finding has an unclear interpretation

with our theoretical model. One on hand, it is consistent with a “general revolution” in Latin

America that is occurring independently of demographics, a conjecture consistent with our

model. Indeed, notice that the coefficient on the interaction term “Latin America X Projected

% Population 65+ in 2025” (significant at the 10% level) is now of the “wrong” sign,

suggesting that demographics play very little (in fact, a negative) role in Latin American

reforms. On the other hand, the strong “Latin American” intercept could reflect other fixed



                                              42
factors in Latin America outside of our model. The coefficient on the interaction term “Latin

America X Historic Instability” is of the “correct” sign but has a corresponding p value

around 15.5, making it significant at the 16% level, outside of conventional levels.

       For additional robustness, Column (5) of Table 6 shows a version of “Large

Reformers” reported in Column (4) of Table 5 combined with “Latin America 2” reported in

Column (4) of Table 6. The coefficient on the pure “Latin American” intercept is reduced in

half (1.31) and is now barely significant at the 5% level. The interaction of “Latin America X

Historic Instability” is now significant at the 10.7% level, just outside our normal threshold.

The demographics interaction term is now insignificant (and still of the “wrong” sign).



4.4    Why did unstable countries create social security systems in the first place?

       Our analysis is confronted with the following question: why were social security

systems, which were eventually fundamentally reformed, created in the first place? The

answer appears to lie in the fact that many social security systems did not originate for the

median voter’s benefit, but rather to help the ruling autocratic regime consolidate power by

redistributing resources toward powerful, focused stakeholders. Only over time did more

progressive political changes enable the will of the median voter that led to their unraveling.

       Indeed, many social security systems started with pension schemes for the military,

civil service, and other elites vital to support the perpetuation of an authoritarian regime. In

these autocratic regimes, instability provides the impetus to create, and even expand, the

social security system in an attempt to shore up political power. As Mesa-Lago argues:

       “…social security in Latin America has often been manipulated to gain the electoral support

       of a particular clientele, to legitimate a spurious political regime, and to satisfy the needs and

       coopt powerful pressure groups which threaten the status quo”. (Mesa-Lago 1978)

                                                  43
As documented by Mesa-Lago, early social security regimes in Chile, Uruguay, Peru,

Argentina and Mexico were actually highly regressive, non-democratic schemes aimed at

redistributing wealth to a narrow political elite including the military and civil service.

       We can investigate the authoritative origins of social security systems with our own

dataset. Figure 5 shows that among countries that eventually reformed there exists a positive

correlation between authoritarianism and political instability at the time of inception of the

social security system, indicating that authoritarian regimes did indeed engage in the creation

of systems that were highly likely to eventually fail, for the purpose of shoring up political

support. In contrast, in Figure 6 there is no such correlation between authoritarianism and

political instability at the time of social security program inception among countries that did

not eventually reform.

The graph shows a negative relationship between the degree of political freedom at the time of the creation of the social security system,
and the degree of instability in that country. For reforming countries, the more unstable the country, the more autocratic the regime that
brought the social security system into place. The estimated slope coefficient is -0.903 and the relationship is not statistically significant at
conventional levels, with a p-value of 0.126.

The graph shows a slight positive relationship between the degree of political freedom at the time of the creation of the social security
system, and the degree of instability in that country. For non-reforming countries, there appears to be little relationship between the degree
of autocracy and the degree of instability at the time of social security system origin. The slope coefficient of the best-fit line is 0.338 and
the relationship is not statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.497.




5.                             Conclusions

                               Fundamental reform of social security systems from traditional pay-as-you-go

defined benefit systems toward defined-contribution accounts represents one of the most

important fiscal policy changes worldwide during the past century. The motivation for

reform has been previously unclear, especially since the traditional pension model possesses

favorable characteristics along several meaningful fronts. Even less clear is why these

reforms have been larger in developing countries facing less severe demographic problems.

We propose a simple model of “intergenerational trust” model that is consistent with these

                                                                      46
stylized facts. The model generates fundamental (large) reforms in the face of political

instability that are largely not demographically driven. Smaller reforms, however, can also

emerge, which are mostly driven by demographics. Empirical analysis is provided that seems

to support the basic tenets of the model. However, we interpret our evidence with some

caution. Ethnographic country case studies could provide useful complementary analysis in

the future.

Appendix B: Modeling the share of pension payments attributable to the personal accounts


       Some countries, like Chile, have replaced their entire pension system with private

accounts, while other countries have chosen to retain significant elements of their existing public

pension systems and use private accounts as a supplementary source of retirement income. We

construct an actuarial model of the future share of pension payments that will be derived from

the privatized portion of the social security system. This produces a scaled reform variable that

ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating that 100% of future pension payments in that country will

come from private accounts. We model all countries with private account reforms in our dataset.

       First, we collected the published rules of the private account system and the

complementary public pension system after reform. These rules include the contribution rates to

the private and public pension system, the retirement age, and the payout formulas used for the

public pension system (Social Security Programs Throughout the World, Various Editions).

Next, we obtain detailed data on the income distribution of the country, and life expectancy by

gender (WDI World Development Indicators 2004). We use the income distribution data to

construct country wages by income percentile, and then model contributions into a private

account for a typical worker of a given income percentile. At retirement, the worker’s private

account, with compounded returns, is used to buy an annuity. The cost of the annuity is

actuarially calculated based on the country-specific life table. The annual value of the annuity is

the yearly income attributable to the private account component of the pension system. We add

to this annuity the annual value of the payment provided by the public component of the pension

system, as determined by the rules of the country’s public pension system, to obtain the total

annual income available to the worker at retirement. The percentage of this total value which is

derived from the private account component is the scaled reform variable, which ranges from 0

for no reform to 1, representing 100% reforms with all retirement income derived from the


                                                51
private accounts. Since contribution rates may differ by income by country, we perform this

calculation at different income percentiles for each country, and obtain the average scaled reform

percentage, which corresponds closely to the percentage of income derived from private

accounts for the median wage earner.

         A simplified structural representation of our modeling process is given by:

         REFORMPCTi = PRIVATEPENSIONi / [PRIVATEPENSIONi + GOVTPENSIONi]

Where:

REFORMPCTi = The percentage of retirement income from private account sources for a

representative retiree in income percentile i (subsequently appropriately weighted to determine

the average country-wide percentage of retirement income from private account sources)

GOVTPENSIONi = Sum of annual country-specific government-administered, publicly financed

transfer payments including specific old age welfare programs and minimum pension guarantees,

to a representative retiree in income percentile i

PRIVATEPENSIONi = Value of the annuity purchased with accumulated private account

contributions by the representative retiree in income percentile i:




where:

         PRIVATEτ = Private account contribution tax rate

         INCOMEX%t = Annual labor income at the Xth percentile of wages in period t

         R = Real rate of return on private account funds, set to 3%

         T = Labor Income Periods till Retirement Age (assuming working life begins at age 20)



         Note that our modeling process differs by country due to structural differences such as

the country’s tax rates on retirement income (if any), contribution ceilings, floors, and caps,

                                                 52
guaranteed minimum income plans, and the like. Two major pension system features and their

modeling decisions are given below:



Redistributive Payments: Many countries explicitly include redistributive elements in their

pension systems. These often take the form of a minimum pension guarantee or other old-age

transfers. These transfers are financed by the government, and thus are excluded from

calculations of the private system’s share of overall pension payments, even when the transfer is

paid out ‘through’ the private system. In general, redistributive elements will decrease the share

of pensions attributable to the private system when the income distribution of the country is such

that a large number of workers will likely qualify for redistributive payments.



Voluntary Participation / Switching Between Systems: Under some systems, workers have a

choice of participating in the new system or old system, or even of switching between new and

old systems at certain times. Generally, this choice of participation is limited by age group, so

older workers have the ability to opt-in while younger workers generally must switch to the new

system. For simplicity, for all reforms that include age-related opt-outs, we assume that the

system is fully transitioned to younger workers when modeling private system payouts.

However, for reforms that give workers the ability to continuously choose which system to

participate in, we model the NPV of each system choice for a representative worker of that

income group, and have the worker choose the system which offers them the higher NPV at that

point in time.



The spreadsheets used in calculating each country’s scaled reform variable are available from the

authors.

                          Political Regime Characteristics and Transitions, 1800-2006
                          database. DURABLE is a country by year level observation that
                          indicates the number of years since the last regime change in that
                          country. Instability measures the number of times, since the creation
                          of that country’s public pension system, that DURABLE reaches 5.
                          Thus, Instability is higher for countries with frequent regime changes.

Historic Democracy        Based on the POLITY2 variable from the Polity IV Project database.
                          POLITY2 is a country by year level observation that ranges from +10
                          (strongly democratic) to -10 (strongly autocratic). Historic
                          Democracy is the average historical POLITY2 score for the period
                          between the creation of that country’s public pension system, and the
                          year of reform or the year 2003, whichever comes first.
WDI: Domestic Credit      Based on FSASTPRVTGDZS from the World Development
to Private Sector, % of   Indicators 2005 database from the World Bank. Domestic Credit to
GDP                       Private Sector refers to financial resources provided to the private
                          sector, such as through loans, purchases of nonequity securities, and
                          trade credits and other accounts receivable that establish a claim for
                          repayment. For some countries these claims include credit to public
                          enterprises. Domestic Credit to Private Sector is divided by country’s
                          GDP and expressed as a multiple of GDP.
WDI: Annual               Based on SPDYNLE00IN from the World Development Indicators
Interpolated and          2005 database. SPDYNLE00IN is a country by year observation
Extrapolated Life         indicating that country’s current life expectancy at birth. Due to data
Expectancy                continuity problems, we interpolate and extrapolate this variable to
                          form a continuous series.
