This paper surveys recent literature examining the relationship between environmental amenities and
urban growth. In this survey, we focus on the role of both exogenous attributes such as climate and
coastal access as well as endogenous attributes such as local air pollution and green space. A city’s
greenness is a function of both its natural beauty and is an emergent property of the types of households
and firms that locate within its borders and the types of local and national regulations enacted by voters.

We explore four main issues related to sustainability and environmental quality in cities. First, we
introduce a household locational choice model to highlight the role that environmental amenities play
in shaping where households locate within a city. We then analyze how ongoing suburbanization
affects the carbon footprint of cities. Third, we explore how the system of cities is affected by urban
environmental amenity dynamics and we explore the causes of these dynamics. Fourth, we review
the recent literature on the private costs and benefits of investing in “green” buildings. Throughout
this survey, we pay careful attention to empirical research approaches and highlight what are open
research questions. While much of the literature focuses on cities in the developed world, we anticipate
that similar issues will be of increased interest in developing nation’s cities.

   I.      Introduction


        Both within cities and across cities, non-market amenities are an important determinant

of where people choose to live and work.      While we now spend more time on line as we shop

on Amazon, socialize on Facebook and Twitter, stream movies from Netflix and telecommute

from home, our physical location continues to define what place based attributes we enjoy and

the environmental conditions to which we are exposed.

        Certain locational attributes such as rivers and ocean ports that were once key

determinants of local productivity now play a central role as amenities offering unique views as

well as recreational and climate amenities. Today the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park on the south

tip of Manhattan is selling apartments for over $1,300 a square foot. This price premium

reflects the desirability of waterfront real estate in modern Manhattan. A majority of the U.S

population and income is clustered in counties within 80 km of a coast or Great Lake (Rappaport

and Sachs 2002). This concentration of economic activity along the coasts and major rivers is a

function of both the historical persistence of early settlement patterns and the key role that

transportation access played in determining the locations of early waves of industrial activity

(Bleakley and Lin 2012).

        The persistence of these coastal patterns today is in no small part supported by the

environmental amenities conveyed by proximity to rivers and coasts and the climate amenities

enjoyed by those living on or near the coast. In coastal cities such as Los Angeles, richer people

consistently live close to the beach and thus there has been less suburbanization of income than

in non-coastal metropolitan areas (Lee and Lin 2013).




                                                                                                   3
       Today, non-market amenities such as clean air, green spaces, temperate climate and safe

streets help fuel the modern consumer city (Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz 2000, Rappaport 2009).

Consumer preferences for these amenities draw wealthier individuals to attractive locations. A

trend that is reinforced by employers (much freer of resource and transportation related

locational constraints than were their predecessors) who choose to locate in high amenity

locations as a way to be more attractive to potential employees. At the same time that cities such

as London and San Francisco are experiencing sharp increases in their home prices, there are

other cities such as Las Vegas and Phoenix whose population levels continue to grow. Even

though these places are not blessed with naturally high levels of amenities, millions of people are

expressing a desire to live in such cities. Home prices and wages adjust in the spatial

equilibrium and the diverse population and firms sorts across space. While some middle class

households will be disappointed that they cannot afford coastal housing, there will be other

households with a taste for large new housing who are quite willing to live in an affordable city

such as Las Vegas.

       At any point in time, a geographic area’s environmental attributes are a function of

exogenous geography and determined by the (intended and unintended) choices made by the set

of households, voters and industries that cluster within the city. Households and firms tradeoff

the private benefits of a specific location’s attributes versus what they must pay in rents to locate

there. Given that higher quality neighborhoods and cities will require a rent premium means

that such areas self-select a subset of households and firms to locate there. Expensive high

amenity areas such as Berkeley, California and Portland, Oregon attract highly educated

individuals. The Tiebout sorting of like-minded progressive environmentalists attracts local firms

who cater to such consumers (i.e organic farmers markets). The net effect is that green cities



                                                                                                    4
emerge due to both selection and treatment effects. Cities such as San Francisco feature few dirty

heavy industries. Instead, the “golden goose” for these high quality of life cities tends to be high

tech companies who, in turn, employ workers who demand high quality local amenities. Such

worker/voters support local leaders who enact policies that further enhance local quality of life

and this process feeds on itself as a type of social multiplier effect (Sieg et. al. 2004, Bayer,

Ferreira and McMillan 2007).

       This causal link between exogenous amenities (i.e San Francisco’s unique coastal beauty)

and endogenous amenities (San Francisco becoming a center of green living) is one of the main

themes of this chapter. These synergies pose a challenge for empirical research seeking to

measure the marginal willingness to pay for individual local public goods such as air quality

improvements. As one local public good improves (perhaps due to local deindustrialization) this

will induce a re-sorting of heterogeneous households and firms such that several aspects of local

quality of life will be affected (Kuminoff, Smith and Timmins 2013). Our survey investigates

different approaches for addressing this issue.

       We explore four main issues related to sustainability and environmental quality in cities.

First, we introduce a household locational choice model to highlight the role that environmental

amenities play in shaping where households locate within a city. We discuss how four major

recent changes in U.S cities; improvements in air quality, rising demand for open space,

brownfield remediation and improvements in center city quality of life influence where and how

densely different income groups live within metro areas. Second, we analyze how ongoing

suburbanization affects the carbon footprint of cities. Whether this association between

suburbanization and carbon production, represents a causal effect remains an open question. We

discuss various identification strategies for convincingly answering this question.



                                                                                                       5
       Third, we explore the causes and consequences of urban environmental amenity

dynamics. A city’s production of pollution depends on its demographics, industrial structure

shifts and the local and national policies that are adopted. As local public goods shift over time

(i.e Pittsburgh’s air quality improves) we seek to understand how such amenity dynamics affect

the cross-city spatial equilibrium. Unlike standard hedonic analyses, we discuss the cross-city

sorting of both households and firms and the role that environmental amenities play in this

locational decision. We explore how new local and federal policies (i.e local zoning and

differential enforcement of the Clean Air Act) affect the spatial equilibrium and we study how

the emerging new risk of climate change and the resulting increase in summer temperature and

sea level rise for coastal cities affects the system of cities. Any change in local public goods

introduces distributional effects. We explore the economic incidence of changes in quality of

life in different cities and their implications for the well-being of rich, middle class and poor

urbanites.

       While much of the empirical quality of life literature has focused on the United States, we

argue that these same issues arise in developing countries as economic development increases

the demand for non-market amenities. This section ends by discussing open research questions

set in the developing world.

       Finally, we review the recent literature on the private costs and benefits of investing in

“green buildings”. In the developing world today, billions of people are moving to cities. Such

cities are constructing new residential and commercial real estate that will last for decades.

Given that buildings are major consumers of electricity, it is important to understand how urban

real estate developers, investors and real estate tenants demand electricity because these




                                                                                                    6
decisions have key implications for greenhouse gas production and thus the severity of future

climate change.




    II.      Incorporating Local and Global Environmental Externalities into Locational

             Equilibrium Models


          In this section, we present an equilibrium locational choice model to study the role that

location specific environmental amenities play in determining who lives in a given area. The

model melds ideas from earlier work including Ellickson (1971), Stull (1974), Epple and Platt

(1998), Epple and Sieg (1999), Sieg et.al. (2004A, 2004B) and Banzhaf and Walsh (2008).


          Assume there exists a continuum of households of measure N that are characterized by

their income y, the distribution of which is given by f(y) which has continuous support over the

interval [yl, yh]. In cases where income heterogeneity is of second order concern we will often

assume that [yl, yh] =      such that all households share the same income level. Location choices

are discretized and each household must choose to live in one of J discrete locations within the

metropolitan area1, indexed by j ∈{1,..., J } . Conditional on location choice, households then

choose their optimal level of land to consume.2




1
  Note, that in some models, locations are modeled as continuously varying along certain amenity attributes. The
canonical example of this approach being the basic monocentric city model which describes continuously varying
locations in terms of their distance from the Central Business District.
2
  Alternatively, one could assume that land is used as one input in the production of housing with, for instance, a
constant returns to scale technology. However, while tractable, this approach adds an extra notational burden
without changing the general intuition that the model provides relative to the role of prices and incomes in
determining population density.

                                                                                                                      7
            Household preferences are represented by the indirect utility function

    V(y,Pj,Zj), where     is the price of a unit of housing at location j and                  ,…,

    is a vector of amenities available uniquely to households that choose to live at location

    j. This vector consists of local public goods that are and are not related to the

    environment. It includes exogenous environmental locational attributes such as

    distance to beaches and climate and endogenous environmental amenities such as

    pollution and protected open space. The elements of             also include access to

    employment opportunities and non-environmental amenities such as crime and school

    quality.3 Finally, each location within the metropolitan area is characterized by a

    continuous housing supply function Sj(P).4 This is a very general specification which

    imbeds the basic monocentric city model, theoretical sorting models such as those

    considered by Epple & Platt (1998) and Walsh & Banzhaf (2008), as well as the

    empirical framework pioneered by Epple & Sieg (1999).

           In equilibrium, the sorting of income types across locations will depend on the

    income elasticities for land and locational amenities. Equilibrium in the model is defined

    by a vector of allocation functions            which identify the proportion of each income

    type living in each location and a vector of J location-specific housing prices which satisfy

    the locational equilibrium conditions:


3
  The specification of V(.) also implicitly assumes the inclusion of a numeraire whose price is normalized to 1. For
tractability V(.) is assumed to be continuous with bounded first derivatives that satisfy: Vy > 0, VZ > 0, VP < 0. For
simplicity, we assume that indirect utility function is specified such that the associated land demand function is
independent of amenity levels Z and is given by D(P,y) which is also continuous with bounded first derivatives Dy >
0 and Dp < 0. Demand is assumed to be strictly positive and bounded from above.
4
  The supply function describes what portion of a location’s available land will be committed to residential
use at a given price. We assume that there exist residual competing demands for land at each location, and
that there is one special competing use (i.e. agricultural production) for which there is completely elastic
demand for land at any price at or below the reservation price . Thus, the supply of land for residential use
at a given location is equal to zero for any price at or below . At prices above residential land supply is
increasing to an upper bound of .

                                                                                                                    8
               , ,               ,   ,         ∀ ,    ∀                        0              i

         N             ,                                    ∀                                 ii

           ∑                 1∀                                                               iii

Condition i requires that in equilibrium no household would be strictly better of choosing a

different location. Condition ii requires that the housing market clear in each location. And,

condition iii requires that each household is assigned to a specific location.5

         As specified, the model is still quite general. Further simplicity can be gained by

assuming that the vector of amenities                can be collapsed into an index such that

     , ,               , ,               and         0∀ . Under this assumption, locations are

vertically differentiated with all households agreeing on the relative ranking of “quality”

across locations. This assumption when combined with equilibrium condition i requires

that housing prices be strictly increasing in the amenity index .6

         As specified, the model is still too general to make predictions regarding income sorting.

In general, sorting will depend on the relationship between income and the marginal (indirect)

utilities of G and P (       and         ). To facilitate a characterization of the equilibrium sorting of

5
  Note that the discreteness of locations can be easily relaxed by instead indexing location by a continuous variable
  , i.e. distance to the CBD and then adjusting conditions ii and iii as follows. First, the functions that are indexed by
j become functions of j (i.e.        becomes       , ). Second , in condition ii,         must be replaced by
where           is the supply of housing per unit land at continuous location j and       is the amount of land per unit of
  available at location (if the “city” is a one unit wide strip of land emanating out of the CBD and indexes
distance from the CBD then this collapses to           ). Finally, in condition iii the sum is replaced by an integral over
the entire support of , ∈         ,        1.
6
  To offer stronger predictions about the sorting of individuals by income, the model as presented here, limits
household heterogeneity to the single dimension of income. Epple and Platt (1998) incorporate heterogeneity in
tastes for the overall public good level G into a similar model. They show that under a modified single-crossing
concept which considers both a taste parameter and income that stratification occurs with all individuals of a given
taste level sorting by income and all individuals with a given level of income sorting based on the strength of their
preferences for public goods. Empirical models have generalized this framework to incorporate heterogeneity in
tastes for specific attributes and specific locations by incorporating random coefficients on the elements of the G-
index and adding an idiosyncratic location parameter which is typically assumed to have a logit distribution. These
analyses then build on the canonical Random Utility Framework developed by Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes (1995).
For an overview of this literature, see Kuminoff et. al. (2013).

                                                                                                                         9
households across communities, we require further restrictions on preferences. A common

assumption made in these models is that preferences satisfy the "single crossing" property. This

condition requires that the slope of an indirect indifference curve in the (G, P) plane,     , be

monotonic in income. Intuitively, this assumption implies that willingness to pay for the amenity


bundle is either increasing                  0 or decreasing                    0 in income.


         Focusing on the increasing case, single crossing guarantees that equilibrium can be

characterized by an ordering of locations that is increasing in both P and G. For each pair of

"neighboring" locations (as sorted by this ranking), there will exist a set of boundary households

(uniquely identified by income level) that are indifferent between the two locations. Households

whose income is below the boundary location will prefer the lower-ordered location, and those

whose income is above the boundary income will prefer the higher-ordered location. This leads

to perfect income stratification of households across locations based on their level of the amenity

index.


         The basic model as specified has implications for how spatial heterogeneity in locational

attributes affects the spatial distribution of households and the income distribution across the

city. To illustrate the basic machinery of the model, consider the case where households care

about just two locational amenities, access to employment locations and environmental quality.

Suppose for instance that employment is at a single factory located at the CBD and that the

factory’s pollution mostly lands on residential areas closer to the city center, while areas further

from the city center are exposed to less of the factory’s pollution. This differential pollution

exposure implies that residential locations vary in two dimensions (commute times and

environmental quality) both of which are a function of distance to the CBD and under our index

                                                                                                    10

                                                                                              0       (1)


 In a continuous expression of the problem, the actual rent gradient at a given distance from the

 Where         and     are evaluated at the income of individuals who choose to live distance x from

          If we assume that pollution levels drop relatively quickly beyond some specified distance

 from the CBD, then the overall amenity index and its two component parts will be as presented

model also predicts that prices will be highest in this location and that the richest individuals in

the community will locate at this point; with incomes dropping as we move either into the CBD

or towards the urban fringe and the lowest income individuals locating at the CBD. Predictions

regarding population density are more nuanced. In equilibrium, prices will be highest at locations

where amenity levels (G-index) are highest. Ceteris paribus, higher prices lead to lower lot

sizes. Thus, at the intensive margin and working through the price channel, higher levels of

environmental quality (and amenities in general) serve to increase the density of development.

However, at the extensive margin, high income households tend to sort into the high amenity

locations. Ceteris paribus, these high income households will demand relatively larger

residential lots. Thus, there is an income channel through which environmental amenities can

effectuate lower housing densities.


       This dichotomy between price and income effects is particularly important for

understanding the potential impact of zoning restrictions on density. In high amenity locations,

high potential rents create a strong incentive for developers to build up (generate more square

footage of living space per unit of land input). By magnifying the relative importance of the

price effect, the potential for building up increases the probability that the net effect of amenities

will be to increase density. However, it is precisely these high environmental amenity locations

that tend to experience restrictive zoning regulations designed to prevent dense development.


       The shape of the income distribution also plays an important role in determining the

relative density outcomes in high G locations. If there is limited income heterogeneity then the

income sorting channel will be attenuated and price effects will dominate, leading to

densification around high amenity locations. Conversely, in the face of large degrees of income

heterogeneity, if the super-rich have a high willingness to pay for large homes in high amenity

                                                                                                       12
areas then we would expect to see large lots and relatively low density development in high

amenity areas - as the income sorting channel dominates the price channel.


   A. Emerging Within City Environmental Trends


        We now examine several environmental dynamics playing out across urban areas and

explore how these supply side changes affect the spatial distribution of economic activity within

cities. An overarching recent trend in the urban environment is the improvement in central city

quality of life on both environmental and non-environmental dimensions. This trend has

important implications for the long-run suburbanization trend. We first consider the literature on

three specific environmental components of this change (air quality, open space and brownfields

clean-up) before returning to the issue of central city quality of life in general.


   i.      Improving Air Quality

        The stylized example presented in figure 1 above highlights the potential role that air

pollution could play in shaping the spatial structure of cities. Historically, the combination of

urbanization, industrialization and a heavy reliance on coal in both manufacturing and residential

uses led to extreme pollution problems (Barreca, Clay and Tarr 2014). The “London Fog” made

news in the United States as early as 1879 (Stradling and Thorsheim 1999). Eighty years later,

the Great Smog of 1952 was responsible for the death as many as 12,000 Londoners (Clay and

Troesken 2010). Thus, local air pollution has been a major component of the spatial amenity

landscape. Perhaps nowhere are the tradeoffs between commute time and air pollution better

illustrated than in the East End neighborhoods of late 19th century Pittsburgh. By the late 1800s

the city’s industrial success had led to such severe air pollution problems that it was famously

referred to by James Parton as “hell with the lid taken off” (Tarr 2003). The air pollution created



                                                                                                    13
a situation where “society was forced to flee to the freer air of the East End.” (Nevin 1888). This

environmental haven, separated from the mill-laden rivers by surrounding hillsides, became the

location of choice for both the city’s and the nation’s elite. By 1900, residents of this

neighborhood, located five miles from downtown Pittsburgh, controlled as much as 60% of

America’s productive assets (Skrabec 2010).

        Over the last few decades there has been a sharp reduction in U.S urban air pollution.

Smith (2012) documents that U.S. air pollution (as measured by ambient PM10) has fallen by

roughly 50% between the early 1960s and 2008. Similar progress in documented in Germany

and Spain. In spite of these improvements, there continues to be strong empirical support for

the role that air pollution variation plays in determining the spatial structure within cities. A

voluminous set of hedonic studies demonstrate that air quality capitalizes into housing prices

suggesting that it belongs in the locational equilibrium model’s amenity vector.8 Further, direct

reduced form evidence regarding the role of air pollution in household location decisions is

provided by Banzhaf and Walsh (2008). These authors first show that the locational equilibrium

model in general predicts increases in both density and income when amenity levels increase at a

single location. They then test these density and income predictions vis-à-vis air pollution by

evaluating the impact of changes in the scale and existence of sources of toxic air pollution that

occurred in California between 1990 and 2000.

        Their work broadly supports both the density and income predictions of the model. On

density, they find that removing exposure to polluting facilities increased population density on

the order of 5% while adding new exposure led to a drop in population density of similar

magnitudes. This density result is likely driven by two related factors. First, working through

8
 Smith and Huang (1995) summarize 37 studies that used hedonic property analysis to evaluate the housing price
effects of air pollution. Zabel and Kiel (2000) and Kim et.al. (2003) present additional hedonic studies of air
pollution valuation.

                                                                                                                  14
the price channel, reductions in pollution provide incentives for developers to develop more

intensely and households to consume less square footage. Second, removal of polluting facilities

provides an opportunity to re-develop the land into residential use. This process is re-enforced

by the newly increased land prices. In terms of the spatial distribution of households of various

income levels, new exposure to toxic air pollution was associated with a drop in a

neighborhood’s average annual household income of $1,000 or more. Conversely the loss of

exposure to polluting facilities was estimated to lead to concomitant increases in income.

       While this research provides reduced form evidence of the potential importance of air

pollution in the locational equilibrium framework, such studies do not explicitly model how

different households respond to exogenous changes in air pollution. A recent residential sorting

literature has sought to test how the spatial distribution of households within a city is affected by

regulation induced changes in the spatial distribution of pollution. Do richer people now move

to areas that have experienced a quality of life improvement? A handful of studies have

attempted to estimate locational equilibrium models of household location that directly

incorporate spatial heterogeneity in air quality. The first such efforts are reported in Sieg et.al.

(2004a 2004b). These authors estimate a locational equilibrium model for the greater Los

Angeles Metropolitan Area that incorporates spatial heterogeneity in ozone concentrations. They

then use the estimated model to compute a counterfactual equilibrium which describes the

predicted sorting of households of different income levels across 92 different neighborhoods

located in five different southern California counties, under the assumption that ozone levels

were what they would have been (as estimated by the Environmental Protection Agency) if the

Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) had never occurred.




                                                                                                       15

       To highlight the potential importance of accounting for equilibrium sorting when

evaluating non-marginal changes in locational amenities. Table 1 reproduces Sieg et.al.’s

estimates of the county-level impacts of the CAAA. Consider for instance the average

household that would have located in Los Angeles County in a baseline no-CAAA state of the

world. The first 3 columns of the table report the impact of the CAAA on ozone levels, prices

and the G-Index in their baseline county (Los Angeles). On average, implementation of the

CAAA was predicted to provide a 9.40% improvement in Los Angeles County’s ozone pollution

and drop average housing prices by 0.20% (as we discuss below, this price drop arises from the

fact that Los Angeles County saw small improvements in air quality relative to overall regional

improvements). The 9.40% ozone improvement was associated with an overall 2.30% increase

in average G-Index levels. However, in assessing the impact of the CAAA on individual

households, it is necessary to account for the fact that household’s move when the spatial

distribution of amenities changes. The last two columns of the table account for these

movements and report the change in price and G-index predicted to be actually experienced by

households in the post-CAAA locational equilibrium as opposed to the baseline no-CAAA

equilibrium (i.e. accounting for the relocation of those households who choose different locations

under the two different two locational equilibria). In general, under the post-CAAA equilibrium,



                                                                                                  16
households tended to sort out of their initial Los Angeles County neighborhoods and into

neighborhoods that saw slightly smaller amenity increases (2.00% vs. 2.30%) and slightly larger

price decreases (-0.60% vs. -0.20%). In some instances, the impact of sorting can be quite large.

For instance, this analysis predicts that, on average, individuals who initially live in Ventura

County will experience a public goods change that is actually four times as large as that

experienced at the average household location in Ventura County.

         These differences can be extremely important when considering the distribution of

welfare from a given policy. For instance in this example, the partial equilibrium estimate of the

average Ventura County household’s willingness to pay for these air quality improvements is

only $21 per year, while the general equilibrium estimate, which accounts for relocation, is $539

per year. Table 1 also highlights the importance of relative improvements in evaluating the price

effects of environmental improvements. While all counties experienced overall air quality

improvements, because those that experienced lower levels of improvement became relatively

less attractive, they actually are predicted to experience price decreases in the new equilibrium.9

It is important to note that this research assumed that Los Angeles was a closed economy and

that the improvement in local air quality did not accelerate population growth of the region as a

whole. Future research might examine intra-metropolitan area and inter-metropolitan area

choice within a unified framework. In an open economy, it is likely to be the case that even

those areas with the lowest relative gains in air quality will still experience accelerated economic

growth.




9
 While not reported in the Sieg et. al. 2004 paper, these relative changes in amenity level can also expected to be
associated with changes in the distribution of income groups across the counties, with the average income of
households in the counties that experienced the largest improvements increasing.



                                                                                                                      17
       Two additional recent studies have also incorporated air pollution in a locational

equilibrium model. Tra (2010) utilizes a Random Utility Model (RUM) approach which

incorporates horizontal differentiation to analyze the impact of air pollution changes in the LA

metro area. The RUM framework uses a random coefficients framework that allows individual

households to place different weights on the various elements of the amenity index and

incorporates idiosyncratic tastes for specific locations. Tra’s results are generally consistent with

those of Sieg et.al. Bayer et.al. (2011) incorporate ozone pollution along with crime rates and

racial composition into a dynamic version of the Random Utility approach which they estimate

using data from the San Francisco Bay area. They find that on average, households would be

willing to pay $295 for a 10% decrease in the number of days that ozone levels exceeded the

state’s hourly standard.

       Applying such a structural approach to studying the valuation of air pollution in cities in

the developing world would be quite valuable. In the developing world, cities in China and India

feature extremely high levels of air pollution and within these cities there is substantial variation

in air pollution. Zheng and Kahn (2008) estimate hedonic real estate price regressions using the

price per square foot of new residential apartments built across Beijing from 2004 to 2006.

Controlling for a large number of attributes of the apartment and the neighborhood, they estimate

that a one microgram per cubic meter increase in PM10 is associated with a .5% reduction in

local home prices.

       One potentially fruitful area for future research is on the spatial distribution of air

pollution within cities. Today, regulators are paying greater attention to small particulates such

as PM2.5. Atmospheric chemistry studies have documented that “hot spots” exist close to major

highways in cities such as Los Angeles (see Hu et. al. 2010). If government regulations reduce



                                                                                                     18
such pollution, an important economic incidence issue arises. As particulate problems fall near

freeways, will renters in the area benefit or will they be priced out of their previously affordable

neighborhoods. If richer people move in, will the type of gentrification documented by Sieg et.

al. (2004) repeat itself so that the main winner from the local public goods improvement are the

local land owners?

             Some cities continue to have rent control and rent stabilization programs. For example,

there are fifteen cities in California who have rent control and these include Los Angeles and San

Francisco.10 Incumbents in such programs are less likely to be priced out of gentrifying

neighborhoods. In addition, developers in major cities are often asked to set aside a given

fraction such as 20% of units in new residential towers to be sold to lower income households.

In this sense, activist local government housing policy interacts with environmental dynamics

such that a subset of lower income households enjoy the gains of local amenity improvements

without facing sharp increases in rents.

       ii.      Preservation of Open Space


             Throughout the United States, many local governments have introduced publicly

financed efforts to purchase open space development rights. The intent of such legislation is to

preserve land for recreational and aesthetic purposes (Kotchen and Powers 2006, Banzhaf et.al.

2010). Such land set asides affect the spatial patterns of economic development within a

metropolitan area.


             Several researchers have considered the role that open space protection can play in

determining urban spatial structure. Most of this work has been theoretical in nature and largely

builds directly on monocentric city formalizations of locational equilibrium. Wu and Plantinga

10
     http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/appendix2.shtml.

                                                                                                       19
(2003) incorporate open space into a monocentric city model and find that land protection at the

urban fringe can lead to “leap frog” development as open space amenities increase the

desirability of land on the far side of the newly protected open space from the city center. Turner

(2005) considers open space in a dynamic version of the model that incorporates both urban and

suburban locations. He finds that in the presence of open space amenities more remote areas are

developed before more central areas. Following on arguments made by Bruekner (2000) about

potential market failures in the provision of open space, Bento et. al. (2006) develop a

computational monocentric city model that incorporates the amenity value of open space at the

urban fringe. Under this formulation, the market can lead to inefficiently large urban areas as

private developers fail to account for the decrease in utility experienced by extant city dwellers

due to increased distance to open space at the fringe.


       On the empirical front two papers have considered the issue of open space protection

and/or land regulation in a locational equilibrium framework. Walsh (2007) extends the

empirical approach developed by Epple and Sieg (2008) to structurally estimate a locational

equilibrium model of open space and housing markets in Wake County, North Carolina. The

model incorporates multiple employment centers and two types of open space, publicly owned

and privately held. Simulated versions of the model are used to undertake counterfactual

exercises which incorporate the endogenous nature of privately held open space – modeled

essentially as a residual land use. A key finding from this work is that public protection of open

space in a given location can lead to an overall decrease in a neighborhood’s overall (public +

private) provision of open space due to the acceleration of the conversion of privately held open

space which is attracted by the amenity created by the new public land.




                                                                                                     20
       A second notable empirical analysis is the work of Cheshire and Sheppard (2006). They

use hedonic methods to estimate implicit prices for “amenities produced by the planning system”

and then imbed these estimates in a modified monocentric city model that is calibrated to data for

the city of Reading in the United Kingdom. The fitted model is then used to calculate the gross

monetized value of planning by calculating the change in household expenditure functions

needed to hold utility constant under no planning counterfactual outcome—assuming that

without planning laws there would be no open space and that all industrial activity would be

equally distributed across the landscape. Working within the framework of the traditional urban

model allows Cheshire and Sheppard to implicitly incorporate general equilibrium adjustments

in their analysis. Their results suggest that there is a net loss from planning activities that may be

as high as 3.9% of annual incomes—with the largest positive benefits from these activities being

associated with the provision of accessible open space.


       In related work, Turner et al. (2014) use an innovative reduced form approach to evaluate

the impact of land use regulation on the price of undeveloped land. They distinguish between

three different channels: "own lot" effects measure the price effect associated with restrictions

that regulations place on the lot itself; "external effects" which capture the price impacts that

derive from restrictions on proximate land uses; and, supply effects which stem from the impact

that land use regulations have on equilibrium prices through their attenuating effect on the supply

of developed land. They find that a one standard deviation increase in land use regulation

decreases land value by about one third. They attribute the bulk of this effect to own and

external lot effects with a 2 to 3 percent decrease in developable area contributing the residual.


       Finally, we note that a large hedonic literature provides support for the claim that access

to open space amenities will lead to higher housing prices. McConnell and Walls (2005) review

                                                                                                     21
approximately 40 published articles that use hedonic methods to assess the capitalization of open

space into housing prices. They document capitalization of a wide variety of open space

amenities including: general open space, parks, and natural areas; greenbelts; wetlands;

urban/suburban forest preserves, and agricultural lands.


       iii.      Superfund, Brownfields and Industrial Site Remediation



              The legacy of more than a century of manufacturing activity is that many U.S cities

feature large numbers of past industrial sites. These areas suffer from toxic releases and severe

localized damage to the land and nearby water (Sigman 2001). The most toxic of these sites

have been placed on the National Priorities List (NPL) and have been targeted for clean-up by

the Environmental Protection Agency through the Federal Superfund program. In 1982 an initial

400 sites were place on the NPL. Today there are more than 1300 sites on the NPL (US GAO

2013). These sites are however only the tip of the iceberg. The U.S. Government Accounting

Office estimates that there are additionally between 450,000 and 1 million brownfield sites in the

U.S. While not as toxic as NPL sites, redevelopment or re-use of these sites is complicated by

the presence or potential presence of hazardous wastes and can sit abandoned or unused.(US

GAO 2005) A large literature documents that property values are negatively impacted by

proximity to NPL sites (see Kiel 1995, Kiel and Williams 2007).11

              As noxious industrial sites are cleaned up, what happens to urban form and the spatial

distribution of real estate prices? Two recent studies are of particular interest. Greenstone and

Gallagher (2008) examine how tract-level median household values respond to the clean-up of

NPL sites. They compare housing price growth in areas surrounding the first 400 hazardous


11
     A summary of these findings can be found in Sigman and Stafford (2011) and USEPA (2009).

                                                                                                       22
waste sites added to the NPL and thus slated for Superfund clean-up to housing price changes in

the areas surrounding the 290 sites that narrowly missed qualifying for the NPL. Greenstone and

Gallagher (2008) implement an instrumental variables approach that embeds a type of regression

discontinuity design. The discontinuity arises from the fact that, while all 690 of these sites were

scored with an index number representing their level of priority for clean-up, EPA subsequently

set an arbitrary score cut-off for listing based on the agency’s projection that it could afford to

clean 400 sites. Their main outcome equation relates changes in census tract home prices over

time to whether the site was designated as a NPL site.



        ∆                                              ∗         ∗                    (3)



Greenstone and Gallagher (2008) instrument for the NPL Site listing dummy using a dummy

that equals one if the site’s hazardous ranking score (HRS) exceeded 28.5 at the baseline.

       Based on this research design; Gallagher and Greenstone (2008) conclude that Superfund

listing has little to no effect on local median housing value changes. More recently, Gamper-

Rabindran and Timmins (2012) revisit the Greenstone and Gallagher results and find a positive

impact of clean-up on prices. The main reason for this difference in findings is that, while

Greenstone and Gallagher evaluated the impact of a site being listed for clean-up, Gamper-

Rabindran and Timmins focus on deletion from the NPL which occurs after clean-up is actually

completed. Thus, Greenstone and Gallagher are measuring the impact of providing information

that a site has been designated as a NPL site and may be cleaned up in the future while Gamper-

Rabindran and Timmins are measuring the impact of the actual clean-up. As of August 2014,




                                                                                                      23
there were 1318 sites listed as NPL sites and 383 deleted sites on the Superfund list.12 These

data suggest that not all listed sites are cleaned up and this raises an expectations issue namely if

and when in the future will the clean-up actually occur. Home buyers are likely to have

different expectations over these random variables and this will affect their bidding for housing

near such sites.

           Gamper-Rabindran and Timmins also document that the use of tract-level data can mask

important within-tract variation in exposure. They show that a clean-up has a larger effect in the

lower portions of the within-tract housing price distribution and use house level data to show that

cheaper houses within an exposed census tract tend to be located closer to the NPL site.


           Less toxic brownfield sites have also been studied. Three recent studies are of particular

note. Currie et. al. (forthcoming) geocode housing sales data from five states (Texas,

New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Florida covering the years 1998 to 2005. They use

data from the Toxic Release Inventory to identify facilities that release toxic emissions and they

use micro data from the Longitudinal Business Database to identify the births and deaths of these

toxic plants. Their paper measures the housing market and health impacts of 1,600 openings and

closings of industrial plants that emit toxic pollutants. They find that housing values within

one mile decrease by 1.5 percent when plants open, and increase by 1.5 percent when plants

close.

           Second, Taylor et.al. (2012) study 105 sites in the Minneapolis metropolitan area, the

majority of which are located in the urban core. A major innovation of this work is that they

study the difference between clean industrial sites and toxic sites and note the high level of

spatial correlation between specific contaminated sites and commercial and industrial sites in


12
     See http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/.

                                                                                                    24
general. They argue that it is important to control for this potentially confounding factor. They

document that proximity to clean commercial sites (within .3 miles) lowers property values by

roughly 4.5% to 5.5%. Environmental contamination increases the negative impacts by

approximately 2.5% to 3.0%.          They find that once the site is remediated, the contamination

effect disappears.

           Third, Haninger et.al. (2014) evaluate the U.S. EPA’s brownfields Program which awards

grants for the redevelopment of brownfields. They utilize a variety of identification strategies to

evaluate a set of 327 brownfield sites that were nominated for clean-up – 197 of which were

awarded grants for clean-up and 130 were not. They non-parametrically identify a treatment

threshold of 2040 meters. Estimates of the price effect from clean-up range from 5% to 32%.

           A review of the recent literature argues for the presence of price effects associated with

close proximity to brownfields and polluted sites. These price effects suggest households are

sorting in response to these disamentities. However, from the perspective of the locational

equilibrium framework, one would also like to see more direct tests of sorting behavior. A

summary of the extant literature is provided in Banzhaf and McCormick (2007) and Noonan

(2005). The majority of this literature, going back to United Church of Christ (1987) documents

correlations between hazardous facilities and the presence of low-income/minority groups.

However, few of these studies explore the sorting behavior of individuals – instead viewing

siting decisions from an environmental justice perspective which focuses on correlations

between race/disadvantaged status and pollution. The handful of studies that have looked at

demographic changes related to citing or removal of toxic waste facilities have found mixed

results.13 It remains an open question of whether urban political leaders choose to locate



13
     See for instance Been (1994), Been and Gupta (1997), Wolverton (2009) and Cameron and McConnaha (2006).

                                                                                                           25
noxious facilities in minority residential communities or whether poor and minority households

choose to live close to such facilities because of the housing price discount.

       The recent hedonic research documenting the price appreciation in localized areas where

noxious sites are cleaned highlights that gentrification will take place in those neighborhoods.

The economic incidence is such that land owners in those areas will gain the most. Such hedonic

studies do not recover welfare estimates nor do they document changes in population density

over time. As a noxious site located in prime piece of center city real estate is remediated, it is

possible that the population density in the area will increase. In this sense the reclamation of

center city land can contribute to the center city resurgence documented in many U.S cities.



   B. Improving Quality of Life in the Center City


       In recent years, there have been sharp improvements in center city quality of life brought

about by several synergistic trends including; declines in center city crime (Levitt 2004,

Schwartz et. al 2003, improvements in urban air pollution (discussed above see Kahn and

Schwartz 2008, Wolff forthcoming), multi-billion dollar investments in rail transit systems that

transport people to the city center (Baum-Snow and Kahn 2005, Kahn 2007), major investments

in cleaning the nation’s downtown rivers, and waterways (Olmstead 2010), building bike lanes

and urban parks such as the Rose Kennedy Greenway (Tajima 2003).


       At the same time there have been emerging demographic trends such as more women

working in the labor force and thus delaying marriage and having fewer children (Goldin 2006).

Such households have less of a need to live in the school focused suburbs. At the industrial level

with manufacturing shrinking in its employment share, more people are working in the high tech

service sector and many of these industries gain from downtown locations. Such industries

                                                                                                      26
disproportionately hire highly educated people (Moretti 2012). All of these trends further

strengthen the central business district.


        Downtown environmental progress is likely to have played a key role in causing the

center city revival. While it is very difficult to parse out the individual effects of specific factors,

together these trends have strengthened center cities and have encouraged private developers to

make multi-billion dollar investments in new downtown real estate projects. The net effect of

these investments is to lead more and more people (especially young adults and older adults

whose kids are out of the house) to be willing to live downtown. In high amenity center cities

such as New York City and Paris, the rich have chosen to live in the center city (Brueckner,

Thisse, Zenou 1999, Brueckner and Rosenthal 2009).


        This center city resurgence has been studied in detail (Glaeser and Shapiro 2003, Glaeser

and Gottlieb 2006) and seems likely to continue. More and more mayors are prioritizing

reinventing their downtowns with a focus on beauty and promoting tourism around their

waterfronts (see Carlino and Saiz 2008). Examples range from Pittsburgh to Chicago to

Shanghai to Seoul. As center city quality of life improves, center city property values rise.

Compare Manhattan’s real estate prices in the bleak 1970s versus in Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s

Manhattan of 2012. By raising center city property values, property tax revenue rises and urban

leaders can finance more of their pet projects. It is no accident that New York City mayors

focused on enforcing dog poop laws, providing bike lanes and enforcing anti-smoking

ordinances. At a time when crime is falling sharply, time outdoors is a complementary activity

to clean air and safe streets.




                                                                                                      27
          As urban quality of life in center cities has improved, it has triggered gentrification in the

center cities and this in turn triggers private sector investments in upgrading buildings and

offering better restaurants and retail shopping (Waldfogel 2008). The geographic patterns of

upscale supermarkets with organic offerings, such as Whole Foods, are not surprising (see

Meltzer and Schuetz 2012).


          Whether this demand for downtown living leads millions of more people to live

downtown depends on the elasticity of downtown housing supply. Such studies as Glaeser,

Gyourko and Saks (2006) and in this Handbook Gyourko and Molloy (2015) highlight the

challenges in building more housing downtown. Kahn (2011) uses data from cities across

California and argues that more liberal cities are less likely to issue new housing permits. In

their study of Massachusetts cities, Glaeser and Ward (2009) conclude that cities with more

manufacturing and more minorities in 1940 are also associated with smaller minimum lot sizes.

If environmental quality rises in the center city but the housing supply is highly inelastic then

such demand will simply translate into higher downtown prices and the rich living downtown.

This proposition merits more research in urbanizing nations around the world. Brueckner and

Sidhar (2012) document that building height limits in India’s cities are contributing to suburban

growth. They document that cities with higher floor to area ratios are more compact.




   III.      Global Externalities Exacerbated by the Intra-Metro Area Locational Choice of

             Households and Firms


          The equilibrium sorting and hedonic models discussed above focus on the demand for

location specific attributes such as air pollution, a short commute, or good school access.


                                                                                                      28
Households have the right incentives to tradeoff such attributes against the market price they

must pay for homes located in such communities. However, equilibrium sorting models

typically ignore how a specific household’s locational choice has consequences for pollution

production. For example, if a household chooses to live close to public transit, such a household

may be more likely to use public transit more and drive less (Baum-Snow and Kahn 2005). In

aggregate, such locational choices reduce a city’s carbon footprint and help to reduce climate

change risk even though each individual household is small in terms of total greenhouse gas

production.


       Unlike localized environmental goods, changes in greenhouse gas emissions associated

with expanded urban footprints do not have any direct effect on the relative attractiveness of

different urban locations so this type of extension to the model essentially boils down to a

measurement challenge in which researchers attempt to measure the impact of different spatial

structures on greenhouse gas emissions.


       A standard claim in the popular media is that suburbanization has a large causal effect on

increasing driving and household electricity consumption. Such a result emerges from the

standard monocentric model. Suburban homes are far from the CBD’s jobs and far from public

transit. This leads such households to drive more miles. Since land prices fall with respect to

distance from the city center, suburbanites live in larger homes that use more electricity for basic

home functions such as air conditioning and leisure. Such suburban households live further

from public transit and are more likely to work in the suburbs. Together, these facts suggest that

they will drive more and consume more electricity than if they lived in the center city. These

activities will contribute to extra greenhouse gas production if the vehicle is fueled using

gasoline and if the home’s electricity is generated by coal and natural gas.

                                                                                                  29
        From a welfare and policy perspective, this discussion hinges on a failure to price the

externalities associated with energy consumption and production. For example, Parry and Small

(2005) estimate that internalizing gasoline consumption externalities in the U.S would require a

$1 increase in the gasoline tax.14 In the presence of such as tax, suburbanites would be more

likely to buy more fuel efficient vehicles and the carbon externality associated with

suburbanization would diminish. This example highlights that the social costs of

suburbanization literature is really focused on a second best world in which households and firms

are spreading out without facing the social costs of their actions. A critical implication is that

any empirical research focused on the externality consequences of suburbanization must account

for the dynamics of the carbon pricing regime faced by key decision makers. .


        The greenhouse gas implications of the suburbanization trend depend on the technologies

used for generating suburban household electricity demand and for fueling private vehicles.

Today, with coal and natural gas providing most of our power and the bulk of private vehicles

still being run on gasoline there is a large carbon impact. In the future, if more households have

solar panels fueling electric vehicles, then the carbon consequences of the suburbanization of

U.S homes and jobs could be sharply reduced. In the absence of carbon pricing in the U.S, it

remains an open question how quickly the research frontier will advance so that the widespread

diffusion of solar homes and electric cars takes place.


A. Measuring the Causal Effect of Suburbanization on Household Energy Consumption


        The typical research design seeking to test the hypothesis that suburbanization causes

greater household GHG emissions is based on running an OLS regression model of equation (4).


14
  Davis (2011) and Muller, Mendelsohn, and Nordhaus (2011) quantify the externalities associated with coal fired
power plants.

                                                                                                               30
In such an equation, the key explanatory variables are such observables as the household’s

distance from the city center and the population density in the area where the household lives.


                     ∑             ∑            ∑                .               (4)


In this regression, the dependent variable is the level of annual household GHG emissions

produced by household living in metropolitan area in tract                    This variable can be formed

with data on the household’s annual gasoline consumption and information on the household’s

annual home fossil fuel consumption such as on natural gas and oil and information on the

home’s annual electricity consumption and the local electric utility’s carbon emissions factor

(see Glaeser and Kahn 2010).              refers to the value of individual characteristic          for household

 . It can include standard household attributes such as the household’s income, the head’s age,

and the household’s size.              refers to the value of characteristic in tract . For example, this

may include a household’s census tract’s population density and the tract centroid’s distance to

the Central Business District. The final set of variables, denoted by                  , refers to attribute   of

MSA .


         OLS estimates of this equation raises the issue of self selection.15 Since households are

not randomly assigned to live in neighborhoods valid concerns can be raised about whether a

select subset of people choose to live in the suburbs versus the center city. At the start of this

section, we presented a residential locational choice model. That model did not explicitly

15
   Several recent studies have attempted to quantify geography-related variation in carbon intensities. Glaeser and
Kahn (2010), Holian and Kahn (2013), Lee and Lee (2014) provide estimates of the relationship between urban
population density and the total greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. Zheng et. al. (2011) quantify the
carbon footprint effects across China’s cities. VandeWeghe and Kennedy (2007) compare per capita auto- and
building-related GHG emissions across census tracts within greater Toronto, Canada. Between the most carbon-
intensive (typically suburban) and the least carbon-intensive (typically urban) tracts, they find that GHG emissions
vary by more than a factor of four.



                                                                                                                    31
include an intensive margin of how much do people travel once they choose a location within a

metro area. Suppose that households who enjoy driving are more likely to locate in the suburbs

further from jobs and shopping centers. The econometrician who ignores this self-selection will

be likely to recover biased estimates based on equation (4) because the distance variable is

correlated with unobserved attributes of the household. Researchers who rely on OLS have to

argue that other factors such as local school quality or housing demand are the key determinants

of locational choice and that these choices are independent of the transportation use.


        Does living at high density close to the city center induce individuals to consume less

energy (that is, a “treatment effect”)? Or instead, has a select subgroup of the population chosen

to live in center cities? This selection effect may be due to unobserved population heterogeneity

such that there are people who are predisposed to living the “low carbon” lifestyle and thus have

less demand for residential space, and prefer using public transit and walking to driving.16


        Applied economists have recognized this challenge and have tried to make progress using

a longitudinal research design. Many urbanists have claimed that people walk and exercise

more when they live in center cities. Eid et. al. (2008) use a geocoded version of the National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. These data track each individual’s residential address,

weight, and other personal characteristics over time. They report that 79% of these people move

address at least once during their six year study period. By first differencing their data, they

remove individual fixed effects and focus on measuring the association between local

neighborhood attributes and a person’s Body Mass Index (BMI). This association can be




16
  The causes of such environmentalism remains an open research question. The peer effects literature and research
on parental transmission of culture and values offers possible pathways for examining this issue (Becker 1976,
Bowles 1998, Iannaccone 1998).

                                                                                                                32
measured because some households move from the center city to the suburbs and vice-versa.17

They test and reject the hypothesis that suburbanization contributes to rising obesity levels.


        A randomized field experiment design would offer a cleaner way to disentangle selection

from treatment effects. Suppose that public housing is scattered across different neighborhoods

in a city. Those households who sign up for a public housing lottery would be randomly

assigned their place of residence. A researcher focusing on this subpopulation could study the

transportation patterns of these individuals to establish the causal effect of urban form on car use.

The researcher would face the challenge of establishing whether results based on this

subpopulation are likely to generalize to other subsets of the population.18


        The bottom line in terms of this area of research is that while, a handful of papers have

been written that highlight potential strategies for identifying the causal link between urban

structure and household energy consumption – this issue remains an open question and merits

future work both in developed and in developing nations’ cities.


B. Suburbanization and Carbon Politics


        Households who live a high carbon lifestyle are likely to be aware of this fact and thus to

oppose policies such as carbon taxes that would raise electricity and gasoline prices. For

example, Cragg et. al. (2013) document that U.S Congressional Representative voting on the


17
   The authors do not model why people are moving across geographic areas and thus they are implicitly assuming
that the migration decision’s determinants are not correlated with unobserved determinants of BMI changes.
18
   As an example, the “Move to Opportunity” (MTO) program of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) introduced a randomized lottery in which low-income households who “won” the lottery
receive vouchers to move to low-poverty areas. The survey data include household vehicle access. This
experimental design would allow researchers to study whether the probability that a household owns a vehicle
increases when it moves to areas further from public transit and further from the city center. The natural control
group in this case is other MTO-eligible families who did not win the lottery (Ludwig et al, 2011).



                                                                                                                     33
American Clean Energy and Security Act in 2009 was positively correlated with their district’s

per-capita carbon emissions. Holian and Kahn (2014) document that California voters who live

in the suburbs are less likely to support the state’s landmark AB32 legislation. California’s

AB32 commits California to major greenhouse gas reductions by the year 2020 and 2050. It

includes new regulations including a cap and trade program for carbon dioxide.19 In the year

2010, California voters had the opportunity to repeal AB32 by voting in favor of Proposition 23.

These voting data provides researchers with the opportunity to studying geographical patterns in

the precinct level data. Holian and Kahn (2014) document that suburban geographic areas were

more likely to vote against cap and trade even after controlling for the fact that more liberal

voters live in the center city. This finding is of interest because it highlights that suburbanites are

self interested voters who believe that their operating expenses will rise in the presence of a

carbon tax. Center city voters recognize that they live in smaller apartments and drive less and

use public transit more. The aggregate effect of these choices is that they face a lower carbon

bill if a carbon tax is enacted. The voting patterns support this spatial hypothesis.


           A majority of U.S metropolitan area jobs are located in the suburbs. Glaeser and Kahn

(2001) use geocoded zip code level employment data to document the empirical distribution of

jobs across cities and industries. As road networks have improved and center city land has

increased in price, jobs have suburbanized. Improvements in information technology have

allowed firms to fragment so that they reduce their demand for downtown real estate and only

retain workers who require face to face interaction with other firms to remain there (Rossi-

Hansberg and Sarte 2009).




19
     http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ab32/ab32.htm

                                                                                                     34
          Households who live and work in the suburbs are unlikely to use public transit. Aware of

this fact, they are less likely to support public policies that improve public transit or to use this

public transit. This fact helps to explain how over 16 major cities have made major investments

in rail transit systems over the last few decades but only Boston and Washington DC have seen

significant ridership of these systems (Baum-Snow and Kahn 2005).


          Throughout the urbanizing world, people are decentralizing as new roads are built and as

household income rises. While environmental economists have stressed that the introduction of

a carbon tax is likely to offer greater long run benefits relative to its upfront costs, this group of

researchers has tended to ignore the spatial distribution of voters and its implications for the

economic incidence of new taxes. Whether the world wide suburbanization trend affects the

likelihood of a global carbon treaty would appear to be an important future research topic.




    IV.       Environmental Amenities in a System of Cities


          In this section, we survey ongoing research examining how environmental amenities

shape cross-city competition for workers and firms. We examine the causes of differential

environmental improvements in some cities (the evolving supply of pollution) and we seek to

understand its consequences for the sorting of heterogeneous workers (who differ with respect to

human capital) and the types of firms who hire them (i.e Facebook vs. service firms).


          An enormous cross-sectional cross-city compensating differentials literature has used the

core Rosen/Roback modeling structure to estimate hedonic wage and real estate impacts of non-



                                                                                                         35
market goods (for a general survey see Gyourko, Kahn and Tracy 1999). The classic

Rosen/Roback model of cross-city quality of life implicitly assumes that spatially tied attributes

are exogenously determined and fixed over time. The leading papers in the cross-city non-

market quality of life literature have been static studies seeking to estimate the cross-sectional

hedonic equilibrium at a point in time (Graves and Linneman 1979, Berger, Blomquist and

Hoehn 1988, Gyourko and Tracy 1991, Albouy 2009). Such estimates are quite useful for

learning about the marginal migrant’s implicit price index for non-market goods and be used to

construct a Laspeyres price index for necessary expenditure to consume a fixed non-market local

amenity bundle such as climate attributes (Cragg and Kahn 1999, Costa and Kahn 2003).                        This

approach is less informative in the case where households face migration costs in moving across

cities and when there is significant heterogeneity with respect to the preferences for local public

goods. In this case, the hedonic gradient represents the marginal mobile person’s willingness to

tradeoff money for local public goods and such estimates may reveal little about the preferences

of those far from the margin (Bayer, Keohnane and Timmins 2009). 20




20
  For example, suppose that a Chicago resident who currently earns $100,000 could earn $140,000 if he moves to
San Francisco. Suppose that housing units are all the same size and that this Chicago resident currently pays
$20,000 in rent but would pay $120,000 for a housing unit in San Francisco. Abstracting from federal and local
taxes, this person sacrifices $60,000 in private consumption if he moves from Chicago to San Francisco. If we
observe this person make this move, then a lower bound on his willingness to pay for San Francisco’s amenities
over Chicago’s amenities is $60,000. Note that this example assumes that migration costs are zero and abstracts
from potential adjustments in the level of housing consumption. Suppose that due to family reasons that this person
would face a $250,000 migration cost for leaving Chicago. An econometrician who does not observe this cost
would see the person remain in Chicago and would infer that this person does not value San Francisco’s amenities.




                                                                                                                 36
   A. A Cross-City Household Locational Choice Model



       This section modifies the locational equilibrium model presented in section II to motivate

the discussion below of environmental quality and cross-city sorting by heterogeneous

households and firms. As presented here, the model is a modification of Bayer, Keohane and

Timmins’ (2009) cross-city locational choice model. At a point in time a household is located in

a specific metropolitan area ∈ and must choose whether to stay in its current location or move

to another location. Households differ with respect to their human capital endowments and can

foresee both the incomes and housing prices available to them at all potential locations.

Households recognizes that if they move they will incur moving costs (which are heterogeneous

and we discuss them below) but that it will enjoy a vector of location specific attributes G. As

with the intra-city model presented above, some of these attributes are environmental attributes

such as climate, proximity to coasts and local environmental quality. Finally, we assume that

each household has an idiosyncratic preference shock (error term) associated with each possible

location       . For simplicity we assume a linear indirect utility function and thus, the utility that

household i that initially is located in community j will receive if it chooses to locate in

community k is given by equation 5:

           ∗                  ∗            Γ    ,    ∗        ∗                          . (5)

In equation 5, moving costs are zero if             . Γ . captures both systematic heterogeneity in

taste for amenities (based on a vector of demographic characteristics,        ) and a random

coefficients component driven by the idiosyncratic shock          . Inclusion of    in the Γ function




                                                                                                          37
allows the model to reflect the fact that, on average, demographics such as education level

impact tastes for environmental quality (Kahn 2002).21

         Assuming a logit error term collapses the implicitly high dimensional problem of

identifying the probability of household i, initially located in j, choosing location k as its final

destination into the familiar logit probability expression presented in equation (6).




                                      ∗          ∗           ,       ∗       ∗
                                                                                                    (6)
                                          ∗          ∗           ,       ∗       ∗
                                 ∑∈




         Several points regarding empirical implementation of equation (6) merit discussion.

First, there is a fundamental asymmetry between the decision maker and the econometrician.

The econometrician must impute what this household will earn in each local labor market.

While it is easy to impute the rental price of what each household will have to pay for housing in

cities such as Boston, Houston etc., a fundamental self-selection issue arises when using the

wages for college graduates who already live in Houston as an estimate of the wage a person

now living in Chicago would earn if he moved to Houston. To avoid self-selection concerns, the

researcher must assume either that there are no unobserved skills or that the factor price for these

skills is equal across cities (Heckman and Scheinkman 1987).

         A key innovation in this model of location choice is the introduction of migration costs

(also see Kennan and Walker 2008). The introduction of migration costs means that migration is

an investment and that a forward looking migrant should also form expectations of how his

income and the amenities of the area will evolve over time. Incorporating fixed costs is

21
  As presented here, preferences do not exhibit the single crossing property discussed above in section II.
Incorporating income into the Γ function is one way to address this issue.

                                                                                                              38
particularly important in the modern economy, where there is an aging population who has built

up location specific social capital (Glaeser, Laibson and Sacerdote 2002). In this case hedonic

differences in prices may sharply understate the marginal valuation of amenities depending on

who is the marginal household (Bayer, Keohane and Timmins 2009).

       Bayer, Keohane and Timmins (2009) estimate a version of this model to recover

estimates of the marginal willingness to pay for air quality improvements using data on

migration while allowing for positive migration costs. They argue that standard hedonic

methods will under-estimate the marginal willingness to pay for clean air and other location

amenities because there are infra-marginal households who value such amenities but face large

migration costs to moving and thus the hedonic gradient contains biased information about

household’s marginal valuations. In their application, they document that a major bias arises

because households are estimated to have high moving costs associated with leaving their state

and/or region of birth. A majority of U.S. citizens were born in areas with relatively high air

pollution levels. Bayer et.al. demonstrate that failure to account for a household’s birth-related

attachments to these relatively polluted areas imparts a large downward bias in estimates of the

willingness to pay for clean air.

       In the presence of migration costs, forward looking households will consider both the

amenities of a location today and their expectations of future amenity levels in potential

destination cities (see Bishop (2012) and Bishop and Murphy (2012)). Bishop (2012) assumes

that such locational attributes as crime and air pollution follow an AR(1) process and uses city

specific estimates of this process to predict future amenity values. In cities where polluted areas

are expected to improve over time, today’s amenity value under-states future progress. If for

instance the AR(1) process is mean reverting and economic agents anticipate that relatively



                                                                                                     39
polluted locations will improve toward the mean over time, then the econometrician who

estimates a static model and does not incorporate these dynamics will under-estimate the

willingness to pay for such an amenity. This bias arises because the econometrician observes

people moving to locations with high levels of pollution today and therefore infers that

individuals do not prioritize pollution avoidance heavily in their location decisions. When, in

fact, economic decision makers are basing their decisions on the lower levels of pollution that

they expect to experience in these locations over longer-run time horizons.



   B. Modeling Cross-City Differences in the Local Public Goods Supply

       Environmental and urban economists have not been explicit about how the G is produced

and who is doing this “production”. Implicit in this is the view that local public goods are either

exogenous or being produced through some unintended by product of economic activity.

       In papers such as Kahn (1999) or Levitt (2004), researchers adopt a reduced form

approach and model a location’s local public goods vector by simply regressing measures of

amenities (such as air pollution, or crime) on a set of observables.



                     ,   )                                             (7)



       In this equation, the G is the city’s local public goods vector, X is a vector of city specific

demographics and industries located within the borders and Z is a vector of national policies that

have been implemented. This reduced form equation representing the supply of local public

goods, including many environmental attributes, highlights a key difference between urban

economics and industrial organization.



                                                                                                    40
       Starting with Rosen (1974, 2002), urban economists have thought of locations as

differentiated products whose attributes are in a characteristics space. In this sense, there is a

close link between urban and industrial organization economics. In the modern IO literature, for

profit product sellers choose what to bundle into a product such as a car or an airplane ride in

order to collect more revenue (Berry et. al. 1995, Blonigen et. al 2013). A key difference

between environmental and urban economics and industrial organization is that the suppliers of

real estate do not consciously choose all of the local public goods bundled into a specific

property. Instead, such local public goods as clean air and water are an emergent property of

regulation, and what industry and population locates within a geographic area and the daily

activities of such economic actors at their specific location.


       Diamond (2012) introduces a straightforward reduced form endogenous amenity

modeling technique in which she assumes that endogenous city specific amenities are an

increasing function of the city’s share of college graduates. The correlation between college

graduates and amenities is likely to reflect both selection and treatment effects. College

educated individuals are likely to be richer and thus are willing to pay more to live in nicer areas

(selection). The clustering of such college educated in a small geographic area may also have a

treatment effect in that their local purchasing power is likely to attract niche retail stores and

restaurants (Waldfogel 2008). This group’s propensity to vote and to follow local politics may

discipline local politicians to address quality of life concerns (Moretti 2004). Given the positive

correlation between education and environmentalism, this group is also likely to prioritize green

issues (Kahn 2002).


       One promising area for future research relates to how local governments respond to both

contemporaneously high levels of local public goods (the G vector) and expectations of future

                                                                                                     41
increases in public good levels. In recent work, Brueckner and Neumark (2014) argue that in

those areas with better natural amenities (a high G) public sector workers earn higher wages.

Their core logic is that households inelastically demand such areas and local officials can tax

more (for redistribution purposes) without people moving away. In contrast in cities such as

Detroit, if rich people move out of the center city then the local government has less tax revenue

to spend on local public services and such a decline in G may have selective effects on who

remains in Detroit and on the probability that outsiders move to this center city.



   C. Firm Locational Demand and Local Amenities


         In the Roback (1988) model, there is no comparative advantage among heterogeneous

firms such that different firms earn greater profits at one location versus another because firms

do not differ.   The cross-city hedonic quality of life literature has developed independently of

the empirical firm locational choice literature that explores the role of local agglomeration

effects, transportation costs and access to input markets affects locational choice (Rosenthal and

Strange 2004, Dumais, Ellison and Glaeser 2002, Kerr et. al. 2012).      A second firm literature

has explored how differences across space in environmental regulation, labor regulation and

energy prices affects the geography of where different industries cluster (Carelton 1983, Becker

and Henderson 2000, Greenstone 2002, Henderson 1996, Holmes 1998, Kahn and Mansur

2013).


         Today firms such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are locating in high

quality of life cities. Nascent agglomerations such as Santa Monica’s Silicon Beach are

emerging. High tech firms face a co-ordination issue that they often have incentives to locate

near each other. High quality of life areas help to solve the co-ordination problem and ex-post

                                                                                                    42
help such firms who seek cross-firm learning and labor pooling to retain workers in the local

labor market.


        For either factories or corporate headquarters, we can write down a locational choice

problem where firms choose the location that maximizes their profits. Similar to the Bayer,

Keohane and Timmins model of household locational choice, the core locational choice

probability model can be written as:



                                   ∗              ∗               ∗
                                                                                        (8)
                                       ∗              ∗               ∗
                              ∑∈




Further flexibility can be obtained by allowing the coefficients in equation (8) to vary by

industry    and firm . Under such a specification,        for instance could be replaced by Β   ,

where      is a vector of firm-level characteristics and     is a firm specific random component.

        A key difference between the firm locational choice problem and the household problem

is the desire of some firms to locate near other firms in the same industry or complementary

industries. The firm agglomeration literature has devoted little attention to the role that place

based amenities (the     ) play in determining where firms locate. For the subset of high tech

firms that seek high skill workers, they should recognize that where they locate is an investment.

They must form an expectation of what will be future centers of agglomeration and the high

quality of life cities such as Santa Monica can solve this co-ordination problem. For example,

for high tech firms the Agglomeration term in equation (8) may be a function of the local public

goods G index.




                                                                                                    43
       This discrete choice approach captures the sorting by heterogeneous firms. Those firms

that are land intensive will move to areas with cheaper land. Those that are labor intensive will

tend to avoid pro-union states (Holmes 1998). Those that are high emitters will avoid non-

attainment counties under the Clean Air Act (Becker and Henderson 2000, Greenstone 2002).

Those firms that are energy intensive will tend to concentrate in places with low electricity prices

(Kahn and Mansur 2013). Such a probabilistic approach but can be aggregated up to predict how

local state policies influence the sorting of industries across space. California is a state with high

land prices, high electricity prices and is pro-union. It is no surprise that California has

deindustrialized over the last 40 years. This reduction in the scale of manufacturing lowers

pollution levels and thus feeds back into a type of virtuous cycle as these amenity improvements

can serve to increase the supply of high human capital labor that tends to migrate towards high

amenity locations.



   D. The Evolution of Cross-City Differences in Environmental Amenities
       In this section, we discuss four comparative statics with respect to how changes in the

spatial distribution of urban environmental amenities affects the spatial distribution of

heterogeneous households and firms; manufacturing dynamics, air quality dynamics, land use

zoning and climate amenities. Such environmental amenities dynamics affect the cross-city

locational choices of households and firms. We motivate the discussion with a discussion of the

role environmental amenities have played in the evolution of the City of Pittsburgh’s evolution

from a polluted industrial center to a high quality of life center of post-industrial commerce.




                                                                                                    44
   i.      The Case of Pittsburgh



        Consider the case of Pittsburgh and the evolving role that natural resources have played

in its existence over the last 250 years. European settlement in the region began in the 1740s

with the establishment of an English trading post at the point of land where the confluence of the

Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers form the Ohio River. Early in the region’s history it was the

key role that these rivers played in transportation that gave Pittsburgh a natural advantage. The

strategic importance of controlling these natural transportation corridors led first the French and

then the British to establish forts at the confluence. Over the next 50 years, the city’s population

slowly grew up around Fort Pitt, its economy relying mainly on trading and the development of a

boat building industry – both predicated on the vital role that the city’s rivers played in moving

people and goods to the west.

        Beginning in the 1800’s Pittsburgh’s natural transportation endowment was matched with

a second critical natural resource endowment as an engine of growth. Throughout the 1800s and

early 1900s the cost of transporting coal was a key determinant of where iron (and later steel)

production was located. The ready availability of local coal supplies combined with proximate

sources of iron ore gave the Pittsburgh region a critical natural advantage in iron production and

led to the region become a national leader in first iron and later steel production. By the close of

the 19th century, these natural advantages multiplied as manufacturers realized that they could

further reduce costs by eliminating the shipping of semi-finished products and integrated

production at the location of the coal fields. Thus, for more than 200 years (well into the second

half of the 20th Century) The City of Pittsburgh was an economic juggernaut fueled by natural




                                                                                                     45
resource-based production advantages.22                By the year 1950, Pittsburgh’s population had peaked

at 676,000. After 150 years as a center for iron and steel production, the city had the third largest

concentration of corporate headquarters in the United States – built almost completely on heavy

manufacturing concerns.

           This economic success came with environmental and health costs. As the population

density increased along the banks of the city’s three rivers, residents experienced increased rates

of infectious disease risk because of increasing concentrations of raw sewage being dumped in

these rivers as people lived at high population density. Urban public health research has

documented the urban death premium (Haines 2001). Major investments in water treatment and

sewage sharply reduced the urban mortality risk but new threats to urban quality of life emerged.

As trading and boat building gave way to iron and steel, an unintended consequence of the

greatly increased scale of this dirty activity was large amounts of local pollution which damaged

what could have been a beautiful city. In the words of one visitor to the city in 1846:


           “Everybody who has heard of Pittsburgh, knows that it is a city of perpetual smoke and
           looks as if it was built on a descent into a bottomless pit. But the locality is eminently
           beautiful, in the confluence of two rivers, with bold hills everywhere in the background,
           richly wooded and verdant.”23


Of course this pollution carried health implications as well. Ongoing epidemiology research

documents the health impacts of particulate matter from living in an area where coal was being

burnt (Clay et. al. 2013).

           As is well known, by the early 1970s, Pittsburgh’s steel economy, predicated on the

natural advantages it enjoyed due to transportation and cheap coal, came crashing down as the


22
     See Isard (1948) for a discussion of the evolving role of resource location in iron and steel production.
23
     Case (1846).


                                                                                                                 46
U.S. economy began its seismic shift away from heavy manufacturing. In the short run, the loss

in manufacturing jobs was devastating to the region’s economy. However, as documented by

Kahn (1999) and Chay and Greenstone (2003), a silver lining of Rust Belt decline (starting in the

1970s and accelerated by the deep 1981 recession) has been a reduction of air and water

pollution levels in Rust Belt cities such as Pittsburgh.

           Pittsburgh of today has successfully re-invented itself, taking advantage of the reductions

in industrial pollution that occurred with the loss of the steel industry to transition from a city

where natural resources are used as inputs to production processes to an economy where these

resources are packaged as amenities which make the city an integral recruitment tool for the

medical, high tech and institutions of higher education that now characterize the city’s economy.

Quoting from recruitment materials on Google’s Pittsburgh recruitment web site:



           “Back in the day, this was a steel town, known for its smokestacks and smelters. Today,
           it’s a technology hotbed, a model for cities trying to transition from an industrial past to
           a knowledge-based future. Home to Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh,
           the ’Burgh produces some of the finest engineering talent in the world. It’s also one of
           the most livable places in the U.S. Don’t take our word for it, though. Ask Forbes and the
           Economist”


     ii.      Air Pollution

           In equation (7) above we noted that environmental and urban economists take a reduced

form approach in modeling a city’s G at a point in time. In the case of air pollution, a standard

accounting approach is to consider scale, composition and technique effects. Consider the

emissions generated by different industries.24 To simplify the problem assume there is a clean



24
   To simplify this emissions inventory discussion, we focus on the emissions from industry. We recognize that the
transportation sector, and the household sector are also major contributors to local air pollution. Their emissions can
also be studied by examining scale, composition and technique effects (see Kahn and Schwartz 2008).

                                                                                                                    47
industry and a dirty industry. At a point in time the total emissions in this city can be expressed

as:

                                   ∗                                      ∗

(9)

where the c subscript indicates the clean industry and the d subscript stands for the dirty industry.

         A growing city can experience reduced pollution if the composition of economic activity

is shifting from dirty output to clean output and if the emissions factor for the dirty industry is

significantly higher than for the clean industry. Kahn (1999) and Chay and Greenstone (2003)

document the particulate progress observed in the U.S Rust Belt as heavy steel producers

reduced production in the face of heavy international competition. Kahn (2003) shows similar

results for Eastern European cities after the fall of communism. Similar trends are now playing

out in many of China’s richer coastal Eastern cities (Zheng et. al. 2014, Zheng and Kahn 2013).

Pope et. al. (1992) present an early natural experiment documenting the particulate reductions

achieved when a steel plant went on strike.

         Over the last 40 years, U.S big cities have experienced an industrial composition shift as

the share of jobs in manufacturing has decreased and the share working in the service sector has

increased. There have been many causes of the deindustrialization of U.S major cities including

high wages and the rise of international trade (Autor et. al. 2013), and differential enforcement of

Clean Air Act regulation (Kahn 1997, Becker and Henderson 2000, Henderson 1996, Greenstone

2002).     As major cities feature fewer manufacturing jobs, this reduces the likelihood that

middle class households live in these cities.


         This discussion has focused on the USA but the same issues arising in China. As center

city land prices rise, the opportunity cost for having land intensive manufacturing remain in the


                                                                                                      48
center cities has increased. In many Chinese cities, urban mayors are eager to reclaim

manufacturing land to sell to real estate developers (see Zheng et. al. 2014). An open question

concerns whether such developers and local governments have strong incentives to remediate the

pollution damage (such as localized toxic emissions) caused by manufacturing. In the United

States, the Superfund and Brownfields cleanups are intended to achieve this goal.


   Richer coastal cities such as Shanghai are tightening environmental regulations and this

provides a further incentive for manufacturing to migrate west to provinces featuring cheaper

land and laxer regulation. This industrial migration from eastern to western China raises the

possibility of future environmental progress in China’s richer eastern cities at the same time that

there is pollution degradation in China’s western cities. The extent of this pollution transfer

hinges on the emissions control technology built into the new factories opening in Western China

(Zheng et. al. 2014).


   iii.      Land Use Regulation/Zoning


          A growing set of empirical studies have documented that coastal high quality of life cities

are more likely to engage in land use restrictions than the average city. Such cities as Boston,

San Francisco and New York City have been documented to engage in more land use restrictions

(Glaeser, Gyourko and Saks 2005, 2006, Kahn 2011, Glaeser and Ward 2009). Such local

limits to growth are intended to preserve local quality of life but by limiting housing supply in

specific high amenity areas, they are likely to drive up home prices in such areas and deflect

middle class people to other geographic areas featuring more elastic housing supply such as

Phoenix. This in turn has implications for both access to local public goods and for the carbon

emissions of the residential sector (Mangum 2014).



                                                                                                    49
       Glaeser and Kahn (2008) argue that the large difference in the air conditioning carbon

footprint between San Francisco and other cities such as Houston means that, by downsizing the

amount of available housing, aggressive local land use zoning in coastal cities displaces people

to higher carbon areas. This suggests that an unintended consequence of local attempts to

preserve coastal quality of life is to exacerbate the global challenge of climate change. Mangum

(2014) builds on this research by developing a dynamic model of housing demand which he uses

to simulate how the residential sector’s production of greenhouse gas emissions is affected by

various counter-factual policies. He finds that imposing stricter land use regulations in high

carbon output cities would decrease the aggregate amount of carbon output by about 1.7 percent

(2.7 percent in new construction), again mostly through decreasing the housing consumed per

person and secondarily by moving population to low carbon cities. His findings build on the

research agenda presented in Gaigne, Riou and Thisse (2012) that stresses the importance of

considering general equilibrium effects when evaluating the impact of local policies related to

carbon footprints.


To quote Gaigne, Riou and Thisse (2012):


        “There is a wide consensus among international institutions and national governments in favor of
       compact (i.e. densely populated) cities as a way to improve the ecological performance of the
       transport system. Indeed, when both the intercity and intra-urban distributions of activities are
       given, a higher population density makes cities more environmentally friendly because the
       average commuting length is reduced. However, when we account for the possible relocation of
       activities within and between cities in response to a higher population density, the latter may
       cease to hold. Indeed, an increasing-density policy affects prices, wages and land rents, which in
       turn incentivizes firms and households to change place. This reshapes the urban system in a way
       that may generate a higher level of pollution. Thus, although an increase in compactness is
       environmentally desirable when locations are given, compactness may not be environmentally-
       friendly when one accounts for the general equilibrium effects generated by such a policy.”




                                                                                                       50
This quote highlights a tension in the applied economics literature. Most papers in the field

experiments and regression discontinuity literature adopt a partial equilibrium approach as they

focus on cleanly identifying a single parameter of interest. This quote highlights the importance

of embedding such estimates within a general equilibrium framework.


   iv.      Climate

         A large amount of cross-city hedonic research focuses on climate valuation. While

climate may appear to be a static attribute increased access to air conditioning and rising

households incomes have both lead to interesting dynamics with respect to the demand for

climate. Based on both the geographic migration of the population over time and on hedonic

pricing, one robust finding is the rising demand for warm winter areas. Hedonic research by

Cragg and Kahn (1999) and Costa and Kahn (2003) documents the rising implicit price of warm

winters in cross-city hedonic real estate regressions. Using decennial census data, they

document that all else equal that the implicit price on winter temperature has been rising over

time in hedonic real estate regressions. With the exception of coastal California and Oregon and

Washington, warm winter states tend to have high summer temperatures. This bundling of a

“good” and a “bad” amenity has been offset by the widespread penetration of air conditioning

access (Oi 1996). Barreca et. al. (2013) document that over the 20th century that there has been a

sharp reduction in the mortality rate caused by extremely hot days and they attribute this trend to

the diffusion of air conditioning.


         As air conditioning has become cheaper and of higher quality over time, warm winter and

warm summer states have become more hospitable locations and more economic activity has

moved there. The overall trends in population locational choice are presented in Figure Two. In

the year 1900 and 2010, we report the cumulative percentage of all people in the United States as

                                                                                                   51
a function of average February temperature. Consider the median person. In 1900, the median

American lived in a state whose February average temperature was 30 degrees F. In 2010 the

median American lived in a state whose temperature was 37 degrees. Note that we use the same

temperature distribution for both years.         The introduction of a cheap market product that offsets

summer heat has sharply changed the spatial distribution of economic activity. This example

highlights how market products influence climate demand and population locational choice.

Future research might explore how the diffusion of air conditioning in LDC cities affects the

spatial distribution of economic activity in these nations.


     v.        Resilience to Climate Change Shocks


          While there are many unknowns about climate change’s impacts on different urban areas,

climate scientists do agree that mean temperature and the variance of possible outcomes

regarding temperature, rainfall and storms is likely to increase over time as global greenhouse

gas emissions continue to rise.           Many climate models predict significant changes in average

summer and winter climate conditions. For example, in the Southwest, cities such as Las Vegas

are expected to become much hotter during summer months. Albouy et. al. (2013) use cross-city

hedonic regressions at a point in time to estimate the marginal valuations of climate. They

combine these estimates with predictions from climate change models of how climate conditions

are expected to change over time to predict how the climate amenity value of different cities will

change due to climate change.25           In addition to shifting mean temperature and rainfall, climate

scientists have tried to be clear about their uncertainty about model accuracy and the possibility

of fat tail events such as super storms. Weitzman (2009) explores the implications of “fat tails”

25
   Such research implicitly assumes that there will be no future technological progress directed toward reducing the
discomfort of summer heat.



                                                                                                                 52
events becoming more likely and having incredibly high costs if they do take place.           This

research line has not incorporated spatial features into the analysis. In this section, we focus on

an emerging new research agenda examining how climate change is likely to affect the spatial

distribution of economic activity across diverse cities.


      In an open system of cities, households and firms can migrate. This option provides a type

of insurance policy as the new news about climate change’s actual impacts unfold. As we

discussed earlier, migration costs will inhibit such adaptation.     Land prices will change in

response to these shifts in migration so that the marginal household and firm is indifferent across

locations (Rosen 2002). Incumbent real estate owners will bear the incidence of new news

related to how specific cities are coping with climate change (see Bunten and Kahn 2014).

Those households who face high migration costs of leaving at risk cities (either due to their

demographics or due to idiosyncratic locational capital that they have built up) will be more

likely to suffer because they are either unable to move from at risk places or will lose valuable

capital in doing so.


      Around the world a large number of people and billions of dollars of real estate is located

close to coastal waterways. Such coastal living offers both easy access to water amenties,

beautiful views and a temperate climate. Such coastal living puts many urbanites around the

world at risk from sea level rise and natural disasters.


      The impact of Hurricane Andrew on Miami and Katrina and Sandy perhaps offer a preview

of the challenges that cities will face if climate change leads to both sea level rise and more

severe and intense storms. These natural disasters highlight an emerging urban research area.

How will individual cities and their current urbanites be affected by climate change? Kahn



                                                                                                 53
(2010) argues that migration offers urbanites the option to vote with their feet if their current

city’s quality of life declines due to climate change. Such potential exit incentivizes urban

politicians to devote effort to mitigating emerging new risks that different cities will face.


      At risk cities have a variety of strategies to protect themselves from anticipated risks.

New Orleans is making enormous investments in new sea walls in response to Hurricane Katrina

(Kates et. al. 2006). Part of the challenge that older coastal cities face is that their existing

infrastructure, such as the New York City subway, is over 100 years old and was built at a time

when the emerging risks could not be imagined.


      An unintended consequence of public investment in coastal armoring to fend off sea level

rise is to crowd out private self protection. More people are likely to move to a coastal city or

remain there if they feel safe there (Boustan, Kahn and Rhode 2012)? Kousky, Luttmer and

Zeckhauser (2006) present a multiple equilibrium model. If an at risk city such as New Orleans

uses public funds to invest in sea walls then private investors will be more likely to build hotels

because their investment is safer. In this equilibrium, the exogenously risky city experiences

economic growth because of the synergy between public and private investment.               A second

equilibrium in this case would be if the government does not expect that people will move to the

risky city and thus the government does not build the sea walls. Anticipating that there will be

no sea walls, the hotel investor does not invest in the hotel.     In this “libertarian” equilibrium,

less economic activity locates in the risky place.       From an ex-post regret standpoint, a key

unknown concerns the quality of these sea walls. If private investors and migrants are over-

confident about the quality of the government provided sea walls then a tragedy could result.

This example bears a strong similarity to Peltzman’s (1975) famous unintended consequences

example of mandatory seat belts (a safety regulation) crowding out private effort.

                                                                                                   54
       For geographic areas that suffer natural disaster shocks, will their long run growth be

affected? The recent macro urban research focused on urban growth after major bombings

would say “no”. Davis and Weinstein (2002) studied Japan’s urban population dynamics after

World War II bombing and found that cities quickly converge back to their population regression

line in the aftermath of a shock (i.e bombings or natural disasters). Unlike with war bombing,

coastal cities face the challenge of the future expectation that they will suffer future shocks of

similar types of disasters (i.e New Orleans will suffer from a future Hurricane Katrina). Such

expectations may displace investment to less risky areas. In this sense, climate change risk may

lower economic growth in risky areas while increasing investment in other less risky geographic

areas that are close substitutes. Hsiang and Jina (2014) document the long run effects of

cyclones on national economic growth. They document large and persistent effects of such place

based shocks.

       This section has focused on the impact of climate change on temperature and sea level

rise. Another major challenge that climate scientists focus on is drought. In 2014, much of the

Southwest is experiencing extreme drought. To economists, an obvious adaptation strategy is to

allow water prices to rise in order to trigger both demand and supply side responses and to direct

technological change to develop new strategies for augmenting our water supply such as water

desalinization.   Water regulators in the West have been slow to adopt this strategy. They often

face complex objectives as they tradeoff several criteria including equity and efficiency

(Timmins 2002).     Initial property rights disputes further inhibit the efficient allocation of water

(Libecap 2009). Whether climate change will nudge such non-profit maximizers to more

efficiently allocate a key scarce resource would be a valuable future research topic.




                                                                                                     55
   E. The Rise of Superstar Green Cities


       Many cities are transitioning from being producer cities to becoming consumer cities

(Glaeser, Kolko and Saiz 2001). In the past coastal cities were major hubs of production and

transportation. This suggests that coastal cities and cities connected to rivers featured greater

concentrations of both industrial activity and population and this scaled up pollution. In 2014,

coastal and river cities in the United States now tend to have better exogenous amenities and

high levels of environmental quality (the endogenous amenity). In this section, we start on the

supply side to sketch some of the relevant factors responsible for the pollution progress but then

we focus on the resulting implications for the spatial equilibrium and the economic incidence of

uneven amenity improvements within a system of cities.

       Today, the U.S features some extremely expensive “green cities” such as San Francisco,

New York City, Seattle, Portland, Boston, and Chicago, Los Angeles and San Diego. None of

these cities has a major manufacturing center. These cities all feature limited land supply both

due to their topography and due to their land use regulations (Glaeser, Saks and Gyourko 2005,

Saiz 2009, Kahn 2011). Such “superstar cities” feature extremely high home prices and a

growing share of international investors purchasing properties there to play rather than to work

(Gyourko, Mayer and Sinai 2013).


       A type of social multiplier or environmental multiplier emerges. If an exogenously

beautiful area such as a Berkeley attracts individuals to live there, then such individuals (both

through voting on public goods and taxes and through choices in private markets. i.e tofu

demand) create endogenous local attributes that may further enhance the local amenity vector

(Waldfogel 2008). This multiplier is likely to feed on itself as like minded people increasingly

move to the area.

                                                                                                    56
        Standard political economy logic posits that people vote their economic self interest.

This issue arises in predicting whether specific cities will support or oppose new environmental

regulations such as limits on coal fired power plants. In areas such as West Virginia, whose

economy relies on coal extraction and cheap energy, workers have incentives to vote against

environmental regulation. In contrast, in high tech cities such as San Francisco the workers are

likely to already be environmentalists who are inclined to support environmental regulation and

they will anticipate that these regulations will not endanger their employment prospects. This

divergence in state environmental policy leads to even more sorting by households and firms and

the net result is that coastal cities become green area hubs, this attracts workers and firms who

want this lifestyle and then as voters they vote for policies to further re-enforce this lifestyle.

Thus, it is not surprising that a Red State/Blue State divide on greenhouse gas policies has

opened up (see Cragg et. al. 2013) and that the party composition of region’s Congressional

delegation can even affect the enforcement actions of federal regulators (Innes and Mitra, 2014).

In this sense, the urban system of cities has implications for the political economy of externality

mitigation legislation. We believe this connection between urban growth and economic

comparative advantage and political voting outcomes is an important future research topic.


        At the same time that coastal high human capital liberal cities such as Boston and San

Francisco engage in strict zoning, there are other metropolitan areas such as Dallas offering more

affordable, larger new homes. In a diverse population, people are free to Tiebout sort to pursue

their own vision of the good life. Those who enjoy indoor leisure in larger homes will be more

likely to choose to live in affordable Texas. In a population where people differ with respect to

their tastes for local public goods, the subset of lower income households with a strong

preference for coastal big cities will be priced out of these markets. Such individuals can either


                                                                                                      57
live in a distant suburb of that metropolitan area or live in another city. Their loss in consumer

surplus merits further research as it speaks to the cost of rising income inequality.


        One way to allow more of the middle class to access these elite cities would be to build

more housing in them. Critics of such up-zoning have countered that cities such as Paris would

stop being Paris if too much tall building construction took place. An open question in this

literature relates to how much of the desirability of these superstar cities is due to their housing

supply regulation? Does such regulation create such desirability by making it exclusive or by

preserving the city’s charm? To disentangle these effects would require a structural model of the

demand and supply for endogenous city attributes. Is it the case that the demand to live in Paris

increases because potential entrants know that housing supply is limited and thus that their

Parisian neighbors will also be rich? In a diverse city, how do we aggregate public opinion to

determine how much a city’s “character” and “charm” has been diminished by new construction?

Returning to equation (7) where we discussed the supply of a city’s local public goods, how

much would a San Francisco’s quality of life be diminished by introducing higher rise buildings?




   F. Cross-City Local Public Good Valuation Challenges and Opportunities


       The previous section highlighted how environmental shifts impact the system of cities

through shifting the locational choice of heterogeneous households and firms. In this section, we

discuss how such dynamics affect an econometrician’s ability to recover marginal valuations of

household willingness to pay for local environmental goods such as clean air.       Researchers seek

to recover the population’s distribution of willingness to pay for such non-market environmental




                                                                                                       58
goods because this is a key input in conducting cost-benefit analysis of past and future

environmental regulations.

       Researchers in the valuation literature use several different revealed preference

techniques to infer marginal willingness to pay for local public goods. The most common

technique continues to be to estimate cross-sectional hedonic wage and rental regressions with

the goal of recovering what a standardized worker would earn in each local labor market and

what would be the price of a standardized housing unit in each city. The hedonic literature has

sought to decompose this differential into the exact observable parts of the bundle using

multivariate regression analysis by estimating regressions of the form;

                           ∑           ∑                               (10)


       In this regression, structure controls (X) are included as well as metropolitan area level

variables (Z) measuring local public goods and bads such as climate, and air pollution. OLS is

used to estimate these regressions at a point in time. An obvious challenge that emerges is

omitted variables bias. These regressions have a “kitchen sink” feel. In this age of the field

experiment, few reviewers are comfortable with the assumption that the error term in such a

regression (which represents all attributes of the home observed by the renter but not observed

by the econometrician) is uncorrelated with the explanatory variables.


       In response to this concern, leading papers have introduced panel data approaches that

incorporate fixed effects in order to sweep out geographically fixed attributes. Consider the

seminal paper by Chay and Greenstone (2005) who study the value of particulate reductions on

county home prices. They exploit the fact that counties differ with respect to their assignment to

attainment or non-attainment status under the Clean Air Act and the rule for assigning counties

to this status has a fixed threshold (i.e if your county’s baseline pollution is less than the

                                                                                                    59
regulatory cutoff then the county faces little regulation as it would be assigned to attainment

status). They examine home price dynamics in counties assigned to the Clean Air Act’s non-

attainment status versus a control set of counties that just missed being assigned to face more

severe regulation. As they document in their first stage regressions, air quality improved in

those counties assigned to Clean Air Act treatment. They use a county’s assignment to non-

attainment status as an instrumental variable for changes in TSP.


       For an instrumental variable to recover consistent estimates of the second stage it must

also pass an exclusion restriction;


                             : ∆                          ∗∆                         (11)


             : ∆                  ∗1        1974                                     (12)


       In equation (12), 1(TSP in 1974 >threshold) is a dummy variable that equals one if a

county’s ambient particulate level in 1974 exceeded the threshold such that the county was

assigned to Non-Attainment status under the Clean Air Act. The standard exclusion restriction

in instrumental variables estimation requires that the error term in equation (11) be uncorrelated

with the instrumental variable.


       Residential and firm sorting in response to the exogenous amenity changes are likely to

take place so that this key assumption does not hold. The error term (U) in equation (11)

represents all unobserved attributes of the city that are changing over time and capitalized into

local home price changes. If the unobserved determinants of housing price changes (which

would include the housing stock’s quality, local school quality, restaurant quality) are improving

over time by more in cities assigned to high regulation than in low regulation counties then the

exclusion restriction is violated. Why might this be the case?

                                                                                                    60
         Implicit in the Chay and Greenstone argument is a ceteris paribus assumption that the

regulation’s impact on home prices solely works through its impact on ambient air quality. But

throughout this survey, we have stressed that an improvement in one amenity such as clean air

triggers behavioral responses by both households and firms. Recall for instance the work of

Banzhaf and Walsh (2008) which documents household sorting in response to changes in

exposure to toxic air pollution. A similar dynamic is likely to play out across U.S counties as

counties are assigned to high and low regulation levels.

          As regulation reduces air pollution in a non-attainment county, this will directly lead to

air quality progress. In the medium term it will also reduce air pollution by reducing the

probability that dirty footloose manufacturing plants remain in the county. They will be more

likely to move to less regulated attainment counties (Kahn 1997, Becker and Henderson 2000,

Greenstone 2002). The exit of such firms will reduce both air pollution and other pollution

margins such as water pollution and toxic releases. As overall environmental quality improves

in these counties, more educated people are more likely to move in to the county and this will

tend to raise home prices because local public schools will improve, peer effects will improve

and local retail and shopping quality will improve (Waldfogel 2008). In a nutshell, as air

pollution sharply improves due to the regulation all else is not equal.26 The air quality regulation

has indirect effects on other local amenities and home price dynamics reflect this entire bundle’s

dynamics.27


26
   Consider a distinctive example from Falck, Fritsch and Heblich (2011). Using data from Germany’s past, they
document that endogenous cultural amenities affect the spatial distribution of the highly educated. Their study is
based on a natural experiment that exploits the fact that baroque opera houses were built as part of local ruler’s
competition for status among their peers. They estimate cross-region growth regression and find that areas that
were close to these opera houses attracted the high skilled to live there and this agglomeration of the skilled
contributed to further local economic growth.
27
   This same issue arises in cross-sectional spatial regression discontinuity studies. Black (1999) studies real estate
price variation for homes on different sides of a school attendance boundary. Such physically close homes share
the same crime and pollution attributes and the same accessibility to stores and commuting options. She interprets

                                                                                                                      61
         We posit that exogenous improvements in air quality in cities such as Pittsburgh will

attract richer more educated people to move to these improving cities.28 They will move in and

renovate homes (i.e install Jacuzzis) and improve neighborhoods (perhaps their kids are better

role models at school) and these attributes are not seen by the econometrician. The net effect is

that the IV design presented in equations (11 and 12) is likely to over-state the partial effect of

improvements in particulate matter on home prices because all else is not held constant. The

improvement in air quality triggers a sorting of specific types of people and retail that has its

own impact on home prices (see Kuminoff, Smith and Timmins 2013, Kuminoff and Pope

2014). For example, if homes are now more valuable in Pittsburgh because of the air quality

improvement and thus the city collects more money in property tax revenue and offers better

schools this secondary effect will also be capitalized. This example highlights that researchers

using panel methods for inferring marginal valuations for amenity improvements must

distinguish between partial effects (i.e the marginal effect of air quality improvement caused by

the regulation holding all else equal) and total effects (i.e the total change in home prices caused

by the initially more stringent regulation).

the difference in the average prices at the boundary to reflect the parents’ willingness to pay for better schools
Implicit in such a research design is the assumption that unobservable determinants of home prices are smooth
across the school boundary. But, this statistical assumption masks a strong implicit economic assumption that is
unlikely to hold in cases where there is a major jump at a physical boundary in local public goods. Consider the
following model of household sorting. Households differ only with respect to their income. All households gain
utility from private consumption, school quality and Jacuzzi ownership. Assume that household utility features a
complementarity between school quality and owning a Jacuzzi. The econometrician observes the price of each
home and the local school quality but does not observe whether the home has a Jacuzzi. In this simple example,
rich people will live in the best school quality areas and will install a Jacuzzi. Their nearby poorer neighbors will
live in a worse school in a home without a Jacuzzi. The econometrician conducting the regression discontinuity
study will over-state the value of school quality because the jump in the school quality at the boundary causes the
home owner to install the Jacuzzi. The homes located in the high school quality district sell for a price premium
because they have better schools and they have a Jacuzzi.
28
   Kahn (2007a) presents another example of this type of social multiplier effect based on his analysis of the medium
term effects of new rail transit lines. In studying the impact of the fast Red Line that connects Tufts University and
Harvard and MIT to downtown Boston, he documents that this subway’s local impact on nearby community income
and home prices grew over time. He posits that as time passed that new restaurants and retail and increased
investment in the local housing supply all contributed to gentrification near the transit stops but that this process
took time to unfold.

                                                                                                                        62
          This example suggests that a valuable research program for studying the value of local

environmental amenities in the presence of household and firm sorting will involve the following

component parts. First researchers should identify plausibly exogenous supply-side causes of

increases in environmental quality and estimate their direct effects on local environmental

quality.29 Second, in the spirit of the approaches considered in Kuminoff et al. (2013),

researchers should explicitly model how heterogeneous households and firms respond to amenity

improvements. Third, analysts need to investigate the process through which changes in

household and firm composition impact other dimensions of local quality of life. For example, if

college graduates now move to a city because its air quality improves, how much does local

school quality improve by because there is greater property tax revenue collected and a better

local peer group? By combining these pieces of information, researchers should seek to

separately identify both the direct partial equilibrium effect and the indirect equilibrium

responses caused by the amenity improvement.



     V.       The Urban Building Stock’s Energy Consumption


          In this section, we study how urban growth contributes to greenhouse gas production by

exploring how the geography and the physical attributes of the extant urban real estate stock

affects aggregate electricity demand.           We focus on five key links between energy economics

and urban economics. First, from the standard monocentric model buildings closer to the city


29
  The developing world’s cities offer a number of natural experiments . For example, Cesur et. al. (2013) document
the spatial roll out of natural gas access across Turkey’s cities. They demonstrate how this cleaner fuel substitutes
for coal and thus improves local air quality and reduces infant mortality. Greenstone and Hanna (2011) document
how the phase-in of vehicle control regulations in India’s cities has reduced local air pollution and infant mortality.
Zheng et. al. (2014) document the changing industrial patterns of China’s dirty industry as it moves away from the
coasts. All of these cases share the same structure such that there is a large change in the spatial distribution of
pollution allowing researchers to estimate sorting models to recover estimates of the willingness to pay for
environmental public goods.

                                                                                                                     63
center are likely to be taller and thus less likely to feature a single tenant living or working there.

As we discuss below, in such cases a split incentives problem arises. Second, due to the

durability of the capital stock older buildings are likely to be closer to the city center. Because

energy regulations tend to focus on new construction, this suggests that there will be important

spatial differences in energy intensity. Third, geographic areas differ with respect to climate

conditions, local electricity pricing, energy efficiency regulation and incentives for conservation.

A recent literature has sought to quantify the importance of these factors. Fourth, the types of

households and firms that choose to locate in a metropolitan area may influence the demand for

solar homes and LEED certified buildings. Environmental ideology, in addition to economic

incentives such as minimizing operating expenses, may play a key role in determining the

demand for green buildings.


     A. Pollution Externalities Associated with Electricity Consumption


        In 2012, residential and commercial buildings were responsible for 74% of total

electricity consumption in the United States.30 Given that electricity continues to be generated

using fossil fuels (for example coal is the fuel source for 70% of India’s power and more than

70% in China), urban real estate is a major producer of global greenhouse gas emissions. As

nations such as China erect hundreds of new housing and commercial towers that will last for

decades, it becomes of even greater importance to study the investment decisions in energy

efficiency made by real estate developers, building owners and their tenants. In the absence of a

global carbon pricing, nations are likely to continue to rely on dirty fossil fuels such as coal and




30

http://buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/docs/xls_pdf/1.1.9.pdf

                                                                                                      64
natural gas for power generation.    Such cheap fossil fuels exacerbate the climate change

externality.


       Coal fired power plants are major producers of a large vector of local pollutants that can

cause significant harm to health and aesthetics (Davis 2011). The economic magnitude of these

localized damages hinges on how many people live downwind from these power plants and their

individual willingness to pay to not be exposed to pollution. Studies based on data from the

United States and from China have estimated large Pigouvian social costs associated with the use

of fossil fuel fired power plants (Muller and Mendelsohn 2007, Muller et. al. 2011, Zhou et. al

2006). In the United States today, fewer coal fired power plants are being built and some are

being shut down. The composition shift from coal to natural gas fired power plants should

reduce both the local and global greenhouse gas externality associated with electricity

consumption. This in turn suggests that, if major reductions can be achieved in the carbon

intensity of electricity, the Pigouvian benefits of green buildings (relative to conventional

buildings) will shrink as the carbon externality from electricity consumption shrinks.




   B. The Building Stock’s Energy Consumption: A Bottom Up Approach


       At any point in time the urban real estate stock is a mixture of residential, commercial

and industrial buildings of different vintages and sizes. In the past, empirical work aimed at

understanding the role of these different factors in determining energy consumption was limited

by a reliance on highly aggregated data such as per capita energy consumption collected at the

nation/year level. In this new Big Data era, researchers have increased access to highly

disaggregated data from the electric utilities that supply the power. These detailed data sets


                                                                                                  65
provide consumption information by customer account at monthly, and sometimes even hourly,

frequencies. Explaining cross-sectional and temporal variation in residential and commercial

electricity consumption has become an active research topic. By merging data from the electric

utilities with structural characteristics taken from local appraiser’s offices or from databases such

as the CoStar data, researchers can observe a building’s attributes, its location, and its energy

consumption. Given that buildings differ along a number of attributes, researchers are now able

to decompose what portion of a building’s energy consumption is due to such factors as: the

physical attributes of the building; its location’s regulatory structure; energy prices; and, local

climate conditions.


       It is useful to consider a simple model of a city’s energy consumption. In terms of

residential energy consumption, assume that there are four key factors that determine an

individual household’s energy consumption: characteristics of the household members

themselves (number, age structure, income, preferences); the characteristics of the structure in

which they live (size, vintage, quality, efficiency investments, etc.); the climate in which the

housing unit is located; and the price paid for energy. For the industrial sector, we aggregate

each industrial sector to the level of a representative firm. Each industrial sector’s total

electricity consumption is a function of its scale of activity in a given city its baseline energy

intensity, climate and energy prices.


       Under these assumptions, the total energy consumption of the residential sector for city j

at time t can be written as:

                                           ,           ,          ,                 . (13)




                                                                                                      66
In the right hand side of equation (13), H represents the continuum of household types the

distribution of which in a particular city j is given by          . .          . is a function that maps the

characteristics of household members and the structure in which they live – each of which vary

by household type h – along with the climate and energy price vectors experienced in city j into

average energy demand.           is the total number of households in city j.


        Similarly, we can represent the total industrial consumption in city j as:


                      ∑∈                     ,                ,                       (14)




where I represents the set of industries in the economy,                   captures the scale of industry in

city j, and ef iency represents the average energy efficiency of firms in industry i that are

located in city j.


        The total greenhouse gas emissions associated with this consumption equals the sum of

each of these sector’s electricity consumption and then multiplied by the city j’s electric power

region’s emissions factor. EGRID data from the U.S EPA allows one to calculate the tons of

carbon dioxide per megawatt of power by region by year (see

http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/). A standard number is that that the

social cost of carbon dioxide is $35 per ton. These numbers can be used to translate electricity

consumption into a bottom line social cost of carbon dioxide estimate.31



31
  A second negative externality from electricity consumption is local air pollution. The EGRID data can be used to
calculate the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and mercury emissions associated with local power
consumption. These emissions may drift far from the origin city to geographic locations downwind of the power
plants (see Bayer, Keohane and Timmons 2009). In this sense, the consumption of electricity does not necessarily
have local impacts on the city because power is generated in the region not in the locale.


                                                                                                                 67
       This accounting algebra highlights several micro economic channels through which a

city’s evolving building stock influences overall city energy consumption dynamics. For

example, in the very first issue of the Journal of Urban Economics, Harrison and Kain (1974)

called attention to the importance of durable capital as a defining characteristic of cities. Over

time, newer homes tend to be larger than older homes due to overall income growth. At any

point in time, a city’s building stock will be a mixture of different vintages. In cities with no

new construction such as Detroit, buildings built more than 40 years ago can be a large share of

the total stock. In recent years, such studies as Glaeser and Gyourko (2005) and Brueckner and

Rosenthal (2010) have examined the role that housing durability plays in determining a city’s

urban form.


       From an analysis perspective, it is critical to understand, and control for, the interplay

among these different channels (building stock, climate, energy prices, urban geography, etc.)

when evaluating the impact of new policies. For example, if Detroit has no new housing being

constructed --- does it, at baseline, have a much higher electricity consumption per square foot

for its average housing stock than a similar city where old homes are being scrapped and new

homes are being built? If so, then these differences must be accounted for when making cross-

location policy comparisons.


       Over time, energy efficiency codes for new buildings have been tightened (see

http://www.energycodes.gov/regulations). Given the durability of the building stock, the average

energy intensity may only be affected after several years have passed. Recent research has

investigated the effectiveness of past building codes regulation. Jacobson and Kotchen (2013)

collected data for roughly 2000 Gainesville Florida homes built at different dates. They compare




                                                                                                     68
the energy consumption of buildings built just before and after the regulatory changes

(introduced in 2001) and find that the regulation is associated with a 4% reduction in electricity

consumption and a 6% reduction in natural gas.


       The third term in equations (13) and (14) is local climate conditions. Both residential

and commercial real estate will consume more electricity in more humid hotter summer areas.

Researchers have estimated the relationship between summer cooling degree days using both

cross-sectional and panel approaches (Glaeser and Kahn 2008, Miller et. al. 2008,

Aroonruengswat and Auffhammer 2011).


       The basic micro economic model here is a Becker Household Production Function. A

household seeks comfort and higher outdoor temperature reduces comfort. Greater expenditures

on air conditioning offsets the outdoor temperature. The marginal cost of reducing the indoor

temperature by one degrees is a function of the efficiency of the air conditioning unit and the

price of electricity. The rational household sets the thermostat so that the marginal benefits of

temperature reduction just equals the marginal cost of temperature reduction. In cooler cities

such as San Francisco, such comfort can be produced using fewer market inputs and in fact many

households do not own a central air conditioner. The wide spread diffusion of air conditioning

over the 20th century has allowed U.S households to enjoy the winter warmth of cities such as

Las Vegas and Phoenix without suffering from the summer heat (Oi 1996, Barreca et. al. 2013).

In this sense, market products can offset parts of a tied spatial local bundle. California is one of

the rare locations in the world to feature temperate winters and summers.




                                                                                                     69
       C. Weak Price Incentives for Conservation


           For a typical single family home owner, their annual electricity bill is typically around

$1200 per year.32         The marginal cost in terms of effort of achieving a 15% reduction in

electricity consumption might exceed the cost savings given current electricity prices. Wolak

(2011) presents a bounded rationality model featuring a cost of action such that residential home

owners are only willing to take costly actions (i.e turning off the lights) if the financial savings in

lower electricity bills covers the cost of taking such an action. His analysis suggests in areas

with higher electricity prices that the residential sector will be more energy efficient because

there is “more money on the table”. In addition to the impact of the price levels per se,

households are confronted with a complicated electricity bill structure. Many electric utilities

charge households on an increasing block tariff structure such that the price schedule resembles a

staircase with a rising marginal price that jumps when consumption exceeds specific thresholds.

For example, in Southern California electricity consumers face a rate schedule with five steps

with the highest price being over 30 cents per kWh. Ito (2014) employs a regression

discontinuity design and demonstrates that Southern California electricity consumers respond to

average prices not marginal prices. A notable feature of his research design is that he compares

the consumption of nearby homes that are located in adjacent electric utility districts. This

means that there is within neighbor variation in the price of electricity. Ito exploits this and

estimates an average price elasticity of consumption of roughly -.12. This suggests that

residential consumers are not very price responsive. Recognizing this fact, utilities have sought

innovative tools for encouraging conservation. Some have appealed to public conservation

campaigns. Reiss and White (2008) present evidence that these can be effective in the short run.

     http://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf

                                                                                                       70
A more novel approach is to distribute Home Energy Reports which are customizes reports

educating households on how their consumption of electricity compares to their neighbors. Such

peer pressure has been claimed to be an effective social incentive for encouraging conservation.

Allcott’s (2011) evaluation of these reports’ impact indicates that they reduce consumption by

2%. These various research designs highlight that there is still the open question of how to make

energy efficiency a more salient feature for households to consider. Higher electricity prices

would clearly provide an incentive for households to invest more effort studying this issue.

International evidence would be valuable here.


       New technologies such as smart meters allows households to observe their electricity

consumption every 15 minutes and to see how different devices in the home use different

amounts of electricity. In the past, households received a bundled monthly bill telling them their

aggregate consumption and total expenditure. With the falling cost of installing smart meters,

the cost for electricity consumers of being educated about how different actions such as turning

on the lights or running the air conditioner are falling. Such educated consumers should be more

sophisticated shoppers for durables that reduce their operating costs and in aggregate improve

overall energy efficiency. Field experiments, perhaps randomizing who receives a smart meter,

testing this claim would be very useful.


   D. The Commercial Real Estate Sector


       In many cities, the commercial real estate sector (i.e office buildings, malls, stores,

restaurants) represents a large share of the total real estate stock but there has been surprisingly

little research on this sector’s economic behavior. Until recently, the lack of data has slowed

research. The DOE’s Commercial Buildings Energy Survey (CBECS) was last conducted in



                                                                                                       71
2003.   In some cases, research partnerships with electric utilities and with private major

companies have allowed researchers access to unique micro data that has allowed for progress.


        Kahn, Kok and Quigley (2014) partnered with a major Western Electric Utility who

provided billing account data for every commercial account in their service area. This research

team matched these data to the CoStar data. CoStar sells data for buildings that have transacted

in the previous ten year. By matching the two data sets, the researchers observed each building’s

monthly electricity consumption and had access to a large set of building attributes including its

real estate quality, size, year built and the tenant roster. They used these data to estimate

regressions such as those reported in equation (15)



         ln        ∙X            ∙                                                        (15)


        In this equation, the dependent variable yi is natural logarithm of average daily electricity

consumption per square foot. Xi is a vector of the structural characteristics of building i,

including building size, vintage, and quality. To control for the impact of occupants on building

energy consumption, we also include Ti, a vector of variables measuring the percentage of the

building that is occupied by each industry n, based on their SIC classification. ε is an error term,

assumed to be i.i.d.


        Kahn, Kok and Quigley (2014) report that newer vintages of commercial real estate

consume more electricity than older vintages and Class “A” higher quality real estate consumes

more electricity than lower quality real estate. They interpret these results to mean that a

building’s quality to its users and electricity inputs are complements. Given that building

quality is likely to be a normal good, this suggests that rising incomes in cities around the world



                                                                                                   72
will lead to increased commercial building electricity consumption. They also find that tenant

contract terms matter. When tenants pay their own electricity bills through triple net leases they

consume less electricity. Government tenants, who presumably face soft budget constraints,

consume more electricity.


   i.      Commercial Real Estate Energy Efficiency and Human Capital


        A key difference between residential single family homes and commercial entities is that

the former are small utility maximizers while the latter are large profit maximizers. In contrast

to the large number of residential households, each of whom spend relatively little on electricity

bills, commercial electricity consumers are fewer in number and have much larger electricity

bills. Kahn and Kok (2014) study Walmart’s electricity consumption across its 220 California

stores using monthly data provided by the company covering the years 2006 to 2012. The

company provided additional data on each Walmart’s store’s climate conditions, year built, and

the size and purpose of the store. Kahn and Kok use as a control group a set of other major retail

stores that are independently managed but of the same size and age as these Walmart stores. In

comparing the electricity consumption across these two sets an interesting pattern emerges. The

Walmart stores feature almost no cross-store variation in their electricity consumption per square

foot. Using their management systems, Walmart has standardized efficiency gains in electricity

consumption. A human capital explanation for this is that Walmart’s size is such that it is cost

effective for it to invest in high quality managers who focus on energy efficiency and then apply

the cost-saving innovations that they identify to each of its stores. This claim mirrors an

argument explored by Bloom et. al. (2010) who find that higher quality managers of UK

manufacturing plants use less electricity in producing output. This research agenda suggests that

there is an inverse relationship between corporate management quality and X-inefficiency.

                                                                                                     73
Given that electricity consumption contributes to the global climate change externality, this

hypothesis and the potential for economies of scale in achieving energy efficiency merits future

research.


   ii.      The Market for Green Buildings


         Urban residential and commercial structures are differentiated products. One attribute of

such products is their energy efficiency. Standard economic logic suggests that when the price

of electricity is high or is expected to rise (perhaps because a carbon tax is expected in the future)

that there will be greater demand for “green buildings”. An emerging vehicle demand literature

has documented that rising gasoline prices are associated with rising demand for fuel efficient

hybrid vehicles. (Li et. al. 2009, Beresteanu and Li 2011, Klier and Linn 2010). There are other

factors such as personal ideology that also correlate with demand for distinctive green cars such

as the Toyota Prius (Kahn 2007).     Gas prices are highly salient in that car drivers refuel on a

weekly basis. In contrast, many households never see their monthly electricity bill because they

pay with automatic billing. Sexton (2014) uses data from South Carolina and documents that

when households sign up for automatic billing payments that their electricity consumption

increases by 4% and commercial consumers increase their consumption by 8%. He attributes

these effects to the absence of salient bills as these consumers no longer are confronted with

what they are actually paying for electricity.


         While fuel economy is the defining attribute of a “green car”, in the case of “green

buildings” there continues to be an open debate about what objective attributes signal a

building’s “greenness”. The presence of solar panels is one possible definition. In the United

States, the government has played an active role in being a market maker. The Energy Star



                                                                                                     74
program, jointly sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S.

Department of Energy, is intended to identify and promote energy-efficient products, appliances,

and buildings. In a parallel effort, the U.S. Green Building Council, a private nonprofit

organization, has developed the LEED green building rating system to encourage the “adoption

of sustainable green building and development practices.”33 The inventory of certified green

commercial space in the U.S. has increased dramatically since the introduction of rating schemes

(Kok et al., 2011).


        A growing empirical hedonic real estate pricing literature has sought to estimate the

market capitalization of such green attributes using hedonic regressions of the form;


      log                      ∗                            ∗                            (16)


In this regression, the researcher controls for housing structure observables and includes

interactions of time and geographic fixed effects (for example zip code by year fixed effects).

Controlling for these variables, the researcher tests whether                 is positive.      One recent study

investigated the capitalization of solar panels into the price of homes in San Diego and

Sacramento County in California. Solar panels are a source of pride for environmentalist

households and lower the operating costs of owning a home. Dastrup et. al. 2012 find that all

else equal that solar homes sell for a 3% price premium. A plausible concern is that the presence

of solar panels is correlated with other unobserved measured of a structure’s quality. Using their

panel data on home sales, they observe some solar homes that sold before the solar system was

installed. They exploit this within home variation to establish that homes that in the future will

33
  The LEED label requires sustainability performance in areas beyond energy use, and the requirements for
certification of LEED buildings are substantially more complex than those for the award of an Energy Star rating.
The certification process for homes measures six distinct components of sustainability: sustainable sites, water
efficiency, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation, as well as energy performance.
Additional points can be obtained for proximity to public transport, and for awareness and education.

                                                                                                                    75
install solar panels do not sell for a price premium before such an installation.


       In another California hedonic real estate study, Kahn and Kok (2014) study the

capitalization of energy star and LEED homes in California. The control group are homes in the

same zip code and on the same street as the energy efficient homes sold at the same point in

time. Kahn and Kok report that Energy Star homes sell for a 3% price premium but LEED

homes do not sell for a price premium. The open question here pertains to what this label

premium represents in terms of the present value of saved operating expenses and in terms of

better indoor air quality and home performance.


       A home owner who wants solar panels faces a make versus buy decision. She can either

buy a home that already has them or purchase a home and have the system installed. This option

places restrictions on how high the solar price premium for resold homes can be. Over time due

to international competition, the price of a solar panels is declining. An emerging literature is

studying this adoption decision. State and national subsidies have certainly played a role in

encouraging the adoption of solar panels (Bollinger and Gillingham 2012). Kahn and Vaughn

(2009) document the clustering of LEED buildings in liberal/environmentalist states such as

California. An open topic concerns the diffusion of solar technology to cities in the developing

world. Such cities often suffer from grid reliability challenges and solar would allow households

to be independent.


      For the commercial real estate market, a series of papers that study investor and tenant

demand for “green” office space in the U.S. show that buildings with an Energy Star label –

indicating that a building belongs to the top 25 percent of the most energy-efficient buildings –

or a LEED label have rents that are two to three percent higher as compared to regular office



                                                                                                    76
buildings. Transaction prices for energy-efficient office buildings are higher by 13–16 percent.

Further analyses show that the cross-sectional variation in these premiums has a strong relation

to real energy consumption, indicating that tenants and investors in the commercial property

sector capitalize energy savings in their investment decisions (Eichholtz et al., 2010, 2013).


         There has also been recent research on the supply side of the green commercial buildings

market focused on the motivations of real estate owners and developers to compete on who “is

the most green”. The LEED certification has different levels of building greenness such as

silver, gold and platinum and the threshold of points needed to cross to a higher level of

greenness can be achieved through relatively minor investments (Noonan et. al. (2013), Matisoff

et. al. 2014). An open question is whether such a “green” arms race actually contributes to

overall sustainability goals such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The LEED criteria

include many indicators of sustainability (such as using recycled materials) while the Energy

Star criteria are more narrowly focused on energy consumption.34


           There are several possible next steps for this “value of green buildings” literature. Note

that hedonic regressions such as equation (16) do not control for the actual energy and water

consumption of the building. Suppose that in estimating equation (16) that the key explanatory

variable is a dummy that equals one if the building is LEED certified. If continuous indicators of

operating expenses could be observed, would the discrete certification dummy still be

capitalized? Given asymmetric information about a building’s actual operating costs, does the

green building dummy act as a coarse partition. Or, do green buildings perform better on other

criteria such as offering higher indoor air quality and hence raising worker productivity and

quality of life?     This literature could also explore whether green certification is more valuable

34
     http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs1095.pdf

                                                                                                       77
in areas with higher average electricity prices. By including such an interaction term, scholars

could study whether the demand for green buildings is mostly tied to minimizing operating costs.

Such research could mimic Ito’s (2014) spatial regression discontinuity design to observe the

pricing of nearby buildings located in different electric utility zones.


   iii.      Challenges in Increasing the Urban Real Estate’s Energy Efficiency


          Given the durability of the urban real estate stock, the vast majority of buildings are not

new. An ongoing effort seeks to increase the energy efficiency of this stock and many have

argued that the equilibrium is unlikely to be a pareto optimum because of information

asymmetries.


          Consider a car buyer. The Internet offers easy to access information on any make and

model’s miles per gallon. Marketing experts have argued that this should be expressed as

gallons per mile to help buyers calculate their annual operating expenses (Allcott 2011). In the

case of apartments, there is no analogous energy labelling. Potential renters are likely to be

unaware of what their monthly electricity bills will be in a building that they have never lived in

before. This information asymmetry poses a sustainability challenge because if potential renters

had full information about each apartment’s energy efficiency then the inefficient apartments

would rent for less (especially in areas featuring high electricity prices) and this would

incentivize the owners of these apartments to invest in greater energy efficiency.


          In recent years, California has passed new regulations (AB1103) requiring the owner or

operator to disclose the benchmarking data and rating to a prospective buyer, lessee of the entire

building, or lender that would finance the entire building based on a schedule of compliance

established by the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission.


                                                                                                        78
       Recent research has examined the role of energy labels using data from around the world.

The EU energy label seems to be quite effective in resolving the information asymmetry in

understanding the energy efficiency of dwellings: Brounen and Kok (2011) estimate hedonic

pricing gradients for recently sold homes in the Netherlands and document that homes receiving

an “A” label in terms of energy efficiency sell for a 10 percent price premium. It is relevant to

note that the Netherlands has chosen a color coded easy to understand educational labeling

system where homes are partitioned into those that receive an “A”, “B”, “C”, etc. This report

card system is similar to how North Carolina reports grades for local school district’s school

quality (Kane et. al. 2006).   In the case of Energy Star labelling, Houde (2014) uses a structural

model to document that consumers respond to labels in different ways such that some greatly

value such labels while others do not. The causes of these different responses merits future

research.


       Conversely, dwellings that are labeled as inefficient transact for substantial discounts

relative to otherwise comparable, standard homes. Similar evidence has been documented for

Singapore: Deng et al. (2012) find that homes labeled under the government-designed Green

Mark scheme sell for a 4 - 6 percent price premium. In China today, no one trusted set of

standards for ranking buildings exists (Zheng et. al. 2012). The emergence of trusted energy

efficiency standards is an important example of the public goods that developing country

governments can cheaply provide in furthering urban environmental sustainability.


       Electric utilities are becoming increasingly aware of the “power of Big Data” and are

actively working with academics to devise strategies for encouraging energy efficiency. In states

such as California where utilities must comply with a renewable portfolio standard (defined as

the ratio of green power purchased divided by total power generated), one cost effective strategy

                                                                                                    79
is to invest in energy efficiency and hence shrink the denominator. This regulatory pressure has

increased the willingness of utilities to introduce field experiments to learn about what strategies

are effective.


    iv.      The Renter/Owner Split Incentives Problem in Cities


          As predicted by the monocentric model, center cities are more likely to feature multi-

family apartment buildings and multi-tenant commercial buildings than will be found in the

distant suburbs. Such tall buildings offer significant economies of scale with respect to land

consumption but they raise issues of how to design proper energy efficiency incentives to

encourage efficient investment by both the owner of the building and his tenants (see Levinson

and Niemann 2004, Maruejols and Young 2011).


          Based on the year 2000 Census, 65% of metropolitan area housing units with five or

more units were located within ten miles of the CBD while 42% of the metropolitan area single

family housing stock was located within ten miles of the CBD. A “split-incentives” literature

has documented the energy efficiency challenge in multi-family housing (Levinson and Niemann

2004). If the owner of the apartment complex pays the energy bills, then the renter faces a zero

marginal cost for energy consumption. Since renters anticipate that they will not live in the

building for a long period, they are unlikely to update energy intensive durables such as the

refrigerator or other appliances that they cannot easily take with them to their next home. If the

renter pays the energy bills, then the owner has little incentive to invest in energy efficient

investments such as energy efficient windows or an energy efficient air conditioning system.

For evidence from the commercial real estate sector see Kahn, Kok and Quigley 2014.




                                                                                                   80
         This would appear to be a key example where a randomized field experiment research

design would yield valuable new knowledge. Suppose that a REIT was willing to select at

random which of its buildings in its portfolio that it would be willing to offer net leases versus

triple net leases. This randomization of rental contract terms would allow the researcher to study

how the building manager and the tenant change their behavior in the face of the new incentives.

By studying the dynamics of such buildings’ electricity consumption, the researcher could

estimate whether incentives matter for overall electricity consumption. The non-experimental

evidence reported in Kahn, Kok and Quigley (2014) and Levinson and Niemann (2004) suggest

that they do but a field experiment design would be more definitive.


   E. Carbon Pricing and the Building Stock’s Energy Efficiency


         At this point in time, the global free rider problem has precluded the adoption of the

global carbon tax. Such a credible policy would raise local electricity prices and incentivize

developers and owners of existing buildings to invest in energy efficiency. In many developing

nations today, a huge wave of urbanization is taking place. The investments made now will last

for decades. If the investors anticipate that carbon pricing will become a reality then they are

more likely to invest in energy efficiency now. Energy efficiency investments in new capital in

the developing world’s cities remains an important future research topic. Research on

endogenous innovation (see Acemoglu and Linn 2004) highlights an optimistic hypothesis. If

there is a growing global demand for “green buildings”, then this creates strong market

incentives for engineers to focus their efforts in creating such new varieties.   The empirical

induced innovation literature has consistently reported evidence of improvements in energy

efficiency of new products such as air conditioners shortly after energy prices rise (Newell et. al.

1998).

                                                                                                     81
VI. Conclusion

       In this chapter we have explored the connection between cities and the environment,

highlighting the bidirectional nature of this relationship. One set of the reviewed literature

examines the role that environmental amenities play in determining the economic geography of

where diverse households and firms locate both within cities and across cities. A second set of

relevant literature explores how a city’s economic geography and the composition of its durable

capital impact the environment – focusing largely on energy consumption and carbon emissions.


       We used the long run history of Pittsburgh to illustrate our sweeping theme that the

relationship between cities and their environment has changed over the last century in a

systematic way. This change has had a profound impact on where and how individuals and firms

choose to locate. These shifts in the geography of economic activity have in turn influenced

how cities impact the environment.


       In the past, as highlighted by the case of Pittsburgh, the comparative advantage of cities

was largely determined by access to transportation and productive resource that arose out of the

natural environment. As these cities grew into the economic engines that characterize the

industrial age, unchecked externalities severely impeded quality of life for their residents. Over

forty years ago, Nordhaus and Tobin (1972) wrote:


       “Many of the negative "externalities" of economic growth are connected with urbanization and congestion.
       The secular advances recorded in NNP figures have accompanied a vast migration from rural agriculture to
       urban industry. Without this occupational and residential revolution we could not have enjoyed the fruits of
       technological progress. But some portion of the higher earnings of urban residents may simply be
       compensation for the disamenities of urban life and work. If so we should not count as a gain of welfare the
       full increments of NNP that result from moving a man from farm or small town to city. The persistent
       association of higher wages with higher population densities offers one method of estimating the costs of
       urban life as they are valued by people making residential and occupational decisions.”




                                                                                                                 82
Due to a confluence of trends many cities have enjoyed a sharp improvement in their non-market

quality of life with many of these gains concentrated along environmental margins. As a result,

the requirement for big cities to provide “combat pay” has attenuated as non-market quality of

life has increased and is a complement of the modern consumer city.


        Air quality, water quality and energy efficiency have become an emergent property of

the industry, buildings, regulations, voters, and households who locate within a city’s borders.

Progress along these dimensions has been seen in cities such as Chicago, London and New York

City. Researchers see the start of similar trends in China. As demonstrated in work surveyed by

Zheng and Kahn (2013), China’s emerging system of cities is wrestling with many of these same

issues. Some of China’s cities are choosing to specialize in heavy industry and this is raising

pollution challenges. At the same time, rich Eastern Chinese cities are deindustrializing and

pollution is declining. As the urban middle class grows in cities around the world, more and

more citizens will demand non-market quality of life and environmental progress.




                                                                                                   83
