Tracing the Effects of Guaranteed Admission through the College Process: Evidence from
a Policy Discontinuity in the Texas 10% Plan

                                              ABSTRACT

The Texas 10% law states that students who graduated among the top 10% of their high school class
are guaranteed admission to public universities in Texas. We estimate the causal effects of this admissions
guarantee on a sequence of connected decisions: students’ application behavior, admission decisions
by the university, students’ enrollment choices conditional on admission; as well as the resulting college
achievement. We identify these effects by comparing students just above and just below the top 10%
rank cutoff. While this design is in the spirit of a regression discontinuity, we note important differences
in approach and interpretation. We find that students react to incentives created by the admissions
guarantee - for example, by reducing applications to competing private universities. The results also
suggest that the effects of the admissions guarantee depend on the university and the type of students
it attracts, and that the law is binding and alters the decisions of the admissions committees. We find
little evidence that the law increases diversity or leads to meaningful mismatch for the marginal student
admitted.

1. Introduction

The Texas 10% law states that a student who graduates among the top 10% of her high school

class is guaranteed admission to public universities in Texas. Consequently, students just inside

the top 10% and students just outside the top 10% are treated differently in the college

admissions process. This leads to different incentives for the two groups of students and

different treatment of these students by the admissions committees at the schools. Ultimately,

the differential treatment by the law and the resulting choices can lead to differences in

educational outcomes.

       In this paper, we examine the effects of the 10% rule on a sequence of connected

decisions: students’ application behavior, admission decisions by the university, students’

enrollment choices conditional on admission; as well as the resulting college achievement.

Intuitively, our identification strategy amounts to comparing students just above and just below

the top 10% high school class rank cutoff. We examine if we are able to detect a discrete jump in

probabilities of application, admission, or enrollment at the top 10% cutoff. Then, we look for

discontinuities in student performance conditional on these decisions.

       We make two contributions. First, we estimate the behavioral consequences of an

admissions guarantee. Second, under the assumption that the total number of slots at a university

is fixed (in the short term) we can contribute to the evaluation of the 10% rule by comparing the

marginal student enrolled due to the rule to the marginal student not enrolled due to the rule.

       We use complete administrative data from the two flagship universities: the University of

Texas at Austin (UT) and Texas A&M University at College Station (A&M). We do not find

evidence that the admissions guarantee increases applications to a specific flagship university.

We do find some limited evidence that the law affects the characteristics of applicants. For



                                                 2
example, the admissions guarantee seems to encourage students with lower SAT scores to apply

to Texas A&M. At UT it leads to slightly more applicants from high schools that traditionally do

not send many students to the university, suggesting a broadening of the applicant pool related to

the law. Our results also suggest spillover effects on applications to institutions not covered by

the law. The admissions guarantee to public universities leads to a drop in applications to private

universities (Rice and SMU), suggesting that guaranteed admission at UT or A&M makes

applications to the private schools less valuable.

       We are able to show that the 10% law is binding and does alter admissions decisions

conditional on application – mainly at the University of Texas at Austin. While students in the

top 10% are always admitted, students just outside the top 10% have an 80% acceptance rate at

UT and a 95% rate at A&M.

       On the margin, the admissions guarantee changes the characteristics of the admitted

students conditional on application. At UT it leads to more admissions of students from ethnic

minorities and from high schools that traditionally provide few students to the university. At

both universities it leads to the admission of more female students. In contrast, we find no

differences in the SAT test score performance for students admitted with or without admissions

guarantee.

       Conditional on admission, students in the top high school decile are more likely to enroll

at A&M than students just outside the top decile, which suggests that the admissions guarantee

leads to applications of students for whom A&M is the preferred school among their eventual

options. At UT the result is reversed. It is possible that students in the top 10% of their high

school use UT as their backup plan—a “high quality safety school” with guaranteed admission.

If they are admitted at a preferred school, they do not enroll at UT.




                                                     3
           Next, we look at the students who eventually enroll at A&M or UT. Holding the total

number of university students fixed, on the margin the 10% rule leads to the enrollment of

students in the top 10% at the expense of students below the top 10%. The law helps to increase

diversity if enrolled students just inside the top 10% of their high school are more likely to be

members of a minority than students just outside the top 10%. If the students just inside the top

10% are less well prepared they are expected to perform less well – the 10% rule induces

“mismatch”.

           At both universities, the marginal student from the top 10% of her high school class is

more likely to be female and less likely from a feeder high school (those with histories of

sending students to the university). We find some weak evidence that the 10% rule increases

minority enrollment at UT, otherwise we cannot detect differences in the characteristics between

enrolled students who graduated just inside or just outside the top high school decile. At A&M

there is no evidence that students with a prior admissions guarantee perform worse than similar

students without guaranteed admission. At UT we find mixed evidence. Students from the top

high school decile tend to choose easier majors1 and are slightly less likely to stay enrolled for

more than 3 years, but we find no evidence of an effect on GPA.

           With these general findings outlined, we now consider how the law could affect

individuals along the multiple decisions we examine, discuss the data and empirical design,

present our full set of results and robustness checks, and conclude.



2. Background of the Law and Related Research

Policy makers have a history of attempting to broaden access to higher education and to increase

the enrollment of minorities at colleges and universities.2 But a consensus about the appropriate

policies to achieve these goals has not been reached. Race based admissions policies, such as

affirmative action, have been challenged in court and it is not clear what their role will be in the

future.3 In this paper, we evaluate a policy that attempts to broaden access to higher education

and to increase minority enrollment, and was implemented in part as a substitute for race based

admissions policies.

         The 1996 Hopwood decision by the 5th Circuit Court required Texas universities to

discontinue the use of race as an admissions criterion. One response was the “Texas top 10%

law”, established when Governor George W. Bush signed Texas House Bill 588 into law on May

20th 1997.

The law states that:

         “Each general academic teaching institution shall admit an applicant for admission to

         the institution as an undergraduate student if the applicant graduated in one of the two

         school years preceding the academic year for which the applicant is applying for

         admission from a public or private high school in this state accredited by a generally

         recognized accrediting organization with a grade point average in the top 10 percent of

         the student's high school graduating class.“4

  See Bowen and Bok (1988) for a detailed discussion.

  Supreme Court decisions on the issue include the 1978 Regents of the University of California v. Bakke decision
that allowed the use of Race only as one many factors in the admissions process, and the 2003 Gratz v. Bollinger
and Grutter v. Bollinger rulings that prevent public universities from giving automatic advantages based on race or
ethnicity but allow the consideration of race and ethnicity when assessing individuals on a case by case basis.
Currently, the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that challenges the policy of the University of Texas to
consider race in the admissions process of those not covered by the 10% law discussed here.

  Where general academic teaching institution refers to the public universities and colleges in Texas (see section
61.003 of the Texas education code).

        The Texas House Research Organization Bill Analysis of HB 588 (1997) documents that

its proponents argued that due to the level of segregation at Texas high schools the policy “would

provide a diverse population and ensure that a large, well qualified pool of minority students was

admitted to Texas universities.” Proponents wanted to “establish a fair, race-neutral admissions

structure providing students from all backgrounds and parts of the state an opportunity to

continue their educations.” Opponents were concerned that the law could distort the admissions

process and argued that “Universities should retain the authority to make such decisions and

implement policies that best suit their individual needs and that will best help them meet their

goals and educate their student bodies.”

        Partly due to the controversies with the law’s passage, several empirical evaluations of

the 10% law have been conducted across a number of disciplines. One key focus of research has

been in examining whether the law changed the proportion of minority students at flagship

campuses in Texas. A second focus has been on whether the students who attend these

universities due to admission guarantees experience worse college outcomes, due to potential

mismatch of students to universities. The general findings suggest that minority enrollment

increased due to the law but not to the levels before the affirmative action ban in 1997.5 Few

studies have supported claims of “mismatch”: the admission of less well prepared students from

inside the top decile at the expense of better prepared students from outside the top decile.6

Several papers suggest that the admissions guarantee has increased applications from students in

the top decile of their high schools and widened the pool of high schools that provide these

applicants.7 A common empirical strategy of these studies has been a pre/post analysis – the

downside of this approach is that other factors may change simultaneously with the

implementation of the law. We use a different identification strategy, which relies on the

discontinuity introduced by the law and thus makes comparisons between students in the post-

Top 10% Law regime who all face the same rules. Our strategy thus provides complementary

evidence with previous research that used pre/post analysis.

        In a separate branch of the literature, several researchers have used the Top 10% Law in

a regression discontinuity (RD) framework. They primarily focus on estimating the “treatment”

of attending a more selective college on later outcomes, such as college success (Cortes, 2010

and Furstenberg, 2010) and post-college wages. Thus, these papers focus on the “treatment” of

attending a selective college versus the “control group” who attended a less selective college due

to the Top 10% law.

       In the current paper and in Tienda and Niu (2010) an alternative framework is used to

investigate a different “treatment”: guaranteed admission due to a students’ high school rank.

Tienda and Niu utilize survey data of Texas high school graduates and find that the 10% rule

increases overall college enrollment of students from the top 10% of their high school.

Moreover, it increases enrollment of eligible Hispanic students and students from predominately

minority high schools at the University of Texas and Texas A&M University.

       In this paper, we use the policy discontinuity to examine multiple connected behavioral

changes induced by the admissions guarantee. However, our paper does not use a traditional RD

design. Instead, we leverage the notion of an underlying continuous distribution of individuals

based on high school rank who are treated differently during several aspects of the college

decision process based on a policy discontinuity. In this way, we analyze the effects of the

admission guarantee on application, admission, and enrollment. Finally, we examine the




                                                7
implications for student performance in college. Thus, our paper does not evaluate the effects of

attending a selective college (i.e. the RD literature in this area) and it goes beyond the evaluation

of the effects of the 10% law on enrollment (i.e. many of the pre/post analyses). Instead it more

comprehensively evaluates the multiple potential effects of the admissions guarantee on a series

of related decisions that affect higher education outcomes using a common empirical framework.




3. Potential Effects of the guaranteed college admission

The 10 % rule mandates that students who graduate in the top 10% of their high school classes

are guaranteed admission by any state university in Texas. This leads to differences in incentives

between students who graduated in the top 10% of their high school and students who graduated

just below the top 10%; potentially resulting in differences in application and enrollment

patterns, as well as differences in academic achievement between these two groups.



Application

Students in the top 10% of their high school class know that their admission to a state school in

Texas is guaranteed. This guarantee increases the benefit of an application to such a school. At

the same time the guaranteed admission reduces the need to insure against non-admission, which

reduces the benefit to applying to other schools – these other schools could be less preferred state

schools or private universities. Additionally, a student with high test-scores has a high

probability of admission without an admission guarantee, so that the guarantee could affect her

less than students with low test-scores. Hence the behavioral differences between students just




                                                  8
inside and outside the top decile are expected to decrease in test-scores. A similar story can be

told for other characteristics that are correlated with admissions probability.



Admission

The composition of admitted students depends on the decision to apply and admission

conditional on application. The 10% law affects admissions directly by mandating that all

students in the top 10% of their high school classes must be admitted and indirectly by changing

the composition of applicants. Students outside the top 10% continue to be admitted at the

discretion of the admissions committees of the universities.

        First, we ask whether the law is binding in general, or would the students in the top 10%

of their high school classes have been admitted anyway? We address this question by comparing

the admissions probabilities of students in the 90th and 89th high school percentiles, conditional

on application.

       Second, we ask more specifically, does the law change the composition of admitted

students – conditional on application? To isolate the marginal effects of the law on student

characteristics we compare the characteristics of admitted students just inside the top decile to

students just outside the top decile. The composition of admitted students just outside of top 10%

reflects the preferences of the admissions committee. Without the law, some of the students in

the top 10% might not be admitted if their characteristics differ from those valued by the

committee. Holding the total number of university students fixed, on the margin the 10% rule

leads to the enrollment of students in the top 10% at the expense of students just below the top

10%.




                                                  9
Enrollment

The eventual enrollment depends on the decision to apply, the admission decision by the

committee, and the decision to enroll, conditional on application and admission. First, we

examine the decisions made by students to accept admission. Theoretically, the effect is

ambiguous – the admissions guarantee might induce students to only apply to their preferred

school and enroll at that school so that the effect of the law is to increase enrollment rates,

conditional on acceptance. Another possibility is that the admissions guarantee makes a state

school valuable to insure against non-admission at a preferred non-state school. That is, it

provides a “safety school” of high quality. This could lead to lower rates of enrollment

conditional on acceptance.

       To study the marginal effect (the result of application, admission and acceptance) of the

law on the composition of the student body at the two flagship schools we consider enrolled

students and compare the characteristics of students who graduated just inside the top 10% of

their high school class to the characteristics of students just outside the top 10%. If students just

inside the top 10% are more likely to be member of a minority than students just outside the top

10%, the policy increases diversity.



College Achievement

By comparing students just above and below the automatic admission threshold, it is possible to

examine the “mismatch” hypothesis. If students just inside the top 10% perform worse than

students just outside the top 10%, we can infer that the policy leads to mismatch. Mismatch

could happen for a number of reasons; for example, high school rank could be a worse predictor

of college performance than the index of characteristics considered by an ordinary admissions




                                                  10
process. On the other hand, if the ordinary admissions process places too large a weight on SAT

scores and/or other characteristics such as legacy status and too small a weight on high school

class rank, the policy could provide lower mismatch.




4. Data

In order to examine the effects of the law, we use administrative data from several public and

private universities in Texas. Because the law only applies to Texas residents, we focus our

analysis on these students. We focus on the flagship institutions: the University of Texas-Austin

and Texas A&M University, though we also examine potential spillover effects on Rice

University and SMU. These data were collected under the auspices of the Texas Higher

Education Opportunity Project, and we focus on data collected during the years of the Top 10%

law (1999-2002).8

         Two types of administrative records are available for each university. A baseline file

includes all students who applied in a given year, their admission decision, and conditional on

acceptance, their enrollment decision. The baseline file also contains a large set of student

characteristics, including high school rank, SAT/ACT score, race, gender, identifiers of high

school of origin, and other measures. For matriculants, a term file records various measures of

academic progress, notably persistence, GPA, choice of major, and graduation status for each

semester enrolled.

         Descriptive statistics for the analysis samples (near the high school rank threshold) for

TAMU and UT-Austin are presented in Table 1. Appendix Table 1 shows results for the full

sample. Admission rates around the top 10% cutoff are 89% at UT and 94% at TAMU; the

8
 THEOP is a longitudinal study of college-going in Texas designed to understand the consequences of changing
admissions regimes after 1996. The description of this project is available at http://theop.princeton.edu/index.html


                                                         11
appendix table shows the rates for the full sample of applicants is 73% for each school.

Unconditional enrollment rates are approximately 58-60% of all applicants. Minority (African

American/Hispanic) students make up 23% of applicants at UT and 15% at TAMU. Students

from “feeder” high schools comprise 21% of UT applicants and 15% of TAMU applicants. The

average SAT score for UT applicants was 1189 and 1146 at TAMU. The table also presents

these summary statistics conditional on admission and enrollment decisions. Finally, descriptive

statistics are shown for several college success measures, including GPA, persistence, graduation

rates, and choice of major.




5. Empirical Specifications and Results

Our empirical strategy is to compare students “close” to a 90th-percentile high school class rank

for a range of outcomes, including application decisions by the students, admission decisions by

the universities, enrollment decisions by the admitted students, and student college outcomes of

enrollees.

         Our identification strategy relies on the notion that students who are ranked in the 89th

percentile in their graduating class provide a good counterfactual to students ranked in the 90th

percentile. In order for this assumption to be valid, high school student characteristics should be

continuous through the threshold.9

         We also assume that each percentile of high school graduates contains the same number

of individuals. This assumption technically holds by definition and allows us to use data on

applications only. We do not require the data on all high school graduates. However, since the


9
 We highlight again here that the student characteristics that should be continuous through the threshold are the
population of high school students from the state of Texas, not necessarily the population of students who have
applied to universities in Texas. Indeed, the latter is a test of the policy rather than a test of the research design.


                                                            12
public universities allowed students to use either their class rank during the fall or spring

semester of their senior year, there could be some shifts in the distribution of the measured high

school class rank variable. Tienda and Niu (2010) find no evidence for such a shift. They

investigate survey data covering all high school graduates and report “… no significant

‘clumping’ around the 10th percentile [the 90th percentile in our terminology] class rank.” If

selective reporting does lead to a shift of the distribution from outside the top 10% into the top

10% we would – ceteris paribus – observe more college applications with high school ranks just

inside the top 10% than just outside the top 10%.

         We consider four sequential stages: First, students decide whether to apply to a

university. Second, the university’s admissions committee decides whether to admit a student.

Third, admitted students decide whether to enroll. Fourth, enrolled students obtain an outcome in

the form of grades or graduation. We briefly discuss potential effects at each stage in turn 10.



Responses to the Law 1: Student Application Patterns

We first examine application decisions of students. We estimate whether the admissions

guarantee increases or decreases the probability that a student applies to UT, A&M, or a private

university in Texas.

         In order to examine the application patterns in the data, we define 1/10th of a percentile

bins for the high school rank and count the number of applicants in each bin. As mentioned

above we assume that the number of high school graduates in each bin is continuous at the 90th

percentile in the high school class rank distribution, where the top 10% law is implemented (i.e.,

the number of graduates between the 89.9th and 90th percentile is equal to the number of

10
  We also note that our analysis is potentially missing a “pre-application” stage, where students might be able to
shift their effort levels in high school in order to qualify for guaranteed admission. Our results should be viewed
with this caveat in mind.


                                                          13
graduates between the 90th and 90.1th percentile). Our second assumption is that without the top

10% rule the probability of applying to a university is continuous at the 90th percentile.

Consequently, without the 10% rule the number of applicants would be continuous at 90th

percentile; any discontinuity can be interpreted as the result of the top 10% rule.

        Figure 1 displays the raw data as well as a lowess smoother of the number of applicants

by 1/2 percentile bins between the 85th and 95th percentiles, centered at the 90th percentile. The

figure shows the results for UT-Austin on top and for Texas A&M on the bottom. For either

school, there is some evidence of increases in application rates slightly above the 90th percentile

(particularly at the 91st percentile).

        To formally investigate whether the number of applicants jumps at the 90th percentile we

use a local linear regression to detect a jump at the 90th high school percentile. We estimate:

         # applicants r   g  r  c   D   D g  r  c   u ,
                        i        i           i    1   i   i                          (1)

Where r indicates high school class rank, c indicates the class-rank cutoff, g .  is a continuous

function, the dummy variable D captures changes at the threshold ( Di   if ri  c , and Di   if

ri  c ), and the associated coefficient  captures jumps at the threshold. The results for UT and

A&M are displayed in columns (1) and (4) of Table 2. Following Lee and Card (2008), standard

errors are clustered on the running variable (high school rank). For both universities, we find

evidence of increases in application rates due to the admissions guarantee, though the increase at

UT is not precisely estimated11. Note again that, although we only have data on applications

(and not those who did not apply), our test of the effects of the Top 10% plan on applicant

behavior is based on our assumption of an underlying continuous set of individuals who could

apply. This assumption follows from the fact that each percentile of high school graduates
11
  We find increases in the number of students in the bins of approximately 120 (UT) and 200 (TAMU), where the
bin-sizes are 526 students at UT and 423 students at TAMU.

contains the same number of individuals and technically holds by definition, allowing us to use

data on applications only. 12

         As we discuss above, the law could also have spillover effects on other universities. For

example, guaranteed admission to the flagship schools could lower the likelihood of applying to

other universities. While we do not have data on the complete application portfolios of students,

we do have data on several other Texas universities. In particular, we examine two private

universities that compete with the flagship universities for high performing students: Rice

University and Southern Methodist University (SMU). We pool these schools and focus on

overlapping years of available applications data in order to increase sample size: 2000-2004.

Figure 2 displays the number of applicants for each 1/2 percentile below and above the 90th

percentile. Estimating (1) for the private universities provides evidence of reductions for

students in the top decile in their graduating class. Column (7) of Table 2 displays an estimate for

 . Individuals who are guaranteed admission to a flagship school are less likely to apply to

SMU or Rice.

         Next, we examine whether the characteristics of applicants changes around the cutoff. In

traditional RD designs, this exercise would be a test of whether the covariates are “smooth”

across the threshold. However, in our case, we are not testing this smoothness assumption;

rather, we are leveraging the underlying smoothness in population characteristics around this

arbitrary policy discontinuity to examine whether the policy affected the distribution of the

characteristics of students who applied to the universities in our database. We will interpret any

changes in the characteristics as evidence of a policy effect. We estimate the following

regression model:

12
  If our assumption of a uniform class rank distribution is violated and there are more students in the percentiles just
inside the top 10% than outside the top 10% - the reduced need to apply to multiple universities under guaranteed
admission outweighs the benefit of applying from the admissions guarantee.

where X i captures a characteristic of the applicant pool. The coefficient of interest is  , which

measures whether the characteristics of applicants change discontinuously at the threshold. We

focus on student race/ethnicity, gender, SAT scores, and high school of origin. The results are

shown in Table 3. We do not find evidence that the admissions guarantee has different effects on

the application decisions of minority or non-minority students. For UT, we find evidence that

students who are slightly above the threshold are 2 percentage points less likely to be from feeder

high schools. This suggests that students from non-feeder high schools are encouraged to apply

to UT by the admissions guarantee. For A&M the point estimate for feeder schools is similar but

the result is not statistically significant. For SAT test scores, we find no connection between the

admissions guarantee and application behavior at UT. For A&M, however, we find evidence

that SAT scores of students slightly above the threshold are about 1/10 of a standard deviation

lower than those of students right below the threshold. We interpret this to mean that the

admissions guarantee encourages students with lower SAT scores to apply to Texas A&M.13



Responses to the Law 2: Admission

While the top 10% law guarantees admission for students in the top high school decile, we next

examine if these students would have been admitted without the rule. For all applicants to a

school we estimate:

            Admiti  g  ri  c   Di  1Di g  ri  c   ui ,

where Admiti equals one if the student is admitted and zero if she is not admitted. The results are

displayed in columns (1) and (6) of Table 4. We see that individuals slightly above the threshold

13
     We show in Table 3A in the appendix that these results are similar with alternative bandwidths.


                                                                16
experienced an increase in the probability of admission by 17 percentage points at UT and 4

percentage points at A&M. The reason for the smaller change for A&M applicants is that

students with class ranks in the second decile are admitted at a rate of 90% or more so that

moving to a 100% admission probability is not a large change.

       Since the total effect of the top 10% rule on admissions is a combination of the effects on

application and admission, we examine whether the total number of admitted students in each

1/10th percentile bin jumps at the 90th percentile. Columns (2) and (5) in Table 2 reveal a positive

effect for both universities. This suggests that the law is binding.

       We next estimate responses by the admissions committee by examining whether the

characteristics of students who are admitted show a discontinuity at the class rank threshold.

Students just inside the top 10% have to be admitted due to the law. If the number of slots is

fixed, this occurs at the expense of students outside the top 10%. We estimate a specification like

equation (2) for all admitted students. We focus on student race/ethnicity, gender, SAT scores,

and high school of origin. Columns 2-5 and 7-10 in Table 4 show the results. For both schools,

admitted students just inside the top high school decile are more likely to be female. Without the

10% law admissions committees would have admitted more male students—this could be a

response to the growing gender imbalance favoring females at most colleges. At the same time,

we find no differences in the SAT test score performance for students admitted under that law

versus those admitted by the committee. For UT, we find an increase in the minority admission

rate for those slightly above the threshold, which is evidence that, to some degree, the Top 10%

Law promotes diversity at UT at the admissions stage. Also at UT, we observe a slight increase




                                                 17
of diversity in admissions along another dimension: students who did not graduate from a feeder

high school are more likely to be admitted to UT based on the law.14 15



Responses to the Law 3: Student Enrollment Decisions

We next examine student enrollment decisions. In Columns 1 and 6 of Table 5, we examine the

differences in enrollment probabilities conditional on admission between students with and

without an admissions guarantee. At A&M, students with the admissions guarantee are more

likely to accept the admissions offer (though this estimate is not statistically significant). While

at UT the student with an admissions guarantee are less likely to enroll than students just outside

the top 10%. One possible explanation for this pattern is that students in the top 10% use UT as

their backup plan—a “high quality safety school”. If they are admitted at a preferred school they

do not enroll at UT. We find the opposite result for students who apply to A&M, suggesting that

the admissions guarantee leads to applications of students for whom A&M is the preferred

school among their eventual options.

        The effect of the admissions guarantee on overall enrollment – not conditional on

admission – depends on the combined effects on application, admission and acceptance.

Columns (3) and (6) in Table 2 show that for both UT and A&M the admissions guarantee leads

to an increase in enrollment. Column (9) reveals that being above the top 10% cutoff

simultaneously reduces the enrollment of students at the private universities.

        We next ask whether the policy is – for the marginal student - successful in diversifying

the composition of enrolled students, which was one of the goals of the law. We estimate

14
  We show in Table 4A in the appendix that these results are similar with alternative bandwidths.
15
  Another way the admissions committee might respond to the Top 10% Law is to offer merit aid to students
outside the top 10% who they would prefer and offer no aid to students who are guaranteed admission. We have no
data on financial aid offers, so our results should be viewed with this caveat. We thank an anonymous reviewer for
pointing out this limitation.


                                                        18
equation (2) for enrolled students with minority status as the dependent variable. Columns (2)

and (7) of Table 5 reveal that the point estimates for a discontinuity in the likelihood the student

is a minority at the cutoff are positive for both A&M and UT, though since the results are not

statistically significant, we are not able to offer definitive evidence that the law increases

diversity at UT or A&M. While we find no effect of the law on student test scores (Columns 3

and 8), we find effects of reductions in male enrollees (Columns 4/9) as well as some evidence

for a reduction in students from feeder high schools (Columns 5/10).



Responses to the Law 4: Student Outcomes in College

           Finally, we evaluate whether there is any evidence suggesting the law creates “mismatch”

by enrolling students who are under-prepared for college. We do this by comparing the college

performance of students above the threshold, and thus admitted automatically, versus those

slightly below the threshold. We estimate equation (2) for all enrolled students with various

college achievement outcomes as the dependent variable. We consider five outcomes, including

first semester GPA, fourth semester GPA, fourth semester persistence in college, college major,

and four-year graduation rates. The results are displayed in Table 6.16

           At UT the results suggest very small, statistically insignificant decreases for students in

the top 10% for three of the five outcomes. For the other two outcomes we find significant but

small decreases. There is a small reduction in fourth semester persistence rates for students with

guaranteed admission – students admitted due to the top 10% rule are slightly more likely to drop

out. Moreover, we find some evidence that UT students with guaranteed admission tend to

choose “easier” majors (where we measure “difficulty” of major by the mean GPA of the major).



16
     We show in Table 6A in the appendix that these results are similar with alternative bandwidths.


                                                           19
       At TAMU, the results suggest no detectable differences in four of the five outcomes. We

find a positive effect on four year graduation rates – students with guaranteed admission are

more likely to graduate from A&M than students admitted by the committee. At the same time,

unlike UT, we do not find evidence that A&M students with guaranteed admission pick “easier”

majors. Overall, Table 6 highlights that the 10% law has different effects on the student bodies

at the two flagships schools, but offers very little evidence that the law creates systematic

“mismatch” for the marginal admitted student.




6. Conclusions

We exploit a difference in the economic environment of otherwise very similar individuals to

examine the behavioral consequences of incentive differences on a sequence of connected

decisions. We estimate the causal effects of being granted automatic admission to the flagship

universities in Texas on the likelihood of application, the likelihood of admission, the likelihood

of enrollment, and college success.

       We find that the Texas 10% law lives up to some of the expectations of its proponents. It

affects the application behavior of high school graduates, encouraging applications to the state’s

flagship universities from students who did not graduate from classic feeder high schools;

thereby reaching population groups that were previously underrepresented in the applicant pool.

The law is binding and alters the decisions of the admissions committees. However, for the

marginal student, we find little evidence that the law leads to notable increases in diversity. This

confirms the finding of previous studies that the top 10% law is not able to compensate for the

discontinuation of race based admissions policies. At the same time, there is little evidence that




                                                 20
the law leads to “mismatched” students who attended relatively weak high schools and are

crowding out more “deserving” students from higher quality high schools.

       The law has a number of other behavioral consequences. Students who are guaranteed

admission to a public university of their choice are less likely to apply to competing private

universities in Texas. We also find that the behavioral consequences of the admissions guarantee

depend on the university and the type of students it attracts. Conditional on eventual admission,

students eligible for guaranteed admission are more likely to enroll at Texas A&M than students

without initially guaranteed admission. For UT the opposite is true: students with initially

guaranteed admission are less likely to enroll. One possible explanation for this pattern is that

students who view A&M as their first choice are induced to apply by the admissions guarantee,

while the same admissions guarantee leads students to use UT as their backup plan - if they are

admitted at a preferred school they do not enroll at UT.

       The future of affirmative action – and race based admission policies in general – is

uncertain as policy alternatives are evaluated. One of these policy alternatives are top x-percent

rules, such as the Texas 10% law. Now, over 10 years after the implementation of the law, the

full set of its implication are still examined and discussed. We add to this discussion by using a

novel empirical approach to reinforce the results of previous studies and comprehensively

examine the various effects of the law within a fixed research design.

       Our results support previous findings suggesting that the law: a) does not lead to the

admission of ill-prepared students; b) increases applications from high schools that traditionally

do not send many students to the state’s flagship universities; but c) is not able to achieve the

ethnic diversity found before the elimination of Affirmation Action. Moreover, we uncover




                                                 21
additional behavioral consequences; contributing to a better understanding of the sequence of

decisions that lead to enrollment at a college more generally.
