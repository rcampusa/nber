                  The Inflationary Process in Israel:
                        Shocks and Accommodation



                               ABSTRACT


     The rate of inflation in Israel increased from 8 percent in 1965 to 300—400
percent in the first half of 1984. The inflationary process until 1977 was not
qualitatively different from that in the OECD countries, but after the financial
liberalization of 1977 the economy appeared to move into a new era in which the
inflation rate seemed capable only of rising. Our explanation of the
inflationary process is that because of institutional adaptations, and as a
result of accommodating monetary and fiscal policies, the stabilizing forces in
the economy are so weak that the inflation rate is in a metastable equilibrium.
We ascribe the apparent asymmetry of the inflation to the expansionary underlying
thrust of monetary and fiscal policy.

     We develop an analytical framework that assigns roles to indexation, to the
financial structure, and to the exchange rate system in determining the dv-namjcs
of the economy. We place very little blame for the inflation on wage indexation,
which has been incomplete, but we regard the extensive indexation of the returns
on financial assets, and the steady shift out of nominal assets, as major
contributing factors, for the economy is now left with virtually no nominal
anchor. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of alternative stabilization
plans, arguing that a successful stabilization program will have to be
comprehensive and rapid.

 THE INFLATIONARY PROCESS IN ISRAEL: SHOCKS AND ACCOMODATION




 Israel's annual inflation rate increased from 8 percent in 1965 to 300—400

 percent in the first half of 1984. Up to 1977, the process of inflation in

Israel does not appear qualitatively different from that in the OECD

countries (see Bruno in this volume). Indeed, even after it jumped to 40—

50 percent after the Yom Kippur War, the inflation rate declined slowly

until, by the first half of 1977, prices were rising at an annual rate of

25 percent. After the financial liberalization of late 1977, the economy

appeared to move into a new era, with inflation firmly entrenched, and

seemingly capable only of rising.

       In this paper we provide an overview and analysis of the inflationary

process, seeking to explain the increases in the inflation rate and the

forces that keep it high and, on occasion, rising. There has been no

shortage of explanations of inflation: it has been ascribed to indexation,

to   monetary policy, to the budget deficit, to the introduction of floating
exchange rates, to "bubbles" — self—justifying expectations of inflation   —

to name only some of the most prominent. Several of these explanations
provide necessary conditions for the continuation of the process, as we

shall show below.

    Taking as given successive governments' reluctance to force the

inflation rate down through restrictive policy that might produce a major

recession, there remain serious economic questions about the forces

driving the inflationary process and the institutional adaptations that

permit the economy to operate at a reasonable level of efficiency despite

inflation. In a nutshell, our explanation of the inflation will be that

because of institutional adaptations, and as a result of accommodating

monetary and fiscal policies, the stabilizing forces in the economy are

very weak, leaving the inflation rate in a meta—stable equilibrium. This

means that the inflation rate could come down as well as rise, but the

underlying thrust of fiscal and monetary policies during the period has

been expansionary, with the result that the adaptation of the inflationary

process, including expectations formation, has been smoother upwards and

more rigid downwards, even when cost—reducing factors were occasionally

operative.

     In developing our analytical framework below we assign roles to

indexation,   to financial structure, and to the exchange rate system in
determining the   dynamics of the economy. We also place emphasis on fiscal

and monetary policies that have permitted the inflation to continue.

Before developing the analytical framework, we provide a brief overview of

phases in the inflationary process since 1960.




I. lifE PHASES OF INFLATION


Figure 1 and Table 1 provide an overview of the inflationary history of

the economy in the period since 1960 together with the growth rate of real

output; Table 2 provides summary data on policy and other macroeconomic


                                       2
variables over the period. The increase in the inflation rate from the 5—

10 percent range of the early 1960s to the 30O-400 percent range of the

first half of 1984 can be broken down into eight phases (see Table 1).



PHASE 1: Normal Growj0to19:l
The inflation rate in the first half of the 1960s averaged 7 percent,

while GNP was growing at an annual average rate of 10 percent. The infla—

tion rate was high by international standards, the growth rate of output

by the same standards even higher. The government budget over the period

was balanced. The major problem facing the economy at this time was the

current account deficit. An overheated economy (inflation reached 8 per—

cent in 1965—66) led to the adoption of sharply restrictive domestic

policies which, together with an exogenous decline in the rate of immig-

ration and a consequent decline in aggregate demand, produced the 1966—67

recession.



PHASE 2: Recession 1965:1to1967:2

The unemployment rate rose to 12 percent (see Figure 3) while the infla-

tion rate dropped to less than 2 percent. As is usual in recessions, the

rate of unemployment started rising before there was any pronounced fall

in inflation. Nonetheless, within two years there had been a decisive, and

subsequently long—lived, reduction in the inflation rate.




PHASE3Recoy97O:1
The recession was drawing to an end before the Six Day War broke out in
June 1967 (the growth rate for 1966 was 0.9 percent and for 1967 it was

2.3 percent). The war was followed by a period of extremely rapid growth,


                                     3
with low inflation, based in part on the absorption of those still un-

employed at the end of the recession and in part on inflows of labor from

abroad and the administered territories.



PHASE 4: Boom, 1970:1 to 1973:3

Growth continued at a rapid pace in the first two years of the 1970s, but

with the economy reaching the full employment zone, inflation accelerated

to an annual rate of 22 percent. The variability of the inflation rate

also increased, as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate and of

the occasional adoption of incomes policies.



PHASE 5: War and Oil Shock, 1973:4 to 1977:2

The growth rates of both output and productivity dropped sharply; infla-

tion accelerated to an annual average rate of 37 percent, with accom-

panying high variability, due to the rise in import prices and to a series

of sharp devaluations up to June 1975, when a crawling peg was instituted

and maintained until 1977, aided by a one—time 10 percent devaluation in

September 1975.



PHASE 6: Traverse, 1977:3 to 1979:3

The period started with the liberalization of foreign exchange transac-

tions in October 1977. The liberalization allowed Israelis to hold foreign

currency accounts at home and abroad, as well as to hold limited amounts

of foreign currency in cash. Virtually all foreign exchange controls were

lifted; export subsidies and import tariffs were also reduced. This was

accompanied by a sharp 50 percent devaluation of the currency, without

other restrictive measures being taken. The major jump in the inflation


                                      4
 rate nonetheless caine some time after the foreign exchange liberalization.

      This period of transition to three digit inflation rates will receive

particular attention in our subsequent analysis.



PHASE   7:                          1979:4   to 1983:3

This four—year period of high inflation (at annual average rates between

100 and 130 percent) is quite remarkable. In spite of the higher average

inflation rate, the variability of quarterly inflation as measured by its

standard deviation was actually lower in absolute terms than in the two

previous phases. A failed attempt at stabilization by a sustained slowdown

in the rate of devaluation ended in a major devaluation in October 1983,

accompanied by a collapse of the value of bank shares, hitherto a major

financial asset.



PHASE   8:   Runaway   Inflation?
The October     1983 devaluation and subsidy cuts resulted in a rapid rise in
the   price   level; in October the rate of inflation was 21 percent. The new

Finance Minister declared that his first          priority   was the balance of

payments; the implication was that the inflation rate would be allowed to

increase if that was necessary to improve the current account deficit,

which in the third quarter of 1983 had reached an annual rate of six

billion dollars or 25 percent of GDP.

      In the event inflation did rise rapidly, to an annual rate of 400

percent (compounded monthly) for the first five months of 1984. With

elections approaching in July 1984, the economic situation at the time of

writing was both unclear and volatile.

II. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK



We use a standard aggregate supply—demand framework to analyze inflation.

The particular Israeli emphasis comes in the description of the properties

of assets and of wage indexation, in the policy choices that make the

growth rate of money and the composition of the outstanding stock of

government debt endogenous, and in the magnitudes of the government and

current account deficits that drive the processes of accumulation of

domestic government and foreign debts.

      The position of the aggregate supply (AS) schedule depends on wages

and associated payroll taxes, raw material prices, the cost of capital,

and technology; the position of the aggregate demand (AD) curve is deter-

mined by the value, liquidity, and composition of wealth, by the exchange

rate and foreign variables — demand, prices, and interest rates — by

fiscal policy variables, and by expectations of inflation and exchange

rate changes. Continuous shifts in the aggregate supply and demand curves

trace out the changing price level and output.

      To analyze the dynamics of inflation, we write the aggregate supply

and demand curves (which relate output to the nominal price level) as

functions of their major driving variables. Thus,


(1)                 = g(W/P, E/P, t, a)


Here Y      is the supply of output, W is the nominal wage (as a cost to

the employer, and thus including payroll taxes), P is the price level,

E is the nominal exchange rate that determines the domestic cost of

imported raw materials, t is a variable representing the state of tech-

nology, and a represents missing supply variables, movements in which


                                          6
can be thought of as supply shocks (e.g., the world price of raw mate-

rials),

      On the aggregate demand side we have


(2)                  = f(H/P, V, G — T, E/P, y* e z)


We represent aggregate demand         as a function of the real stock of

high—powered money (H/P), real wealth (V), the government domestic demand

surplus (C —   T),   the real exchange rate (E/P), foreign income (y*), the

expected rate of inflation (ire), and z, a demand shock variable rep-

resenting also omitted demand factors. We shall subsequently consider the

domestic budget deficit as a fraction ()     of   GNP. Because there is no

agreed—upon measure of the liquidity of the stock of assets, we omit that

determinant of aggregate demand from (2).

      To understand the dynamics of the inflationary process, we need to

analyze the determinants and dynamics of the variables specified in the

aggregate supply and demand curves (1) and (2). Starting on the aggregate

supply side, wages are determined in bi—annual wage negotiations that £ ix

a base wage level and indexation formulae for the adjustment of the wage

to changes in the price level. Typically the indexation clauses have pro-

vided for partial (70—80 percent), semi—annual and subsequently quarterly,

compensation for price changes. The non--adjustment of wages for a period

of three months at high rates of inflation makes for a marked within—

quarter variation of wages; the less—than—complete compensation for infla—

tion means that real wages at very high rates of inflation would fall

rapidly over the life of a contract) This account of the wage adjust-

ment process makes it difficult to blame indexatjon as the main factor

determining the behavior of wages, since even in the short run there are


                                        7
always discretionary elements in the wage—setting process.

    The second argument in the supply function is the real exchange rate,

representing the prices of imported raw materials.2 A depreciation or

devaluation (increase in E) will shift the AS schedule up, tending to

increase prices and reduce output. If the Bank of Israel follows a pur-

chasing power parity (PPP) rule, then domestic price level shocks are

automatically transformed into inflationary exchange rate changes. We

shall later discuss the behavior of the economy when the government was

following a set of operating rules that include PPP for control of the

exchange rate (from around 1975 onwards).

     Many of the most significant factors in the Israeli inflation enter

in the first three arguments of the aggregate demand function (2), in the

interaction of monetary and fiscal policies and in the dynamics of asset

supplies. Private sector wealth consists of some nominal assets, largely

currency and demand deposits, of various government liabilities indexed to

either the price level or the foreign exchange rate, of some foreign

assets, and consumer durables, housing, and private ownership of corpora-

tions. We simplify by concentrating on the stock of high—powered money, H,

government bonds indexed to the price level (B)1 government bonds indexed

to the exchange rate (Bf) and direct ownership of foreign exchange (F).

Thus, wealth is given by:

    Special indexation adjustments to wages are paid more frequently than
    quarterly if the inflation rate exceeds a specified level. For more
    details on wage indexation see Kleiman's chapter in this volume.
2
    We do not explicitly discuss other factors affecting the rate of shift
    of the aggregate supply curve beyond noting that supply factors played
    a significant role in the slowdown of growth in Israel since the early
    1970's (see Bruno in this volume). The growth slowdown in turn affected
    the inflation rate, as we discuss below.


                                      8
 (3)             V = H/P + B    + EBf/P + EF/P


       In (3) Bf and F are the foreign—currency denominated values of

holdings of foreign—currency linked bonds and foreign currency respec-

tively. The dynamics of inflation in Israel is significantly affected by

the fact that domestic bonds (B) are fixed in real value, and that the

nominal value of much of the remainder of the government debt (EBf)

automatically increases when there is a devaluation. Thus the Israeli

economy does not have the automatic inflation stabilizer that an increase

in the price level and/or the exchange rate reduces real private sector

wealth by reducing the real value of the outstanding stock of government

debt, except for the possibility that the real value of the monetary base

would fall. Indeed, if the government is pursuing a PPP exchange rate

policy, then any domestic inflationary shock automatically increases the

nominal value of wealth virtually pan       passu.

       Examining the aggregate demand function (2), and assuming both that

the government budget deficit is fixed in real terms3 and that the ex-

change rate is determined by PPP, we see that the only potential element

of non—homogeneity or non—accommodation to price rises on the demand side

is H, the nominal stock of high powered money. The monetary base, H,

is a small   nominal   magnitude with which to control the price level

(assuming a given real exchange rate and real wage) so that even if H

were held strictly constant when the price level rose, it might be ex—




  In fact, there have been two elements making for an increase in the
  real deficit with a rise in the price level — one was the un—indexed
  debt of the private sector (which by 1984 has virtually been eroded by
  inflation) and the other was the lag in the collection of taxes.


                                        9
pected to exert at best a small and slow stabilizing influence.

     Such stabilization would arise from the rise in the rate of interest

caused by the reduction in the real money base. But suppose the monetary

authority is attempting to control the real rate of interest, as it has in

Israel. Then the quantity of high—powered money becomes endogenous, and in

response to an increase in the price level and consequent upward pres—sure

on the interest rate, the stock of high—powered money is increased. Thus

the stabilizing element that could have been provided by keeping H to a

prescribed path is lost. There would accordingly be no forces on the

demand side of the economy tending to resist rising prices.4 The price

level then does not tend to return to its original level, or to any equl—

libriuin level, unless some element of policy — be it monetary or fiscal —

is   directed to that end.

      The above discussion implies that we could expect the aggregate

demand (AD) schedule to be quite steep or virtually vertical. The very

short—run AS curve, on the other hand, will be considerably flatter,

because   of imperfect wage indexation (see previous discussion) and as long
as the economy is operating below capacity (which it   did   in the mid—

1970s);   the short run is defined here as the indexation period for wages.



     A further difficulty has been pointed out to us by Rafi Melnick. In the
     semi—conventional full—employment IS—LM model with nominal bonds, and
     with policy that fixes the real interest rate (assume adaptative expec-
     tations to avoid well—known problems of indeterminacy when expectations
     are rational), goods market equilibrium determines the real value of
     wealth. The appropriate interest rate is then enforced through open
     market operations in which bonds and money are exchanged. However, if
     money is the only nominal asset, and the real value of wealth is deter-
     mined in the goods market, the real value of money balances are also
     determined. Then, given the conventional demand for money function,
     there may be an inconsistency between the specified interest rate that
     clears the goods market and the rate that clears the money market. The
     inconsistency is removed if output becomes endogenous.


                                      10
However, since wages have also been effectively indexed, though at a time

 lag (which has become shorter over time), one could expect greater steep.—

ness of the AS curve as one moves from the very short run (say, a quarter

or less) to somewhat longer time spans (say, six months or more). The

price level may thus become very sensitive to shocks. As we shall see,

this problem has worsened as the inflationary process accelerated towards

the end of the 1970g.

        The steepness of the AD curve and relative flatness of the short run

AS curve would imply that in the short run price level changes would

mainly be affected by cost factors (wages and input prices) and less by

demand shifts, while demand shifts would feature large in short—run output

changes (see Bruno in this volume).

       Equating the supply (1) and the demand (2) relationships and looking

at the implied equilibrium in rate—of-change form we may write down the

rate of change of the price level (P/P =        ir) as a linear function of
the rates of change of the three key nominal magnitudes: the nominal wage

(,    = /W),   the exchange rate (è =   E/E),   and the money base (i =   cl/H),
iU5 SUiy shift (j.i) and demand shift (lid) factors, These are com-

bined into one factor (li) which can be expected to be dominated by the

supply side.

where p=logP, m=logH, w=logW, e=logE.
       The description of the price dynamics can be completed by writing

down a Philips—type equation for wages as a function of prices and labor—

market slack, and adjustment rules for the exchange rate and the money

base during periods for which these could not be considered exogenously

determined.

       Consider now the longer—run implications of such price dynamics when

the above nominal magnitudes are themselves each indexed to past inflation

(iT1) and/or to inflationary expectations (l1e) If the system is homoge-

neous we could summarize the inflationary process in the form

where         is a summary statistic involving supply and demand shocks,

as well as shocks to w, e, and m.

       Suppose that expectations are adaptive, with coefficient of adapta-

Solving    (5) and (6) we obtain:




(7)
                                                  1=1


       Equation (7) shows that when (1 —        a)(1   —   ) becomes   very small,5 a

positive shock        > 0   will be transmitted into an immediate jump in the

inflation rate               —        >   0) rather than just a jump in the




      As the degree of inflation itself accelerates the degree of persistence
      a (i.e., direct indexation of the nominal magnitudes) will tend to
      increase towards unity. Likewise, the coefficient of adaptation of
      expectations () rises towards unity.

price level.6 Thus, one puzzling feature of the Israeli inflation —

the      apparent tendency for a shock to the price level (such as a devalua—

tion) to result in a permanent change in the inflation rate — can be

explained as a result of accommodating macro policies.

            But there is a second feature of the inflation that needs explana-

tion: the inflation rate jumps up quite readily but does not fall in the

same way. Suppose the indexation or the expectation—formation mechanisms

are not symmetric upwards and downwards. The coefficient of adaptation ()

is      likely to depend on the state of the economy as perceived by indivi-

duals and firms. For example, when the general thrust of fiscal and mone—

tary policy is highly expansionary and there is a temporary unexpected

downward shift in inflation in period t —                     I (ir1 —      < 0),   may

be very small (or zero) so that expectations are not revised downward

[i.e., in equation (6) we get                                 even though      <

while             would be large (or close to 1) when the unexpected shock is

positive (Tr1 >            Tr1).     The effect of such asymmetries is to make a

sequence of positive and negative shocks of zero mean impart an upward

thrust to the inflation rate.

            If the inflation rate follows the random walk implied by (7) when

    =   1    or     = 1,        then the inflation rate could, in the long run, be at

any level. But if                   is slightly less than one, that is, if there is any

element of non—homogeneity in the equation for the inflation rate, the

system will tend — perhaps very slowly —     to   return to an equilibrium long—

run inflation rate.7

       In particular, fiscal policy considerations may determine the average

growth rate of money, through the government budget constraint, even if

monetary policy does not pursue explicit monetary growth targets. We can

write the government budget constraint as


(8)              G—T=Y =ñ/P+,
where the dot indicates the change in a variable. We here suppress the

difference between bonds indexed to the domestic price level and to the

exchange rate, and omit direct government sales of foreign exchange, which

will be added subsequently.

        In steady state, the ratios H/(PY) and B/Y, where Y     is   real GM', are

constant. Accordingly in steady state, the growth rate of high—powered

money 11/H ()     is   equal to the inflation rate (Tr) plus the growth rate of

output

Similarly, the growth rate of bonds ()       is   equal to the growth rate of

      Note the distinction betweeen the questions of whether the price level
      or the inflation rate returns to a steady state level. Suppose the
      inflation rate is described by 7r = a + O.95ir 1 ÷      where      is
      white noise. Then the expected long—run rate o inflation is determi-
      nate and equal to [a/(l — 0.95) = 20a}. But shocks to the price_level
      are permanent. If the price level jumps by 10 percent today there is no
      expectation that subsequently the price level will tend to return to
      its original level or expected path.


                                        14
Accordingly, in steady state the government budget constraint becomes


(11)                   = (cr +
                               g)(H/PY)
                                        +   g(B/Y)

Now let h denote the ratio of the stock of real high—powered money to

nominal GNP (H/PY), and b the ratio of bonds to GNP (B/Y). Then,


(12)              11   = [(5   g(h + b)I/h
        Equation (12) gives one approach to analyzing the determinants of the

growth rate of the monetary base and thus, in steady state, of the infla-

tion rate. The term following g            in the denominator in (12) is the

amount of the deficit that can be financed by the government through the

sale of bonds and printing of money without increasing their respective

ratios to GNP. The more rapid the growth rate of output, the greater the

share of the deficit that can be financed in a non—inflationary way. The

larger the government deficit,       (5,    the higher the inflation rate in the

steady state. And the larger the monetary base, the lower the inflation

rate need be.8

       The government budget deficit obviously plays a major role in this

steady—state analysis. There is no reason, though, to expect a close

short—run connection between the inflation rate and the size of the gov—

ernment budget deficit. For it has to be remembered, when using the



8
    A more complete analysis takes into account the dependence of h in
    the denominator of (12) on the expected inflation rate, and raises the
    possibility that there are two equilibria for the economy at which a
    given amount of revenue from the printing of money can be obtained —
    one at a relatively low inflation rate, and one at a higher rate. We
    regard this possibility as more than a theoretical curiosity as we
    shall note when discussing the Israeli experience below. The analysis
    can also be extended to study the non—steady state dynamics of infla-
    tion, and to recognize that b depends on the real interest rate.


                                            15
approach implied by (12), that we used the quantity theory in equation (9)

to link the inflation rate to the growth rate of money in the steady

state. But in the short run there is at best a very loose connection

between the growth rate of the stock of high—powered money and inflation.

       We can now extend the government budget constraint (8) to include the

government's foreign account and changes in the government's foreign debt

('G). We get:


(8')              (+óf)Y=fl/P++EFG/P.
Here        is the government's external deficit as a percentage of GNP.

The external deficit (sometimes a surplus) is equal to the deficit on

goods and services minus unilateral transfers.9

       Equation (8'), the overall government budget constraint, shows that

the government finances its total deficit in three ways: through the

printing of high—powered money, through sales of bonds (indexed either to

the price level or to the exchange rate) and through borrowing abroad.

Sales of foreign exchange to domestic residents, one way of financing a

domestic deficit, do not necessarily imply increases in foreign indebted-

ness of the government: if the government has an overall foreign surplus,

then the sale of foreign exchange is merely the means through which the

foreign surplus finances part of the domestic deficit. It should be noted

that FG is the government's net foriegn debt. Thus if the government

runs down foreign exchange reserves to sell foreign currency to domestic

residents it is, in terms of (8'), engaging in foreign borrowing.




   Capital gains or losses on the oustanding debt have to be treated con-
   sistently in defining the service account and the external deficit.


                                      16
       The use of the government budget constraint (8) or (8?) does not

necessarily imply that the government consciously decides on a particular

growth rate of high—powered money as a means of financing its budget

deficit. Rather, in the Israeli context, it is much more likely that the

government turns to printing money as its last resort in budget financing.

First it decides what it needs to spend arid how much it can raise through

taxes (and foreign borrowing), then it sells as many bonds as it can at

the existing interest rate, and the rest is financed by printing money.'°

Relatively small changes in the deficit would be consistent in the long

run with major changes in the growth rate of H, and thus of inflation,

according to this approach. But the transitional costs of moving from a

high—inflation to a low—inflation equilibrium could be sufficient to

inhibit such a change. We believe this to be particularly important in the

Israeli context.

       The current stock of government debt is the result of past deficits,

and the prospective size of the debt is a function of expected deficits.

A large current debt may inhibit monetary policy by preventing aggressive

use of interest rate variations for current stabilization purposes, for

budget   deficit or thwart the finance of future deficits because of fluc-

tuations in bond prices. Prospective deficits influence aggregate demand

and the terms at which the government can obtain both current and future

financing.

       The analytical framework presented in this section is reasonably

conventional. The major departure from standard macroeconomic models lies

in the structure of assets, for wage indexation is found in many coun-

tries. As we shall argue below, abnormal macroeconomic behavior in Israel

has to be attributed at least as much to specific policy choices that, for

instance, produce large budget deficits, and/or endogenize the rate of

growth of money, as to peculiar structural characteristics of the economy.




III. ANALYSIS OF THE INFLATIONARY ECONOMY



Policy since 1965 has been significantly affected by the experience of the

1965—67 recession, when restrictive policies were implemented primarily to

bring the current account deficit closer to balance, but also to counter-

act the then high (8 percent) rate of inflation. The resultant unemploy-

ment of more than 10 percent brought both social demoralization and emig-

ration, with the result that maintenance of low rates of unemployment was

considered a major policy goal during the crises of the 197Os. Despite the

rising rate of inflation since 1970, there has been no strong political

pense of temporary unemployment. Widespread indexation, particularly of
asset returns, reduced the perceived and actual costs of any given rate of

inflation and helped keep inflation from becoming the dominant economic

policy issue.

      The major features of the inflation process that were seen in Figure 1

are the generally rising trend of the inflation rate since 1965, and the

apparent step nature of the changes. To understand the inflation process

we have to understand both why the inflation rate has been on a rising

trend, and the reasons for the jumps.


                                                18
1. Inflation Djnamics

On the demand side, we shall argue, expansive fiscal policy and accommo-

dative monetary and exchange—rate policy have generally combined to main-

tain upward pressure on the price level and the rate of inflation and as a

result of the structure of the financial system and the policy choices,

the automatic forces that could stabilize inflation in response to supply

shocks are very weak. Favorable shocks were usually exploited to help

expand demand (in the last few years, consumption) and output while un-

favorable ones were not counteracted for any length of time by restrict-

ive discretionary policy. Temporary contractionary policies were under-

taken (as in 1975—77 and in 1980); they were usually accompanied by cost—

increasing measures (devaluation, indirect taxes, and a cut in subsidies)

which pushed up the AS curve, while the flatness of the AS curve implied

that contraction showed up in output rather than in prices. A short run

account    of inflationary dynamics will       then be dominated by supply—side

factors    to which we turn first. The important underlying role of the
budget deficit and of the monetary       system in accounting   for shifts in
long—run steady state inflation will be taken up subsequently.
        The cost—side dynamics of inflation has featured in several accounts
of the inflationary process       in the 1960s and early 1970s, the best known

being    a pair of annual wage and consumer—price equations for the period
1958—1975 by Artstein and Sussman (1977).h1 Prices are a function          of wages

and    import   prices   plus a small, hardly significant, role for money, while


  This is discussed briefly in another chapter in this volume and will
  not be repeated here. For a quarterly regression of the same kind see
  Bruno and Sussrnan (1979). After 1977 regressions based on annual data
  would miss a considerable part of the dynamics. See          also   Zilberman
      (1984).

                                          19
wages are a function of prices, unemployment, and the increased labor

supply from the territories (a very important wage—moderating factor in

the years 1968—1972).

       It can be argued12 that with a high degree of correlation between the

nominal magnitudes (prices, wages, exchange rates, and money) price equa-

tions of the typical kind are difficult to interpret, especially after

1975. However, this problem can be partly side—stepped by running such an

equation in real terms, namely, in the form of first differences with

respect to past inflation. The following equation is obtained, in terms of

wholesale prices (to neutralize, to the extent possible, subsidies and

demand elements) for the 66 quarters 1966:3 to 1982:413 —

       An attempt to add monetary variables to this equation on the whole

fails, with the exception of an apparent five-quarter—lagged effect of

     The correlation coefficient (p) between * —       and     —      for
     the whole period 66:3—82:4 is 0.24, but this turns out to be dominated
     by high collinearity during the first oil crisis 73:4—77:1 (p = 0.571)
     while the correlation is virtually nil in all other periods: 66:3—77:3
     (p = —0.025), 77:2—82:4 (p = 0.066). The equation was also tested for
     the implied homogeneity assumption by adding       to the right—hand
     side. This gives a zero coefficient (—0.005 with standard error 0.037).
     It is also remarkably stable with respect to length of period or break-
     up into sub—periods.

real credit expansion on inflation during 79:4—82:4. We shall come back to

the important role of real import prices and real credit expansion in the

traverse to the higher inflation plateau.

        Continuing in the line of cost—side adjustments in the inflationary

process we recall the argument that wages (w) can in turn be related to

lagged inflation. Likewise, the exchange rate followed an approximate

PPP rule (plus occasional jumps) since the introduction of the crawling

peg in 1975:3.

        Instead of fitting an equation like (13) we could therefore run a

regression of inflation acceleration ( —
                                               f1) on   its own past lags

plus the acceleration in exchange rate adjustment ( —              Using

four—quarter lags and running the regression over sub—periods during

1965:1 to 1982:4 we find coefficients of 0.20—0.29 for (é —

similar     to the ones found in the previous regression and also in Art—

stein and Sussman (1977); we also test and find that the inflation rate

Is homogeneous in terms of its own past lags.14 What is more inter-

esting is the finding, already recorded by Gottlieb and Piterrnan (1982),

that the share of quarterly inflation 'explained by the inflation of

the previous two quarters continuously rises over time, The implied

coefficients are, respectively,

    This is evidence of the considerable inertia (autoregressive

nature) of the inflationary process as well as of the shortening of the

lag in the implicit indexation of all nominal magnitudes (including

faster monetary accomodation).

     At this point we may also mention the asymmetric response to upward

and downward inflationary shocks. When we add the acceleration in prices

of controlled (subsidized) products            to the same regression

together with the acceleration in exchange rates (t&), this time

allowing for a different response to positive and negative shocks, we

find the following coefficients (for the period 1975:3—1983:1) —




            0.284              0.002            0.320         —0.003
           (0.099)            (0.143)          (0.143)        (0.121)



     As already noted in Section II, expectations and price linkages are

asymmetric when the general economic climate is an expansionary one.

When the government is running a large and persistent deficit which


                                          22
shows no evidence of declining, cost reduction will be perceived as only

temporary. We shall later mention an application of this feature to the

recent dis—inflation experience of 1981—82. At this point it is appro-

priate to turn to the role of fiscal and monetary variables.



2. The Policy Variables

Table 2 shows the government budget deficit over successive periods

since 1960. It gives both the domestic budget deficit (column 4) as a

measure of the contribution of the government to domestic demand, and

the overall budget deficit (column 5) including the government's current

account (of the balance of payments) deficit; the overall deficit is an

indication of the rate of change of government debt —    internal   and

external —   plus   money printing. The domestic deficit climbed sharply as

a percentage of GDP over successive periods from the start of the 1960s

till shortly after the Yom Kippur War, It then remained more—or—less

constant, before falling somewhat in 1982 and 1983. It is not only the

trend in the domestic deficit that is noteworthy, but also its absolute

size; the deficit is extremely large by international standards. With

the growth rate of GNP very high until 1973, large deficits could be

sustained without much growth in the debt/GDP ratio. But with the

average deficit in excess of 15 percent of GDP since 1974, with money

financing covering less than one fifth of the deficit, and with GDP

growing at only 3 percent, the debt/GDP ratio has risen sharply,

     Table 3 presents indicators of monetary policy actions over the

same period, The increase in the growth rate of high—powered money from

period to period stands out clearly, as does the increase in the growth

rate of other nominal magnitudes. However, much of this latter growth is


                                       23
automatic, as a result of the indexation of asset returns to either the

price level or the exchange rate. The table also includes measures of

the real interest rate on government bonds over the period since 1975.

These have been impressively stable, a result both of the institutional

detail that the Knesset fixes the real interest rate on new issues, and

of the reluctance of the Bank of Israel to allow prices of bonds to

fluctuate in the secondary market.15

     The policy picture, then, is one of generally expansive fiscal and

monetary policy, of stabilization of the real interest rate, and of fol-

lowing a PPP rule for the exchange rate during much of the period.


3. The Transition to Three—Digit Inflation

The major movement in the inflation rate after 1977 is associated with the

massive devaluation that accompanied the foreign exchange liberalization

at the end of 1977. Over the two quarters from 1977:3 to 1978:1, the real

dollar exchange rate rose by 30 percent. (It was less when measured

against a basket of currencies, due to the dollar appreciation.) Because

the depreciation was accompanied by reduced tariffs and subsidies, the

effective exchange rate fell by less, thus mitigating the cost—push

effects, but still leaving a large (20 percent) increase in the real cost

of imported inputs. In addition, the value of dollar—linked assets rose

considerably, creating demand—side inflationary pressures. By the middle

of 1978 the one-time shock of the devaluation appeared to be over, with

the inflation rate back to the level of the plateau from which it had

started in 1977.


15 There have, however, been periods during which the Bank of Israel has
    allowed the interest rate on bank loans (as opposed to government
    bonds) to change.


                                       24
       But then, in the second half of 1978, the inflation rate began its

 climb to the three—digit range, which was reached at the end of 1979, What

was the source of this rapid jump? There was some cost pressure from

wages, which rose 6 percent in real terms in 1978, partly through delayed

indexation and partly as a result of wage negotiations, but no other

major cost—push factor operated at the time: the second oil shock          caine

only in 1979; the real exchange rate did not depreciate much further after

the first quarter of 1978 and, indeed, appreciated in the fourth quarter

of 1978.

      On the demand side, fiscal policy during 1978 was more expansionary

than in 1977, with the domestic and total deficits well above the 1976—77

levels. Here was one expansionary factor. The monetary base grew by only

28 percent while prices rose by 48 percent over the year. However, the

money stock CM1) increased at 45 percent annually while bank credit rose

80 percent. Studies of the demand for money typically find a significant

shift in demand, during 1978, away from assets denominated in local
            16
currency.        Consistent with   the   econometric result is the fact that

there was a major shift into PATAN (dollar—linked) accounts during 1978,

during   which ycar ways were discovered of using PATAN in current
transactions.'7

16
     For example, Melnick (1983); Leiderman and Marom (1983).
17
     On the eve of the monetary reform PATAN (demand and time) deposits were
     equal to half the lira—denominated money supply; by the end of 1979
     they were three times the value of the lira—denominated money supply.
     Evidence for a drop in the demand for money can be obtained by looking
     at the implied elasticity of change in the money base ratio (h) in
     Table 4 with respect to the change in inflation (rr). For the change
     from 1965/67 to 1974/77 we find irLh/(hLir) = —0.64 while for the
     change from 1974/77 to 1978/80 it is —0.82 and from 1978/80 to 1981/83
     it is —1.09. Another piece of indirect evidence can be obtained by

                                            25
      With a shift in demand away from Israeli—currency denominated assets

underway, increased rates of inflation were consistent with relatively low

rates of money and particularly money—base growth.

     At the end of 1978 a restrictive credit policy was undertaken — by

the Bank of Israel acting independently of the Treasury —       in   an attempt to

stabilize the growing balance of payments deficit and control inflation.

Ceilings were placed on the expansion of bank credit, but with free capi—

tal movements, imports of capital replaced domestic credit as a source of

financing. The restrictive policy thus failed to reduce the growth of

credit. The capital inflow problem was solved only in 1979, when capital

imports were first prohibited and then permitted —       subject   to heavy

taxation.

     By that stage, however, the inflation rate was already well above its

previous levels, and it would have taken a prolonged period of restrictive

policy to reduce it. The second oil shock struck in 1979, with costs to

the economy that exceeded those of the first oil shock. There was thus a
                          18
sizable   supply shock.
                                            .
                               At the same time, the domestic deficit of the

government rose. Monetary policy exerted some restraining influence by

keeping the growth rate of bank credit low; once again low growth rates of

the monetary base and the Israeli—currency denominated money supply were

consistent with high rates of inflation because real demand for these




     looking at the relative increase of currency in circulation compared
     to demand deposits in shekels. Between 1976 and 1978 deposits grew by
     102 percent while currency grew by only 74 percent, whereas in 1979
     the numbers are 31 and 41 percent, respectively (1979 is when the
     large PATAM increase took place).
18
     As Figure 2 shows, real import prices rose much more during the second oil
     shock than during the first.


                                           26
 assets fell. Despite the supply shock, demand policies allowed real GNP to

 rise by more than 5 percent in 1979; demand rose by more than 6.5 percent,

 and the current account deficit thus worsened.



 4. Attempts to Arrest flation

With inflation firmly established in the three—digit range by the third

 quarter of 1979, and the government and the current account deficits

increasing, a new Finance Minister was appointed at the end of 1979.

Finance Minister Hurwjtz assumed office determined to reduce the inflation

rate and the current account deficit the old—fashioned way, by cutting

government demand and by restrictive monetary policy. The initial cuts in

government spending took the form of reduced subsidies, which immediately

raised the price level, so that the inflation rate for the last quarter of

1979 was 168 percent. Monetary policy was defined in terms of the expan-

sion of credit for domestic purposes; export credits
                                                       were freely granted.

    The Hurwitz policy raised unemployment from less than 3 percent in

1979 to over 5 percent in 1980 (see Figure 3), and sharply reduced the

current account deficit by cutting imports. Despite growing unemployment,

GNP increased in 1980, although domestic demand fell. The real exchange

rate stayed virtually constant, so that most of the improvement in the

balance of payments was due to the fall in domestic income and the deple-

tion of stocks. Monetary policy defined in terms of the nominal increase

in bank credit was restrictive throughout the year, particularly in the

first half, and the rate of investment fell.

     One might ask why Hurwitz's policies reduced employment without

reducing inflation until much later. In the first place, the initial

measures taken to cut the budget deficit were themselves inflationary. In


                                    27
the second, it is typical that a recession starts with output falling

before inflation.

     By the middle of the year, with the balance—of--payments deficit

significantly reduced, political support for maintenance of contractionary

policy was weakening, particularly in light of the approaching elections;

the end of these policies was marked by the Finance Minister's resignation

at the end of the year. There has not subsequently been an episode in

which conventional contractionary policies were used in an attempt to

reduce the inflation rate.

    The beginning of 1981 saw the introduction of a new anti—inflationary

policy, under Finance Minister Aridor. The policy, introduced before the

June 1981 elections, was to keep inflation rates down by working on the

cost side, and by keeping controlled prices from rising rapidly. Subsidies

were accordingly increased, import tariffs slashed, and the exchange rate

appreciated. Similar policies had been undertaken before other elections,

though not with the same boldness. The policies had the desired effects,

seen most clearly in an 80 percent (real) increase in consumer durable

imports, and a fall in the inflation rate during the year (this may, in

part, reflect a delayed response to the earlier I-Iurwitz contractionary

policy). The budget deficit increased sharply, and monetary policy was

accommodating in that nominal magnitudes, with the exception of bank

credit, rose more rapidly than prices. The balance—of—payments deficit

also worsened.

    The expansionary policies of 1981 began to take their toll in a rising

inflation rate in the first three quarters of 1982. At this point a new

inflation stabilization policy was introduced, following the lines of the

policy of early 1981. The hope was to move the economy to an inflation


                                     28
rate of 5 percent per month by keeping the rate of increase of the ex-

change rate and controlled prices to that rate. The belief was that these

measures, together with their effects on expectations, could move the

economy to a new lower inflation equilibrium.

      The policy succeeded in bringing the inflation rate down somewhat, but

monetary policy was not supportive of the 5 percent inflation rate; all

nominal magnitudes were expanding at well above 100 percent per year. This

may   explain   the asymmetry of response to downward adjustments in the

exchange rate that was recorded earlier. Domestic prices were still rising

at more than 100 percent per year implying a rapid real exchange rate

appreciation, and accompanying increasing current account deficit. At the

same time, the real wage was rising rapidly (see Figure 2).

      The anti—inflationary policies were buying short—run success at the

cost of a later inflationary outburst when the nominal and real exchange

rates would have to be adjusted to deal with the current—account deficit.

Real wages and income levels would likewise have to be reduced to levels

more commensurate with domestic resources.

      The failure of the Aridor policies is a result of the unwillingness to

reduceaggregate demand sufficiently to justify the new 5 percent per
month equilibrium. Even if, in principle, the economy did have another
lower    inflation equilibrium with the same policies,19 fiscal and/or

monetary policy should have been tightened early in the Aridor program

when it was clear that the real exchange rate was appreciating and that

the policy could not be sustained.

19
      With the growth rate of high—powered money the only nominal anchor in
      the system, it is possible that there is another lower inflation equi—
      ibrium for the economy with unchanged fiscal policy variables, and the
      same amount of revenue being obtained from the printing of money.


                                       29
     When the long—delayed devaluation took place in October 1983, it once

more caused jumps in the price level and in the inflation rate. The price

level increased by more than 50 percent from September to December 1983,

while the exchange rate increased by 68 percent over the same period. Cuts

in subsidies contributed to the rise in prices. The real wage fell sub-

stantially over this period, once more showing the effects of the lags in

the indexation system and the less than 100 percent indexation of wages to

prices. The rate of inflation fell in the first quarter of 1984 to the 300

percent range, but still remained well above the levels before the devalu-

ation.

     Any prospects for restrictive monetary and fiscal policy vanished

with the announcement of elections for July 1984. The government once more

increased subsidies and slowed the devaluation rate to less than the

inflation rate. After a remarkably long period of quiet labor relations

following the devaluation, labor negotiations in the second quarter of

1984 resulted in nominal wage increases that restored real wage levels to

the pre—October 1983 levels. With monetary and fiscal policy expansionary,

with the need for a post—election correction of the exchange rate becoming

evident, and with widespread uncertainty about the type of policies to be

followed after the elections, the inflation rate remained in the 300—400

percent range, and the black market exchange rate opened up a 25 percent

premium over the official rate.



5. Shifts in the Inflation Rate — A Steady—State View

While our approach to inflation dynamics may explain short—run shifts in

inflation, it does not of itself provide an account of the components of

the underlying long—run inflation rate. One summary way of looking at the


                                   30
latter is to apply the framework of equation (12) to the determinants of

the monetary base and the implied steady—state inflation rate. For each

sub—period we may calculate the difference between the ratio of domestic

government finance (ó) and the part of the growth in net financial assets

(money and debt) that individuals would be willing to hold given GNP

growth and the average financial asset ratio [(h +    b)].   The ratio of the

resulting net injection to the money base should be consistent with the
                             20
underlying inflation rate.

      The components of this calculation are shown in Table 4 and the

resulting index appears in line 7 and is compared in line 8 with the mean

inflation rate, by sub—period. Since the money base ratio is itself a

function of the inflation rate, and the failing GNP growth rate, too, may

at least partly be related to rising inflation, one should not interpret

this comparison in pure one—way causality terms. It does, nonetheless,

indicate that the shift in the underlying inflation rate from one phase to

another could be related to three important respective developments: the

rise in the deficit      between the two wars (1968—73), the fail in the

growth rate after the 1973—74 crisis, and the probable drop in the demand

for money in the period after 1977. It Is interesting to note that the

index points to an implied money—base growth rate (267 percent) that is

higher than actual inflation (141 percent) during 1981—83. By the end of

1983, we remember inflation did in fact catch up with this higher figure.

While the actual jump in inflation in October 1983 may be attributed to

the dynamic effects of a delayed devaluation in a perfectly accommodated


20
     For an empirical application of this framework to the analysis of the
     jumps in the inflation rate see Melnick (1983) and Melnick and Sokoler
     (1984). A similar framework was first discussed by N. Liviatan,


                                    31
monetary system, this calculation at least shows that the more recent jump

was not inconsistent with the underlying fiscal and monetary determinants.




IV. POLICY ISSUES


1. The role of indexation

Indexation is at the top of most lists of villains in the Israeli infla—

tion. Any analysis that blames indexation for the inflation has to contend

with the fact that indexation has been widespread in the Israeli economy

since the 1950s, whereas the inflation rate did not reach exaggerated

levels until the 1970g.

    The standard view that indexation is to blame for inflation is correct

in the sense that without indexation, the costs of inflation would have

been so high that the inflation rate would not have reached its current

levels. The government would have been forced to stabilize well before the

three—digit range was reached.

    Beyond this valid point, we distinguish between the roles of indexa—

tion of wages and indexatlon of the values of financial assets. Because

wage indexation is less than 100 percent, the pattern of typically inc-

reasing real wages seen in Figure 3 could not have been attained without

discretionary wage fixing, especially in more recent years. There is no

reason to think that labor would have been more willing to take real wage

cuts in the absence of indexation; nor, given the lags in indexation, is

it likely that nominal wages would have adjusted significantly more slowly

in the absence of indexation.

     Indexation of financial asset returns does, however, significantly

reduce the automatic stabilization of the economy. Price and exchange—rate

                                    32
shocks automatically affect the nominal value of large stocks of assets.

The effect of a given devaluation on the balance of payments is thereby

also reduced. More active accompanying fiscal policy could compensate for

the loss of automatic stabilization, but variations in government spending

and taxes are neither costless nor easily achieved.

      The difficulties created for the stability of the system by the debt

are a result not only of indexation but also of the size of the debt. If

the debt were small, as it had been in the 1950s and 1960s, the change in

the nominal value of wealth resulting from a given shock to prices or the

exchange rate would also be small, and the stabilizing power of the real

balance effect would be proportionately greater. Further, the continued

issuance of indexed as opposed to nominal debt can itself be viewed as an

endogenous response to the need to finance large budget deficits: the

public simply would not have been prepared to lend to the government on

terms that gave the government the option to repudiate the debt through
             21
inflation.

      So long as the debt and inflation continue to be large, there is no

prospect for shifting to a different structure of assets, though steps

could be taken to reduce the liquidity of the debt. A sharp cut in the

government budget deficit sufficient to begin reducing the debt/GDP ratio

would eventually both reduce the difficulties created by the indexation of




21
     It is not obvious that an optimizing trustworthy government operating
                                  .


     in an environment with considerable macro—risk should issue indexed
     debt. The issue is complicated by the inter—generational nature of the
     risk—sharing implied by public debt issue: issuing indexed debt gives
     the current generation of savers a claim of fixed value on later
     generations of producers. The question of the optimal form of govern-
     ment debt issue is closely connected with the problem of
     jnjstc; see Lucas and Stokey (1983).

the debt and make it possible to begin issuing different types of debt.22



2. The costs of inflation

There has been very little research on the costs of inflation in Israel.

The co—incidence of the rise in the inflation rate after 1973 with the

reduction in the growth rate is generally suspected to be more than that:

in one direction we have already seen above that a fall in the growth rate

is likely to increase the inflation rate; less firmly established is the

causal link from high inflation to low growth. It is not sufficient to

point to the Israeli experience, for there has been a worldwide reduction

in the growth rate of output, shared by countries like Japan where the

inflation rate fell from the 1960s, and countries like Israel where the

inflation rate increased. While we believe that the continuation of infla-

tion in Israel is partly to blame for low growth, we are uncomfortably

aware that the case has not been proved.

      One source of the relationship between the growth rate of output and

rising inflation may    be   the increasing diversion of resources to financial

activities as inflation increases. Preliminary results by Kleiman (1984)

suggest that increasing activity in the financial sector absorbed an extra

3—4   percent   of GNP by 1982, The well—known   measure   of the costs of antici-

pated inflation as the area under the demand curve for high—powered money




21
      Indexation of debt in Israel applies almost entirely to government
      bonds. There has been virtually no private issue of indexed debt;
      behind every major, apparently private—sector indexed liability (such
      as long term savings accounts in banks, or indexed life insurance)
      stand government indexed bonds. The government is active as a finan-
      cial intermediary, borrowing indexed from the public to make (until
      1979) non—indexed loans to the private sector, or to offer subsidized
      credit for exports, housing, and other forms of investment.


                                         34
 gives estimates   of the cost of 160 percent inflation as being about 2—3
 percent   of GNP. This   is   an alternative estimate   of   the increased absorp—
 tion of resources   in   making financial transactions.

      These are useful lower bound estimates of the costs of inflation, but

 familiar stories of the increasing inefficiency of the price system, the

 diversion of managers' time to financial instead of real output decisions,

the inefficiency and —     with   rising inflation —   the progressive breakdown
of the tax system, and so forth, suggest the costs are much higher

     However, the existence of indexed assets in Israel means that one of

the major costs of and concerns about (uncertain) inflation —           the   inabi—

lity to protect the real value of savings —       is   not present, or at least is

present only to the extent that there is uncertainty about the govern—

rnent's ability to meet its formal commitments, This difference accounts

for the lesser public concern expressed about inflation in Israel than in

other countries with much lower inflation rates.



3. Public opInion about inflation

There has not been any overwhelming pressure of public opinion in Israel

to end the inflation. In part this has been because there are pressing

non—economic issues before the electorate; in addition, the costs of

inflation are not perceived to be great.

     The indexation system protects the public from what in other coun-

tries would be the major costs associated with high and uncertain infla-

tion. Further, although the rise in inflation in Israel was accompanied by

slower growth, it has in recent years also been accompanied by a rapidly

rising standard of living. For the years 1980—1983, private consumption

increased by 28 percent (while GNP grew       only 6 percent). Under these

                                         35
conditions the public may be excused f or not seeing a pressing need to end

inflation —   particularly   when it is well known that the adjustment process

would require a transitory period of unemployment.



4. Stabilization programs

We do not provide a full discussion here, rather touching on the issues

that have been raised in the debate.

    The economy is seen as facing both real and nominal problems. On the

real side the balance—of—payments deficit is viewed as too large, leaving

the economy sensitive to both political pressure from the United States

government and to changes in opinion in the world capital markets; simi-

larly, the budget deficit is too large, implying a national debt that is

growing too rapidly, and diverting too much of the private sector's saving

to government debt. On the nominal side, there is a need to reduce the

inflation rate and the sensitivity of the price level to shocks hitting

the economy.

    The first set of issues are those of whether to attempt to stabilize,

and how rapidly. As the inflation rate has increased, economists have

moved increasingly towards the views that reducing the inflation rate back

to the low double digit range is desirable, and that this could only be

carried out through a comprehensive stabilization program that attempts to

make the adjustment rapidly rather than gradually. The conclusion that

inflation should be ended has been reached because of the increasing

perception of the economy and the financial system as out of control,

tending over time always to higher inflation rates, and with an increasing

frequency of balance of payments crises. The low growth —     high inflation
correlation of the economy has also influenced the argument.


                                        36
     The conclusion that the program should be comprehensive and rapid has

 been reached on political economy, and not purely economic, grounds. The

 failure of successive governments since 1977 to persist with restrictive

 policies for periods of much more than half a year raises the fear that

 any gradualist program in which restrictive policy —     for   instance, a
 continuing series of budget cuts —   is   supposed to be maintained over

 several years is unlikely to be followed through by the government. Hence

 the conclusion that the tough medicine should be taken all at once.

     The list of measures included in the program starts from a cut in the

budget deficit. The justification for and the proposed size of cuts

varies: for instance Liviatan and Piterman (in this volume) argue that the

budget deficit matters mainly because it affects the balance of payments,

and that a cut in the deficit of 3—4   percent   of GNP would be sufficient;

others (ourselves included) point to the large and growing debt as so

constraining monetary policy (because of the need to roll over the debt

and prevent rising interest payments from making the budget deficit

larger) and increasing the likelihood of future crises that it is essen-

tial to move rapidly to a balanced budget so that the debt/GNP ratio can

start failing.

    It is also generally agreed that in the long run monetary policy

should play a stronger role in the economy, with perhaps explicit adoption

of monetary growth targets. Strict adherence to monetary targets in an

extremely open economy is, however, unlikely, for exchange rate distur-

bances originating abroad will at times have to be offset by monetary

policy.

    The difficult issues of a stabilization program arise in discussion of

the measures that should accompany the initial budget cuts, in the attempt


                                      37
to minimize the unemployment costs of the transition to a low inflation

equilibrium. One approach that has received support is to attempt to move

almost immediately to a zero or low inflation equilibrium through an

agreement with the Histadrut to freeze nominal wages, by fixing the ex-

change rate, and by attempting to control prices. The difficulty in this

approach is that the program will have to start with a real devaluation

and   changes   in relative prices of goods, that would certainly make it

difficult to control the absolute level of prices —     or   alternatively could

lead to damaging relative price distortions and greater unemployment.

Another difficulty with this approach is that it Is almost certain that

readjustments of prices and the exchange rate will be necessary after some

time, and that these readjustments could reignite inflation.

       An alternative approach would first implement budget cuts and wait

for unemployment to emerge before trying to reduce the inflation rate

through a co—ordinated package of measures. This approach can be seen as

trying to solve the    real   problem first and the nominal one later. The

danger in this approach is that the large unemployment costs incurred at

the beginning would lead to the abandonment of the second—stage inflation

reduction part of the program.

      The issue of how to handle the large stock of indexed assets in the

economy during this transition period and for the future stability of the

economy has also received attention. There have been many proposals to

reduce the liquidity of the dollar—indexed PATAN accounts, though less

detail on how to do this; there was also at the time of writing fear that

a new government would in some way reduce the value of these assets as

part of a stabilization program. A capital levy, which would reduce the

value of the outstanding debt without taxing especially those who had in


                                        38
 the past purchased government debt was also on some agendas.

       Finally, we briefly discuss the dollarization alternative that was

 proposed at the end of 1983 by Finance Minister Aridor in the wake of the

 failure of his previous policies If the Israeli economy were Indeed to

move to complete use of the dollar, its long—run inflation rate would be

that   of   the United States23 and inflation would be ended quickly.

There is no guarantee, however, that such a change would reduce the unem—

ployment Costs of the transition to a lower inflation rate.

     From a purely economic viewpoint dollarlzation is undesirable because

the country would pay to the United States government the revenue that it

would otherwise be obtaining for itself through the printing of money. In

addition, Israel would be accepting the American exchange rate vis—à—vis

other currencies: for instance, if Israel had been on the dollar in the

last few years its currency would have appreciated substantially relative

to Europe. This would not have been desirable.

     There are of course nationalist reasons not to dollarize. Adoption of

a well planned stabilization program would make it less likely that

dollarization would in the end be the only available solution for the

economy.
