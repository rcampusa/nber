Financial Frictions and Fluctuations in Volatility

                                          ABSTRACT

During the recent U.S. financial crisis, the large decline in aggregate output and labor was
accompanied by both a tightening of financial conditions and a large increase in the dispersion of
growth rates across firms. The tightened financial conditions manifested themselves as increases
in firms' credit spreads and decreases in both equity payouts and debt purchases. These features
motivate us to build a model in which increased volatility of firm level productivity shocks
generates a downturn and worsened credit conditions. The key idea in the model is that hiring
inputs is risky because financial frictions limit firms' ability to insure against shocks. Hence, an
increase in idiosyncratic volatility induces firms to reduce their inputs to reduce such risk. We
find that our model can generate most of the decline in output and labor in the Great Recession of
2007–2009 and the observed tightening of financial conditions.

       During the recent U.S. …nancial crisis, the economy experienced a severe contraction
in economic activity and a tightening of …nancial conditions. At the micro level, the cri-
sis was accompanied by large increases in the cross-section dispersion of …rm growth rates
(Bloom et al. 2014). At the macro level, it was accompanied by a large decline in labor
and output. During the crisis …nancial, conditions tightened in that …rms’ credit spreads
increased, and both equity payouts and debt purchases decreased. Finally, aggregate total
factor productivity fell only slightly. Motivated by these observations, we build a quantitative
general equilibrium model with heterogeneous …rms and …nancial frictions in which increases
in volatility at the …rm level lead to increases in the cross-section dispersion of …rm growth
rates, a worsening of …nancial conditions, and decreases in aggregate labor and output with
small movements in measured total factor productivity.
       The key idea in the model is that hiring inputs to produce output is a risky endeavor.
Firms must hire inputs to produce and take on the …nancial obligations to pay for them before
they receive the revenues from their sales. In this context, any idiosyncratic shock that occurs
between the time of production and the receipt of revenues makes hiring inputs risky. When
…nancial markets are incomplete in that …rms have only debt contracts to insure against such
shocks, they must bear this risk. This risk has real consequences if, when …rms cannot meet
their …nancial obligations, they must experience a costly default. In the model, an increase
in uncertainty arising from an increase in the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity shocks
makes the revenues from any given amount of labor more volatile and the probability of a
default more likely. In equilibrium, an increase in volatility leads …rms to pull back on their
hiring of inputs.
       We quantify our model and ask, can an increase in the volatility of …rm-level idiosyn-
cratic productivity shocks that generates the observed increase in the cross-section dispersion
in the recent recession lead to a sizable contraction in aggregate economic activity and tighter
…nancial conditions? We …nd that the answer is yes. Our model can generate most of the
decline in output and employment seen in the Great Recession of 2007–2009. During this
event, our model can also generate increases in …rm credit spreads, as well as reductions in
debt purchases and equity payouts comparable to those observed in the data. More generally,
we …nd that the model generates labor ‡uctuations that are large relative to those in output,
similar to the relationship in the data. The ability to generate such a pattern has been a
major goal of the business cycle literature. Underlying these aggregate macro predictions, our
model contains a rich set of micro predictions. We compare the model to …rm-level data and
show that it generates data consistent with the distributions and covariates of …rm spreads,
leverage, debt purchases, and equity payouts.
       Our model has a continuum of heterogeneous …rms that produce di¤erentiated prod-
ucts. The productivity of these …rms is subject to idiosyncratic shocks. The volatility of
these shocks is stochastically time varying, and these volatility shocks are the only aggregate
shocks in the economy.
       The model has three key ingredients. First, …rms hire their inputs— here, labor— and
produce before they know their idiosyncratic shocks. That hiring labor is a risky investment
is a hallmark of quantitative search and matching models but is missing from most simple
macroeconomic models that have, essentially, static labor choices. Here we capture that
feature in a simple way: …rms commit to hiring labor before they experience idiosyncratic
shocks. Second, …nancial markets are incomplete in that …rms have access only to state-
uncontingent debt and can default on it. Firms face interest rate schedules for borrowing
that re‡ect their default probabilities and are increasing in their borrowing and labor choices
and depend on all shocks. Third, motivated by the work of Jensen (1986), we introduce an
incentive problem in that managers can divert free cash ‡ow to projects that bene…t them at
the expense of …rms. This incentive problem creates an agency friction that makes it optimal
for …rms to limit the free cash ‡ow. This limitation makes the …rm less able to self-insure
against shocks.
       Given these ingredients, when …rms choose their inputs, they face a trade-o¤ between
the expected return on hiring workers and the risk of default. As …rms increase their la-
bor, they increase the expected return conditional on not defaulting, but they increase the
probability of default. For a given variance of idiosyncratic productivity shocks, they choose
labor to balance o¤ the increase in expected return against the costs from increasing default
probabilities. The increase in the probability of default has two costs: it increases the proba-
bility of liquidation and increases the interest rate …rms pay on their borrowing. These e¤ects
constitute an extra cost of increasing labor and thus distort the …rm’s optimal labor choice.


                                                2
       When the variance of the idiosyncratic productivity shocks increases at a given level
of labor and borrowing, the probability of default increases and the interest rate schedule
tightens, both of which increase the distortions for labor and borrowing. Firms become
more cautious in the face of such an increase in variance and respond by decreasing labor and
borrowing. In equilibrium, default probabilities and credit spreads increase. At the aggregate
level, these …rm-level responses imply that when volatility increases, aggregate output and
employment both fall, debt purchases are reduced, and credit spreads increase.
       The result that …rms decrease employment when the variance of idiosyncratic produc-
tivity shocks increases depends critically on our assumptions of incomplete …nancial markets
and the agency friction. If …rms had access to complete …nancial markets, an increase in
volatility would lead to no change in their employment; …rms would simply restructure the
pattern of payments across states so that they would never default. With incomplete mar-
kets and default risk, …rms have a precautionary motive to self-insure by maintaining a bu¤er
stock of unused credit. If incentives to self-insure are su¢ ciently strong, …rms build such
a large stock that they can greatly dampen ‡uctuations in labor. We introduce an agency
friction that limits the incentives to build up such a large bu¤er stock.
       We are motivated to introduce agency frictions by a large literature in …nance that
argues that there are substantial agency costs of maintaining a large bu¤er stock of unused
credit and that these agency costs help explain why …rms typically have large amounts of debt.
In particular, Jensen (1986) argues that, in practice, if …rms retain a large bu¤er, managers
use these funds in ways that bene…t their private interests rather than shareholder interests.
Since shareholders understand these incentives, they give the managers incentives to pay out
funds immediately rather than retain them. We model this Jensen e¤ect by assuming that
managers can divert the bu¤er stock to projects that bene…t them at the expense of the …rm.
In the presence of such a friction, the …rm …nds it optimal to limit the size of the bu¤er stock
and maintain high debt levels.
       We show that a quantitative version of the model can successfully reproduce the main
real and …nancial variables at both the macro and micro level. We choose the parameters
of the idiosyncratic …rm productivity shock process, including those governing the aggregate
volatility shocks, so that the model produces the observed time variation in the cross-sectional


                                               3
dispersion of the growth rate of sales.
       At the macro level, the model produces 86% percent of the observed ‡uctuations in
output and ‡uctuations in labor that, as in the data, are about 30% more volatile than
those in output. The model generates many features of observed …nancial variables including
countercylical spreads and procyclical debt purchases and equity payouts. At the micro
level, the model reproduces the main patterns of the cross-sectional distributions of …nancial
variables including spreads, leverage, debt purchases, and equity payouts. It is also consistent
with the observed positive correlation of spreads with leverage.
       We view our model as providing a new mechanism that links increases in …rm-level
volatility to downturns. To keep the model simple, we have abstracted from additional forces
that would lead it to generate a slow recovery, as has been observed following the Great
Recession. In so doing, we follow the spirit of much of the work on the Great Depression,
including Cole and Ohanian (2004), that divides the analysis of the downturn and recovery
into mechanisms that generate the sharp downturn and mechanisms that generate a slow
recovery.
Related Literature. Our work is motivated by the evidence of Bloom et al. (2014) that
uses detailed Census micro data to document that the dispersion of plant-level shocks to
total factor productivity is strongly countercyclical, rising steeply in recessions. In terms of
causality, Bloom et al. (2014) ask whether volatility drives the cycle or whether recessions
drive increases in volatility. In particular, they search for but …nd no evidence that the
increase in the variance of these shocks is driven by level, or …rst-moment, shocks and conclude
that the causation seems to run from volatility to the cycle and not the reverse.
       Our work is related to models that link time-varying volatility to downturns. Bloom
(2009) and Bloom et al. (2014) consider models with frictionless …nancial markets. As
such, their models do not attempt to deliver on our prime motivation: linking the drop in
economic activity during the Great Recession to a tightening of …nancial conditions. Instead,
their work focuses on adjustment costs, which implies that …rms halt their investment and
hiring when hit by a high volatility shock, but such …rms have zero credit spreads. We
purposefully abstract from such adjustment costs to emphasize the …nancial frictions that
lay at the heart of our mechanism, and in contrast to Bloom et al. (2014), show that the


                                               4
empirical implications of the model are consistent with micro and macro …nancial data.
       Schaal (2014) endogenizes adjustment costs to labor by incorporating time-varying
volatility shocks into a search model of the labor market. He shows that while an increase in
idiosyncratic volatility leads to an increase in unemployment, it actually leads to an increase
in output. A main success of his model is that a given drop in aggregate TFP generates a
larger increase in unemployment than Shimer’s (2005) search model. In contrast to our work,
however, this framework cannot account for any of the downturn in output during the Great
Recession from the observed increase in volatility.
       As in our work, Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2009) and Gilchrist, Sim, and
Zakrajsek (2010) explore the business cycle implications of volatility shocks in environments
with …nancial frictions. While both of these studies are complementary to ours, we focus on
di¤erent issues. Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2009) show that, in a dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium model with nominal rigidities and …nancial frictions, volatility shocks
to the quality of capital account for a signi…cant portion of the ‡uctuations in output. In
contrast to our work, they focus solely on aggregate implications and abstract from any
features of the micro data, such as the observed high persistence in …rm-level productivity
shocks and the distribution of real and …nancial outcomes at the …rm level, such as sales
growth and spreads. Gilchrist, Sim, and Zakrajsek (2010) have a frictionless labor market
and instead focus on the dynamics of investment. Di¤erently from us, they abstract from any
feature that can generate the large observed labor wedge in the Great Recession documented
by Brinca, Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2016).
       Our work is also related to studies on heterogeneous …rms and …nancial frictions. For
example, Cooley and Quadrini (2001) develop a model of heterogeneous …rms with incom-
plete …nancial markets and default risk and explore its implications for the dynamics of …rm
investment growth and exit. In other work, Cooley, Marimon, and Quadrini (2004) …nd in
a general equilibrium setting that limited enforceability of …nancial contracts ampli…es the
e¤ects of technology shocks on output.
       Finally, several researchers, including Buera and Shin (2010), Buera, Kaboski, and
Shin (2011), and Midrigan and Xu (2014), have used heterogeneous …rm models without
aggregate shocks to help account for the relation between …nancial frictions and the level of


                                              5
development.
       A recent literature, linking …nancial frictions and business cycles, has developed quan-
titative business cycle models in which the exogenous shock is directly to the credit constraint.
(See, for example, the work of Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2011), Perri and Quadrini (2011),
Jermann and Quadrini (2012), and Midrigan and Philippon (2016).) As do we, this liter-
ature aims at generating business cycle ‡uctuations without large ‡uctuations in aggregate
productivity. One di¤erence is that in our model, the tightening of the credit constraint is
endogenously linked to our volatility shocks, measured from …rm-level data, while in this lit-
erature the shock to the credit constraint is exogeneous and chosen based only on aggregate
data. Khan and Thomas (2013) have exogenous shocks directly to the collateral constraint
in a model with heterogeneous …rms subject to investment adjustment costs. They …nd that
a shock that tightens the collateral constraint can generate a long-lasting recession. Their
model di¤ers from ours in that they abstract from any labor market frictions and, in it, credit
spreads are zero. Our work is complementary to this literature.
       As shown in Eggertsson and Krugman (2012), …nancial shocks can lead to reductions
in aggregate demand when coupled with sticky prices. In a quantitative model, Midrigan
and Philippon (2016) …nd that shocks that directly tighten credit constraints in an economy
with sticky prices can account for under half of the employment decline during the Great
Recession because these shocks cause the economy to hit the zero lower bound. We think of
our work as complementary to theirs. Adding to our model sticky prices and a zero lower
bound constraint would simply amplify our e¤ects.

1. Our Mechanism in a Simple Example
       Before we turn to our full model, we construct a simple example to illustrate our mech-
anism in its starkest and most intuitive form. Speci…cally, we show how, in the presence of
…nancial frictions, ‡uctuations in the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks give rise to distortions
that generate ‡uctuations in labor. To do so, we compare the optimal labor choice of …rms in
two environments: one in which they can fully insure against shocks and one in which they
cannot insure at all.
       Consider a model with a continuum of …rms that solve one-period problems. Firms


                                                6
begin with some debt obligations b; produce using the technology y = ` , and maximize
equity payouts, which must be nonnegative. They choose the amount of labor input ` to hire
before the idiosyncratic shock z for this product is realized. These shocks are drawn from a
continuous distribution                z (z)     with volatility       z.   The demand for a given …rm’s product is
given by

                   z
(1)   y=                  Y;
                   p

where Y is aggregate output. As we discuss later, the shock z can be interpreted as a
productivity shock. At the end of the period, after shock z is realized, a …rm chooses the
price p for its product and sells it. If a …rm has su¢ cient revenues from these sales, it pays
equity holders its revenues net of its wage bill w` and debt obligations. This …rm also receives
a continuation value V; here simply modeled as a positive constant. If the …rm cannot pay
its wage bill and debt, it defaults, equity payouts are zero, and the …rm also receives a
continuation value of zero.
       Consider, …rst, what happens when …nancial markets are complete. Imagine that a
…rm chooses the state-contingent pattern of repayments b(z) to meet its total debt obligations
b and, hence, faces the constraint
      Z    1
(2)            b(z) z (z)dz = b:
       0


The …rm chooses labor and state-contingent debt to solve the following problem:
               Z    1
      max               [p(z; `)`          w`        b(z)] z (z)dz + V
      `;b(z)    0


subject to (2) and the nonnegative equity payout condition


(3)   p(z; `)`            w`        b(z)        0;


where p(z; `) = zY 1= `                =
                                            is the price the …rm sets to sell all of its output and is derived
from (1) and y = ` . Assume that the debt b is small enough so that it can be paid for


                                                                   7
by the pro…ts of the …rm. Hence, with complete …nancial markets, the …rm can guarantee
positive cash ‡ows in every state in period 1 by using state-contingent debt b(z), and the
equity payout constraint is not binding.
       With complete markets, the …rm’s optimal labor choice ` is such that the expected
marginal product of labor is a constant markup over the wage

                               1
(4)   Ep(z; ` ) (` )               =            w:
                                            1

This …rst-order condition shows that with complete …nancial markets, ‡uctuations in the
volatility of the idiosyncratic shock z that do not a¤ect its mean will have no impact on a
…rm’s labor choice, since p(z; `) is linear in z.
       Now consider what happens when …nancial markets are not complete. The existing
debt is state uncontingent, so …rms have no way to insure against idiosyncratic shocks. Here,
…rms with large employment have to default and exit when they experience low productivity
shocks, since cash ‡ow is insu¢ cient to cover the wage bill plus debt repayments. E¤ectively,
the …rm chooses its labor input ` as well as a cuto¤ productivity z^ below which it defaults,
where for any `; z^ is the lowest z such that p(z; `)`                            w` + b, where p(z; `) is described
above. Thus, the …rm solves the following problem:
             Z    1                                            Z    1
      max             [p(z; `)z`       w`       b] z (z)dz +            V   z (z)dz
       `;^
         z   z^                                                z^


subject to p(^
             z ; `)`          w`       b = 0: This last condition de…nes the cuto¤ productivity z^ below
which the …rm defaults, because for any z < z^, the …rm would have negative equity payouts.
The cuto¤ z^ is increasing in labor because as labor ` is increased, the wage bill w` increases
by larger amounts than the revenues p(z; `)` . The larger the level of labor `, the larger the
probability of default for the …rm.
       In this environment, the optimal choice of labor does not simply maximize period 1
pro…ts as it does with complete …nancial markets. Here, the …rm balances the marginal in-
crease in pro…ts from an increase in ` with the increased costs arising from a higher probability




                                                               8
of default that such an increase entails. The choice of ` satis…es

                                1                        z (^
                                                            z)     d^
                                                                    z
(5)   E(p(z; ` )jz    z^) `         =       w+V                       ;
                                        1            1      z (^
                                                               z ) d`

where p(^
        z ; ` )`     w`       b = 0 and     z (z)   is the distribution function associated with the
density   z (z).

       When …nancial markets are incomplete and …rms face default risk, the choice of `
equates the e¤ective marginal product of labor in the states in which the …rm is operative
to the marginal costs arising from increasing labor, which includes the wage and the loss in
future value. This loss in future value arising from default risk and encoded in the second
term of the right-hand side of condition (5) distorts the …rm’s …rst-order condition and creates
a wedge between the marginal product of labor and the wage.
       Now, in contrast to what happens in complete …nancial markets, here ‡uctuations in
the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks do a¤ect the …rst-order condition of labor. Increases
in volatility typically increase the hazard rate         z (^
                                                            z )=[1     z (^
                                                                          z )],   which in turn leads to a
larger distortion and a smaller labor input for any given wage w and aggregate output Y .
More precisely, in the appendix, we assume that z is lognormally distributed with E(z) = 1
                     2
and var(log z) =     z:   We show that if the value of continuation V is su¢ ciently large, then
a mean-preserving spread, namely an increase in              z,   leads to a decrease in labor `. The
intuition for this result is that an increase in volatility increases the risk of default; hence,
…rms have incentives to lower this risk by reducing their labor input.
       Note that the …rst-order condition (5) shares some features with that for the choice
of capital in standard costly state veri…cation models, as in Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist
(1999). In particular, the lost resources from default in our example play a similar role as
the lost resources from monitoring in the costly state veri…cation framework.

2. Model
       We now turn to our general model, namely, a dynamic open economy model that in-
corporates …nancial frictions and variations in the volatility of idiosyncratic shocks at the …rm
level. The economy has continuums of …nal goods, intermediate goods …rms, and households.
The …nal goods …rms are competitive and have a technology that converts intermediate goods

into a …nal good. This technology is subject to idiosyncratic shocks that a¤ect the produc-
tivity of intermediate goods used to produce …nal goods. The volatility of these shocks is
stochastically time varying, and these volatility shocks are the only aggregate shocks in the
economy.
          The intermediate goods …rms are monopolistically competitive and use labor to pro-
duce di¤erentiated products. They can only borrow state-uncontingent debt and are allowed
to default on both their debt and payments to workers. If they default, they exit the market
with zero value. New …rms enter to replace defaulting …rms that exit. Households have
preferences over consumption and leisure, provide labor services to intermediate goods …rms,
and own all …rms.
          At the end of any given period, …rms decide how many workers to hire for the next
period and how much to borrow, while households decide how much labor to supply to the
market for the next period. In the beginning of the next period, aggregate and idiosyncratic
shocks are realized. Intermediate goods …rms set their prices, produce, sell their products to
…nal goods …rms, choose whether to pay their existing debts and their wage bill, and distribute
dividends. The …nal goods …rms buy the intermediate goods and produce. Potential new
…rms decide whether to enter the market. Households consume and receive payments on their
assets.

A. Final and Intermediate Goods Firms
          The …nal good is traded on world markets and has a price of one. The …nal good Yt is
produced from a …xed variety of nontraded intermediate goods i 2 [0; 1] via the technology

                 Z                           1
                                    1
(6)   Yt             zt (i)yt (i)       di       ;


where the elasticity of demand is greater than one. Final goods …rms choose the intermediate
goods fyt (i)g to solve
                     Z
(7)   max Yt             pt (i)yt (i)di
      fyt (i)g




                                                     10
subject to (6), where pt (i) is the price of good i relative to the price of the …nal good. This
problem yields that the demand yt (i) for good i is

                      zt (i)
(8)    yt (i) =                Yt :
                      pt (i)

         Intermediate goods …rms produce di¤erentiated goods that are subject to idiosyncratic
productivity shocks zt that follow a Markov process with transition function             z (zt jzt 1 ;   t 1 ),

where     t 1   is an aggregate shock to the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic productivity
shocks. The aggregate shock           t   follows a Markov process with transition function      ( tj    t 1 ).

Firms are also subject to i.i.d. idiosyncratic revenue shocks               t   that have a distribution
  ( ). These …rms are monopolistically competitive and produce output yt using technology
yt = `t `mt , where `t is the input of workers and `mt is the input of a single manager where
0<      < 1. Since each active …rm uses one manager, we simply impose `mt = 1 from now on.
         In the current setup, since the …nal goods production function has no value added but
rather simply combines the intermediate goods, we can alternatively reinterpret our setup as
                                              R         1   1
follows. The aggregator of …nal goods is Yt =   y~t (i) di    and each …nal good i produces
           (    1)=
y~t (i) = zt          `t `mt units of good i with associated demand function y~t (i) = pt (i) Yt . Here,
when measured in logs, the TFP of a …rm is proportional to zt . This alternative interpretation
is useful to keep in mind when using the data to help set the parameters for zt .
         After all shocks are realized, each …rm decides on the price pt (i) of its product and
decides whether to repay or default on its wage bill and debt. Since …rms face demand curves
with an elasticity larger than 1, they always choose prices to sell all of their output, and,
hence, we can set pt (i) = zt (i) (Yt =`t (i))1= and eliminate prices as a choice variable from
now on. Firms that default exit, whereas …rms that continue choose new debt bt+1 and labor
input `t+1 at the end of period t, paying the associated wage bill only after they produce.
This debt contract pays o¤ bt+1 at t + 1 as long as a …rm chooses not to default at t + 1 and
gives the …rm qt bt+1 at t where, as we show later, the bond price qt is a function that re‡ects
the compensation for the loss in case of default.
         Firms pay their equity holders their revenues net of production costs and net payments
on debt. Equity payouts dt are restricted to be nonnegative and satisfy the nonnegative equity


                                                       11
payout condition


(9)     dt = pt ` t   wt `t   wmt    t     bt + qt bt+1    0;


where wt is the wage of workers and wmt is the wage of managers. Firms use variations in
equity payouts to help bu¤er shocks. It will turn out that this motive leads equity payouts to
be procyclical, as they are in the data. We follow Jermann and Quadrini (2012) in interpreting
reductions in equity payouts as issuing equity.
         It is convenient for the recursive formulation to de…ne the cash-on-hand xt as


(10) xt = pt `t       wt `t   wmt    t     bt :


         The idiosyncratic state of a …rm, (zt ; xt ), records the current idiosyncratic shock zt and
its cash-on-hand xt ; whereas the aggregate state St = ( t ;       t)   records the current aggregate
shock     t   and the distribution   t   over idiosyncratic states. It is permissible to index a …rm
by its idiosyncratic state (zt ; xt ) rather than its index i because all intermediate goods …rms
with the same idiosyncratic state take the same decisions.
         We provide a brief overview of the …rm’s problem before we formally describe it. The
…rm’s value is the discounted value of its stream of equity payouts. In each period the …rm
chooses current equity payouts, the default decision, borrowing, and next period’s labor. The
…rm has a budget constraint, a nonnegativity condition on equity payouts, and an agency
friction constraint derived from the manager’s incentive problem. Firms default only when
their value is less than or equal to zero. Since equity payouts are nonnegative, the …rm’s
value is always nonnegative. Since the …rm will never default if it can pay positive equity
payouts in the current period, it follows that the …rm will default only if there is no feasible
choice for it that leads to nonnegative equity payouts, that is, it defaults only if its budget
set is empty. Using this logic, we can set up the …rm’s problem.

Financial Frictions
         We turn now to discussing the bond price and the default decision that determines
it and then turn to the agency friction. The bond price qt = q(St ; zt ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ) re‡ects the


                                                      12
compensation for the loss in case of default and depends on the current aggregate state St ;
the …rm’s current idiosyncratic shock zt , and two decisions of the …rm— its labor input `t+1
and its borrowing level bt+1 . To derive when …rms default, let M (St ; zt ) be the maximal
borrowing, namely the largest amount a …rm can borrow, given the price of debt schedule q,
that is,


(11) M (St ; zt ) =         max q(St ; zt ; `t+1 ; bt+1 )bt+1 ,
                        f`t+1 ;bt+1 g


and let `(St ; zt ) and b(St ; zt ) be the labor and debt plan associated with this maximal bor-
rowing. Let       t+1   =     (St ; St+1 ; zt+1 ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ) be the highest level of the revenue shock such
that if at this level a …rm borrows this maximal amount, it can just satisfy the nonnegative
equity payout condition. From (9), this cuto¤ level of revenue shock satis…es


(12)    t+1         (St ; St+1 ; zt+1 ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ) = pt+1 `t+1        wt+1 `t+1         wmt+1       bt+1 + M (St+1 ; zt+1 );

                                          1=
where pt+1 = zt+1 Yt+1 =`t+1                   . Wages for workers and managers, wt+1 = w(St ) and
wmt+1 (St ); depend on the aggregate state St because they are determined at the end of
period t. Aggregate output Yt+1 = Y (St ) also depends on the aggregate state St because it is
based on choices made at the end of period t and the distribution of idiosyncratic productivity
shocks at t + 1, which is known at the end of period t.
        The default decision thus has a cuto¤ form: repay in period t + 1 if the revenue shock

        t+1 ,   which occurs with probability               (   t+1 ),   and default otherwise. Hence, the bond
price schedule that ensures that lenders break even is de…ned by

                                         X
(13) q(St ; zt ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ) =                    (   t+1 j t ) z (zt+1 jzt ;   t)   (   t+1 );
                                        t+1 ;zt+1



where      is the discount factor of risk-neutral international intermediaries and the aggregate
state St evolves according to its transition function.
        All …rms, even those that default, choose prices and produce. Defaulting …rms with
enough revenues to cover their wage bill, namely those with pt `t                              wt `t     wmt       t   0, pay
this wage bill in full, and those with insu¢ cient revenues to cover current wages pay out of

                                                                13
all of their revenues to labor. Defaulting …rms can pay their wage bill in full if


(14)    t     (St ; zt+1 ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ) = pt+1 (St ; zt+1 ; `t+1 )`t+1   w(St )`t+1   wmt+1 .


       Consider next the agency friction. This friction captures the tensions between share-
holders and managers discussed by Jensen (1986). The idea is that if the plans of the …rm
do not exhaust most of the credit available to the …rm, then managers are tempted to access
this unused credit and use the resulting funds to bene…t their private interests relative to
the shareholder interests. When shareholders choose their borrowing, they understand the
incentives of managers to divert unused credit. This agency friction will end up implying
a constraint on the maximum amount of unused credit or equivalently, a constraint on the
minimum amount of borrowing.
       A large number of potential managers either can work in intermediate goods …rms with
wmt or can use a backyard technology to produce wm units of …nal goods each period. Given
the large number of potential managers, competition implies that managers earn wmt = wm .
If a …rm leaves too much unused credit, the manager of that …rm will make the following
deviation. After the …rm borrows qt bt+1 , the manager diverts the unused credit, the maximal
credit M (St ; zt ) minus the actual credit used by the …rm qt bt+1 : The manager uses these
resources to hire workers `s;t+1 for a side project chosen to just exhaust the unused credit at
the current wages; that is, `s;t+1 solves


(15) M (St ; zt )    qt bt+1 = wt+1 `s;t+1 ;


where qt = q(St ; zt ; `t+1 ; bt+1 ). This side project produces a good with a current period payo¤
for the manager of


(16)    `s;t+1 Et ps;t+1


where the fraction         determines the pro…tability of this side project, `s;t+1 = (M (St ; zt )
qt bt+1 )=wt+1 , and ps;t+1 = zt+1 (Yt+1 =`s;t+1 )1= . In this diversion, the deviating manager
changes the plan of the …rm from `t+1 ,bt+1 to the plan `(St ; zt ), b(St ; zt ), which allows maximal


                                                         14
borrowing, M (St ; zt ), and the creditors adjust the price of debt in (13) to be consistent with
the deviating plan so that they break even. After diversion, the …rm …res the manager. After
being …red, the manager regains the ability to either work in the market or use the backyard
technology with probability . A manager will not divert unused credit if the diversion payo¤
is su¢ ciently small relative to the wage in that

                                 wm          wm
(17) Et ps;t+1 `s;t+1 +                         :
                                1           1

The left side of this constraint captures both the current period payo¤ of diverting funds plus
the present value of payo¤s after being …red, while the right side is the present value of wages
if the manager never diverts funds. To prevent diversion, …rms leave small enough unused
credit such that the value of the side project the manager can undertake is su¢ ciently small,
which means choosing borrowing to be su¢ ciently high so that the agency friction constraint


(18) q(St ; zt ; `t+1 ; bt+1 )bt+1    M (St ; zt )    Fm (St ; zt )


holds. Here Fm (St ; zt ) is the maximum amount of unused credit, or free cash ‡ow, that pre-
                                                                                              1=
vents diversion and is obtained by substituting (15) into (17) using pt+1 = zt+1 Yt+1 =`t+1
and rearranging to get

                       "                                   #   (   1)
                                1          (1        )wm
(19) Fm (St ; zt ) =                  1=
                                                                        wt+1 ;
                           Et zt+1 Yt+1         1

where wt+1 = w(St ) and Yt+1 = Y (St ). This maximum cash ‡ow depends on the side project
technology, the manager’s wage, the probability of a …red manager regaining a job, and the
wage rate of workers.
        The agency friction constraint plays an important role in our model. In the model, the
combination of uncontingent debt and the nonnegative equity payout condition restricts the
ability of the …rm to choose the size of employment to maximize expected pro…ts. That re-
striction gives …rms an incentive to build up a large bu¤er stock of unused credit, which would
allow the …rm to self-insure against idiosyncratic shocks. This constraint makes building up



                                                           15
such a bu¤er stock unattractive.
        Most dynamic models of …nancial frictions face a similar issue. The …nancial frictions,
by themselves, make internal …nance through retained earnings more attractive than external
…nance. Absent some other force, …rms build up their savings and circumvent these frictions.
In the literature, the forces used include …nite lifetimes (Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist
(1999), Gertler and Kiyotaki (2011)), impatient entrepreneurs (Kiyotaki and Moore (1997)),
and the tax bene…ts of debt (Jermann and Quadrini (2012)). For a survey of these forces and
the role they play, see Quadrini (2011).

The Firm’s Recursive Problem
        Consider now the problem of an incumbent …rm. Let V (St ; zt ; xt ) denote the value of
the …rm after shocks are realized in period t. The value of such a …rm is


       V (St ; zt ; xt ) = 0


for any state (St ; zt ; xt ) such that the budget set is empty in that even if it borrows the
maximal amount, it cannot make nonnegative equity payouts, that is, dt = xt +M (St ; zt ) < 0.
For all other states (St ; zt ; xt ), the budget set is nonempty, and …rms continue their operations
and choose labor `t+1 , new borrowing bt+1 , and equity payouts dt to solve

                                                X                                                   Z   t+1
 V (St ; zt ; xt ) =        max         dt +               Q(    t+1 j t ) z (zt+1 jzt ;       t)             V (St+1 ; zt+1 ; xt+1 )d ( )
                       f`t+1 ;bt+1 ;dt g
                                               t+1 ;zt+1



subject to the nonnegative equity payout condition


(20) dt = xt + qt bt+1              0


and the agency friction constraint (18) where qt and                                  t+1   are given in (12) and (13). The law
of motion for aggregate states St+1 = (                         t+1 ;   t+1 )   has


(21)     t+1   = H(      t+1 ; St );




                                                                        16
where       t+1   follows the Markov chain                      (    t+1 j t )    and the cash-on-hand tomorrow,


(22) xt+1 = pt+1 `t+1                  wt+1 `t+1         wm      bt+1            t+1 :


                                                                     1=
In (22), the price pt+1 = zt+1 Yt+1 =`t+1                                 is de…ned by the demand function, wages for
workers and managers wt+1 = w(St ), and output Yt+1 = Y (St ). As we show below, Q(                                    t+1 j t )

equals            (   t+1 j t ).       This problem gives the decision rules for labor `t+1 = `(St ; zt ; xt );
borrowing bt+1 = b(St ; zt ; xt ); and equity payouts dt = d(St ; zt ; xt ).
           Now consider …rm entry. The model has a continuum of potential entering …rms every
period, each of which draws an entry cost ! from a lognormal distribution with mean ! and
standard deviation                 !   with cdf         (!) and density (!): To enter, …rms have to pay an entry
cost ! in period t and decide on the labor input `et+1 for the following period. An entering
…rm must borrow to pay the entry cost and current equity payouts.
           Firms that enter in period t draw their idiosyncratic productivity in period t + 1 ac-
cording to the density                  z (zt+1 jze ;   t)   where ze simply indexes the density from which entrants
draw their productivity shocks. Such …rms can borrow up to a maximum of M (St ; ze ). We
assume that from the measure of potential entrants with entry costs smaller than the max-
imal borrowing, namely those with !                                 M (St ; ze ), a subset is chosen randomly so that the
measure of entering …rms equals the measure of exiting …rms. All such …rms have an incentive
to enter. An entering …rm solves the same problem as an incumbent …rm with x =                                          ! and
z = ze .

Characterizing Firms’ Decisions
           The following lemma characterizes some properties of a …rm’s decision rules.
           Lemma. For x <                    M (St ; zt ), the …rm defaults. For x                 M (St ; zt ), there exists a
cuto¤ level of cash-on-hand, x^(St ; zt ), such that for x < x^; the nonnegative equity payout
constraint is binding and the value of borrowing q 0 b0 increases one-for-one as cash-on-hand
decreases, whereas for x                    x^; the nonnegative equity payout constraint is slack and the bond
price, labor, and borrowing do not vary with cash-on-hand while equity payouts increase
one-for-one with cash-on-hand.
           Proof. From the de…nition of M (St ; zt ); for any level of x <                            M (St ; zt ), the budget

                                                                          17
set is empty and the …rm necessarily defaults. For x                                 M (St ; xt ), we construct the cuto¤
level of cash-on-hand by solving a relaxed version of the …rm’s problem for the optimal levels
of new borrowing and labor in which we drop the nonnegative equity payout constraint for
the current period only, namely V~ (St ; zt ; xt ) =

                                              X                                             Z   t+1
       xt +      max          qt bt+1 +                (   t+1 j t ) z (zt+1 jzt ;     t)             V (St+1 ; zt+1 ; xt+1 )d ( )
              f`t+1 ;bt+1 g
                                           t+1 ;zt+1




subject to the agency friction constraint (18) where the cash-on-hand tomorrow xt+1 is given
in (22) and the aggregate state evolves according to the state evolution equation. Note that
cash-on-hand xt enters simply as an additive constant in the objective function and not in any
                                                                               ^ t ; zt ) and
constraint. Hence, the relaxed solution does not vary with xt and has the form `(S
^b(St ; zt ) so that the associated bond price q^ = q(St ; zt ; `;
                                                                ^ ^b) and the value of borrowing, denoted

For a level of cash-on-hand below this cuto¤ level, the nonnegative equity constraint binds,
the …rm chooses its borrowing level so that equity payouts are zero. For cash-on-hand above
this cuto¤ level, the optimal level of borrowing does not vary with x and is given by the
solution to the relaxed problem q^^b. Because the associated equity payouts satisfy d = x + q^^b,
they increase one-for-one with x. Clearly, the multiplier on the nonnegative equity payout
constraint (St ; zt ; xt ) = 0 if x            x^ and (St ; zt ; xt ) > 0 if x < x^. Q:E:D:
        Consider next the …rm’s …rst-order conditions for labor `0 and new borrowing b0 . The
…rst-order condition with respect to labor is a generalization of the corresponding …rst-order
condition (5) from our simple example, namely

                                                                18
  are associated with the nonnegative equity payout condition (9) and the agency friction
constraint (18).
       The optimal labor choice equates the weighted expected marginal bene…t of labor to
expected marginal cost times a markup. This expected bene…t, given by the left side of (23),
is calculated using the “distorted” probability density              (s0 jz; ). This bene…t weights the
marginal product in future states taking into account two forces. First, it puts weight only
on states in which the …rm repays the debt tomorrow because whenever the …rm defaults, its
shareholders receive zero. Second, it puts more weight on states in which the nonnegative
                                                                0                   0
equity payout condition tomorrow is binding in that                 > 0. Here 1 +       is the shadow price
of cash-on-hand and re‡ects the marginal value of internal funds to a …rm.
       The expected marginal cost of labor, given by the right side of (23), equals the marked-
up value of the wage and a wedge. The …rst term in this wedge is the loss in value from default
incurred from hiring an additional unit of labor and is similar to the wedge in the simple
                                                           @
example. This term is proportional to V 0 ( )              @`
                                                                    where V 0 ( ) is the …rm’s future
                                                                                                       @
value evaluated at the default cuto¤ weighted by the probability of the cuto¤ and                      @`

captures how the cuto¤ changes with labor. Since the cuto¤ decreases with labor, at least
for low values of z, this …rst term is generally positive and acts like a tax on labor.
       The second term in the wedge, which was not present in the simple example, comes
from the decrease in the bond price from hiring an extra unit of labor. The wedge is scaled
by the expected value of the shadow price in nondefault states.
       In the simple example we abstracted from new borrowing. Here we do not. The
…rst-order condition with respect to new borrowing is
                                           Z
                      @q0                             0
(24) (1 +    + ) q + b 0 = Ez 0 ;      0       (1 +       ) d ( 0 ) + Ez0 ; 0 V 0 ( ):
                      @b                   0


The optimal level of new borrowing equates the e¤ective marginal bene…t of new borrowing
to the expected marginal cost. Borrowing one more unit gives a direct increase in current
resources of q and leads to a fall in the price of existing debt, giving a total change in current
resources of q + b0 @q=@b0 . On the margin, these resources help relax both the nonnegative
equity payout condition and the agency friction constraint and, hence, are valued at the sum


                                                19
of the multipliers on these constraints. This marginal borrowing relaxes the agency constraint
because by issuing more debt, there is less unused credit that the manager can use for its
side project.
       The marginal cost of borrowing, given by the right side of this condition, consists of
two terms. The …rst term re‡ects the cost of repaying but is relevant only in repayment
                                                                                                    0
states and is weighted by the shadow price of cash-on-hand in those states, namely 1 +                  .
The second term is the loss in value from default.
       It is useful to contrast these …rst-order conditions to those that would arise in a version
of the model with complete markets and no agency frictions. In that version, the …rst-order
condition for labor would be
                    Z
          0     1               0
(25)    (` )             z (z       jz; )p0 dz 0 =       w0 ;
                    z0                               1

where p0 = z 0 (Y (S)=`0 )1= , which is the same as in our simple example (5). As in that
example, labor is chosen statically by the …rm so as to equate the current marginal product
of labor to a markup over the current wage. The …rst-order condition for state-contingent
borrowing is, of course, trivial in the complete market model without agency frictions because
the …rm no longer has to consider how borrowing a¤ects the future probability of default or
the manager’s incentive constraint.

B. Households
       There are a large number of identical households. Each household is a family with a
continuum of members. At the beginning of period t, each household elastically supplies a
measure Lt of labor to the labor market as workers and has a mass of managers                > 1 that
earn an e¤ective wage wm either by working as managers or by working in home production.
On the …rm side, each …rm decides how much labor it wishes to hire at the going wage.
The labor Lt that the household supplies gets distributed across …rms according to their
relative demands. In particular, households cannot pick which …rm they work for; rather
they supply labor to the market. After the aggregate shock            t   and the idiosyncratic shocks
are realized, the households choose their consumption Ct and state-contingent asset holdings
At+1 = fAt+1 (      t+1 )g,   get paid their wages Wt ; and receive aggregate equity payouts Dt from

                                                                20
their ownership of the intermediate goods …rms.
        The state of the household is their vector of assets At and the beginning-of-period
state St 1 . The recursive problem for households is the following:
                                     (                                                                                              )
                                         X
         H                                                                                                        H
(26) V       (At ; St 1 ) = max                      ( tj    t 1)              max              U (Ct ; Lt ) + V (At+1 ; St )
                                Lt                                  Ct (   t );fAt+1 ( t+1 )g
                                             t



subject to their budget constraint for each                          t,


                    X
       Ct ( t ) +          Q(   t+1 j t )At+1 ( t+1 ;         t)   = Wt (St 1 )Lt + wm + At ( t ) + Dt ( t ; St 1 );
                    t+1




where At is the vector fAt ( t )g, and the aggregate law of motion for St                                    1   is given in (21). In
our open economy the state-contingent prices Q(                                  t+1 j t )   are equal to         (   t+1 j t ).   In the
budget constraint Wt (St 1 )Lt is the total wage payments to the measure of labor Lt where
Wt (St 1 ) is referred to as the e¤ective wage. This wage is determined before the shock                                              t   is
realized and is a function of the aggregate state St 1 . Aggregate equity payouts Dt ( t ) are
determined after the shock               t   is realized and hence are functions of the aggregate state St                                1

and the shock        t.   The …rst-order condition for labor is
         P
                    ( tj    t 1 )UL (Ct ( t ); Lt )
(27)     P    t
                                                            = Wt (St 1 ):
              t
                    ( tj   t 1 )UC (Ct ( t ); Lt )


Using the envelope condition and Q(                         t+1 j t )      =         (   t+1 j t );   the …rst-order condition for
consumption implies


(28) UC (Ct ( t ); Lt ) = UC (Ct+1 (               t+1 ); Lt+1 ):



        The aggregate equity payout that households receive each period is the sum of all the
equity payouts from intermediate goods …rms so that
                            Z
(29) Dt ( t ; St 1 ) =          d(x; z;          t ; H( t ; St 1 ))dH( t ; St 1 ):



The household’s problem (26) gives the decision rule for labor, Lt (St 1 ), and the decision


                                                                      21
rules for consumption and bond holdings, Ct ( t ; St 1 ) and At+1 (                                                   t+1 j t ; St 1 ).

         The aggregate wage payments that households receive from all …rms is Wt Lt , whereas
wt is the face value of wages that an individual …rm o¤ers but may not pay. A given …rm pays
the full face value of wages wt if                               <     t   or       <    t.   We denote the corresponding repayment
set as


             R (St 1 ; St ; zt ; xt 1 ; zt 1 )      =f :                        t   or           t g;



where         t   and     t   are given in (12) and (14) where we evaluate `t = `(St 1 ; zt 1 ; xt 1 ) and
bt = b(St 1 ; zt 1 ; xt 1 )). Let                        D       be the default set in which the …rm pays less than the
full face value. The aggregate wage payments at t that a household receives from …rms,
Wt (St 1 )Lt (St 1 ) =
Z                                                   Z                                                   Z
        ( tj      t 1 ) z (z t jz t 1 ;    t 1)                       wt 1 `t       t 1d      ( )+                  maxfpt `t      wm     ; 0g   t 1d   ( )
                                                             2    R                                         2   D



where the …rst integral is taken over fxt 1 ; zt 1 ;                                     t ; zt g.   Here the household understands that
when it supplies a measure of workers to the market in which each …rm is promising a face
value of wage wt , once default has been taken into account, the e¤ective wage will only be
Wt < wt .1

C. Equilibrium
         Here we specify the equilibrium conditions in our model for aggregates in t + 1: Market
clearing in the labor market requires that the amount of labor demanded by …rms equals the
amount of labor supplied by households,
         Z
(30)          `t+1 (St ; zt ; xt )d       t (zt ; xt )   = Lt+1 (St ) :

    1
    In our quantitative model, …rms almost always pay their wage bill, so that Wt is within .01% of wt . In
the appendix, we also allow for the …rm to default on the wages of managers, but in our quantitative model
with bounded supports on shocks, this never arises. The …rm never defaults on managers’wage payments so
that it pays the constant amount wm .

    (xt+1 ; zt+1 ; xt ; zt j   t+1 ; St )   =    z (zt+1 jzt ;         t)   (   t+1 )   if, at that state (zt ; xt ) , the decision rules
`t+1 = `(St ; zt ; xt ), bt+1 = b(St ; zt ; xt ) together with the given                                           t+1      produce the particular
level of cash-on-hand xt+1 , so that                         t+1   satis…es

and       t+1         (St ;      t+1 ; H(St ;        t+1 ); zt+1 ; `t+1 ; bt+1 )        so the …rm does not default. If not, then
    (xt+1 ; zt+1 ; xt ; zt j t ; St ) = 0.
           The second term comes from the new entrants. To understand this term, note that
the probability that a new entrant’s state (zt+1 ; xt+1 ) is equal to the density of the entry cost
    ( xt+1 ) conditional on zt+1 = ze and the entry cost ! =                                           xt+1 being less than the borrowing
limit so that          xt+1          M(     t+1 ; H( t+1 ; St ); ze ).           The term in the denominator scales the total
measure of new entrants so that it equals the total measure of exiting …rms.
           Given the initial distribution                          0   and an initial aggregate shock                                  0;   an equilibrium

3. Quantitative Analysis
          We begin with a description of the data we use, discuss our parameterization, and
describe how we choose parameters using a moment-matching exercise. Since our model is
highly nonlinear and has occasionally binding constraints, we explain our algorithm in some
detail.
          We then explore the workings of our model starting at the …rm level. We begin with
an analysis of interest rate spreads and decision rules and how these shift with aggregate
volatility. We study the impulse responses for a …rm’s labor in response to an increase in
aggregate volatility. We illustrate the importance of the …nancial structure by contrasting the
response of a …rm in our baseline model to one of a …rm with frictionless …nancial markets.
We then compare …rm-level statistics in the model and the data.
          We then turn to the model’s predictions for aggregate variables. We begin with busi-
ness cycle moments and then show that the model can account for many of the patterns of
aggregates during the Great Recession.

A. Data
          We use a combination of quarterly aggregate data from the national income and prod-
uct accounts (NIPA), Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Federal Reserve’s ‡ow of funds
accounts, Moody’s, and …rm-level data from Compustat since 1985. From NIPA we use GDP
and from BLS we use hours. From the ‡ow of funds we use information on equity and debt for
the non…nancial corporate sector to construct our aggregate measures for equity payouts and
debt purchases. From Compustat we construct …ve …rm-level series: sales growth, leverage,

                                                         24
equity payouts, debt purchases, and spreads.
      Consider …rst the …rm-level series from Compustat. As in Bloom (2009), we restrict
the sample for …rms to those with at least 100 quarters of observations since 1970. We de…ne
sales growth for each …rm as (sit    sit 3 )=0:5(sit + sit 3 ) where sit is the nominal sales for
…rm i at time t de‡ated by the consumer price index. Here we follow Davis and Haltiwanger
(1992) in de…ning growth as being relative to the average level in order to have a measure
that is less sensitive to extreme values of sales. We follow Bloom (2009) in computing growth
rates across four quarters to help eliminate the strong seasonality evident in the data. Using
the panel data on …rm growth rates, we construct the time series of the interquartile range
(IQR) of sales growth across …rms for each quarter. We de…ne leverage as debt, de…ned as
the sum of short-term and long-term debt, divided by average sales, which is the average of
sales over the past eight quarters expressed in annual terms. We de…ne equity payouts as the
average across the previous four quarters of the ratio of the sum of dividends and net equity
repurchases to average sales. We de…ne debt purchases as the average across the previous
four quarters of the ratio of the change in total …rm debt to average sales. To construct the
spread for a given …rm, we use Compustat to obtain the credit rating for each …rm in each
quarter and then proxy the …rm’s spread using Moody’s spread for that credit rating in the
given period.
      Consider next the aggregate measures for equity payouts and debt purchases from the
‡ow of funds. We use data from the non…nancial corporate sector, and, in contrast to the
…rm-level de…nitions, we de…ne equity payouts and debt purchases relative to GDP rather
than sales. We use the NIPA data for GDP and employment. For more details, see the
appendix.

B. Parameterization and Quanti…cation
      Here we discuss how we parameterize preferences and technologies and choose the
parameters of the model.




                                               25
Parameterization
          We assume the utility function, has the additively separable form

                C1                       L1+
(32) U (C; L) =                              :
                1                        1+v

          Consider next the parameterization of the Markov processes over idiosyncratic shocks
and aggregate shocks to volatility. We want the parameterization to allow for an increase in
the volatility of the idiosyncratic productivity shock z while keeping …xed the mean level of
this shock. We assume a discrete process for idiosyncratic productivity shocks that approxi-
mates the autoregressive process,


(33) log zt =      t   +        z   log zt   1   +   t 1 "t ;



                                                                                                                          2
where the innovations "t                     N (0; 1) are independent across …rms. We choose                      t   =   t 1 =2

so as to keep the mean level of z across …rms unchanged as                                  t 1   varies. We assume that the
volatility shock       t   takes on two values, a high value,                  H,    and a low value,      L,   with transition
probabilities determined by the probabilities of remaining in the high and low volatility states,
pHH and pLL .
          Next, the revenue shock                    t   is assumed to be normal with mean               and standard devi-
ation      . Notice that in the de…nition of equity payouts, (9), the manager’s wage and the
revenue shock enter symmetrically, so that only the sum, wm + t , matters for decisions. From
the de…nition of free cash ‡ow in (19), we see that in the agency friction constraint, only the
ratio ~       (1           (1          )) =wm matters. Hence, we only parameterize                      ; wm + , and ~ and
refer to ~ as the agency friction.
          We divide the parameters into two groups. We using existing studies to assign some
parameters and use a moment-matching exercise to assign others.

Assigned Parameters
          The assigned parameters are                           A   = f ; v; ; ; ;   z g.   Many of these parameters are
fairly standard, and we choose them to re‡ect commonly used values. The model is quarterly.
In terms of preferences, we set the discount factor                           = :99 so that the annual interest rate is


                                                                       26
4%, and we set      = 0:5, which implies a labor elasticity of 2. This elasticity is in the range of
elasticities used in macroeconomic work, as reported by Rogerson and Wallenius (2009). We
also redo our experiments with              = 1, which implies a labor elasticity of 1, and …nd similar
results. We set         = 2, a common estimate in the business cycle literature. Although given
the risk-sharing condition (28) and the separable utility (21), this parameter matters little
for ‡uctuations.
      Consider the parameters governing production. For the intermediate goods production
function, we set the parameter             equal to the labor share of 0.70. We interpret there to be two
other …xed factors, managerial input and capital, which receive a share of 0:30. For the …nal
goods production function, we choose the elasticity of substitution parameter                = 5:75 so as
to generate a markup of 20%, which is in the range estimated by Basu and Fernald (1997).
We choose the serial correlation of the …rm-level productivity shock              z   = :91. This value is
consistent with the estimates of Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008) for measures of
their traditional TFP index, which measures the dollar value of output de‡ated by a four-digit
industry-level de‡ator.

Parameters from Moment Matching
      The parameters set in the moment-matching exercise are

               n                                                        o
       M   =       H;    L ; pHH ; pLL ;   + wm ;   ; ~ ; ze ; !;   !       :


We target ten moments. The …rst four are the mean, standard deviation, autocorrelation,
and skewness of the IQR of sales growth. The next three are the median …rm spread and
its standard deviation and the median …rm leverage. To calculate these medians, we …rst
calculate for each period the median spread and leverage in the cross section and then report
the medians of the constructed time series. Likewise, the standard deviation of the median
spread is the standard deviation of the cross-sectional medians. The …nal three are the mean
productivity and mean employment of entrants relative to incumbents, as reported by Lee
and Mukoyama (2012), and an average leverage of entrants equal to that of incumbents.
      Our model is highly nonlinear, and all parameters a¤ect all the moments. Nevertheless,
some parameters are more important for certain statistics. The mean IQR is largely driven by

                                                        27
the mean volatility shock            t:   The IQR standard deviation is determined largely by the distance
between       L   and   H,   and the IQR autocorrelation is determined by the levels of the transition
probabilities pLL and pHH of these shocks. The IQR skewness is controlled by the di¤erence
in these transition probabilities. In our calibration, pLL is su¢ ciently larger than pHH so that,
on average, high volatility shocks are realized relatively infrequently. This leads to skewness
because the resulting IQR re‡ects the disproportionate probability that is put on the low
volatility shocks. The median spread and its standard deviation are a¤ected by the standard
deviation of the revenue shocks and the agency friction. The median leverage is largely
determined by the mean revenue shock and the agency friction. The relative productivity,
employment, and leverage of entrants are determined by ze ; !; and                                     !.

        The parameters we use are reported in Table 1. In Table 2, we report the target
moments in the data and the model. Overall, the model produces similar statistics for the
IQR, spreads, and leverage.

C. Algorithm
        Here we provide an overview of the algorithm we use to solve the model and relegate
the detailed description to the appendix.
        To solve its problem, each …rm needs to forecast next period’s wage w(S) and output
Y (S), and it needs a transition law for the aggregate state. In practice, it is infeasible to
include the entire distribution                        in the state. Instead, we follow a version of Krusell and
Smith (1998) to approximate the forecasting rules for the …rm. We do so by approximating
the distribution of …rms              with lags of aggregate shocks, (                   1,       2,        3,   k) where k records
how many periods the aggregate shocks have been unchanged. Here k = 1; : : : ; k and k is the
upper bound on this number of periods. In a slight abuse of notation, we use S = ( ,                                             1,

   2,    3,   k) in the rest of this description of the algorithm to denote our approximation to
the aggregate state. The law of motion of our approximation to the aggregate state is given
by H( 0 ; S) = ( 0 ; ;          1;        2; k
                                                 0
                                                     ) with k 0 = k + 1 if   0
                                                                                 =   =        1   =     2    and 0 otherwise.2

   2
    To help motivate this approach to approximating the state, note that for any initial distribution 0 ,
after su¢ ciently many periods the distribution over t becomes independent of this initial distribution and
instead only depends on the history of aggregate shocks ( 0 ; :::; t ). We think of our approximation is simply
a truncation of that history.



                                                                   28
       We start with an initial guess of two arrays for the aggregate wages, w0 (S), and output,
Y 0 (S), referred to as aggregate rules. We then solve the model with two loops: an inner and
an outer loop.
       In the inner loop, taking as given the current set of aggregate rules, we …rst solve for
the bond price schedule by iterating on the borrowing limit M (S; z) in (11), the default cuto¤
  (S; S 0 ; z 0 ; `0 ; b0 ) in (12), and the bond price q(S; z; `0 ; b0 ) in (13) until convergence. Given
the resulting bond price schedule, we then iteratively solve each …rm’s optimization problem
using a combination of policy function and value function iteration until convergence. In
the iterations we also iterate on a set of arrays of grids fX(S; z)g where the set of points
X(S; z) = fx1 ; : : : ; xN g varies with (S; z). We begin with an initial guess on the array of grids
fX 0 (S; z)g, the multiplier function on the nonnegative equity payout condition f 0 (S; z; x)g
and the value function fV 0 (S; z; x)g where the multiplier function and value function are
de…ned for all values of x in a range [ M (S; z); 1]. For each iteration n, given the array
of grids, the multipliers, and the value function from the previous iteration, we solve for the
updated array of grids fX n+1 (S; z)g, multiplier function f           n+1
                                                                             (S; z; x)g, and value function
fV n+1 (S; z; x)g in two steps. In these steps we use the result that for all cash-on-hand levels x
greater than some cuto¤ level x^(S; z), the nonnegative equity payout condition is not binding
and the decision rules for labor and debt do not vary with cash-on-hand x. We refer to the
associated values of labor and debt as the nonbinding levels of labor and debt and denote
        ^ z) and ^b(S; z).
them by `(S;
                                                     n
       In particular, given the multipliers f            (S; z; x)g and the value function fV n (S; z; x)g
in the …rst step, we solve for these nonbinding levels. To do so, we solve a relaxed problem
in which we drop both the nonnegative equity payout constraint and the agency friction
constraint and then check whether the constructed tentative solutions satisfy the agency
friction condition. If so, then we set the nonbinding levels of labor and debt equal to the
tentative solutions. If not we impose that the agency friction constraint binds and de…ne
these non-binding levels to be the resulting solution. We then de…ne the cuto¤ level


      x^(S; z) =           ^ z); ^b(S; z))^b(S; z)
                   q(S; z; `(S;




                                                     29
and construct the new grid by setting x1 =                             M (S; z) and xN = x^(S; z). In the second
step, we solve for the decisions and multipliers at intermediate points using the …rm …rst-
order conditions and the nonnegative equity payout condition. Finally, we update the value
function. We iterate on these steps until the grids, the multipliers, and the value functions
converge.
       In the outer loop, taking as given the converged decisions from the inner loop, we start
with a distribution of …rms               0 (z; x)    and simulate the economy for T periods. In each period
t, we record …rms’ labor choices f`t+1 (z; x)g, borrowing fbt+1 (z; x)g, and default decisions
f t (z; x)g as well as wages and aggregate output. We then project the simulated values for
wages and output on a set of dummy variables corresponding to the state S: We use the …tted
values as the new aggregate rules w(S) = wk+1 (S) and Y (S) = Y k+1 (S).
       Given the new guesses for the aggregate rules, we then go back to the inner loop and
…rst iterate on the bond price schedule to convergence and then, using the new bond price
schedule, iterate on the grids, multipliers, and value functions to convergence. Then, given
these converged values, we simulate the economy and construct new guesses for aggregate
rules. We then repeat the procedure until the arrays of aggregate output and wages converge.

D. Firm-Level Decisions and Responses
       We begin by studying …rm spread schedules, decision rules, and responses to an ag-
gregate shock.

Spread Schedules
       The bond price schedule that a given …rm faces, q(St ; zt ; `0 ; b0 ), depends on the aggre-
gate state St , the …rm’s idiosyncratic shock zt , and the …rm’s choice of labor and borrowing.
The bond price schedule maps into a spread schedule that …rms face on their borrowing given
by

                                          1               1
      spr(St ; zt ; `0 ; b0 ) =                               :
                                  q(St ; zt ; `0 ; b0 )

       In Figure 1 we display the spread schedules. To graph this schedule, we need to
choose a particular (St ; zt ) pair. In both panels, we choose the idiosyncratic shock z to be in


                                                                  30
the median level in the distribution. For the lines in panel A, the aggregate state, denoted
S L , has aggregate shock      L   and a distribution of …rm-level states   that emerges after a
long sequence of low volatility shocks. The lines in panel A show how the resulting spread
schedule varies with borrowing for two di¤erent levels of labor, that is, the lines are the
function spr(S L ; z; `0 ; ) evaluated at two levels of `0 .
        As this …gure shows, if a …rm chooses higher levels of borrowing, it faces higher spreads.
The reason is simply that for a given level of labor, the higher the level of debt, the greater
the tendency for …rms to default. These lines also show that if a …rm chooses a higher level
of labor, it faces higher spreads. The logic behind this feature is more subtle: a higher level
of labor is associated with higher spreads because …rms default more in the low z states, and,
on the margin, a higher level of labor tends to decrease pro…ts in such z states. Hence, hiring
more labor increases the default probability and, hence, drives up the interest rate paid by
…rms.
        The lines in panel B show how the spread schedule shifts with aggregate volatility:
the low volatility state S L described earlier and the corresponding high volatility state S H
that has aggregate shock       H   and a distribution of …rm-level states   that emerges after a
long sequence of high volatility shocks. When the economy shifts from the low volatility
state to the high volatility state, spreads increase for any level of borrowing because this
shift increases the probability that a …rm will default. The …rm is more likely to default
both because the probability of low idiosyncratic productivity shocks has increased and also
because the ability to borrow in the future has become more restricted.

Decision Rules
        Consider next the …rm’s decision rules. In Figure 2 we again consider a …rm at the
median level of idiosyncratic shock z and at the low volatility aggregate state S L . We graph,
as a function of cash-on-hand, the …rm’s choices of new labor `0 , the value of new borrowing
qb0 , the equilibrium spread at its optimal choices, equity payouts d, and the multiplier on the
nonnegative equity payout condition .
        These decision rules and multipliers have the features highlighted in the lemma. For
cash-on-hand x <        M (S; z), the …rm defaults whereas for cash-on-hand above this level,


                                                   31
it repays. As panel A shows, the multiplier (S L ; z; x) on the nonnegative equity payout
constraint (20) hits zero at a cuto¤ level x^ = x^(S; z). Above this cuto¤, labor, the value
of borrowing, and the equilibrium spread do not vary with cash-on-hand and the value of
equity increases one-for-one with cash-on-hand. Below this cuto¤, the nonnegative equity
payout constraint binds so that the value of borrowing, qb0 =   x, increases one-for-one with
decreases in x.
       Consider the rest of the patterns in these rules. For the multiplier, note from panel E
that, below this cuto¤, the multiplier increases as x decreases because the nonnegative equity
payout condition restricts plans for labor and borrowing more as x falls further.
       For labor, note from panel A that below this cuto¤ level, labor at …rst decreases and
then starts increasing. The decreasing part is straightforward: as cash-on-hand decreases
today, the …rm has to borrow more to increase qb0 and the current multiplier        increases.
This increase in the multiplier increases the shadow price of labor and thus the wedge in
(23). The …rm responds by decreasing its labor to decrease the spread and reduce the wedge.
The increasing part is more subtle. As cash-on-hand decreases su¢ ciently, the new borrowing
necessary to meet the nonnegative equity payout condition increases so much that the default
rate and the spread increase rapidly. Hence, conditional on repaying, the idiosyncratic shock
z is higher, and so the relevant marginal product of labor, given by the left side of (23),
increases. The …rm responds by increasing its level of labor accordingly.
       For the spread, note from panel C that, below the cuto¤ x^, the spread increases as x
decreases. Brie‡y, the quantitative impact of the increased borrowing on spreads outweighs
the e¤ect from changing labor, so the spread increases.

Decision Rules and Aggregate Volatility
       Consider next how an increase in volatility shifts the decision rules. Figure 3 shows
how an increase in volatility shifts the decision rules for labor, the value of borrowing, and
equity payouts as well as the equilibrium spread at these optimal choices. As we did earlier,
in each panel for the idiosyncratic shock, we consider a value of z at the median level of the
distribution. We see that an increase in volatility shifts down the decision rules for labor,
value of borrowing, and equity payouts and increases the equilibrium spread. The intuition


                                             32
is that the increase in volatility makes the …rm more cautious in hiring labor because of
the increase in the wedges in the …rst-order conditions described earlier. This caution also
extends to the value of borrowing and equity payouts. The increase in volatility induces …rms
to reduce their level of borrowing and equity payouts. Nevertheless, the equilibrium spread
increases because, as described above, the spread schedule is more restricted when volatility
is high.
       The change in decisions for labor, value of borrowing, and equity payouts can be
thought of as coming from two parts. The …rst is the partial equilibrium e¤ect, namely for
a given level of wages and aggregate output, …rms tend to decrease their labor, borrowing,
and equity payouts for precautionary reasons. The second is the general equilibrium e¤ect,
namely as volatility increases, wages fall and aggregate output falls. The lower wages induce
…rms to hire more labor, whereas the lower aggregate output induces …rms to hire less labor.
Quantitatively, the wage e¤ect dominates, so the general equilibrium e¤ect tends to dampen
the drop in labor relative to the partial equilibrium e¤ect.

Impulse Responses for a Firm’s Labor
       We want to contrast the …rm’s response for labor with and without frictions. We focus
on the impulse response for labor for a …rm with the median z and         as volatility switches
from low to high. Along this impulse response, we keep the level of both z and          at their
median levels. The responses of this …rm are driven by three factors that are exogenous
to its choices: the change in the probability of future levels of z, which are drawn from a
more dispersed distribution than under low volatility; the change in the wage and aggregate
demand; and the resulting change in the schedule for borrowing that it faces.
       Speci…cally, we suppose that the aggregate state in period 0 is S L , and in period 1
the economy switches to the high volatility state and stays there throughout the experiment,
eventually ending in S H .


A Firm in the Baseline Model Consider …rst a …rm in the baseline model. In Figure 4
we see that on impact the …rm decreases its labor by 4%, and, after four periods, labor drops
a total of about 8% and stays persistently at a depressed level. The …rm becomes cautious in
its hiring decisions for two reasons that are driven by the increased volatility. First, the …rm

                                              33
now fears receiving a very low idiosyncratic shock z at which, at its original level of labor, it
will have to default. Second, spread schedules tighten, and …rms understand that if they do
indeed receive a very low idiosyncratic productivity shock, they will be unable to borrow as
easily as they could when volatility was low. This shift in the spread schedule thus reinforces
the tendency of …rms to be cautious in hiring.
       In general equilibrium, since this increase in volatility leads overall employment to fall,
it also leads to a fall in wages and a fall in aggregate demand, in the sense that the Yt term
in (8) falls, so that the demand schedule facing each …rm shifts inwards.


A Firm with Frictionless Financial Markets To isolate the …rm-level e¤ects from the
general equilibrium e¤ects, we suppose that a single …rm operates without frictions in the
midst of an economy in which all other …rms face the frictions in the baseline model. This lack
of frictions is modeled by allowing this …rm to borrow using complete markets and assuming
there is no agency friction so that labor satis…es (25). The upshot of these assumptions is
that this frictionless …rm faces the same aggregate wages and demand schedule as do the
…rms in our baseline model.
       In Figure 4 we compare the impulse response of labor for this frictionless …rm to the
corresponding impulse response for a …rm in our baseline model. We normalize the values
of labor to be equal before the shock. (Absent this normalization, the level of labor for the
frictionless …rm is about 30% higher than that of the …rm in the baseline model.) As this
…gure makes clear, such a …rm actually increases its labor when volatility increases. There
are three e¤ects: the fall in wages increases this …rm’s incentives to hire workers, the inward
shift in the demand for its product reduces its incentives, and the lack of frictions implies
that the …rm can insure against all the increase in idiosyncratic risk from the more dispersed
distribution of productivity shocks. On net, the wage e¤ect dominates and the …rm hires
more workers.
       Note that in our model with frictions, the …rm also faces a net positive e¤ect from the
general equilibrium forces, dominated by the fall in wages, but the frictions that make the
…rm cautious outweigh this e¤ect. Of course, if in our baseline model we make wages sticky,
then we would have dampened this general equilibrium e¤ect, and the resulting drop in labor


                                               34
would have been much larger.

E. Firm Moments
       Before we present the model’s aggregate implications, we show that the model can
produce the broad patterns in …rm-level statistics. Our earlier moment-matching exercise
ensured that the model was consistent with some basic features of …rms’…nancial conditions,
including median spread, median leverage, and the dispersion of sales growth. Here we take
a closer look at …rm-level statistics in the model and the data.
       Table 3 presents some moments of the cross-sectional distribution of …rms. Consider
…rst the spreads. In each period, we compute the spread at the …rst, second, and third
quartiles in the distribution of spreads and then consider the time series median of spreads
at each quartile. In Table 3 we see that in the model, the spreads are a bit higher and more
dispersed than they are in the data. For example, the median of the spread at the 50th
percentile is 2.8 in the model and 1.3 in the data, whereas the median spread at the 75th
percentile is 6.3 in the model and 2.1 in the data.
       Consider next the distribution of the growth of sales. In the model, we abstracted
from any force that leads to trend growth in a …rm’s sales, such as an upward drift in the
size of z. Because of this abstraction, by construction the median of the 50th percentile of
…rms’growth in the model is zero. To make the statistics in the data comparable to those in
the model, we subtract the median of the 50th percentile of …rms’growth. We see that the
model does a good job of replicating this distribution.
       In terms of leverage, the median of the 50th percentile in the model is similar to
that in the data (29 in the model and 26 in the data), but the model’s distribution is more
compressed than in the data. The distribution of debt purchases in the model is also roughly
similar to that in the data.
       Finally, consider the equity payouts. In the model, we have …rms with decreasing
returns in the variable input, namely labor, which can be thought of as arising from a …xed
factor, such as land or a …xed capital stock. Thus, the equity payouts to agents outside the
…rm should be thought of as the sum of payments to the …xed factor and the payments to the
owners of the …rm. In the data, of course, equity payments are reported net of the payments


                                              35
to land and capital. To make the numbers in the model comparable to those in the data, in
both we subtract out the median of the median equity-payouts-to-sales ratio. We see that
the model gives a wider dispersion in the equity-payouts-to-sales ratio than in the data.
       Consider next the correlations of …rm-level variables with leverage displayed in Table
4. For a given variable, such as spreads, we compute the correlation of each …rm’s spread
with its leverage over time and report the median of these correlations across …rms. The
correlation between spreads and leverage is positive in both the model and the data. This
correlation arises because …rms that have low cash-on-hand tend to have high spreads and
high leverage. Firms tend to have high leverage when they have low cash-on-hand because
higher debt decreases cash-on-hand one-for-one, as seen from the de…nition (10). As we
described earlier using the decision rules, …rms tend to have high spreads when they have
low cash-on-hand. The correlation between growth and leverage is also positive in the model
and the data. In the model, …rms with high growth are those that receive relatively high
productivity shocks. The increase in productivity allows …rms to borrow more at the same
rate. This e¤ect induces …rms to take on more debt and, thus, higher leverage.
       Next, the correlation between debt purchases and leverage is also positive in both the
model and the data. In the model, …rms with low cash-on-hand have higher leverage, as
explained, and tend to borrow more. Finally, equity payouts are nearly uncorrelated with
leverage in both the model and the data. In the model, there are two opposing forces. One
force is that …rms with low cash-on-hand and high leverage tend to have low equity payouts.
The opposing force is that …rms with high current productivity tend to have high leverage
and high equity payouts. These two forces tend to cancel out each other and lead to small
correlations between equity payouts and leverage.

F. Business Cycle Moments
       So far we have focused on …rm-level moments. We are also interested in the moments
of aggregate variables in our model over the business cycle. In Table 5 we report for both
the data and the model the standard deviations of output, labor, aggregate debt purchases
relative to output, and aggregate equity payouts relative to output, as well as the correlations
of these variables with output. We also report the correlations of median spread and IQR


                                              36
with output. The output and labor series are logged and HP-…ltered quarterly data from
1985:1 to 2013:1.
       Table 5 shows that volatility shocks at the micro level lead output in the model to
‡uctuate nearly as much as in the data. Since we are abstracting from all other shocks
that contribute to ‡uctuations in output, we think of this result as showing that micro-level
volatility shocks can potentially account for a sizable fraction of the volatility in aggregate
output.
       More interesting is the behavior of labor. Recall that one of the main problems of
business cycle models with only productivity shocks is that they generate a much lower
volatility of labor relative to output than is observed in the data. Here, instead, there is no
such problem: the relative volatility of labor to output is very similar in the model and the
data (1.31 in the model versus 1.26 in the data). Moreover, as the lower part of the table
shows, in both the model and the data, labor is highly correlated with output. This result
represents the primary success of the model for business cycle moments.
       Consider now the statistics for the IQR. The standard deviation of IQR is close in the
model and the data by our calibration. The interesting result here is that the data show that,
over the last 30 years, the correlation between IQR and output is negative. The correlation is
-.27 in the data and -.45 in the model. In comparing these numbers, it is useful to remember
that if we add in other aggregate shocks that we have abstracted from, such as aggregate
productivity shocks, this correlation will be weakened in the model and hence become closer
to the data.
       Turning to …nancial variables, we see that the volatility of the median spread, one of
our calibration moments, is close in the model and the data. More interesting is that the
model produces a key feature of the data: …rm spreads are countercyclical. Speci…cally, in
the model and the data, the median spread is negatively correlated with output: -.33 in the
model and -.31 in the data. The volatility of the ratio of debt purchases to output in the
model is 2.51 and close to the corresponding value in the data of 2.83. This debt purchases
ratio is positively correlated with output in the model (.21) although less so than in the data
(.75). Equity payouts are somewhat less volatile in the model than in the data: the volatility
of the ratio of equity payouts to output is 1.76 in the model and 2.74 in the data. This equity


                                              37
payout ratio is also positively correlated with output in the model (.18), although somewhat
less so than in the data (.45).
       Although we abstract from aggregate productivity shocks, our model generates modest
movements in measured TFP because, with our …nancial frictions, labor is not e¢ ciently
allocated across …rms. One way to illustrate the ‡uctuations in measured TFP is to de…ne
a measure of aggregate TFP as an outsider would, namely, Yt =Lt Kt1       with Kt = K. We
…nd that the correlation of TFP and output is positive in the model and in the data (.40 and
0.56 respectively), but the ‡uctuations in measured TFP in the model are about a third as
volatile as those in the data.

G. The Great Recession of 2007–2009
       Here we ask how much of the movement in aggregates in the recession of 2007–2009
can be accounted for by our model. We show that our model can account for much of this
movement.
       In this experiment, we choose a sequence of volatility shocks so that the IQR of
sales growth in the model reproduces the corresponding IQR path in the data. We think
of this procedure as using the data and the model to back out the realized sequence of
volatility shocks. We plot the aggregate series after detrending them with a linear trend and
normalizing them by …rst observation.

Baseline Model
       In Figure 5A we show the IQR of sales growth for both the data and the model. As
the …gure shows, the IQR increased substantially during the recession, from 0.16 in 2007:3 to
almost 0.34 in 2009:2. Note that the IQR reached its highest level since 1985 at the height
of the Great Recession.
       The model generates substantial declines in aggregate output and labor over this
period. In Figure 5B, we see that over the period 2007:3 to 2009:2, the model generates a
decline in output of 9.5%, whereas in the data, output declines 9.2%. Figure 5C shows that
the dynamics of labor are similar to those of output: the model produces about a 9.7% decline
in labor, whereas in the data, labor declines about 8.7%. Thus, the model can account for
essentially all of the contraction in output and labor that occurred in the Great Recession.


                                             38
       The Great Recession had sizable changes in …nancial variables. Consider …rst the
median spread across …rms. Figure 5D shows that in the data, the median spread increases
about 575 basis points by 2008:4, whereas in the model, it increases about 480 basis points by
2009:2. Note that in the model, the peak of the spread occurs two quarters later than it does
in the data. The reason is that in the data, the IQR is highest at the end of the recession,
and in the model the spread is largest when the IQR is highest.
       Figure 5E shows the pattern of aggregate debt purchases over output. By the end of
the recession, debt purchases had fallen by 7.5% in the data and 9.5% in the model. This
pattern of debt purchases implies that the outstanding level of …rm debt slowly falls over
the recession. Figure 5F plots equity payouts over output. In the data, equity payouts over
output fall about 3% by the end of the recession, whereas in the model they fall more, by
about 8%.
       Here we have focused on the Great Recession of 2007–2009. We have not tried to ac-
count for the slow recovery following the end of the recession in 2009. As it stands, our model
cannot account for the slow recovery. The reason is twofold. First, in the data, our measure
of volatility, the IQR of sales growth, falls relatively quickly post-2009. Second, our model has
a tight link between volatility and output so that when volatility falls, output recovers. One
reason for this tight connection is that agents know exactly when the volatility shifts. A more
elaborate stochastic structure on information in which agents receive only noisy signals of the
underlying aggregate shocks, such as in Kozlowski, Veldkamp, and Venkateswaran (2016),
would allow the model to break this tight connection. Another reason is that we have ab-
stracted from other mechanisms, such as adjustment costs in debt or in labor, search frictions,
and so on, that stretch out the impact of shocks on aggregates. Finally, we have abstracted
from other shocks, including policy uncertainty shocks, that Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012)
show actually increase further after the end of the Great Recession. While it is conceptually
straightforward to extend the model to have a more elaborate information structure, various
adjustment costs, search frictions, and more elaborate shocks, it is computationally infeasible
for us to do so.




                                               39
Lower Labor Elasticity
       So far we have assumed a Frisch labor supply elasticity of 1= = 2. Here we redo
our Great Recession experiment with a lower labor elasticity of 1= = 1. When we change
the labor supply elasticity, we do not adjust the other parameters in our moment-matching
exercise, so this experiment should be thought of as a simple comparative statics exercise. In
Figure 6 we see that the …nancial variables are a¤ected little by this change. The main e¤ects
are that both output and labor fall less than they did in our baseline model. For example, in
the baseline model, by the second quarter of 2009, output has fallen by 9.5% and labor has
fallen by 9.7%, whereas with the lower elasticity, the corresponding falls are 7.4% and 6.7%,
respectively.
       In the appendix, we report all the statistics corresponding to those in Tables 2–5 for
this lower elasticity. The basic pattern is that with a lower labor elasticity, the …nancial
variables change little, whereas output and labor become less volatile. For example, moving
from the benchmark to the lower labor elasticity results in a drop in the volatility of output
from .97 to .75 and a drop in the relative volatility of labor to output from 1.31 to 1.22.

Frictionless Financial Markets
       To help isolate the quantitative role of frictions in our baseline model, it is useful
to contrast the implications for output and labor for our model with frictionless …nancial
markets, namely complete markets and no agency frictions. In contrast to our earlier study
of a …rm’s impulse response, here we are considering the full general equilibrium e¤ects with
endogenous wages and aggregate demand.
       As Figures 7A and 7B show, with frictionless …nancial markets, output and labor both
increase sharply when volatility rises: output increases about 8% and labor about 6%. The
channel by which this increase takes place is referred to as the Oi-Hartman-Abel e¤ect, based
on the work of Oi (1961), Hartman (1972), and Abel (1983). The mechanism is that when
the distribution of z spreads out and z is serially correlated, …rms with high z tend to hire
relatively more of the factor inputs. To understand why, consider a mean-preserving spread
in the distribution of idiosyncratic productivity shocks. With a more spread out distribution,
a …rm in the upper fraction of the distribution now has a higher level than it did under a


                                              40
less spread out distribution. With serially correlated productivity shocks, a …rm knows that
if its productivity shock is high today, then its mean productivity shock tomorrow will also
be high. All else equal, this prediction leads the …rm to increase its labor.
         In our baseline model, these same Oi-Hartman-Abel forces are present but to a much
weaker degree because …rms are unable to insure against the risk of a low realization of z:
With …nancial frictions, if a …rm in the upper fraction of the distribution sharply increases
the amount of labor it hires, then, in the unfortunate circumstance that the realized level
of z in the next period is actually very low, it will default. This inability to insure against
the low realization of z shocks makes such a …rm cautious and undoes the Oi-Hartman-Abel
e¤ect.

4. Conclusion
         Many observers believe that the depth of the Great Recession was due to the in-
teraction of shocks with …nancial frictions. We have formalized this idea in a model with
heterogeneous …rms that face default risk and time-varying volatility shocks. We …nd that
‡uctuations in the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity shocks lead to quantitatively sizable
contractions in economic activity as well as tightening in …nancial conditions. In the model,
as in the recent recession, we observe a large increase in the cross-sectional dispersion of …rm
growth rates and a large decline in aggregate labor and output, accompanied by a tightening
of …nancial conditions that manifest themselves with increases in …rm credit spreads and
declines in debt purchases and equity payouts. Hence, we think of our model as a promising
parable for the Great Recession of 2007–2009.
         A critical feature of our analysis is the use of micro …rm-level data for both disciplining
the parameterization of the model and checking many empirical predictions of the model
mechanisms. We use …rm-level data on time-varying volatility, credit spreads, and leverage
to parameterize the volatility shocks, including the increase in volatility during the Great
Recession, and the magnitude of the …nancial frictions in our model. We then show that the
resulting model predictions for the distributions of …rm growth rates, credit spreads, debt,
and equity, as well as …rm covariates among these variables, resemble the patterns of the
micro …rm-level data. Hence, the macro predictions of the model occur in a framework that


                                                 41
is consistent with micro observations. We view this attempt to connect the macro and micro
predictions to be a strength of the paper and a useful addition to the growing literature
using heterogeneous …rm models for business cycles, which, unlike this paper, has, with few
exceptions, not confronted the micro-level predictions of their models.
      We think the quantitative framework developed in this paper, business cycles with
…rm-level default risk, can be used for studying other applications. One area of interest is
…nancial regulation. The framework can be useful in studying the real implications of …nan-
cial regulation that change …rms’borrowing incentives. Another application is the monetary
policy transmission to the real economy through changes in …rms’…nancial conditions. Fi-
nally, as explored in Arellano, Bai, and Bocola (2016), the framework is useful for studying
the connection between sovereign debt crises and …rm default risk.

In the data and the model, for each variable and
quarter, we calculate the 25th, 50th and 75th
percentiles across firms. Then we report the me-
dian of each time series. Growth and dividends
are reported relative to the median 50th per-
centile. Data are from Compustat. See variable
definitions in the data appendix.

For the data and the model, we compute for each firm the
correlation between its spread, growth, debt change, and
dividends with its leverage across time. We report the me-
dian correlation across firms. Data are from Compustat.

Data for output and labor are from NIPA, data
for IQR (interquantile range of sales growth) and
spread are from Compustat and Moody’s, and
data for debt change and dividends are from
the flow of funds. Output and labor are logged
and filtered with a Hodrick-Prescott filter with a
smoothing parameter equal to 1600. See details
