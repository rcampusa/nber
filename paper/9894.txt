Investor Rationality: Evidence from UK Property Capitalization Rates

                                             ABSTRACT

        Recent analyses have suggested the irrationality of investors in Australian and U.S. office

properties. More specifically, investors have failed to raise capitalization rates sufficiently at rental

cyclical peaks to account for the obvious mean reversion in real rents and thus have significantly

overvalued properties. In this paper we analyze the determination of UK office and retail

capitalization rates and provide evidence that these rates reflect rational expectations of mean

reversion in future real cash flows. Moreover, these rates are linked to capitalization rates

(dividend/price ratio) and expected dividend earnings growth as expected.

1. Introduction
   Property capitalization rates should be linked to other capital market capitalization rates

because all rates should contain the real default-free rate and reflect common risk factors.

Each type capitalization rate will, of course, reflect that type’s specific risk. Capitalization

rates should also be linked to expected real cash flow growth. The higher is expected growth,

the more investors will be willing to pay for a current dollar of cash flow and thus the lower

the cap rate will be. For property, the cash flow is rent; for stocks the cash flow is dividends.

Thus, the movement of real estate capitalization rates relative to stock market capitalization

rates should be negatively related to expected real rental growth, but positively related to

expected real dividend growth.

    How rental growth expectations are formed is crucial to the rationality or efficiency of the

property market.1 Both Hendershott (1996 and 2000) and Sivitanides et al (2001) argue that

investors have not built the “obvious” mean reversion of real rents into their forecasts of real

rental growth and thus have overvalued property at rental cyclical peaks (used too low cap

rates) and undervalued them at cyclical troughs. Providing evidence on the rationality of the

UK property markets is a key component of this paper.

        Because data on property capitalization rates are predominately based on appraisals,

property cap rates tend to move sluggishly relative to other capitalization rates and proxies for

real cash flow growth expectations. Precisely how smooth (auto correlated) cap rates are

depends greatly on the nature of the appraisal process and how the cap rate index is

constructed (Geltner and Ling, 2000). Thus it is necessary to model the sluggish appraisal

process as well as investor behavior.

 More generally, how real cash flow growth expectations are formed is crucial to the rationality of any market.
For a discussion of the U.S. equity market in this context, see Hall (2001).

                                                                                                                  2
      This paper develops a framework for modelling property cap rates and estimates it using a

long-run equilibrium relationship and a short-run adjustment process that reflects both

changes to the fundamental explanatory variables and an adjustment to disequilibrium.

Section 2 describes the framework that links property cap rates directly to both bond and

stock market cap rates. Section 3 reviews the key literature, section 4 presents an error

correction model, and section 5 describes data sources and expectation proxies. Results for

the UK office and retail markets are reported in sections 6 and 7. Section 8 highlights our

major findings and presents additional interpretations and evidence.


2. Modelling the capitalisation rate

      For long leases with periodic rent reviews, the property cap rate (the ratio of rent to value)

is:

                  (1 + G p )T − 1
K p = Rp − Rp (                     )                                                   (1)
                  (1 + R p )T − 1

where T is the period between reviews; G p is the (constant) expected growth rate in rent; and

R p is the (constant) property required rate of return. If T = 1 (annual rent reviews), this

reduces to Gordon’s growth model:



K p = Rp - g p − π .                                                                    (2)



where we have expressed the growth rate as the sum of expected general inflation π and the

expected growth in real rent on the property type g p .

         We specify the required return on property as a weighted average of a mark up on the

required return on bonds and a mark down on the required return on stocks Rs , where w is the




                                                                                                   3
weight on stocks. Because stocks are more risky than property, this stock-bond premium

( prem sp ) is subtracted:




R p = w( Rs − premsp ) + (1 − w)( RRb + π + prem pb )                                 (3)



where RRb is the real default-free rate.

          Assuming continuous growth in dividends and a constant required equity return, the

required return can be expressed as the sum of the cap rate for corporate stocks (the

dividend/price ratio) and the expected growth rate in dividends. Again partitioning the

growth rate into general inflation and real growth,



Rs = K s + g s + π                                                                    (4)



Substituting (4) into (3), the result into equation (2), and cancelling the inflation terms, we

obtain:



K p = wK s + wg s − wpremsp + (1 − w) RRb + (1 − w) prem pb − g p                     (5)



Of course if w is zero, property is priced solely off of bonds, and if w is unity, property is

priced only off of stocks or shares. Unfortunately, only one of the six variables in this

equation, the dividend/price ratio, is observed.

    Given that lease rates do not adjust annually, that real cash-flow growth is not expected to

be constant forever into the future, and that expected future one-period returns are not

necessarily constant, this relationship is not expected to hold exactly.




                                                                                                  4
3. Literature

       The early literature on modelling real estate cap rates emphasized the link to the bond

market and estimated simple lag structures. For the UK, Hetherington (1988) modeled

appraisal-based cap rates from Hillier Parker and Key et al. (1994) modeled the UK all-

property appraisal-based cap rate from the Investment Property Databank. Some early U.S.

work recognized the links to the stock market as well. Both Evans (1990) and Ambrose and

Nourse (1993) estimated the link between the S&P 500 and the ACLI market cap rates. Jud

and Winkler (1995) and Viezer (1999) modeled market cap rates for property types from the

National Real Estate Index, the former emphasizing links to both the bond and stock markets

and the latter to the bond market only.

       Sophisticated lag structures have been estimated only recently. Sivitanidou and

Sivitanides (1999) use the National Real Estate Index (twice yearly from the end of 1985 to

the end of 1995 for each of 17 MSAs) for office properties. They identify the discount rate

and income growth expectations as the key components affecting cap rates. Both are affected

by variables that could be time invariant or time variant. They consider two sets of variables:

local office market effects; and time variant effects in the local office markets and national

capital market. A process of adjustment to equilibrium is specified.

       The equilibrium cap rate Ce is given by



   e
C jt = a j L j + b j F (t )                                                            (6)




where Lj is a vector of metropolitan dummies (so that the estimated values of aj represent

fixed local effects), F(t) represents time variant effects, j denotes metropolitan areas and t is a

time index. The actual cap rate C is the equilibrium value plus an autoregressive error, thus




                                                                                                      5
C jt = a j L j + b j F (t ) + ρ jε jt −1 + ν jt                                         (7)




where ρ denotes the serial correlation coefficient and νt is an independent random error term.

          In the first set of estimations, cap rates are modelled in panel with spatially varying

intercepts, a deterministic time trend (F(t) = t/(1+t2)) with spatially variable coefficients and a

spatially varying autoregressive error. It is estimated using the Seemingly Unrelated

Regressions (SUR) procedure to account for cross-sectionally correlated metropolitan-specific

errors. The results show significant inter-market differences in the local-fixed component

(showing differential risk perceptions and income growth expectations). There is also

evidence of differences in persistence in the errors (ρ different) and the bj’s are unequal.

          In the second set of estimations, the model is



C jt = a j + F ( L j , M j t , X t ) + ρ jε jt −1 + ν jt                                (8)




where Lj still denotes time-invariant traits of local office markets; Mjt represents time-variant

features of the local office markets; Xt represent time-variant features of the national capital

market. Three versions are estimated: fixed effects (aj and ρ are constant for all markets); ρ

only constant for all markets; both aj and ρ variable.

          While this is the most detailed attempt to model real property cap rates, it is not

without problems. The adjustment process is modelled through an AR error. However, serial

correlation in residuals does not necessarily imply serial correlation in the disturbances: it

may be the result of a more fundamental problem of an omitted, but relevant, autocorrelated




                                                                                                    6
independent variable (Harvey, 1990, Darnell, 1994).2 The authors acknowledge this

possibility. Moreover, in the first model, the deterministic time trend, based on a quadratic

decline, is surely a time specific phenomenon of a period when cap rates were falling. This

declining trend may point to possible problems with the order of integration of the variables

in the estimation. Further, it is possible that other methods of composing the series would be

more appropriate and might not result in an AR error. In the second model, it is uncertain

whether the local fixed effects can really be regarded as fixed over a 10-year period. Finally,

if the model were expressed in differences, the coefficients on the explanatory variables

would be constrained to be equal to those in the levels model. This implies a constrained

adjustment process.

         Sivitanides et al. (2001) examine NCREIF cap rate data. For office and industrial

properties, data are from 14 metropolitan markets for the 1984-2000 period; for retail and

multifamily properties data are for only 9 markets and begin as late as 1990. The primary

economic determinants are two real rent series analogous to our series, the ratio of real rent to

its average over the 1980-99 period and the annual growth rate in real rent. Unlike our

results, though, the real rent level variable has a negative coefficient, which is inconsistent

with an expectation of mean reversion in real rents. Other variables include the lagged log of

the capitalization rate, the Treasury bill rate, the CPI inflation rate (national, rather than by

MSA) and city fixed effects.

         From the above review, a number of common issues emerge. First, the models of cap

rates have been estimated in levels rather than differences. Second, and related, attention does

not seem to have been given to orders of integration of the variables or of co-integration



2
  For a dynamic regression, serial correlation may also reflect inappropriate specification of the system
dynamics. Harvey (1990, 288) suggests that if
 y t = αy t −1 + β 0 x t + β 1 x t −1 + ε t
the residuals from regressing yt on xt will tend to be serially correlated unless αβ0+β1=0. In such a case,
including an AR(1) disturbance term is not an appropriate course of action.

                                                                                                              7
among variables. Finally, the short-run dynamic adjustment process is unsatisfactorily

modelled or not modelled at all.


4. Estimation: An error correction model

    Error correction models (ECMs) are used widely in econometrics. The central notion is of

a steady-state relationship between variables that are evolving over time. This long-run

relationship is a time-varying equilibrium to which the system tends. An ECM comprises

both the long-run relationship and the short-run transitory effects and describes how the long-

run solution is achieved through negative feedback and error correction (Harvey, 1990;

Darnell, 1994).

    The long-run relationship is specified in levels, and the short-run adjustment in first

differences. The long-run or equilibrium relationship is:



K t* = β 0 + ∑i =1 β i X i t
                 n
                                                                                      (9)



where Kt* is the cap rate and Xit are explanatory variables at time t. Replacing K* with K and

estimating, the residual of this equation is:



            ∧           ∧
u t = K t − β 0 − ∑i =1 β i X it
                   n
                                                                                      (10)



the difference between the actual and estimated equilibrium values of the cap rate. If this

term is stationary, its lagged value can be used in the short-run model as an Error Correction

term.




                                                                                                 8
         Short-term changes in the variable of interest are driven by changes in the explanatory

variables in the long run relationship and by adjustments to previous disequilibrium in the

long-run relationship.



k t = α 0 + ∑i =1α i xit − γu t −1
               n
                                                                                                  (11)




where kt denotes the first difference of Kt and xit the first difference of Xit. Thus, the cap rate

adjusts to short-run changes in the causal variables and also to the lagged disequilibrium. The

degree of adjustment is indicated by the coefficient, γ: γ =1 means full adjustment, 0< γ <1

means partial adjustment and γ =0 means no adjustment. We would expect that α0 = 0.

We would also not be surprised if the αi were proportional to the β i , in which case ak* could

replace the summation in equation (11). A more general specification can include multiple

lags of the explanatory variables and of the dependent variables.

         There are two rationales for applying an ECM to capitalization rates. First, cap rates

effectively determine prices, and prices are often viewed as periodically deviating from

equilibrium values temporarily owing to market enthusiasm and a variety of transaction costs

that limit trading against optimists. The lagged change in price could capture market

momentum, and the difference between the actual and equilibrium prices could reflect the

underlying forces operating to return the market to equilibrium.3 Second, the optimal

appraisal process weights current and past transactions prices of similar properties (Quan and

Quigley, 1991). Given our use of appraisal data, the ECM could be capturing this process.

         The only study to use an ECM for cap rates is that of McGough and Tsolacos (2001)

who estimate a vector autoregressive model with error correction mechanisms (VECM) to

 In house price research, the lagged price change has been described as a “bubble” builder” and the actual-
equilibrium price gap as a “bubble burster” (Abraham and Hendershott, 1996).

                                                                                                              9
explain IPD appraisal-based cap rates.4 The significant variables in the VECM are: the first

three lags of the change in the cap rate; the third lag of the change in the yield on 10 year

Government bonds; the second lag of the change in the dividend yield from the FT Actuaries

All Share Index. The ECM is not significant. The insignificance of the error correction term

in the VECM is disappointing but may result from the restricted range of explanatory

variables, the inclusion of numerous lagged values of the explanatory variables in the short-

run model and the short period over which adjustment is allowed (three months).


5. Data sources and description

Capitalization rates

           Ideally, capitalization rates would be based on transactions of constant-quality

(including location) properties with identical lease terms. Of course, such data don’t exist.

Our rent and capitalization rates represent appraisers’ quarterly estimates for notional newly-

let new properties with standard characteristics and the standard UK lease in 731 particular

prime locations.5 That is, these data are ideal except that they are not based on actual

transactions. The series are publically available from Hillier Parker from the first quarter of

1972. The retail price index is used to deflate nominal rent and dividend series. All financial

and economic data are from DataStream.

           Figure 1 plots quarterly values of the UK office and retail cap rates, the share

dividend/price ratio and the 20-year government bond new issue rate. The share and bond

yields move together (correlation of 0.84 for the period 1973.3 to 2001.4), as do the office and

retail cap rates (0.82). But property does not correlate with either shares or bonds. The

    Hendershott, MacGregor and White (2002) use this framework to explain panels of UK regional real rents.

 There are 162 points in the office index, of which 83 are in the greater London area, reflecting the
concentration of the office investment market. There are 459 points in the retail index, of which only 78 are in
London.

                                                                                                               10
correlations of office and retail cap rates with bond rates are -0.25 and –0.15, respectively;

with shares the correlations are -0.03 and –0.04.

        One reason for the lack of correlation with cap rates in the stock and bond markets is

the far higher serial correlation in property cap rates. The serial correlation of first differences

of the property cap rates is 0.67 for retail and 0.57 for offices, while that of shares is 0.08 and

bonds is 0.18. The slow adjustment to changes in causal variables makes property cap rates

difficult to model. This problem is compounded by the importance of expectations in the

determination of cap rates and the need to identify suitable proxy variables for these

expectations. Many of these variables, too, exhibit substantially greater volatility than

property cap rates.



Proxies for expected real cash flow growth

        Dividends and real rents for both offices and retail exhibit high first order serial

correlation (all 0.98 in our data). However, the serial correlation of percentage changes is far

greater for rents than dividends (0.87 and 0.77 versus 0.20). The three income series exhibit

long horizon mean reversion or trend reversion.6 Figure 2 plots real office and retail rents per

unit space and real dividends, all scaled to unity in 1988.1. Real office rents have no trend,

real retail rents have a modest trend (1.35 per cent per year), and real dividends grow at about

5.3 per cent per year. The lower trends in real rent relative to real dividends reflect both the

ease of production of additional space and the retention of corporate earnings for investment.

        Expected future growth in real cash flows should reflect both the observed serial

correlation and mean (or trend) reversion. We capture mean reversion by using the four-

quarter average (current and previous three quarters) of the deviation of the log of real rent or

Hendershott (1996) and Hendershott, Lizieri and Matysiak (1999); on real US dividends, see Shiller (1981) and
Campbell and Shiller (1989).


                                                                                                           11
dividends from a linear trend. A high/low level will be expected to revert to the trend,

raising/lowering the cap rate.7 We capture serial correlation by using one-year moving

averages of changes in real cash flows; high recent growth will be extrapolated forward,

lowering the cap rate.

        On average, one would anticipate that actual future growth in real cash flows would be

positively correlated with expected future cash flow growth, as least over limited time

periods. Thus we would expect future real cash flows to be correlated with our deviation

from trend (negatively) and recent growth (positive). This is, indeed, the case.

        The three sections of Table 1 report these correlations for our three real cash-flow

variables – office rent, retail rent, and dividends. The top of each section shows the

correlations of the mean reversion and recent growth proxies. For rents, the correlations are

effectively zero. For dividends there is a slight negative correlation. The rest of the sections

show the correlations of the mean reversion and recent growth proxies with future actual real

rental growth at intervals of one to five years. As can be seen, the negative correlation with

the mean reversion proxy becomes stronger the more years of growth are considered, rising

from roughly (minus) 0.5 to 0.6 at one year to 0.8 or 0.9 at five years. The positive

correlation with the extrapolation proxy, in contrast, declines as more years are considered,

dropping from 0.45 to 0.65 at year one to less than 0.1 at year four.



Proxies for risk premia

        For the stock-property risk premium, the volatilities in recent property and stock-

market total returns are candidates for proxies. The volatility in recent property returns is also

 Hendershott (2000, pp 74-76) reports calculations suggesting an enormous rational decline in the Sydney office
market cap during the 1989-93 real rent collapse (real effective rents fell by two-thirds to a level far below
equilibrium).


                                                                                                            12
relevant to the property-bond premium, as is the volatility of recent inflation because property

is a superior inflation hedge than bonds. In practice, only the volatility of total real returns on

the stock market was significant in early models and, as its impact was marginal, it was not

included in the final models reported below.8

         It is well known that UK institutions have been moving out of property for the last

twenty years. In 1979, 18 per cent of life and pension fund portfolios was invested in

property; by 1999, only 4 percent (the data are from the Investment Property Databank). This

is a consequence of both portfolio revaluation and differential flows of new capital.

(Property’s share of net institutional new investment fell from a peak of around 25% in 1974

to 0% in 1996 and then rose to 10% in 2000, DTZ Research, 2001.) The decline in the

property weight probably reflects an increase in the risk premium demanded on property by

institutional investors, in which case property values would have fallen and cap rates would

be higher. On the other hand, the portfolio decline could reflect a decrease in the property

risk premium demanded by other investors, in which case property prices would have risen

and cap rates would be lower. That is, the reduced institutional share could reflect others

bidding for property rather than institutions dumping property. In the former case, we would

expect higher property prices (lower cap rates); in the latter, lower prices (higher cap rates).

Of course, if each of these changes were occurring at different times, the portfolio shift

variable will not work in the estimation.9

         A time trend is included to pick up trends in liquidity premia, in depreciation rates, or

in other missing factors.



8
  Other possible proxies for the risk premium on property were tested without success. They included recent
volatility of national GDP and output and employment related to the office and retail markets and of inflation.
Inflation volatility worked in some models but these regressions had other unsatisfactory features.
9
 We also tried a variety of other ‘weight of money’ variables, including net institutional investment in property,
property company debt, property company lending as a percentage of total bank lending, property company
share issues and new construction. Some worked modestly but none nearly as well as portfolio share.


                                                                                                                  13
       Table 2 shows that all of the cap rates, the property weight and real dividends are

integrated of order one (stationary in the first differences). The two real rent variables are

order zero (stationary), according to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, and order one,

according to Phillips-Perron test. If the order is one, we cannot include rents in the tests of

co-integration. In these tests, there are no problems with establishing at least one co-

integrating vector for the office market and, moreover, the residuals are stationary. The

results for the retail model are a little less conclusive – using the Akaike criterion for model

selection produces the desired result but the Schwarz criterion does not. However, the

residuals are again stationary (see Appendix 1 for the full results).

   The relatively high volatility of many of the likely explanatory variables in comparison to

cap rates pointed to the need to construct moving averages of many of these. The use of four-

quarter moving averages restricts our estimations to start in 1973. Quality property portfolio

weight data are available only beginning in 1977 (earlier data are based on book rather than

market values) and the series currently ends in 2001. Thus we report estimations for 1978-

2001. However, because we really have only 2.5 cycles of data and the 1973-76 period

amounts to nearly a full cycle, we illustrate the robustness of our principal findings on the

importance of expectations of real rental growth using data from the full period from 1973.


6. Office Market Results

   Table 3 contains estimates of the long-run relationship based on equation (5) estimated

over the period from the fourth quarter of 1977 (77.4) to the end of 2001 (01.4). We have

effectively assumed the real bond rate to be constant (above and beyond any relationship to

the variables included to reflect variations in the expected growth in real cash flows or the

property risk premium). Indexed linked bonds did not become available until 1986, and we




                                                                                                   14
despair of modelling long-term expected inflation.10 We include the stock market

capitalization rate (dividend/price ratio), the real cash flow deviation from trend and rate of

change variables for both property (office rent) and stocks (dividends), and the property

portfolio weight. The first equation includes a time trend and the second does not.

     All variables are highly significant (all rent coefficients have t-ratios of above 8) and are

appropriately signed. The adjusted R2 is 90 percent with the trend and 85 percent without.

The log deviation of real office rent from its trend (mean) has a positive sign. If real rent is

above trend, it is expected to fall and the implied lower rental growth is reflected in a higher

cap rate. If real rent were 50 percent above trend, as it was in 1974 and 1990, the cap rate

would be one and a half percentage points higher, while if real rent were 20 percent below

normal, as in 1977-84 and 1994-95, the cap rate would be a half percentage point lower. The

four-period moving average of real rental growth has a negative sign. Thus, if current rental

growth were high, expectations of further growth would necessitate a lower cap rate. The

rapid five percent quarterly real rental growth during mid1987-mid1988 translates into a

percentage point lower cap rate, while the sharp declines during 1975-76 and 1991-92 imply

the reverse.

         The coefficient on the dividend-price ratio is only 0.18 with a t-ratio of two,

suggesting that property is priced more off the bond market than off the stock market.

Nonetheless the significance of the dividend-price ratio and both the real dividend growth rate

and real dividend deviations from trend (with the expected signs) is strong evidence that

office property is priced off the stock market.



10
   Sivitanides et. al. (2001) use the previous year’s percentage change in the CPI as the proxy for ten-year
expected inflation and obtain coefficients on it (and the nominal Treasury bill rate) that are far below the
expected unity value. We have constructed a real rate series assuming it was constant prior to 1986. When
included in our trend model, the variable had a coefficient of 0.13, far lower than the expected unity value, with
a t-ratio of 1.9. The coefficient was lower in the non-trend model, and when the models were estimated on the
1986-2001 data, the coefficient turned negative.



                                                                                                                15
       If mean reversion and rental momentum were the same in the property and stock

markets, we would expect the coefficients on the variables based on dividends to be roughly

w those based on rents, where the estimated w was 0.18. Of course w is estimated with error;

lowering and increasing it by a standard error gives a range of 0.09 to 0.27. In fact the

estimated ratio of dividend to rent coefficients is 0.11 for the growth variables and 0.68 for

the mean reversion variables. This exercise suggests that while investor’s extrapolation of the

growth in real dividends and rents is similar, mean reversion in the office market is weaker

than in the stock market. This result is not surprising given that both Hendershott (2000) and

Sivitanides, etal. (2001) report zero or even negative expected reversion of real rents by

investors. Overall, though, the importance of the cash-flow variables with the expected

impacts is an especially appealing result of the estimations.

       The property weight and trend variables are highly significant with economically large

coefficients, but their impacts are largely offsetting. As noted above, the property weight fell

from 18 percent to four per cent during the 1979-1999 period. With a coefficient of –0.37,

this translates into a huge 5.2 percentage-point rise in the cap rate. On the other hand, a

negative time trend of 0.036 per quarter for 80 quarters cumulates to a 2.9 percentage point

decline in the cap rate, giving a net effect of the two variables of a 2.3 percentage point rise in

the cap rate over the twenty years.

       When the time trend is excluded (the second equation in Table 3), the coefficient on

the property weight variable is halved to compensate. The 14 percentage-point decline in the

weight now implies a 2.4 percentage point (0.17*14) rise in the cap rate. All the cash-flow

variables work as before, although the level (mean reversion) coefficients decline by 10 to 20

percent in absolute magnitude and the flow coefficients rise, especially the low dividend

coefficient.




                                                                                                 16
        Figure 3 plots the actual and fitted values of the cap rate (the third series in the figure

is discussed shortly). As can be seen, the actual series oscillates throughout the 1980s before

jumping by two percentage points in 1990 and early 1991. Roughly two years later, in late

1993 and early 1994, the two-point increase was reversed. Not surprisingly, the estimated

equation captures the broad movement in the cap rate, although significant, reversing, errors

occur periodically, suggesting the need for an error correction framework.

        We next estimate the short-run adjustment model, initially including changes in all the

long-run model variables, the lagged dependent variable to expand the dynamic adjustment

process, and the ECM variable. All the change variables enter with the expected signs and

most are 25 to 42 percent of their coefficient in the long run equation (see Table 4). The two

exceptions are the dividend-price ratio, whose short-run coefficient is 59 percent of the long-

run coefficient, and the deviation of dividends from trend, whose short-run coefficient is 121

percent. Both of these coefficients have t-ratios around 2.3. The other t-ratios range from 1.4

to 1.9. The lagged dependent and ECM variables have t-ratios of 3.5 and 5.0 and suggest

autocorrelation of 0.3 and error correction of 0.25. The adjusted R2 is 45%. The actual and

fitted values are shown in Figure 4. The model picks up the broad movements of the cap rate

change well, although it does not fully capture the 1.12 percentage point plunge in 1994.2.

        To determine how well our preferred equations from the two-part estimation – the

long and short run equations – really explain the cap rate, we have simulated the estimated

cap rate dynamically. In this simulation we compute the change in the cap rate each quarter

going forward using the difference equation coefficients, but the lagged cap rate in the

simulation is always that obtained from the previous simulation, rather than the actual lagged

cap rate. In this way, errors in the estimation are allowed to accumulate over time. This is the

third series in Figure 3.




                                                                                                  17
       As can be seen, when lag gaps between the actual and long run capitalization rates

exist, the dynamically simulated cap rate tends to narrow the difference. The gap between the

estimated and actual cap rate is more than 50 basis points during 87.1-88.2 and 93.1-94.1 and

less than -50 basis points in 89.2-90.1. In the first two periods the average differences are 75

and 61 basis points. The dynamically predicted cap rate, in contrast, differs from the actual

cap rate by only 64 and 29 basis points. In the third case, the average estimated long run gap

is -55 basis points and the dynamically fitted gap is again smaller, -29 basis points. On

average, the gaps are reduced by 34 percent.


7. Retail Market Results

   Table 5 contains the estimated long-run relationship for retail cap rates. All the

coefficients are correctly signed, although those on the dividend price ratio, the dividend

growth rate and the trend variable are less than their standard errors. Because the coefficient

on the time trend is trivial, excluding it has only modest impacts on the other coefficients.

Thus no equation is reported without the trend. The –0.20 coefficient on the portfolio weight

variable combined with the 14 point drop gives a 2.8 percentage point rise in the cap rate

between 1980 and 2000. The adjusted R2 is 85 percent.

   The rent and dividend level coefficients are about 60 percent larger than in the office

market equation, suggesting stronger mean reversion generally. If real rent were 30 percent

above trend, as it was in 1989-90, the cap rate would be 1.5 percentage points higher, while if

real rent were 20 percent below normal, as in 1983-84, the cap rate would be a percentage

point lower. On the other hand, if current rental growth were high, expectations of further

growth would necessitate a lower cap rate. The rapid five percent quarterly real rental growth

during 1987-88 translates into a two-thirds percentage point lower cap rate.




                                                                                                18
   The small coefficient on the dividend growth variable is consistent with the small

coefficient on the dividend-price ratio. What is surprising is how large the coefficient is on

dividend reversion relative to rent reversion. Again, this result is consistent with less mean

reversion in property markets relative to the stock market.

   Figure 5 plots the actual, fitted and the dynamically simulated. Our ability to explain the

long-run movement in the retail cap rate is less than our ability to explain the office cap rate.

The cap rate is underpredicted at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period.

Also, the sharp movement during 1989-mid94 is only partially explained.

   Table 6 contains the short-run adjustment equation. All coefficients on changes in the

variables appearing in the long-run equation are correctly signed, but only that on the change

in the dividend-price ratio is statistically significant. The second equation in the table

includes only the lagged dependent variable, the error correction and the dividend-price ratio.

The error correction is smaller than that for offices, while the auto correlation is close to

double that in the office market. The R2 is 46 percent. Figure 6 gives the actual and fitted

values and residuals. The fitted follows the path of actual cap rate changes reasonably well

throughout the period but, as with the office model, the spike in 1994 is largely missed.

   As noted above, the actual retail cap rate does not track the long-run fitted value as closely

as was the case for the office cap rate. Whereas we identified three periods of substantial

continuous gaps between the actual and long-run fitted cap rates for offices, here we identify

five. The actual exceeded the equilibrium by 70 basis points during 78.1-79.2 and 67 basis

points during 2001. The dynamic adjustment halved the first gap, but actually increased the

second by 6 basis points. On the other hand, the equilibrium rate exceeded the actual by 46

basis points during 85.2-86.1, 68 basis points in 1989, and 58 basis points during 94.2-94.4.

On average, the dynamic equation reduced the gaps by only 14 percent (to 46 from 54 basis




                                                                                                 19
points), far less than the 34 percent reduction of the office market gap. That is, neither the

long run relationship nor the short-run adjustment is as good for retail as for offices.


8. Discussion and further work

   From these estimations for office and retail cap rates, it is clear that a model can be

estimated that is generally consistent with the cap rate analysis in section 2. It is also clear

that the ECM is a useful formulation for the analysis. Some caution is, however, required for

this final conclusion. While the stock and two property cap rates are integrated of order one

during the period of analysis, there is no reason to suppose that these would be anything other

than stationary over a much longer period. If this were the case, a levels estimation would be

appropriate.

   Especially noteworthy is the importance of proxies for expected growth in real cash flows

(reflecting both extrapolative growth expectations and mean reversion). We have reproduced

the mean reversion and extrapolation regression coefficients for both models both with and

without the trend variable in the first two columns of Table 7, with office at the top of the

table and retail underneath. In the third and fourth columns we have done the same based on

estimation over the longer mid1973-2001 period, which adds nearly another full rent cycle.

In this estimation the property portfolio weight variable prior to 1977.1 is set equal to the

1977.1 value due to its unavailability prior to then. For offices, only one of the rent

coefficients changes by as much as 10 percent. For retail, the mean reversion coefficients

decline by 15 and 60 percent, while the extrapolation coefficients rise (absolutely) by a

quarter and two-thirds.

   The standard errors for the four office mean reversion coefficients are 0.3 and the

coefficients themselves range from 2.2 to 3.2, averaging 283. The standard errors for the

extrapolation coefficients are in the 1.6 to 2.3 range and the coefficients range from -15.9 to -

21.3 and average -18.5. That is, the t-ratios always exceed 7 and average 10. Moreover the


                                                                                                   20
impacts are large. When real office rents are 50 percent above the mean (1974 and 1990), the

cap rate would be one to one and a half percentage points higher. And when real rents are 20

percent below the mean (1977-84 and 1994-95), the cap rate would be a third to two-thirds

percentage points lower. A year of rapid growth in real office rents (five percent quarterly)

also has a major impact, lowering the cap rate by a percentage point or more because

investors are willing to pay more for a dollar of rent that is expected to grow rapidly. The rent

variables explain much of the extraordinary hump in cap rates during the 1990-92 period.

    The standard errors for the four retail mean reversion coefficients are 0.6 and the

coefficients themselves range from 2.0 to 5.2 and average 4.2. The standard errors for the

extrapolation coefficients are in the 3.5 to 4.1 range and the coefficients range from -13.3 to -

23.6 and average –16.9. All the t-ratios exceed 3, and the mean reversion coefficients average

nearly 7.

    Our results are strikingly different from those of Sivitanides et al (2001), who report a

negative sign on the ratio of real rent to its mean value, suggesting that investors irrationally

extrapolate far above normal real rents to rise even further. Not only do our real rent proxies

work as expected, that is, are consistent with rational expectations of mean reversion, but the

real dividend proxies work correctly as well. That is, real dividends being above trend lead to

expectations that real dividends will fall and thus that property is relatively more attractive.

As a result, the property cap rate falls. This is true for both office and retail properties.

    Of course, cap rates can be converted to values by dividing them into market rents. We

have divided actual rents first by actual cap rates and then by the dynamically simulated office

market cap rate described above and graph the two series in Figures 7 (offices) and 8 (retail).

As can be seen, the office model tracks value reasonably closely. The model explains all but

the last sixth of the 1985-89 rise in office value and all of the entire subsequent decline, and

otherwise tracks value closely. The retail equation does not perform as well.



                                                                                                    21

 Notes:
    (1) There are 97 observations from 1977 q4 to 2001 q4 inclusive.
    (2) Variables with a ‘4’ are four quarter moving averages.
    (3) The rental and dividend level variables are deviations from a fitted exponential trend,
        although the trend is insignificant for the two property variables. The trend is
        calculated for the full period for which there is rental data – 1972 q3 to 2001 q4.
    (4) ADF – Augmented Dickey-Fuller; PP – Phillips-Perron.

   Notes:
   (1) All tests undertaken using I(1) variables and with I(0) variables as exogenous.
   (2) All tests undertaken twice: (a) with the rental level assumed I(0) and (b) with it
       assumed I(1).
   (3) The number of co-integrating vectors is from the test variant that maximises the
       information criterion: the first number is the Akaike criterion result; the second
       number is the Schwartz criterion result.
