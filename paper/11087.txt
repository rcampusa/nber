                                          ABSTRACT

During the 1990s US healthcare markets underwent a significant transformation. Managed care rose

to become the dominant form of insurance in the private sector. Also, a wave of hospital

consolidation occurred. In 1990, the mean population-weighted hospital Herfindahl-Hirschman

Index (HHI) in a Health Services Area (HSA) was .19. By 2000, the HHI had risen to .26. This paper

explores whether the rise in managed care caused the increase in hospital concentration. We use an

instrumental variables approach with 10-year differences to identify the relationship between

managed care penetration and hospital consolidation. Our results strongly imply that the rise of

managed care did not cause the hospital consolidation wave. This finding is robust to a number of

different specifications.

Introduction

           During the 1990s the landscape of US healthcare markets underwent a dramatic

transformation. Managed care in one of its many forms displaced indemnity insurance to

become the dominant form of insurance in the private sector (Glied, 2001). Over the

same period, a wave of hospital mergers, acquisitions and hospital system expansions

occurred. In 1990, the mean, population weighted, hospital Herfindahl-Hirschman Index

(HHI) in a Health Services Area (HSA) was .1903. By 2000, the HHI had risen to .2566.1

The HHI measures the level of ‘competition’ in a market with 0 being perfect

competition and 1 being pure monopoly.

           Understanding the determinants of hospital concentration allows the development

of policies to manage hospital competition. Hospital market power impacts the

functioning of health care markets in several important ways. First, as hospitals garner

more market power, their bargaining position with payers may improve and that can

increase the cost of hospital care for the privately-insured population. Research shows

that increases in hospital concentration lead to higher hospital prices (Gaynor and Vogt,

2001, and Dranove and Saitherwaitte, 2001, provide excellent reviews of this literature).

Increased hospital market power is also associated with decreased hospital quality

(Kessler and McClellan, 2002; and Gowrisankaran and Town, 2003). Finally, there is

some evidence that decreases in hospital competition decrease access to health services

for underserved populations (Aizer, Currie and Morretti, 2004).

    The unweighted HHI is .31 in 1990 and .37 in 2000.


                                                     1
        It is conventional wisdom that the rise of managed care precipitated the hospital

consolidations and concentration in the 1990s.2 Graphical analysis is consistent with the

conventional wisdom. Figure 1 graphs the annual mean population-weighted levels of

hospital HHI and HMO penetration across HSAs.3 Two hospital HHI measures are

graphed, overall concentration and concentration due to changes in hospital ownership

structure (i.e. mergers, acquisitions and hospital system formation and expansion).4

Several features of this graph are noteworthy. First, hospital concentration and HMO

penetration share a common trend throughout most of the 1990s. Only in the late 1990s

was there a break in this trend, as HMO penetration experienced a slight decline while

hospital concentration continued to increase. While this correlation is suggestive, it does

not prove that there is a causal link between HMO penetration and hospital concentration.

The second noteworthy feature of Figure 1 is that most of the increase in hospital

concentration occurred in the mid-1990s. Finally, of the .063 overall increase in the

population weighted HHI, .053 is due to mergers, acquisitions or hospital system

expansion. The remaining .01 change in HHI is a consequence of hospital exits and

changes in the distribution of beds across hospitals.

        This paper tests the proposition that the rise of managed care caused hospitals to

consolidate in the 1990s. Our models explicitly account for the possibility that markets

are systematically heterogeneous and that this heterogeneity may bias cross-sectional

estimates of the parameters of interest. We also use an instrumental variables (IV)

  For example, Evans Cuellar and Gertler (2005) say, “Hospital consolidation is likely a response to
managed care,.” (p.214). Also, see Dranove, Simon and White (2002), Employee Benefit Research Institute
(1999), Czajkowski (1999), Grembowski et al. (2002), McCue et al. (1999) and Hollis (1997).

  Our measure of hospital concentration includes direct ownership of hospital assets as well as membership

approach to account for the possibility that managed care penetration may be

endogenous.

       Our estimates indicate that the rise in managed care did not cause the increase in

hospital concentration. In every specification we estimated, the coefficient of managed

care penetration is negative and in many of the specifications it is significant. That is, if

anything, our estimates indicate that the rise of HMOs reduced hospital concentration.

       The next section discusses some of the reasons why managed care might lead to

hospital consolidation and reviews the relevant literature. The following sections present

the methods, the data, the results and the discussion of our findings.

Hospital Consolidation and Managed Care

Why Managed Care May Cause Hospital Consolidation

       There is a widespread belief that the wave of hospital consolidation that occurred

over the 1990s was driven by the rise of managed care. There are at least three reasons

why this might be so. First, managed care may reduce the demand for hospital beds thus

creating excess capacity in the market. Second, managed care may change the bargaining

power of hospitals relative to health insurers. Third, the value of contracting with an

integrated hospital system may be greater for managed care organizations than indemnity

insurers.

       One of the theories underlying managed care is that by monitoring and controlling

health care use, insurers can reduce health care expenditures and perhaps increase

enrollee health. In the RAND health insurance experiment, enrollment in the prepaid

Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound reduced the likelihood of a hospital admission




                                             3
by 35% compared with a fee-for-service population (Manning et al., 1987).5 However, as

an explanation of hospital consolidation this finding needs embellishment. Most

economic models of mergers predict that the incentive to merge increases with the

demand for the product (e.g. Deneckere and Davidson, 1985). The intuition behind this

result is straightforward—the larger the market the larger the profit gains from market

power.

         However, it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which a decline in demand

for inpatient services leads to hospital consolidation. If demand falls far enough so the

market can no longer support the old number of hospitals under the old ownership

structure, then there may be an incentive to merge. According to neo-classical economic

theory, if the reduction in demand leads to lower prices and if price falls below average

variable cost, the market will need to remove the capacity in some way. Hospital closure

is one way to reduce capacity. However, hospital assets have “high specificity” and few

alternative uses. These features of the hospital market may drive hospitals to seek to

combine operations in order to gain market power and thereby raise price above average

cost. These combinations may also allow hospitals to achieve efficiencies and reduce

average costs, thereby keeping price above average costs. Hospitals may prefer to merge

and perhaps lose valued autonomy rather than close. This explanation requires that

hospitals value autonomy as well as profits. This is a plausible assumption given the

hospital industry’s historical basis as a decentralized, community-based system. If

autonomy was not valued, the hospitals would have been better off by merging earlier.

Another motivation for consolidation is that merging hospitals may wish to internalize

5
  While managed care may reduce demand, the advancement of medicine has surely had a larger effect on
the demand for inpatient days. According to our estimates, from 1990 to 2000 average inpatient days per-
capita declined by 54%.


                                                   4
externalities. In the face of excess capacity hospitals may want to reduce capacity by

closing down wings or converting parts of their hospital to an outpatient or skilled

nursing facility. But, there may be an externality problem. If a hospital reduces the

number of beds, then all hospitals in the market may benefit. A merger or hospital system

expansion may allow hospitals partially to internalize that externality.

       The second reason that increases in managed care might trigger hospital

consolidation is based on the ability of managed care organizations (MCOs) to bargain

effectively with hospitals over prices. The rise of managed care may change the price

elasticity of demand for hospital services. By selective contracting, MCOs increase their

bargaining leverage with hospitals vis-à-vis indemnity plans. However, in economic

theory the effect of increasing the price elasticity of demand on the incentive to

consolidate is ambiguous. Mergers in markets with intermediate levels of price elasticity

are more likely to increase market power than those in markets with either low or high

elasticity. Thus, the common belief that changes in bargaining power between payers and

hospitals increase the incentive to merge is not necessarily true.

       The third possible reason why managed care may increase the incentive for

hospitals to consolidate is that by forming an integrated delivery system the hospitals are

better able to manage patient care (Shortell, et al., 1996). This ability to better manage

patient care may make the organization better able to engage in capitation arrangements

with health plans. The formation of these integrated delivery systems requires hospitals to

form both vertical (with physician groups) and horizontal (with other hospitals)

arrangements so that they can manage care for a geographically dispersed population.

That is, in order for the managed care organizations to achieve efficiencies they need to




                                              5
write ‘high-powered’ contracts and hospitals need to integrate to be able to respond

effectively to the incentives contained in these contracts. The development of integrated

delivery systems is a weak explanation for the link between managed care and hospital

consolidation. Capitated hospital arrangements never became widespread and integrated

delivery systems ultimately “didn’t work.” (Burns and Pauly, 2002).

Empirical Evidence

        There are two studies of the relationship between managed care penetration and

hospital market competition. Dranove, Simon and White (2002) (herafter, DSW) use data

on physicians’ reports of managed care revenue and find that the change in hospital

concentration in 68 large MSAs between 1981 and 1994 is positively correlated with the

level of managed care concentration in 1993/1994. This research has some limitations.

First, the time period of the analysis is only of modest interest because most of the

hospital consolidations and most of the increase in managed care in the 1990s occurred

after 1994. Much of the variation in the variables of interest is missing. Second, DSW

focus on large metropolitan areas in which hospital mergers are much less likely to lead

to significant increases in market power. The mean end-of-period Herfindahl-Hirschman

Index they report is .126 – well below concentration levels that would give the Federal

Trade Commission or the Department of Justice cause for concern.6 Third, the measure of

managed care penetration is the mean percent of physician practice revenues from

managed care. This measure of managed care penetration, based on the physician

services factor markets, is not widely used in research. It is also a function of physician

prices in a location and thus may be more subject to endogeneity problems than simple


6
  It is also likely that antitrust markets are much smaller than the large MSAs and thus they likely have
significant measurement error.


                                                   6
managed care penetration rates. However, a potential advantage of DSW’s measure is

that it includes all forms of managed care, not just HMOs. The more commonly used

measure is penetration based on the managed care product market.7 Fourth, DSW regress

the change in concentration on the end-of-period level of managed care penetration. They

argue that this is a reasonable approach because managed care penetration in most cites

was close to zero at the beginning of their sample. However, in this type of statistical

analysis, the difference between being ‘close’ to zero and being exactly zero matters. In

this circumstance, failure to difference a variable, even if it is close to but different from

zero, can still lead to significant biases.8 According to InterStudy data, 62% of MSAs

with over 800,000 population (roughly DSW’s sample) had managed care penetration

greater than 5% in 1985 and 37% had HMO penetration greater than 5% in 1981.9 We

replicate and discuss the DSW results in greater detail in the Results section.

         Chernew (1995) analyzes the relationship between the change in the number of

hospitals and managed care penetration in 175 large MSAs between 1982 and 1987. He

finds a negative and significant relationship between managed care penetration and the

number of hospitals in an MSA. Like DSW, Chernew’s analysis occurs before the rise in

managed care. Also, Chernew’s analysis does not explicitly focus on changes in market


7
  For example, Baker and Brown (1999) use HMO penetration data from Group Health Association of
America as a measure of managed care penetration.

  We performed the following Monte Carlo simulation. The base model is yit = α i + .5 xit + eit for t=1,2.
The variables α i , x1 and x2 are drawn from uniform distributions (with censoring) with a mean of .2, .035
and .2, respectively. About half of the x1’s are equal to zero. The eit are drawn from a N(0,.1). The x’s are
correlated with α i ( ρ = .5 ). We performed 500 simulations each with 70 observations. Estimation of the
coefficient on x using the approach of DSW resulted in a bias of approximately 50%.
9
  The PMSA with over 5% HMO penetration in 1981 include: Denver, CO; Portland, OR; Orange County,
CA; Seattle, WA; New York, NY; Rochester, NY; Minneapolis, MN; Sacramento, CA; Los Angeles, CA;
Miami, FL; Milwaukee, WI; Riverside Co., CA; San Diego, CA; Phoenix, AZ; Washington, DC and San
Francisco, CA. DSW exclude Washington, DC, three California PMSAs, and Minneapolis from one of
their analyses to test the robustness of their conclusions.

structure due to consolidation. The number of hospital competitors in a market can

change due to consolidation (although a consolidation does not necessarily change the

physical number of hospitals in a location) or because of entry or exit.

       In related work, Baker and Brown (1999) examine the impact of managed care on

the number of mammography providers. Their data is cross-sectional and they instrument

for managed care penetration using the size distribution of employers in the locale. They

find that managed care penetration reduces the number of mammography providers.

Methods

       Our approach to estimate the impact of managed care on hospital consolidation is

to relate the change in HMO penetration to one of several possible measures of the

change in hospital concentration in a market area. Our empirical model is:

(1)     H it = α i + HMOit βt + xit' γ t + eit .

Hospital concentration in market i at time t, Hit, is a linear function of HMO penetration,

HMOit, market characteristics, xit, a time-invariant unobserved (to the researcher) market

fixed effect, α i , and a market/time shock, eit. We let βt depend on time as changes in

technology or unmeasured market conditions may affect the incentive for hospitals to

consolidate in response to managed care.

       It is possible and perhaps probable that the unobserved market fixed effect is

correlated with HMO penetration. There are many possible reasons for this correlation.

For example, locations in which hospitals have high α ’s may be unattractive for HMOs

to enter because they have fewer hospitals with which to contract. If α is correlated with

HMO penetration, OLS estimation of (1) will lead to biased estimates of βt . This bias can

be eliminated by taking differences of (1) across time.


                                                   8
        Taking differences between period t and period t-1 gives

(2)      ∆H it = ∆HMOit β t + HMOit −1β e + ∆xit' γ t + xit' −1γ e + ut

where ∆ is the standard difference operator (i.e. ∆H it ≡ H it − H it −1 ), β e = β t − β t −1 ,

γ e = γ t − γ t −1 and uit = eit − eit −1 . One may still be concerned that the error term in (2), ut,

may be correlated with our HMO variables. Our strategy is to correct this possible

endogeneity by estimating the parameters of (2) with an instrumental variable approach.

We discuss the instrument set later in this section.

        We use a long difference of 10 years to define our change variable, with 1990 as

the base year.10 We chose 1990 as the starting year because that is the approximate

beginning of the horizontal (within market) consolidation wave. The mean, population-

weighted HHI in 1985 was .1900 and in 1990 it was .1903 – a very small difference over

the five year period. However, the increase in average HHI between 1990 and 1991, the

years of the smallest increase in our sample, was .0022, a rate of increase that is 55 times

larger than the annual rate of increase over the preceding five years.

Measures of the Change in Concentration

        The most common measure of competition used by economists is the Herfindahl-

Hirschman Index (HHI). This measure serves as the basis for two of the three measures

of the change in concentration in our analysis. The other measure of the change in

hospital concentration that we study is the number of mergers between hospitals in the

geographic area.




10
  We have performed our analysis on both a longer period, 1985 to 2000, and a shorter period, 1992-1998.
The results from those analyses are qualitatively identical to those we present here. These results are
available from the authors upon request.


                                                     9
           The HHI is simply the sum of the squared market shares of all firms in a given

market. That is, the HHI is defined as,

                       N
(3)         HHI it = ∑ sit2
                      i =1


                                                                                qit
where s is the market share of the hospital system within the market, sit ≡   N
                                                                                           and q is
                                                                              ∑q
                                                                              j =1
                                                                                      jt




a measure of output/capacity while N is the number of market participants.

           We made two important decisions in calculating the HHI. The first decision

concerns the boundaries (both geographic and product) of the market. As we discuss in

the data section, we use a Health Services Area (HSA) as the geographic boundary and

short-term, non-governmental inpatient care as the product market. The second decision

concerns the appropriate measure of output. Our measure of output is the total number of

staffed beds. We tested the sensitivity of our results to these design decisions by

repeating our analysis using HHI constructed from alternative measures of the geographic

market (MSAs) and output (inpatient days) and found that our conclusions are robust to

these alternatives.11

           The standard HHI can change from period to period within a market for several

reasons. The most obvious one is a merger or system formation between two market

participants. However, this is not the only reason that the HHI can change. The HHI will

change if the distribution of output/capacity changes or if there is entry into or exit from

the market. If managed care does have an impact on the HHI through causing mergers we

would like to isolate the change in the HHI due to mergers. So, we developed a measure

of the change in HHI due to consolidation (∆MHHI).

       We define ∆MHHI as follows,

                       Nr           Nr
(3)     ∆MHHI it ,r = ∑ s(Ot )ir2 − ∑ sir2
                       i =1         i =1



where s (Ot )ir2 is the share based on the distribution of output/capacity from period r

aggregated to the hospital using the ownership/system structure in period t (r<t). If there

is only one change in ownership/system structure in a location (denote the hospitals as j

and k) during the period then the ∆MHHI it ,r = 2 s jr skr . For the most part, ∆MHHI will be

either 0 (if no changes in within-location ownership/system structures occur) or positive

(if there is a consolidation in a location). If a de-merger occurs then ∆MHHI is negative.

       Our third measure of the change in hospital concentration is simply an indicator

taking the value of 1 if a merger occurred between hospitals in an HSA and 0 otherwise.

In essence, this is simply an indicator of whether ∆MHHI is greater than zero. We

include this variable in our set of dependent variables because ∆MHHI is a nonlinear

function of market shares and the resulting distribution is highly skewed as well as

censored. A high degree of skewness in the distribution of a left-hand side variable can

lead to misleading inferences because of the presence of outliers – thus analyzing the

parameter estimates from the indicator allows us to examine the robustness of our

estimates from the ∆MHHI regression.




                                             11
Instruments

       The possibility that the error term in (2) may be correlated with our measures of

HMO penetration caused us to seek out potential instruments for HMO penetration.

There are two possible reasons for this correlation: omitted variable bias (primarily health

status) and unobserved characteristics of hospital markets that may influence HMO

penetration.

       We use as instruments the number of potential HMO entrants in a market in 1990,

the number of non-specialist physicians per capita in 1990, the percent of the population

that is self-employed and the percent of the population employed in firms with over a 100

employees in 1990. These variables are plausibly unrelated to changes in hospital market

structure and they predict HMO penetration.

       The number of potential HMO entrants is simply the number of HMOs that are

participating in a market within the state in 1990 but have yet to enter into the HSA in

question. The rationale behind this measure is that an HMO must meet a number of state-

level regulatory hurdles before it can enter a market, and if an HMO is already

participating in a state, then its entry costs will be lower than if it tries to enter a market

without any previous experience in that state. Our hypothesis is that more potential HMO

entrants will increase actual entry in a market and that HMO penetration will be higher.

       We hypothesize that HMOs will have more bargaining power and consequently

lower costs of doing business in markets with higher numbers of primary care physicians

per capita. Baker and Brown (1999) used the size distribution of employers to instrument

for HMO penetration in their analysis of the impact of managed care on mammography

providers.




                                              12
        It is well known that if the instrument set is a poor predictor of the endogenous

variables conditional on all of the control variables, then small-sample bias can be very

large (Stock and Staiger, 1997). Following the suggestion of Stock and Staiger (1997)

and Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995), we performed F-tests of the joint significance of the

instrument set for the endogenous variables, ∆HMO Penetration and HMO Penetration.

The F-statistics are 3.36 and 6.29 for the regressions with corresponding p-values of .003

and <.0001, respectively. Both of these F-statistics are significantly greater than 1—a

value that Bound, Jaeger and Baker (1995) suggest should be “a cause for concern.”12

Estimation Strategy

        We have three different dependent variables – ∆HHI, ∆MHHI, and the merger

indicator. Only ∆HHI has a distribution that is appropriate for using linear methods. The

distribution of ∆MHHI is essentially censored with two-thirds of the observations equal

to zero. Of course, the distribution of the merger indicator is discrete.

        For each dependent variable we estimate two regressions – one treating the HMO

penetration variables as exogenous and one instrumental variable regression. For ∆HHI

we use linear regression with heteroskedasticity correction and instrumental variable

estimation. As the distribution of ∆MHHI is essentially censored, we estimate the

parameters using standard Tobit and instrumental Tobit as described by Newy (1989).

Finally, we use Probit and instrumental variable Probit approaches to estimate the

parameters from the merger indicator regression.

  The F-test suggests that the small sample bias will be less than .30. The presence of this bias will not
overturn any of our conclusions.

Data

        An observation in our analysis is a Health Services Area (HSA), defined by the

National Center for Health Statistics (Makuc, et al., 1991) as one or more counties that

are relatively self-contained with respect to the provision of routine hospital care. This

definition is operationalized by using an algorithm that groups counties by minimizing

travel by patients within the area to areas outside of the defined group. Thus, unlike

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), the HSA relies on patient flows instead of geo-

political boundaries to identify hospital ‘markets.’13

        This definition is not ideal. The ideal unit of observation for our study would be

an antitrust market. However, defining antitrust markets is notoriously difficult. It

requires detailed analysis of each hospital under consideration, and there is still

substantial disagreement within the economic and legal communities on the appropriate

methodology to use (Capps et al., 2002; Werden, 1990). While it is important to

recognize that HSAs are not antitrust markets, they are probably closer approximation to

them than MSAs. Most economists believe that antitrust markets typically are smaller

than MSAs, and HSAs, on average, are significantly smaller than MSAs.

        The data in this study come from several sources. Data on hospitals come from

the American Hospital Association (AHA) hospital survey. This commonly-used data set

contains information on hospital location, size (beds and inpatient days) and system

membership. The AHA survey also tracks mergers and acquisition of different hospitals

in an appendix to the documentation. In most of the analysis, we use data from 1990 to



13
   A literature in antitrust analysis suggests that using patient flows to define markets can be misleading
(Werden, 1990, and Capps et al., 2002). However, it is probably the case that using patient flow data to
identify markets is more accurate than using existing geo-political boundaries.

2000 but some of our sensitivity analyses go back to the 1985 hospital survey. Each

hospital is assigned to an HSA according to its address in the 1990 AHA Survey.

       Our information on the structure of the managed care market comes from

InterStudy. InterStudy collects information on the number of HMO enrollees by health

plan. The HMO data come from InterStudy census data (InterStudy, 1985-1987; InterStudy,

1988-2001) and Group Health Association HMO Directories (Group Health Association of

America, 1989-1992). The InterStudy Census includes HMO location, founding year, model

type, not-for-profit status, federal qualification, and national affiliation. Enrollment by

geographic area comes from multiple sources. From 1985 to 1988, enrollment data comes

from the InterStudy Census and supplemental InterStudy reports on areas served by HMOs

(Hartwell, et al. 1986). From 1988 to 1991, the list of counties an HMO operates in was

obtained from Group Health Association HMO Directories (Group Health Association of

America, 1989-1992). From 1992 to 1996, the list of counties where each HMO operates

and enrollment by MSA was obtained from 1992 through 1996. Following 1996, InterStudy

obtained county-level information on most HMOs in its annual survey and provided country

enrollment measures. Where county enrollments were unavailable, enrollment for each

HMO was pro-rated on the basis of county population to the each county served by the

HMO.

       There is a significant change in enrollment distribution between 1987 and 1988

because of the significant improvement in the listing of counties served. Because of the less

complete listing of counties served in 1985 to 1987, MSA enrollment may be overstated.

But, pro-rating HMO enrollment on the basis of a larger list of counties served may

overstate rural country enrollment if HMOs predominantly developed in urban areas and




                                             15
then expanded to adjacent rural areas. Since HMO development was more of an urban than

rural phenomena in the mid- to late- 1980s, the 1985 enrollment measures probably reflect

HMO development reasonably well.

         County level market measures come from the Area Resource File (Bureau of Health

Professions, 1999). State level wage data come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

Occupational Employment Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001). State HMO

regulations come from reports compiled by Aspen Publishers (Aspen System Corporation

1985-1994; Aspen System Corporation 1988-1994; Aspen Systems Corporation 1996; Levy

1999).

         Health System Areas (HSA) measures were constructed by first measuring HMO

enrollment, Area Resource File characteristics, and wage data at the county level. Then,

HSA-level measures were constructed as weighted averages of all counties in the HSA, with

the weights being the proportions of the HSA’s total HMO enrollment in each county.

County data were aggregated into HSAs using a crosswalk between counties and HSAs.

         We supplement the hospital and HMO information with data from the Area

Resource File (ARF). For each year, the ARF has information on the number of primary

care physicians, median per-capita income, unemployment rate, population of the HSA,

and percent of the population over 65 years of age. We also acquired information on state

hospital certificate of need (CON) regulations from the American Health Planning

Association.

         We limit our sample to HSAs with a population of more than 50,000 and more

than one hospital 1990. We dropped the monopoly HSAs as those areas, by definition,




                                           16
cannot experience a horizontal consolidation (unless there is entry and then

merger/system formation – a very unlikely possibility).14

         Table 1 lists the dependent and explanatory variables as well as the instruments in

the analysis and the un-weighted means and standard deviations of these variables.

Histograms of the ∆HHI and ∆MHHI are graphed in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively. The

distribution of ∆HHI looks roughly symmetric while the distribution of ∆MHHI is

essentially censored at zero.

         Several patterns in Table 1 are noteworthy. As mentioned earlier, we see a large

increase in hospital concentration and HMO penetration during the 1990s. Approximately

40% of all HSAs experienced a horizontal hospital merger. We also observe large

declines in inpatient days per capita (20%) and the number of beds per capita (17%) over

this 10-year period. In some ancillary analysis we have performed, the decline in

inpatient days and beds per capita appears unrelated to HMO penetration.15

Results

         Figure 3 graphs the number of horizontal hospital mergers, acquisitions and

system expansions, total number (both horizontal and across HSAs) of hospital mergers,

acquisitions and system expansions, and the number of hospital failures over time for our

sample HSAs. Several features of the graph are of interest. First, in the early 1990s there

was an increase in both the number of horizontal ownership changes and across-market

ownership changes with the peak occurring in the mid-1990s. The height of the

merger/system activity occurred two years before the peak of HMO penetration. Second,

14
   In order to check the robustness of our findings, we have also performed the analysis limiting the sample
to those HSAs with less than 11 hospitals. Again, the qualitative results using this sample are identical to
those we present here. These results are available from the authors upon request.

horizontal ownership changes account for approximately 40% of all ownership changes.

Third, there is a modest inverse relationship between the number of hospital

consolidations and the number of hospital failures.

       Tables 2, 3 and 4 presents two sets of coefficient results for the three dependent

variables--∆HHI, ∆MHHI and the market consolidation indicator, respectively. For each

dependent variable the first set of results presents the coefficient estimates treating HMO

penetration as exogenous. The second set of results is the instrumental variable

coefficient estimates. For each estimation method we present estimates from two

specifications. The first set of coefficient estimates is from a specification that includes

both the change in HMO penetration and the level of HMO penetration in 1990 as well as

all of the control variables. The second set of estimates is from a specification that

includes just the change in HMO penetration and all of the control variables. This

specification tests the sensitivity of the results by imposing the restriction that β is time-

invariant.

       Table 2 presents the coefficient estimates The OLS estimated coefficient on

∆HMO Penetration is negative, small in magnitude and insignificant at traditional levels

of confidence in both columns (1) and (2) of Table 2. That is, an increase in HMO

penetration is associated with a decrease in measured hospital competition. In column (1)

the coefficient on the level of HMO penetration in 1990 is small, positive and imprecisely

estimated. The coefficient estimates are very similar between column (1) and (2) and the

likelihood ratio and t-test do not reject the hypothesis that β is time invariant.

       The IV estimates of the HMO penetration coefficients are also negative and larger

in magnitude. The coefficient on ∆HMO Penetration in both columns (3) and (4) are just



                                              18
significant at the 5% level. That is, there appears to be an inverse relationship between

hospital concentration and HMO penetration. The coefficient on HMO Penetration in

1990 in column (3) is positive but insignificant. The IV estimates do not suggest that β

varies over time.

       Table 3 presents the coefficient estimates with ∆MHHI as the dependent variable.

As ∆MHHI is censored, we estimate the parameters using Tobit and IV-Tobit procedures.

Columns (1) and (2) present the maximum likelihood Tobit estimates. The coefficients on

∆HMO Penetration in both regressions are negative, small in magnitude and insignificant

at traditional levels of confidence. The coefficient on HMO Penetration in 1990 is

positive, small in magnitude and insignificant.

       The IV estimates are presented in columns (3) and (4) of Table 3. The coefficient

estimates on ∆HMO Penetration are again negative, large in magnitude and flirt with

significance at the 5% level of confidence. That is, there is modest evidence that an

increase in HMO penetration actually reduced consolidation activity. The coefficient on

HMO Penetration in column (3) is positive and is imprecisely estimated.

       Table 4 presents the coefficient results with the consolidation indicator as the

dependent variable. The pattern of the coefficients is similar in the Probit and IV-Probit

regressions. The coefficient on ∆HMO Penetration is negative and insignificant in all

four regressions. The coefficient on HMO Penetration is positive and insignificant in

columns (1) and (3). These results in combination with the results in Table 3 suggest that

an increase in HMO penetration did not affect the likelihood of a consolidation but,




                                            19
conditional on a consolidation occurring, reduced the average size of the consolidating

parties.16

           While the rise in HMO penetration does not seem to explain hospital

consolidation, the presence of excess capacity is strongly correlated with hospital

consolidation due to merger. The t-statistics on Hospitals Per Capita range from 2.60 to

4.39 in the ∆MHHI and hospital consolidation indicator regression. A one standard

deviation increase in beds per capita (1.84) is associated with a non-trivial .048 increase

in hospital concentration due to consolidation.

           Several other variables are significantly associated with consolidation activity.

The parameter estimates in all four regressions indicated that increases in the percent of

the population in poverty and increases in the population level in 1990 are associated

with increases in consolidation activity. Finally, an increase in the proportion of hospitals

that are for-profit is associated with an increased likelihood of a consolidation.

Robustness

           We estimated the parameters using different time frames (1990 to 1995, 1995 to

2000, and 1990 to 1998). The parameter estimates from these regressions lead to the

same conclusions as those presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4. We also estimated the

parameters on several different samples that were split by initial population size (split at

500,000 and 800,000) and HMO penetration (split at 5% and 10%) and again we found

no significant relationship between HMO penetration and hospital consolidations in any

of those samples. Finally, we also estimated the parameters weighting the observations by




16
     Two-stage estimation supports this conclusion.


                                                      20
the HSA population and the implications of the coefficients are not meaningfully

different.

Explaining the Difference between Our Estimates and DSW

        There are several possible reasons why our results differ from DSW. First, we

difference both our left-hand and right-hand variables of interest while DSW do not

difference their measure of HMO penetration. Second, DSW use a more inclusive

measure of managed care but one that may have more measurement error. Third, they

examine a different time frame, 1981 to 1994. Fourth, they use the MSA as the unit of

analysis. Fifth, they limit their analysis to the largest 68 MSAs with population over

800,000.

        In order to determine the source of our differing conclusions we first attempt to

replicate their results with our data. We use the largest 68 MSAs and data from 1985 to

1994. We assumed that the final observed penetration level as a measure of penetration,

assuming that initial penetration was zero. We use a similar, but not identical, set of

control variables and instruments.17

        Table A2 in the appendix presents the results of our attempts to replicate DSW. In

column (1) we present the coefficient estimates of this effort. As in DSW, the coefficient

on managed care penetration is positive and significant. In column (2) we estimate the

same equation but replace the level of managed care penetration with the change in the

managed care penetration. The coefficient on the managed care variable declines and

becomes insignificant. However, the power of the instruments declines substantially

raising the possibility of small sample bias. Nevertheless, inferences regarding the impact

17
  DSW use the percent of workforce self-employed and percentage of workforce employed in large firms
in 1992 as instruments. We use the percentage of firms in each size category in 1992 and 1985 as
instruments.


                                                21
of managed care on hospital concentration are sensitive to the decision to difference the

variable of interest.

           In columns (3) and (4) of Table A2 we estimate the parameters as in columns (1)

and (2) on the same sample, but using OLS. The parameter estimates in column (3) are

very close to the estimates in column (1). However, the OLS estimates of the impact of

the differenced managed care variable are essentially zero. In the last two columns of

Table A2, we estimate the same specification as in the first two columns but use a more

inclusive sample selection rule. We include all MSAs with a population greater than

500,000. Both coefficients on managed care population are insignificant in this sample.

           Our estimates suggest that the results in DSW are sensitive to the decisions not to

difference the managed care variable, the sample selection criteria and the time period

they studied. While these findings are very suggestive, they are not conclusive as the data

we use are not identical to DSW.

Discussion

           In 1996, the two hospitals in Great Falls, MT, merged to form a “monopoly”

hospital.18 According to the State of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic

Research, “Managed care in Montana is virtually nonexistent, with recent data showing a

miniscule number of people covered by health maintenance organizations.”19 That is, the

anecdotal evidence from Great Falls suggests that managed care played no role in causing

the large increase in hospital concentration. The parties to the merger argued that there

was not enough demand for inpatient services to support two acute care hospitals in Great




18
     The two merging hospitals were Columbus Hospital and Montana Deaconess Medical Center.

                                                  22
Falls.20 The data support this contention. In 1990, Great Falls had 7.56 beds per 1,000—

the average in our sample is 3.85.

           At the other end of the urban spectrum is Philadelphia. The Philadelphia

metropolitan area (five counties in southeast Pennsylvania, 3 in New Jersey and 3 in

Delaware) contained 65 hospitals, five of which were academic medical centers and three

of which were children’s hospitals. Philadelphia experienced a large growth in HMO

penetration through the 1990s. In 1990, the HMO penetration was approximately 16%.

By 2000, HMO penetration had risen to 53%. However, hospital HHI only increased a

modest .023.

           Furthermore, most of the increase in concentration in Philadelphia is unrelated to

HMO penetration. The HHI increase is attributable, in large part, to the entry into the

market by the Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Health Educational and Research Foundation

(AHERF). AHERF acquired the poorest-performing academic medical center. AHERF’s

entry touched off a competitive rivalry among Philadelphia’s academic medical centers to

build bigger and bigger hospital systems. AHERF’s acquisition of one of the three

pediatric hospitals similarly touched off intense competitive strategies by hospitals to

develop pediatric referral networks with community hospitals and physicians. (Burns, et

al., 1997; Burns et al., 2000).

           These two accounts of the evolution of hospital market structure from very

different health care markets are consistent with our empirical findings. That is, the ‘lore’

that the hospital consolidation wave of the 1990s was caused by hospitals responding to

the managed care revolution is not consistent with the data.

        Our work raises an important and yet to be answered question: what really caused

the horizontal hospital merger wave? Our results hint at a possible answer. The

coefficient on Beds Per Capita is positive, large and significant in the all specifications in

Table 3 and 4. This result is consistent with two possible and not mutually exclusive

explanations. First, reduction of bed capacity is a public good (from the hospital’s

perspective) and consolidation may help hospitals internalize this externality. Second,

hospitals located in markets in which there is higher bed capacity likely are in worse

financial condition than their counterparts in under-bedded areas. Mergers may be the

best alternative to closing the facility.

Conclusions

        It is widely believed that rise of managed care caused the hospital consolidation

wave of the 1990s. In this study we test this proposition using data on managed care

penetration and hospital consolidation from 1990 to 2000. Our results suggest that the

common wisdom is false—managed care penetration is not significantly related to

hospital consolidation. This finding is robust to different specifications, time frames and

sample selection criteria. This finding raises an obvious question: if managed care did not

cause hospital consolidation—what did?
