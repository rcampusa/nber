     This paper identifies three major riods: 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and

1965—1978. In contrast to the middle period, the extreme periods are

characterized by rapid growth in private employment and hours worked; because

growth in private productivity increases by less, measured labor productivity

growth falls compared to the middle period. However this fall reflects a

substantial substitution of quantity for quality in labor force growth: after

private employment and hours are adjusted for age, sex, immigration, and

education, no difference is observed among the average quality—adjusted labor

productivity growth rates. Substantial variation in these growth rates

remains within the 1929—1965 and 1965—1978 periods. Slow quality—adjusted

labor productivity growth during 1929—1948 is just offset by unusually rapid

growth during 1948—1965; these variations are attributed to the near cessation

of investment during the Depression and World War II and subsequent recovery

of the capital—labor ratio. Thus no substantial variations in total factor

productivity growth or technical progress is found. Variations in

productivity growth within 1965—1978 are explained by price—control induced

biases in reported deflated output. Correction of these biases results in

equal quality—adjusted labor productivity growth in 1965—1973 and 1973—1978.

A substantial program of future research is proposed. A data appendix is

included.

     The decline in American productivity has come to rival inflation as a

major economic issue for public policy. Indeed something akin to panic has

followed reports that labor productivity growth has declined from an average

annual rate of 2.6 percent over 1948—1965 to 2.0 percent over 1965—1973 to 0.9

percent from 1973 to 1978.1 This paper shows that the productivity panic is

based upon statistical myopia and that a careful analysis within the

perspective of the entire twentieth century discloses no substantial variation

in what is variously described as growth in total factor productivity or

technical progress.

     The argument is made in two parts. First, three major subperiods are

identified: 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and 1965—1978. It is noted first that the

early and late periods are very similar to each other and are characterized,

in comparison with the middle period, by rapid growth in labor force and a

less than equal increase in growth in real output so that measured labor

productivity falls. This picture changes dramatically when allowances are

made for age, sex, education, and immigration to obtain a quality—adjusted

labor force. The differential between the growth rates of output and quality

adjusted hours worked is essentially identical across the three periods. Thus

simple demographic adjustments eliminate any secular decline in technical

progress.
                                      2




    The second part of the argument focuses on variations in productivity

growth trends within the middle and later periods. It is shown that very slow

growth in the capital—labor ratio from 1929 to 1948 accounts for very slow

labor productivity growth during that sub—period as well as very rapid growth

during 1948—1965. That is, the very rapid growth of 1948—1965 resulted from

our poverty in 1948 and did not reflect desirable economic conditions. The

more rapid productivity growth in 1965—1973 as compared to 1973—1978 is fully

explicable by measurement -error due to underreporting of price increases and

hence overreporting of output increases due to Nixon's price control

program. It is of particular interest that the oil price increases of 1973—

1974 do not appear to have played a major role in slowing productivity growth.

     The analysis was made possible by the development of a historical data

base on productivity, labor force, and employment reported elsewhere.2

Extracts of the relevant data are contained in a data appendix.

                     I. Analysis of Longer—Period Trends



     The broad trends of the twentieth century are sununarized in Table 1 for

private employment (PE), average and total private hours worked (AHWP and

THWP, respectively), gross private product (GPP), and private hourly and

employee productivity (GPP/THWP and GPP/PE, respectively).3 Darby (1982b)

notes the periods 1900—1929 and 1965—1978 were characterized by rapid

employment growth with immigration the relatively dominant factor in the early

period and the baby—boom new entrants relatively more important in the recent

period. The intermediate period 1929—1965 was marked by both tight limitation

on immigration and a low rate of natural increase.4 The three major periods

were thus differentiated both by changes in immigration laws and by the post-

war baby—boom's coming of age. Since the rate of decline in average hours

worked was nearly constant, the changes in employment growth were the dominant

factor determining variation in growth in total hours.

     Each of the major periods has been divided roughly in half for later

analysis.5 At least for 1929—1965 and 1965—1978, the growth rate of private

employment and total private hours is approximately the same in each subperiod

as the mean for the respective major period. Thus each of these periods is

homogeneous in terms of labor developments. The unevenness of immigration and

estimated average—hours—worked growth in the first 29 years of the century

makes the period 1900—1929 appear rather less homogeneous, but demographic

adjustments discussed below eliminate most of the differences between the

subperiods.

     Focusing on the major periods in Table 1, we note that 1965—1978 is

rather similar to 1900—1929 not only in employment and hours growth but also

in output and productivity growth. Compared to 1929—1965, total hours growth
                                        4



is 1.0 to 1.2 percent higher in the earlier and later periods while GPP growth

is only 0.4 to 0.5 percent higher. Thus hourly productivity growth is

recorded as 0.5 to 0.7 percent lower in 1900—1929 and 1965—1978 as compared to

1929—1965. Correspondingly, growth in private output per person employed is

0.4 to 0.6 lower in the extreme periods than in the middle period. Two

(possibly   complementary) hypotheses provide possible explanations of the more

rapid productivity growth in the middle period: (1) The hours and employment

growth—rate declines in the middle period may be overstated due to failure to

adjust for demographic changes, especially immigration and the baby boom. (2)

Slower labor growth results in increased steady—state values of the capital—

labor and output—labor ratios in the standard closed—economy neoclassical

growth model. These hypotheses are examined in turn.



Demographics Hypothesis

     Measures of private hours do not adjust for differences in human capital

although the idea that an hour is an hour is as falacious as the idea that a

1962 dollar equals a 1982 dollar. Although elaborate adjustments such as

Chinloy (1980) are precluded by limitations in the historical data, it is

possible to make approximate adjustments for observed differences in

productivity due to age, sex, education, and immigrant status.

     Let us first consider the adjustment for the age—sex composition of the

labor force. The private labor force estimates are divided into individual

cells by sex and "young" (Y, under 25) or "old" (0, over 24). Standardizing

on males over 24 and taking young males, young females, and old females as

less productive because of differences In human capital, we compute age—sex

adjusted private employment as
                                                5



(1) APE = PENO + a1PE + a2PEFY + a3PEFQ



where the subscripts M and F indicate sex. The a's are chosen to reflect

differences in average hourly earnings. Using data in Denison (1979, p. 33),

this suggests a of 0.53 to 0.50,            of 0.43 to 0.41, and a3 of 0.56 to
                                       a2
0.57.6 We use 0.515, 0.42, and 0.565 as
                                                    a1, a2, and a3, respectively.
      New immigrants to the United States on average earn substantially less

than native—born Americans.7 In part this reflects permanent differences in

human capital endowments, but much of the difference is eliminated over time

as the immigrants become acculturated. Since immigration is most important in

the earlier period, Francine Blau's (1980) estimates based on 1909 data are

used to adjust the foreign—born to native—born equivalents by the following

formulas .8



                                  z
(2)   PE =        Na + (1.01076) M(0•75.3)PEMIa

where PEsIa and PESNa are the (unadjusted) private employment of foreign born

(I) and native—born (N) individuals of sex s and age—group a and where Z i.

the average years since entry of foreign—born workers of sex s. The average

years since entry was estimated according to the recursive formula



(4) Z5 =      (0.5) .- +   (Z5,_1 + k) (1 —



where I is the inflow of (sex s) immigrants over the preceding year,                is

the corresponding foreign—born population, and k5 is a number between 0 and 1
                                        6



to allow for disproportionate frequency of death and retirement among the less

recent foreign—born. This formula says that the (mid—year) average years

since entry is a weighted average ——   weights      and 1 —   (I/P) — of
0.5 year for those arriving in the last twelve months and Z1 + k5 for those

previously arrived and remaining in the labor force. Benchmarks for 1909 and

1970 were computed from the Immigration Commission data for 1909 and from 1970

Census data.'° These benchmarks implied kM kF      0.603. The estimated

values of Z are reported in the data appendix. Since the adjustments for

years since migration of the foreign—born were made before the adjustment for

age and sex described in equation (1), the variable APE is in fact adjusted

for all these factors.

     The final demographic factor believed to be important in determining the

human capital content of the labor force is education. It is assumed that

human capital is increased by 7 percent per year of education," so that

quality—adjusted private employment is



(5) QAPE = (107)EAPE



The education variable E is measured by the median school years completed by

those 25 years and over.'2

     Table 2 indicates the relative importance of the various demographic

factors across the period by breaking the difference between unadjusted and

quality—adjusted private—employment growth rates into age—sex, immigration,

and education components.'3 Table 3 displays the differential effects in the

three major periods by subtracting the average 1900—1978 value of each

adjustment from the value of the adjustment for the period. For example,

failure to adjust for age and sex in the productivity measures in Table 1
                                        7




resulted in understating 1965—1978 productivity growth by —0.32 — (—0.01) =

—0.31 percent per annum relative to 1929—1965. Overall, the productivity

growth differential from 1929—1965 was overstated by 0.35 — (—0.27) =    0.62
percent per annum for 1900—1929 and by 0.35 — (—0.37) = 0.72 for 1965—1978.

     Table 4 illustrates that after private employment is adjusted for these

demographic factors, both the hourly and employee productivity measures show

no significant variation across the major periods. In particular there is no

indication of a secular productivity slowdown in 1965—1978 versus 1929—1965 or

indeed the entire twentieth century. Furthermore, as noted above, we have

used the hours measure most favorable to finding such a slowdown; the data on

average private hours paid in fact decelerate in 1965—1978 which would imply a

small (0.3 percent per annum) increase in hourly productivity growth.'4



Capital—Deepening Hypothesis

     Given the just—demonstrated ability of demographic adjustments to explain

the measured secular variations in productivity growth, it smacks of pedantic

digression to spend any time on the capital—deepening hypothesis ——

particularly   so because the latter will prove at odds with the data.

Nonetheless a little consideration is due this hypothesis since its failure

suggests interesting areas for future research.

     The capital—deepening argument can be expressed in terms of the simple

neoclassical growth model. Suppose that investment (k) is determined by

saving to be a constant fraction a of output y:



(6) k=ay
                                      8




Suppose that output is determined by the linear homogeneous production

function



(7) y =    f(k,i)

where Labor is measured in efficiency units so that the given constant growth

rate of labor i/i is the sum of the growth rates of total hours and of the

average quality of those hours.'5 It is well known that in steady—state

equilibrium the growth rates of output and capital equal     with   fixed ratios

k/p. and y/i.16

     The capital—deepening argument runs as follows: The growth rate of labor

in efficiency units (i.e., quality—adjusted) was about 0.4 percent per annum

lower from 1929—1965 than before or after. The lower line of Figure 1

illustrates such a protracted slowdown in labor growth. During this

intermediate period, the steady—state values of the k/i and hence yip. ratios

will rise yielding the jump in steady—state output Y at 1929 and

corresponding fall at 1965. Figure 2 illustrates the predicted effect on

actual output assuming that we were initially in steady—state equilibrium. In

the middle period the actual growth rate of output is reduced by the slower

steady—state growth rate of labor, but this is partially offset by the

transitional effect of moving up to the higher ratio of yip.. Thus the growth

rate of productivity would be increased in the middle period as compared to

the earlier period. A transitional effect would be operating in the opposite

direction to reduce productivity growth in the post—1965 period.

     Despite its elegance, I believe that the capital—deepening hypothesis Is

not a satisfactory explanation for the productivity trends at issue. Besides

the fact that there are no unexplained secular increases in quality—adjusted
                                      9




productivity growth during 1929—1965, there is no evidence of an increase in

the ratio of capital to output. In fact, over this period GPP grew at an

average rate of 3.0% while corporate capital input as measured by Christensen

and Jorgenson (1978, p. 35) grew by only 2.2%. As we shall see in Section II,

there are reasons to suspect that this may be an underestimate of capital

growth, but capital deepening still seems absent from the period.

     An intriguing hypothesis for future research would be that the United

States should not be viewed as a closed economy, as in the previous

neoclassical growth analysis, but rather as a part of a world capital

market. Conditions of saving and labor growth in this larger market would

then control the evolution of the capital—labor ratio in America largely

independently of fluctuations in domestic labor growth. Unfortunately,

examination of international data must be left to the future.



Conclusions on Longer—Period Trends

     Changes in immigration laws and the entry of the baby—boom divide the

twentieth century into three maJor periods: before 1929, 1929—1965, and after

1965. From the point of view of growth in employment and hours, each major

period seems reasonably consistent, but the middle period is characterized by

considerably lower growth than either of the exterior periods. Since the

growth rate of gross private product declines by less than the decline in

hours growth in the middle period, measured productivity growth rises. Such a

pattern is consistent with the implications of the neoclassical growth model,

but no evidence of the corresponding sharp increase in the capital input is

found. In contrast, it was shown that the demographic factors of age, sex,

immigration, and education explain all of the measured secular variation in

hourly productivity growth.17 Thus, it appears that there is no substantial
                                      10



variation in trend private productivity growth over the twentieth century to

be explained by variations in regulation growth, oil prices, the failure of

American management, labor, or any of the other popular whipping boys. So far

as broad trends go, the U.S. productivity slowdown appears to be a case of

statistical myopia.

     Demographic adjustments also appear to explain observed variations in

private employee productivity growth within the period 1900—1929. The hourly

productivity growth measure shows some residual variation (1.43% for 1900—1916

versus 1.96% for 1916—1929), but this appears to be related to anomolous

growth In average hours. It Is left for economic historians to unravel

whether the hourly productivity measure reflects a real phenomenon or simply

measurement error.

     Much more substantial variations in hourly and employee productivity

growth are reported in Table 4 within the periods 1929—1965 and 1965—1978.

For example, quality—adjusted hourly productivity growth is reported as 1.0,

2.1, 2.0, and 0.9 percent per annum for 1929—1948, 1948—1965, 1965—1973, and

1973—1978, respectively. It is the task of Section II to explain this

residual variaton.
                                       11




                    II. Analysis of Intra—Period Variations



     Section I argues that the quality—adjusted hourly productivity growth

rate has had a constant secular value of 1.60 percent per annum throughout the

twentieth century. Then how are we to explain the fact that this growth rate

exceeded 2.0 percent per annum from 1948—1973 and was only 0.9 percent from

1973—1978? In this section it is first shown that the rapid 1948—1965 growth

is explained by the recovery of the capital—labor ratio from its abnormally

low level at the end of World War II and the Great Depression. That Is, the

rapid (slow) growth in labor productivity during 1948—1965 (1929—1948) is due

to abnormal movements in the capital stock relative to labor and output and

therfore is not reflected in total factor productivity growth or technical

progress. Next it is demonstrated that the reported variations within the

1965—1978 appear to be the result of biases in measured output due to evasion

of the 1971—1974 price controls. Correction of these biases eliminates any

tendency for productivity growth to slow in 1973—1978 or to be above 1.6

percent per annum in 1965—1973.



The 1929—1965 Period

     The slow growth in 1929—1948 and rapid catch—up growth in 1948—1965 is

attributed here to the very low ratio of investment to output during the Great

Depression and World War II. The idea is that in 1948 we were quite poor in

the sense of a low capital—labor ratio and it took until around 1965 to

recover to the steady—state capital—labor and output—labor ratios as

illustrated in Figure 3.

     An implication of the approximately equal quality—adjusted hourly

productivity growth rates for 1900—1929, 1929—1965, and 1965—1978 is that the
                                           12



output—labor ratio is approximately the same in 1900, 1929, 1965, and 1978

after allowing for a constant rate of labor—augmenting technical progress.'8

Therefore, if capital growth explains the observed variation of output growth

within the period, it follows that there was no significant intra—period

variation in technical progress (total factor productivity growth).

     A simple and usually serviceable characterization of the aggregate

production function is the Cobb—Douglas form



(8) y =    eTtk
where r is the rate of total factor productivity growth and 2. is now measured

(quality—adjusted) labor input. This can equivalently be written in

logarithmic form as




(9) log y =     log k + (l_)log(Le1t)



where -y   t/(l—$) is the constant rate of labor—augmenting technical

progress. Subtracting log 2. from both sides of equation (9) and using r for

the continuously compounded growth rate operator, we have



(10) r(y/L) =   -y   + 8[rk — (rz-F-y')]



That is, the growth rate of labor productivity equals the rate of technical
progress plus the product of capital's share and the difference between the

capital and the adjusted labor growth rates.

     The capital growth rate has been estimated as about 0.6 and 4.0 percent

per annum for 1929—1948 and 1948—1965, respectively.19 Equation (10) is used
                                       13




to predict the observed quality—adjusted labor productivity growth rate for a

capital share of 1/4 as well as alternative value of 0.2 and 0.3. Table 5

reports the results which indicate that the actual and predicted growth ratio

of quality—adjusted hourly and employee productivity correspond quite closely

for 1929—1948. Thus the near cessation of investment during the Depression

and World War II nicely explains the observed slowdown in productivity

growth. Since the output—labor ratio has already been shown to return to its

trend value by 1965, the solution seems to be complete.

     Unfortunately, the second line of each part of Table 5 indicates that the

predicted productivity growth falls short of actual growth by 0.2 or 0.3

percent per annum. It may be that this unexplained growth ref lects a real

temporary increase in technological progress that offsets an unusual fall in

the capital—output ratio of some 24 percent over 1929_1965,20 but a simpler

and economic explanation is also possible, Quite possibly the fault lies in

the capital data themselves: The quantum leap in tax rates during World War

II provides an incentive to write off as current expense as much capital

formation as possible; thus gross investment and capital growth could be

systematically understated in the postwar period.2' Suppose that a consistent

data series would in fact show no decline in the capital—output ratio. This

would imply that the true capital growth rate over 1948—1965 is 5.6 percent

per annum.22 In order for this to be the case, firms would have had to alter

their accounting practices so that reported net investment was reduced

relative to earlier practices by almost 24 percent. Given the large

incentives, this magnitude does not appear unreasonable, but further research

is clearly indicated.23 In any case, the lower halves of each part of Table 5

indicates that a rather smaller capital growth rate would be sufficient to

eliminate any apparent 1948—1965 rise in total factor productivity growth.
                                       14



      In summary, measured capital growth variations can explain all of the

1929—1948 slowdown in quality—adjusted labor productivity growth and a large

part of the 1948—1965 increase in that growth relative to trend. The

remaining 0.2 to 0.3 percent excess growth in 1948—1965 can be attributed

either to an unexplained temporary increase in total factor productivity

growth or to changes in net investment reporting in response to increased

income taxes.



The 1965—1978 Period

      It is not widely recognized that the main problem with productivity

growth in 1973—1978 is concentrated in the seven quarters 1973 II through 1974

IV:

       The productivity decline in 1973—74 was particularly striking.
       Labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell in every
       quarter from the second quarter of 1973 to the fourth quarter of
       1974, dropping a total of 4.2 percent in a 7—quarter period. On
       the basis of the usual relati.onship between fluctuations in
       productivity and fluctuations in output, no more than 1 percentage
       point of that decline could be attributed to the sharp recession
       during the period. The additional drop of 3.2 percentage points
       accounts for ich of the difference between the expected 2 percent
       annual growth rate between 1973 and 1977 and the 0.9 percent rate
       that actually occurred.24

This section will demonstrate not only that the progressive relaxation and

ultimate removal of general price controls during 1973—1974 can fully account

for this anomolous excess productivity decline of 3.2 percent but also that

the imposition of these controls during 1971 II through 1973 I can account for

the peculiarly rapid productivity growth observed during those quarters.25

This rapid productivity growth permits us to reject the popular oil—price

hypothesis in favor of the price control hypothesis.

      Bef ore examining the evidence, it is useful to sketch these two competing

hypotheses: The oil—price hypothesis as developed by such authors as Rasche
                                        15




and Tatom (1977, 1981) asserts that higher oil prices will significantly lower

the equilibrium level of output consistent with a given level of labor and

capital and will further induce a fall over time in the level of capital. The

price—control hypothesis as developed in Darby (1976a, 1976b) asserts that

measured real output was progressively overstated (and price understated) from

their imposition in 1971 III through 1973 I and that this overstatement was

progressively eliminated under Phase III and decontrol (1973 11—1974 III).

Sung Hee Jwa (1982) has extended Darby's basic model by a formal analysis of

firm and industry equilibrium. Darby (1982a) examines the oil—price and

price—control hypotheses in detail using both U.S. and international data and

finds that the preponderance of evidence supports the price—control

hypothesis. This evidence will be supplemented below by directly estimating a

productivity growth equation. Additional empirical evidence is presented in

Appendix A.

     First we wish to test whether oil price, price controls, or both had a
significant   influence on productivity growth other than via any temporary

effects causing unemployment and employment to differ from their steady—state

values. Standard productivity equations have deflated values on both sides

inducing spurious correlation if the price control hypothesis is true.

Fortunately, a simple dynamic Okun's Law extended by other current and leading

labor—market indicators provides very respectable explanatory power without

potential spurious correlation. The basic equation used corresponds in right—

hand variables to equation (5) in Darby (1982a):



(11) 1og (yh) = a1 + a2TS + a3tu + a4ALR
                     +
                         a5log Et + a6tlog Ei ÷
                                           16



where          is the private—hours—paid definition of labor productivity,26 TSt

is a time shift dummy equal to 0 before 1965 and 1 otherwise,27 u is the

total unemployment rate, LRt is the layoff rate, and Et is employment in

manufacturing, mining, and construction. Note that the cyclical indicators

used in this equation are all based on counts of individuals and so not

subject to possible reporting biases (as are deflated series) under price

controls. The estimated equation for 1949 1—1980 IV is:28



(12) slog (y/L) = 0.0069 — 0.0022 TSt — 0.010
                       (7.55) (—1.73)         (—3.19)


                      —   0.001 ALRt + 0.026 log Et — 0.308 slog Et_l
                       (—0.37)       (0.28)             (—4.04)


         S.E.E. =   0.0071,      2 = 0.30,         D—W =   2.02



This equation does reasonably well at explaining quarterly fluctuations in

productivity growth, although only the current change in unemployment and the

lagged growth rate of employment are significant among the cyclical

indicators.

        To test the price control hypothesis, a simple quantitaitve variable was

formed: CDt grows linearly from 0 in 1971 II to 1 in 1973 I and then falls

linearly back to 0 in 1974 IV. The deflated dollar price of a barrel of

Venezuelan oil was used for the oil price               The following general equation

was estimated with up to a one year adjustment lag permitted for oil prices to

take effect:
                                             17




(13) slog (Yh) = a1 + a2TS + a3Au + a4E1LR + a5log Et



                      + a6Alog E1 + a7CD + Ea8.log P_1 +


Table 6 reports the results of various alternative hypothesis tests that might

be conducted. Line 1 pertains to equation (13) as stated while all the other

lines involve various zero constraints on a7,...,a11.29 We see that whenever

the price—control variable is included it is significant at the 5 percent

level or better. The oil variables, in contrast, are never significant except

for line 5 in which, with both the price—control variable and lagged growth in

oil prices forced out, current oil—price growth is significant at the 10

percent level on a one—tailed test.      I conclude that oil—price changes had no

significant effect on productivity growth. Note particularly that a major

Increase in real oil prices occurred between 1979 I and 1980 1, but no direct

effect was detectable.

     The final form of the regression is



(14) log(y/i) = 0.0069 — 0.0022 TS — 0.010             u —   0.000    LR
                    (7.88) (—1.81)           (—3.23)     (—0.24)


                    + 0.018 tlog E — 0.304 tlog Et_i + 0.04397 CDt
                     (0.20)           (—4.15)                (3.41)


      S.E.E. =   0.0068,      R2 =   0.36,        D—W = 2.14



     Consider the implications of this equation for the level of productivity

in the year 1973. The average value of CDt in 1973 is 0.7857 which, when

multiplied by 0.043997, implies that the logarithm of labor productivity in

1973 was overstated by 0.0343.30 This means that the 1965—1973 growth rates
                                      18



of private labor productivity are overstated by 3.43/8 = 0.43 percent per

annum and correspondingly that the 1973—1978 growth rates are understated by

3.43/5 = 0.69 percent per annum. Table 7 shows that applying this correction

to the quality—adjusted productivity growth rates of Section I completely

eliminates any evidence of a 1973—1978 productivity slowdown. Instead the

picture is one of remarkably stable productivity growth over the period 1965—

1978 after accounting for the 1973 measurement biases.

     It is of course true that price controls could have had real effects, but

these effects should have operated by changing unemployment and employment.

The estimated coefficient of ACD captures some additional impact which must

either measure output overstatement or some shift in the relationship of

output to labor inputs for a reason yet to be proposed in the literature. For

any yet skeptical reader, additional discussion and evidence is contained in

Appendix A.

                III. Conclusions and Areas for Future Research



     The results of this study can be clearly summarized by the use of two

figures. Figure 4 illustrates the logarithm of hourly productivity measured

in the standard way by GPP/THWP. It is difficult if not impossible to discern

any overall trend although 1900—1929 and 1929—1948 might be identified as

periods of slow growth followed by rapid growth during 1948—1965 and then

slowing growth over 1965—1973 and 1973—1978. The logarithm of quality—

adjusted hourly productivity (GPP/QATHWP) is plotted in Figure 5. Here a

constant trend line dominates the data except during the Depression—Korean War

era of slow investment and subsequent rapid recovery. With demographic

factors accounted for, the anomolous productivity gains in 1972 and 1973

(which we attribute to measurement biases) stick out like the proverbial sore

thumb.

     The major conclusion to be drawn is that there have been no substantial

variations in trend growth rates of private labor productivity since 1900 if

reasonable adjustments are made for the effects of demographic trends on the

average quality of labor. Even if one were to ignore the effects of

demographic shifts, the measured growth rates of productivity, total private

hours, and private employment have essentially the same values in 1900—1929 as

in 1965—1978 so that panic may   be   premature.

     The slow labor productivity growth in 1929—1948 can be explained by the

near cessation of capital formation, but measured increases in capital growth

in 1948—1965 are too small to fully account for the catch—up of labor

productivity. Further research is required to determine whether this is due

to problems in the measurement of capital or to other yet undiscovered

factors. The slowdown in productivity growth within the period 1965—1978 can
                                      20



be readily explained by measurement biases induced by evasion of price

controls. Increased oil prices do not play a significant role.

     Taken as a whole, the evidence does not support the view that there has

been a substantial, inexplicable decline in total factor productivity growth

since 1965 and especially since 1973. Instead the evidence presented here

indicates that there has been a surprisingly stable growth rate of total

factor productivity throughout the twentieth century. Only in 1948—1965 is

there any evidence of a substantial (0.2 to 0.3 percent per annum) temporary

increase in total factor productivity growth and there are good economic

reasons to suspect that this may be an artifact of tax—induced changes in

accounting procedures.

    A considerable program for future research which has been noted in

previous sections can be briefly summarized here: (1) An interesting issue

for economic historians is whether the intra—period inconsistency between

hourly and employee productivity growth for 1900—1929 reflects a real

phenomenon or indicates a measurement problem in the data on average hours

worked. (2) Certainly improvements can be made to the demographic adjustments

reported here. Doubtless others will test these results by doing so. (3) The

failure of the closed—economy neoclassical growth model suggests an

(industrialized) world linked by capital flows which are quite responsive in

the long—run. So like analysis of other economies could similarly explain

their postwar labor productivity recoveries and slowdowns. It further

suggests investment incentives may be more effective than saving incentives as

means of increasing domestic capital stock. (4) In light of the discrepancy

between full recovery in the output—labor ratio and incomplete recovery in the

capital—labor ratio, a reexamination of the consistency of existing estimates

of net investment and the capital stock is in order. (5) The potential
                                      21




importance of price—control induced biases in deflated (and deflator) data

during the 1971—1974 period is once again demonstrated. Further evidence is

called for on this issue, but the time has come to reexamine various claims

for effects of oil—price and other variables which may serve as a proxy for

these reporting biases.

     One must conclude with a warning note: The fact that factors such as

regulation, governmental size, oil prices, management practices, educational

quality, moral fiber, and the like have not been required to fully explain

twentieth century variations in labor productivity does not imply that they

have been unimportant. Any or all of them may have been quite important in

determining the trend value of total factor productivity growth. Nonetheless

in the aggregate their impact has caused quality—adjusted total factor

productivity growth to evolve as if following a random walk with constant

drift and small variance. For this type of process the average growth rate of

total factor productivity growth converges over considerable periods to the

constant drift.

                                  APPENDIX A

      ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND EVIDENCE ON THE PRICE—CONTROL HYPOTHESIS



     This Appendix provides discussion and evidence on the price—control

hypothesis supplementary to that contained in Darby (1976a, 1976b, 1982a) and

in the main text of this paper.

     There are three popular models of the effects of Nixon's Economic

Stabilization Program (ESP): The first, used as the basic economic support

for the program, argued that sticky expectations and nominal contracts would

delay adjustment to a new lower, noninflationary equilibrium. The ES?, the

argument goes, would accelerate the adjustment process and minimize the

transitional increase in unemployment. The second view, associated with Barro

and Grossman (1974) and Evans (1980), argues that general price controls

reduce real output and inflation by inducing increased consumption of

leisure. The third view, which I have proposed, argues that the ES? was

largely window—dressing and was easily evaded by minor covert quality

depreciation both n physical products and services and in the terms on which

they were sold.

     Needless to say, these views are not mutually exclusive. For example,

the ES? most probably reduced the unemployment associated with the existing

macroeconomic conditions so that true output Increased while reported output

increased even more due to covert quality depreciaiton not captured in the

official price indices. For the analysis of productivity growth, we are

interested in the reporting effects and of the real effects.31

     It may be useful to look more closely at how these reporting effects

could occur. Recall that the ES? established price controls relative to the

base—period price of each product produced by each firm. New, higher quality
                                          23



products could be introduced at higher prices reflecting their higher costs.

During Phases 1 and 2 (August 1971—January 1973) the controlled prices

generally fell relative to the prices which otherwise would have prevailed.

This provided an increasing incentive to make covert quality depreciations in

existing goods and to claim spurious quality appreciatons in new goods. Or to

say the same thing, there was an increasing incentive to publicize every

quality improvement and to shade the quality of existing products. If firms

reacted to these incentives as we normally suppose, then those collecting data

for computing price indices would likely miss more quality depreciation and

record more quality appreciation than normal. Controls become progressively

less binding under the subsequent Phases III and IV ending de jure on April

30, 1974, with the expiration of legislative authority and de facto in the

third quarter with the expiration of certain pricing agreements negotiated in

exchange for early decontrol.32 So during this period firms had an incentive

to progressively restore their products to their nominal quality. To the

extent price data collectors missed the shading of quality during Phases I and

II, they should equally have missed Its restoratIon during the relaxation and

removal of controls.

     Before going any further, we must consider whether this story is

empirically plausible. Some economists, especially those responsible for

collecting the price data, have doubted that any significant quality shading

could have been missed. However, the price—control hypothesis does not

require any huge errors. The estimate in equation (13) of the missed quality

decrease —   or   better, of the decrease in the quality improvement which was

missed — only amounts to about 0.2 percent per month (2.5 percent per

annum). This magnitude is very small not only in absolute terms but also

relative to the supposed margin of error in quality adjustments.33 Missed
                                      24



quality change always imparts some bias to measured real GNP growth, but price

controls impart incentives which change the bias in predictable ways.

     Another possible objection is that firms shading quality would be caught

by the I.R.S.'s monitoring of the profit margin ceiling. But this is not the

case in a balanced inflation in which prices, costs, sales, and profits all

rise in proportion. Everyone can accurately report the dollar amounts of

revenues, costs, and profits since the profit margin ceiling was purely window

dressing absent any effective controls on (quality—adjusted) costs.   Thus

nominal value added and nominal GNP will be correctly computed; only its

division between real GNP and the deflator will be biased.

     The text and Darby (1982a) have already shown that misreporting under

price controls can explain the anomolous behavior of Okun's Law during the

price control period.34 Okun's Law should underpredict output growth from

1971 III through 1973 I when the growth is overreported and correspondingly

overpredict output growth during th& decontrol period. For 1971 II to 1974 LV

as a whole, Okun's Law predicts total growth in real GNP rather well.35

     Let us see what other evIdence can be offered in support of the reporting

hypothesis. A simple check on the hypothesis that the nominal GNP data will

be unaffected involves running a simple reduced—form regression explaining

nominal GNP (Y) growth by a distributed lag on nominal money (NiB) growth

and ACD:



(15) log Y = h0 + Eh11lo N1Bt. + h9ACD


The estimated regression can he summarized as
                                                   25


                              7
(16) ilog Y = 0.0088 + E h                  Alog M1B      — 0.0004 ICD
                                      1+1
                (3.53)        =o                          (—0.03)

       7
            h   =    0.8872
      i=0


      S.E.E. = 0.0073,        2 = 0.34,           D—W = 1.99,     PERIOD = 1961 1—1980 III



Thus controls do not appear to have any significant impact on nominal GNP.36

An analogous regression ccmfirms the hypothesized negative impact of controls

on the inflation rate as measured by the GNP deflator PD:37


                                  7
(17) Alog PD = —0.0010 + E k                 Alog M1B      — 0.0337 ACD
                                       1+1
                    (—0.40)    1=0                         (—3.19)

       7
       E k1 = 1.0685
      1=0


      S.E.E. = 0.0036,        R2 =     0.35,      D—W =   2.22,   PERIOD = 1961 1—1980 III



Thus regression analysIs of U.S. data on real GNP, nomInal GNP, and the GNP

deflator indicates that price controls had no effect on reported total nominal

spending, but only upon its division into prices and output. The fact that

real output and productivity growth appear to rise and fall relative to that

predicted by labor—market conditions strongly supports the reporting

hypothesis.

     Separate evidence in support of the reporting hypothesis is to be found

in comparisons of reported deflated GNP not with inputs but with alternative

measures of output. Terborgh (1979) has noted the anomolous behavior of

reported real GNP relative to the Federal Reserve index of manufacturing

production in the period 1971—1974. As noted by Terborgh, the FRB Index is
                                         26



based primarily on counts of physical units. Terborgh shows that although

normally the FRB index grows faster than real GNP, this is not true in 1971

and 1972. Furthermore measured real GNP falls sharply relative to the FRB

index in 1973, 1974, and 1975.38 A formal check on whether or not price

controls move measured real GNP compared to what would be expected from the

Index of Manufacturing Production (IMP) involves running the regression:




(18) tlog y = 0.0052     + 0.3239 tlog IMP + 0.0355 CD
                (9.21)    (16.72)              (3.05)


      S.E.E. = 0.0061,       =   0.71,   D—W    2.02,   PERIOD = 1948 11—1980111



Note that the coefficient on t1CD is some 0.009 smaller than that estimated in

the text for the productivity growth equation. Although the difference Is not

significant, it is to be expected since IMP includes some deflated as well as

physical unit series.39 It is proposed in future research to follow up these

very promising results by using the underlying individual data series on

physical units of homogeneous commodIties to construct an Independent estimate

of real GNP for analysis of recent productivity growth.

     In   summary, there is a considerable body of evidence that the uneven
productivity growth reported in 1965—1978 can be explained by reporting biases
in 1971—1974 and normal cyclical factors. Darby (1982a) showed that similar
adjustments   may be required in those countries which adopted programs modeled

on the ESP during 1971—1974. These results support the basic conclusion of

this paper: that there have been no substantial variations in secular U.S.

labor productivity growth after adjustment for changing demographic trends.

     *This research was begun with financial support received from the

U.C.L.A. Institute of Industrial Relations and the Foundation for Research in

Economics and Education. It has been completed as part of the National Bureau

of Economic Research's Project on Productivity and Industrial Change in the

World Economy. An earlier version was presented as the Goldwater Lecture at

the Arizona State University, September 24, 1982. The participants in the

U.C.L.A. and Berkeley Money Workshops, especially Roger Craine, Sebastian

Edwards, Dan Friedman, John Haltiwanger, Ed Learner, Axel Leijonhufvud, James

Pierce, Mark Plant, Ken Sokoloff, and Ezio Tarantelli, provided valuable

comments. Charles S. Morris, Elizabeth M. Landaw, and Frances R. Hammond

provided able research assistance. Any opinions expressed are those of the

author and not necessarily those of the funding organizations. This is not an

official publication of the N.B.E.R.

     i-Productivity trend growth rates are normally computed from high—

employment to high—employment year to avoid the large cyclical variations In

productivity analyzed by such authors as Oi (1962), Fair (1969), Solow (1973),

Sims (1974), and Gordon (1979). The figures in the text are for the private—

nonfarm—output—per—hour—paid—for definition of labor productivity and are

taken from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1979, pp. 67—68).

     2Darby (1982b, 1982c).

     3As discussed below, the results are not very sensitive to the particular

measures chosen. The ratio of GPP to total private hours worked indicates the

largest 1965—1978 private hourly productivity slowdown (0.67 percentage

points) and is accordingly used. At the other extreme, total private hours

paid would indicate only a 0.39 percentage point deceleration.

     4lmmigration was sharply limited by the "national origin" quota system in

effect from 1929 until abolished by the Act of October 3, 1965. The average

ratio of immigrants (16 and over) to civilian labor force was 1.42, 0.20, and

0.34 percent for 1900—1929, 1930—1965, and 1966—1978, respectively.

     5The break years 1948 and 1973 are the standard ones in the literature.

The year 1916 was chosen as a convenient high employment year.

     6The estimates are computed from relative earnings for 1929—1970 and

1970—1976, respectively, f-or finer age groups. The finer age groups were

weighted for percentage of total hours worked. Note that the relative wages

reflect not only pure age and sex differences in human capital hut also the

relative amounts of education, all taken as approximately constant. Changes

in the average level of education are accounted for in equation (5) below.

     7See Chiswick (1978, 1979) and Blau (1980). Previously Friedman (1974)

had noted that the rapid immigration of the early twentieth century reduced

measured growth in real per capita income or, as here, labor productivity.

     8These parameters were derived as follows. Blau (1980, p. 32) indicates

gross log differentials in wages at entry for Ethnic Group 2 (the relevant one

for post 1900) of —0.351 for men and —0.183 for women. Now e°35' = 0.704

and e°'83 = 0.833.    These gross differentials were in part due to education,

which is adjusted for separately below. Allowance is made for 1 year of

education (see Chiswick, 1978, p. 907) or 7 percent which approximately

squares with Blau's results for percent literate. (No allowance was made for

differences in mean ages as preliminary calculations suggested any effect was

negligible.) Thus the gross wage differential on entry used was (1.07)

(0.704) = 0.753 for males and (1.07) (0.833) = 0.891 for females. The

estimated effect on the log of real wages of years since migration was 0.0107

for males and 0.0117 for females, and e°°107 = 1.01076 and e°°-'7 =
                                       34



0.01177. Using 1970 data for men, Chiawick (1978) obtained values implying an
                                 z
adjustment factor of about (1.015) M(0•721) for males. A sensitivity check

showed that substituting this factor made no significant difference to the

results.

     9Unfortunately, no data was found to make differential adjustments by age

group so the same factor was used f or both young and old.

     10The 1909 data came from U.S. Immigration CommIssion (1911, Table 56,

pp. 1521 and 1528). The cells were assigned their mean values (0.5, 1.5, 2.5,

3.5, 4.5, 7.5, 12.5, and 17.5) except for the open cell (20 years and over)

for which Blau's value of 30 years was used. The 1970 data were from U.S.

Bureau of the Census (1973, Table 18, p. 466) using cell values of 2.65, 7.8,

12.8, 17.8, 22.8, 30.3, 40.3, and 53.1 years for the open (before 1925)

cell. The last value was estimated by taking weighted averages of young

immigrants arriving 1904 through 1924 who would be 65 or under in 1970.

     "This value was taken from Chiswick (1978, P. 908) and appears

reasonable in terms of such recent cross—section results as reported by Smith

and Welch (1977). Yet lower rates of return to education would lower

productivity growth in the early period relative to the two later periods, but

would not have much effect on the main conclusion of this section: the

absence of a secular decline in productivity growth.

     12Mean years of education were not available, but if the difference is

constant the substitution of the median will not affect the growth rates

estimated below. Folger and Nam (1964) retroject the 1940 census data back to

obtain median estimates for 1930, 1920, 1910. These values of 8.6, 8.4, 8.2,

and 8.1 were extrapolated to 8.0 in 1900. Sources for more recent years are

given in the data appendix. Log—linear interpolation was used to fill in

missing values.

     '3The growth—rate effect of education is separable from those of age,

sex, and immigration, but the latter effects are not separable from each

other. Because the age—sex adjustment is more important for the last two

periods, the effect of the age—sex correction is reported if no adjustment is

made for immigrants and then the additional (marginal) adjustment when APE is

computed according to equations (1), (2), and (3).

     14This deceleration is not reflected in the household survey data on

average hours worked per person employed in the civilian economy (AHW) but is

even a bit larger in the establishment data on hours paid per production or

other nonsupervisory employee (AI-1PN).   It might reflect increased moonlighting

(higher hours per person employed but less hours per employee in each

establishment). The growth in average private hours paid per person employed

in the private sector (AHP) is computed as the growth rate of the ratio of

total private hours paid for (all employees, private business sector,

establishment data) to private employment. The deceleration in this AHP

measure is less than in the ARPN measure either due to increased moonlighting

or less negative growth in average supervisory hours, The remaInIng 0.2%

discrepancy between the growth rates of the Al-lW and AHP measures could be

attributed to shifts in the government/private employment mix and to less

negative growth in average hours worked per government employee, but data is

lacking to demonstrate this. Another possibility is a yet unidentified change

in reporting procedures for the establishment data —— such a change occurred

in 1934 with the introduction of the N.I.R.A. codes and minimum wages, but the

hours data were adjusted for that.

     '5me growth rate of the average quality of the hours will reflect both

the increasing human capital embodied in the labor force and any labor—

augmenting technical progress.

     -6Textbook expositions of these results may be found in Solow (1970, pp.

17—38) and Darby (1979, pp. 105—115, 139—140,. 440—441).

     171f one makes no allowance for measurement error, one could say that

productivity growth was a bit low in 1929—1965 relative to 1900—1929 and 1965—

1978, but surely this is going too far.

     18As is well known, technical progress or total factor productivity

growth is a euphemism for the increase in output which we cannot explain by

the increase in measured inputs. Presumably, the constancy of its average

growth rate over substantial periods reflects the law of large numbers and

numerous independent contributing factors.

     19Christensen and Jorgensen (1978, pp. 35, 53) report series on corporate

capital input and private domestic captial input with 1929—1948 growth rates

of 0.7% and 0.4% per annum, respectively. The NBER—Kendrick capital input

series in U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (1973, pp. 192—193, Series A65) has

an average growth rate of 0.6% per annum during this period. For 1948—1965,

Christensen and Jorgensen estimate that private domestic and corporate capital

input grew at average rates of 4,0% and 3.8% per annum respectively. The

NBER—Kendrick data indicate only a 3.4% growth rate. The preference for the

higher growth rate in the latter period is explained in the text below.

     20The implied average growth rate of capital is 2.21% per annum while

output grew at 2.98%; exp[(0.022l—0.0298)(36)] =   e°2772   =   0.758.
     210verdeflation of gross investment due to undercorrection for quality

changes would have a similar effect.

     22That is, [(19)(0.6%) + (17)(5.6%)]136 = 2.96%   ry = 2.98%.

     23obviously, I subscribe to the view that consistent data—collection

procedures do not yield consistent data series when incentives or constraints

change so as to alter the behavior of the optimizing agents who provide the
                                         37



data. This differs from the uncertainty principle in that economic analysis

can be applied to estimate the nature of the changes.

     24U.S. Council of Economic Advisers (1979, P. 70).

     25See Perry (1977, p. 37). In terms of my own short—run productivity

growth function — equation (12) below —— the residuals for these seven

quarters are 0.0123, —0.0064, 0.0040, 0.0084, 0.0011, 0.0049, and 0.0106,

respectively, for a sum of 0.0349. The residuals for the next seven quarters

are —0.0068, —0.0058, —0.0037, —0.0079, —0.0117, —0.0076, and 0.0028,

respectively, for a sum of —0.0407. The difference (—0.006) is statistically

insignificant but could reflect a very small oil—price effect on productivity.

     26This was the most convenient measure of private productivity available

quarterly. All   data   for this quarterly analysis were taken from the Citibase

data bank.

     27This variable is supposed to capture the differential effects of the

demographic adjustments summarized in Tables 2 and 3 above.

     28The t—statistics are in parentheses below the estimated coefficients.

             line 6 refers to equation (12) as reported above,

     30mis estimate is an estimate of the overstatement in deflated private

output and thus applies equally well to the annual quality—adjusted private

productivity measures reported In Table 4 above.

     31mus equation (14) in the main text is a way of estimating the spurious

increase in reported output conditional upon whatever real effect on

unemployment and employment may have occurred. The reporting hypothesis

implies that the official division of nominal amounts into quantities and

prices is generally suspect during 1971—1974. Deriving implications from

(possibly) incorrectly deflated data is a task not unlike that of George

Smiley in LeCarre's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Frequently the data seem to
                                              38



tell one consistent story if they are taken at face value and another

consistent story if they are assumed biased by the price—control program. The

challenge is to find cases in which only one of the hypotheses fit.

     32Charles Cox (1980) uses October 1973 (i.e., 1973 IV instead of 1973 II)

as the beginning of the decontrol period since that was the beginning of

sector—by—sector decontrol. I believe that the Phase III removal of

requirements for prior approval of price increases was a major relaxation

since —— as explained below ——   the    remaining profit margin ceiling was

consistent with any rate of inflation. Some macroeconomic evidence supporting

1973 II instead of 1973 IV as the start of decontrol is offered below, but the

issue is not crucial. The same evidence is consistent with Cox's view that

the controls had no effect on price levels past 1974 II (as compared to my

1974 III) nor on growth rates past 1974 III.

     33Economists have traditionally argued that missed quality improvements

might imply a 2 percent measured inflation even if the "true" price level was

constant. See, for example, Ackley (1961, p. 87), Price Statistics Review

Committee (1961, pp. 35—39), and Griliches (1961).

     341n a simple dynamic Okun's Law regression, one obtains:




                1og y = 0.0089         —      O.0l80Eu     + O.0436ACD
                       (14.18)             (—13.23)          (3.24)


    S.E.E. = 0.0071,   2 = 0.61,           D—W =   1.99,   PERIOD = 1948 11—1980111



The coefficient on 1CD is nearly identical to the estimate of 0.04397 obtained

in the productivity—growth equation (14) in the text. Note, that although

Okun's Law is sometimes reversed to explain u given t1og y, that form is not

appropriate to the current case in which relatively large measurement error is
                                         39



hypothesized for tdog y as compared to Au.

     35See Darby (1976a).

     36These results are inconsistent with the Barro—Crossman—Evans view

discussed above.

     37This equation was estimated with a first order correction for

autocorrelation (p =   0.5419).   Without this correction the coefficient

of ACD was estimated as —0.0437 (standard error 0.0082, t—statistic —5.3084)

and the S.EE. was 0.0041 with a D—W of 1.13.

     38Terborgh's use of annual data spreads the adjustment period into 1975

since the average 1974 real GNP data will be overstated on the price control

hypothesis.

     39A formal F—test was conducted for both this regression and the one

reported in footnote 34 above to test the implicit hypothesis that the

coefficient was the same during the decontrol and control periods. The

hypothesis was not rejected.
