                             Abstract


The identifiability of redticed form econometric models with variable
coefficients is investigated using the control theoretic concepts of
uniform complete observability and uniform complete controllability.
First, a variant of the state space representation of the traditional
reduced form is introduced which transcribes the underlying non-
stationary estimation problem into one particularly suited to a Kalman
filtering solution. Using such a fornoilation, observability and con-
trollability can be called upon to obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for identification of the specific parameterization. The
results so obtained are completely analogous to those already established
in the econometric literature, namely, that the parameters of the reduced
form are always identified subject to the absence of multicollinearity
(referred to as "persistent excitation" in the control literature). How-
ever, now the multicollinearity condition is seen to depend on the struc-
ture of the parameter variations as well as the statistical nature of
the explanatory variables. The verification of identifiability thus
reduces to a check for uniform complete observability which can always
be   affected in econometric applications. Some    consistency results   are

also   presented which derive from the   above approach.

                          1. Introduction

Identification is an issue which arises in connection with all parametric
statistical models. Simply stated, the issue is whether one can infer
from observed samples the existence of a unique underlying theoretical
structure. Econometricians have long concerned themselves with establish-
ing the conditions for the identifiability of structures whose parameters
are assned to be constant. In this paper we address the seemingly more
complex issue of the identifiability of structures when the parameters
themselves are varying systematically or stochastically over time. This
is a relevant problem because in recent years increasing attention has
been focused on the problem of estiuting time varying structures. Although
estimation methods have been suggested by several authors, little attention
has been paid to the space problem of identification or to the asymptotic theory
for these estimators. Many of the issues we address in this paper have
been investigated by others (Tse Anton [1972]       arid   Mehra [19 7L.]   for
example) but the context, as we shall elaborate, is somewhat different.
    The identification problem for the traditional linear econometric

model   with uncor'related errors was first recognized by Koopnns and
Reiersol [1950] and solutions were    provided by Koopmaris    etal. [1950].
This theory was   later extended   arid elaborated upon by   Fisher   [1966]
in his comprehensive book on the subject. 'ID important papers by

Hannan    [1969, 1971] generalize the   earlier   theory to encompass models
with    moving average error processes .      Most   of this prior theory
concentrates on conditions   which guarantee unique solutions to the set

of   equations which characterize the structural form parameters in tenns
of the reduced form parameters as manifest by HanrianTs solution.
Rothertherg [1971] takes a different approach in characterizing the
identifiability criteria in tenns of the information matrix of classical
mathematical statistics. Rothenberg' s approach has been nicely extended
to a more general representation by Boden [1973]. It is this latter
approach which is most appropriate to problems we are considering because
of its relative independence from concepts related to stationary
stochastic process theory.
     The problem we are addressing can best be illustrated by considering
the state space representation of a model with stochastically varying
structure. We characterize the problem in tentis of a regression relation
(or   observation equation) and   a   "state" equation which desibes the

evolution of the parameters   over    time:

(kxk) matrix thich governs the transitions of the k component         parameter
                                          —3—



        and
              e   and
                        Ut are
                                 independently and identically distributed random
    variables with mean zero and covariance matrixes               arid Q respectively.
    Intuitively it is seen that identification is more conlex in this
    context because the underlying theoretical structure is itself a stochastic
    process. Since the      process is also     dependent upon initial conditions we
    lTn.lst establish   the conditions for the existence    of    a unique set of )cc(T+1)

    parameter   vectors.     In fact, however, the problem is not as difficult as

    it might   appear because      we have imposed   additional   structure   on the problem
    through equation      (1.2). Nevertheless, the information        matrix conditions
    of Rothenberg arid     Bowden must be amended to establish identification in
    such a   context.

          The plan   of the paper is as follows. In        Section 2 we formulate the

    general estimation problem for tine varying structures and present the
p
    recursive     (Kalman Filtering) solution. Our purpose here is partly peda-
    gogical because, while the KaInan Filtering solution to the time varying
    estimation problem has appeared elsewhere in the literature,2 it provides
    a convenient vehicle for illustration of the identifiability conditions.
    The third section of the paper introduces concepts of            unifonn   canplete
    observability and uniform canpiete controllability and relates these to
    the performance of the Kalman Filter.
          In Section L the observability matrix arid controllability matrix
    are related to the information matrix of the constant parameter case
    considered by Rothenberg. In addition, these concepts are used to
    derive sane interesting asyntotic results for the time varying problem.
    The final section discusses the results and suggests directions for
    further researoh.
           2.   The Estimation Theory for Time Varying Structures
                                                                                      .
In the introduction we represented the problem of time varying structures
in tenris of a single equation regression relationship and an equation
which characterizes the evolution of the parameters as a first order
Markov process. As a point of departure for this section let us consider
how we might generalize this representation. Ideally, we would like to
be able to consider general simultaneous equation regression relation-
ships. In practice, however, we mist restrict ourselves to the considera—
tion of reduced fonn relationships because the estimation theory for the
structural fonns of simultaneous equation systems has not yet been
developed.3 Consequently, the irost general regression structures we
can deal with are of the form

(2..l)            Ai(t)yt_i +....+A(t)Yt_+B0(t)Wt +.. ••+Bq(t)Wt_q
                                                                        +
                                                                            et
where       is an Lxi column vector of outputs (endogenous variables),

are   vectors   of exogenous   variables, and   e is an Lxi vector of observa-
tion    errors. This system of equations can be represented more compactly
as

(2.2)             Xtt +   e.
        We also want to consider generalizations of the process which       governs
the evolution of the parameters. Our original characterization of the




                                                                                      S
                                       —5—




parameter evolution as a first order Markov process, or, more generally,
as an autoregressive or iroving       average   process of low order has consider-
able appeal. Not only is it a convenient           characterization     but it is a
natural one in a time series context in that          such   processes can capture
well    the   evolution of the parameters.4

        In many instances, however, one might expect to observe variation

that    is   systematic but non-stochastic, or variation that is purely          random.

To include these possibilities we modify our state equation to the form


(2.3)


which    admits variation of all      three   types. If u is equal to zero then
the variation is purely systematic. Thus, if the parameters follow a
time trer1, a sinusoidal pattern, or are correlated with exogenous vari-

ables it can be represented in this fashion. Similar models have been
considered by Beisley [1973]. If z is a unit vector and      is non-
zero then      the formulation is equivalent to the random       coefficients    model

considered      by Swainy [1970] and others     where the parameters are regarded

as   random drawings from a multivariate distribution with mean vector r
in the above representation. Although this is not properly a state space
formulation it can still be handled within this framework. Thus, the
evolution      of the state of the    system represented     by equation (2.3) is a

general       one which encompasses   many possibilities.5     In any   given   context

prior restrictions  will be placed on and r (and also the covariarice
of the Ut) by one' s view of the particular problem.
        Models like the one described by equation (2.2) and (2.3) have been

extensively    explored in the engineering      literature   following the work

of Kalman £1960] and      Ka.linan and Bucy £1961]. The first    recoition of
the applicability of state space representations and          Kan filtering
solutions   to the problem of estimating econanetric relationships with
tine varying structure was by Rosenberg [1968]. Other approaches to
estimating models similar to the one described above have been suggested
by Cooley and Prescott [1973] and Sarris £1973]. Here, however, we shall
briefly review only the optii.l recursive estimation method because it
is the most convenient for establishing the identifiability criteria.
        We begin by assuming that e    and
                                             u from equations (2.2) arid (2.3)

                                                definite matrices   arid

covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients as

then    the solution is easily obtained when '           , Q, R and r are known.
The form of the solution is known as       the KaJirian filter and is represented

      Although   the Kaan Filter has appeared many other places in the
literature a brief interpretation may be useful. Equation (2.5) represents
the one step ahead prediction of the parameters based on observations
through period t when t =         t-l.       The quantity     which   is called the
"innovations" series, is obviously the one period prediction error for
the        The quantity Kt is called the gain of the Kalman Filter and S
is the covariance matrix of the innovations. In this light it is easy
to see that the gain of filter is simply the:optimal prediction corTection
factor.
      It is obvious that 8,         P0,0,    Q and   R will not be known in nst   appli-
cations. The     log likelihood of the system represented by (2.5) - (2.11),
however,   is (see Mehra   [1972]);

Thus, estimation proceeds by selecting initial values of B, F0,0, e
and using the equations of the KaJ.inan Filter to define the likelihoxl
function. This process proceeds iteratively and is known in the engineer-
ing literature as "tuning the filter". The engineering literature,
however, has not in general been sensitive to problems of estimating
the initial state vector B. Most of the literature assi.mies that
has a proper prior distribution fnich eliminates the problem. That
this    is seldom the case, however, is not a serious problem in dealing
with   real time systems with many observations (as is the case in nest
engineering applications)      because it is easily        shown that   under the

appropriate conditions7 the discrete Kalmari filter            is   asymptotically

stable and   the   effects of the initial       conditions   are ultimately forgotten

(see Jazwinski     [1970,   pp. 240-243]). In econanetrics, however, the

situation is somewhat       different   in that we do not deal       with   real   time
systems,   our observation intervals          are   often relatively short, and we

are often primarily interested in how the structure             of   the system evolves

over    time. For all   of these reasons it is particularly           important to        be

sensitive to the starting      problems.       The first correct solution to the

starting    problems was proposed   by Rosenberg [1968] and          later generalized
by   him [197 3b].   The solution involves concentration of the likelihood

function with respect to the initial parameter vector ,. This permits
maxinu.un likelihood estimation of  conditional on R, Q, 4 and F. The
recursive equations for 8 are8

It is worth noting that, in econometric applications, we will be most
interested in obtaining smoothed estimates of given realizations of the
parameter trajectory (Bt/T), that is, estimates which use all of the
infontation    in the sample. Smoothing equations are presented in Meditch
[1969].
      This review of estimation methods for time varying structures high-
lights one of the important features that is useful in the discussion of
the identifiability of such structures. It is that estimation that is a
two-step procedure. In the first step the initial parameter vector
and the unknown covariance elements are estimated. The second step
consists of estimating realizations of the parameter process (bt,t or
bt,T)     conditional on the estimates obtained in        the first step. Thus,
                                —10—




estimation   of the paranter trajectories is essentially an empirical
Bayesian procedure. Consequently, the identifiability criteria for
such structures may be viewed as having two parts. The first, which
obviously is the crucial part, establishes conditions for the existence
of a unique underlying initial parameter vector. The second part simply
involves the conditions for the existence of a trajectory conditional
on b0
    As we shall see &thsequently there is a direct, but by no nans
simple, relationship between the classical identifiability criteria
for constant parameter models and the identiabiity criteria for models
with time varying structure. Before deriving this relationship, however,
we introduce some concepts from the control theory literature which will
be useful in the subsequent analysis.

                             3. Observabiity and Controllability


    3.1   Definitions

          The concepts which we shall find useful in studying the identifiability
          of time varying structures have evolved in the control theory literature
          from an essentially different, but parallel set of concerns. The rapid
          development of optimal control theory in the early l96OTs led to a
          concern for the qualitative aspects of the optimal control problem.
          Naturally, of first concern were questions regarding the existence and
          uniqueness of      optimal controls. This      led   to the consideration of whether

          or not    it was possible to arbitrarily alter the state of a model solely
          by iwilpulation of the instrtmients        (inputs).     If a model possessed this


I
          ability    it was said to be carlete1y controllable, i.e., there existed
          a coupling between the inputs         and all of the    states. In relation to the

          usual state space fonn representation9

       Uniforn   complete controllability (UCC) implies two things. First,

whenthe lower positive bound, c11, obtains, every nxde of the dynamic
ndel for will be excited by •12 In other words, if x is inter-
                                     x
preted as a stochastic process, then a random component will enter every
element of       thus insuring that some uncertainty is present in each
state. This characteristic is important when specializing these concepts
to the estimation problem, and will be treated again below. Second,
when the finite upper bound, c21, exists and x. is given a stochastic
interpretation, then the effects of this random input on           will remain
bounded in a mean-square sense. This implication also has an important
role to play in the TVP estition problem, and will be nore thoroughly
discussed below.
       A second qualitative consideration arose from the feedback nature
of many optimal control schemes. Since a feedback control required the
state for its implementation, and normally only the endogerous variables
(outputs) were available for measurement, it became increaingly important
to ascertain whether information about the state of the system could be
extracted solely from observations       made on the outputs. If   a nodel
possessed   this characteristic it      was said to be observable, i.e., there
existed   a coupling between all of the states arid the outputs. In relation

to the representation (3.1), the concept of observabiity is best desThed
                               13
by the following definition:




                                                                                 .
                                            —13—




        Definition 2. The model (3.1)              is   said to be uniformly completely
        observable if, and only if, there exist an integer N>O and con-
        stants C1, c2>0 such that,

        Uniform complete observa.biity (UCO) implies that given enough

observations              t-N L   t   t}   it is possible to solve exactly for
In its original (purely deterministic)                  sense, with x. interpreted as    a
known function of time,           this ability to recover          also implies the

exact   recovery of       t-N• In fact, for a linear           deterministic system
such   as (3.1), the observability of the state at any               one   time   t implies
the observability at any           other   time.16      When a stochastic environment

is encountered such that           x is random or measurement errors are present,
then         cannot be determined exactly fran a finite set of observations.
However, uniform   complete observability will be useful in that it
can   establish the possibility of estimating exactly given an infinite
set of data. This is akin to consistency so that observability has an
important role to play in estimation.

Observa.biity, Controllability, and Estimation
In order to     establish the usefulness of UCO arid UCC, they must be related

to estimation and identification. To this end, two leimas a-re presented
which explicitly display the fundamental role played by these concepts.
But before this is done, the definitions given previously are specialized
to TVP estimation probleiuts characterized by (2.2) - (2.3).
        Definition 3. The model         (2.2)       -   (2.3) is said to be ihiifonnly
        completely     controllable with       respect           to the noise, u., if and

        only   if there exists an integer N>O and                   constarrts   c1, cf 0 such

        that   (3.2)   holds for all    tN, where the               controllability matrix is

        The following lemma         exhibits   the existence of a priori bounds                on

        Lemt. 1. Let       the   system (2.2) -      (2.3)   be unifonmly ccmpletely

        observable and     uniformly cou1ete1y          controllable, aixi   let   P010D,
        then         is   uniformly bounded        for all tN   according to


(3.8)          0   < tOR(t,t_        +   C(t,t-N)] iPt/t O(t,t-N)              + C(t,t-N)<

Thus UCC and       UCO are seen to guarantee a meaningful            problem in    the sense

that a positive definite                   is   assured for every -tN. Upon examination,

(3.8) reveals that UCO is crucial                in establishing a   finite upper bound,

while UCC is vital in establishing                a positive definite lower bound

(since
          [0R+C]_l         [C0R+I:r'C).
        The   UCC condition of Lerxma 1 is somewhat restrictive in that there
are three important cases in econometrics where UCC fails to obtain:
(1) constant parameter estination; (2) purely deterministic (or systematic)
parameter estimation; arid (3)             a mixture of systematic and     stochastic
parameter variation. In the first two instances Q.O forces C(t,t-N)0,
whereas in the third instance QO                together   with certain can lead to
C(t,t-N).). In these circumstances no positive definite lower bound
          exists by the hypotheses of Leimia 1. Fortunately this dilemma
can be easily overcome by a slight nodification of Lemma. 1:
                                                                                              .

      ___2. Let the
      Lemma                   system (2.2) -     (2.3)   be UCO   but   not necessarily

      UCC, GG'.O arid P010>O, then               is uniformly     bounded for all

      t.   N according   to

 (3.10)     0 <      i O(t,t-N)         +   C(t,t-N)<    .
The key requirement      of   this   lemma is   that
                                                       P0,0>O.    If estimation   is
initiated with a proper prior on             then         will    be positive definite

whether or not con-bollabiity obtains. It appears quite reasonable
in paractice to expect P,>0 when estimating constant or nonstochastic
parameters, otherwise the nonstochastic elements of uld be Imown
exactly at t=o and it uld be senseless to attempt to estimate them
Note, however, that even when sane              elements are nonstochastic        (GG' M)),

  may be such that C(t,t-N) is positive definite for saie t. This situa-
tion uld be a manifestation of the controllability property as discussed
after (3.2): Namely, that the particular structure in would eventually
result in the "scattering" or distribution of randanness due to                 u
working its way through the system into all the components of
Eventually all of the elements of the parameter vector would contain
sane uncertainty so that                must be satisfied.
     The results contained in Lemmas 1 and 2 should not be interpreted
as restricted solely to the Kalmari filter method of parameter estimation.
The Kalrnan Filter is a mber of the BLUE class so that any and all esti-
mators that are BLUE must yield the same      matrix. Thus the bounds
presented above remain independent of the estimation method. Indeed,
both O(t,t-N) and C(t,t-N) are defined indeendentlv of the estimator.
                                                                                              .

3.3   Observaiility, Controllability, and Identification
      The main import of Lemrr.s 1 and 2 is the unifonn boundedness f
      its definiteness, ar its invertibiity. Whenever               <
                                                                        i<'
      exists and is positive definite. This is extremely important because
      it is intuitively clear that uncertainty (as represented by Pt,t) and
      information are inversely proportional. Thus in obtaining a priori
      conditions which guarantee the positive definiteness pf P1,'         it is
      possible to insure, a priori, the identifiability of the parameters.
      The relationship between observabiity, controllability, and identif 1-
      ability can be put on a irore rigorous footing by examining the special
      case of systematic parameter variation.
              Consider the identification problem associated with the estimation
               in   (2.2) -   (2.3)   given only Y              }   when QO and RI.
      The classical approach to the identification problem would be to view
         as    the only vector to be estimated so that afl   identification     questions
      focus    on it and neglect the rest of the parameter (vector) trajectory.
      With this interpretation, identification would be determined by examination
      of the singularity of the Fisher Information Matrix or the definiteness
      of the Hessian of the Information Integral.17 In the present situation
      both approaches are equivalent because the relevant probability densities
      are continuous in 8.. Therefore the Information Matrix,

it is easy to see that for any variance-covariance matrix R > 0, the
condition of uniform complete observability is both necessary arid
sufficient for classical identification to obtain. These observations
can be surrmarized by the following theorem:
     Theorem 1. The TVP iodel (2.2) - (2.3) with Q   0, (rnstochastic
     parameter variation, is completely identified) if arid only if it
     is uniformly completely observable.
The feeling -that UCO and identifiability were in€mately related has
now been borne out; in the case of systematic parameter, identifiability
arid observability are equivalent.

The results of the previous section are well Icriown in the engineering
literature although they have not, to the best of our kricledge been
der±red elsewhere in the context of the tine varying parameter estiniat ion
problem. Most important, hcx.ever is the fact that the equivalence of the
observability and the information matrix reinforces the generic link
between the econometric identification problem and the properties of the
iKalman Filter. This link provides some insight as to h the criteria for
the identification of tine varting models differ from those of the constant
param€ter problem. In addition, we can more easily explore some of the
asymptotic properties of tine varying parameter estimators.

parameter   variation is ncw clear.             Since we have imposed additional structure

on the oblem by specification of the parameter transition process, identifi-
cation is no larger solely dependent or the properties of the exogenous
variables, it nai       also   depends on the specified from of the parameter variation.
     It is worth exploring hcw the specification of the parameter process can
alter the standard conditions for identification. To illustrate this let us
replace the suniition in (4.4) by a matrix inner product:

                          0(t,t-N)    L'L

where,
                   L      [(_N) XN' (l_N) XN+l                     (fl) X1 X ]
o (t,t-N) will be positive definite if L is of full rank.               But, since         is

nonsingular,     the   rank   of L is equivalent to the rank of
(.5)                      [XN XN+l                    I(Nly         (Ny.x

        In the   constant parameter case identification was concerned only with
the linear independence of the columns of the various {Xt(t_N <                 r < t) }.       Now,

hcever, consideration must be given to the linear independence of the columns
of XT under the nonsingular transformation T-t

       One   of the consequences of Theorem 1 arid the above observations is
that the effects of imilticollineari-ty may be nei.rtralized by specification
of a time-varying structure. Consider the foUing idealized example of
the nest extremxe form of multicoflinearity where an explanator is proportional
to another:

                    X    Exit x2] =              axi]
Under the assumption         of    constant   parterization the   observability criterion
(4.2) reduces    to a test of the renk of L where


                                                          xl,t

The   rank test nc must be applied to L' where,

columus fran anong just the first two in L. Therefore, the imposition of
additional prior information in the form of , may serve to identify an otherwise
unidentified imodel. It must be reirembered, hcwever, that the converse is also
possible, narrely a certain specification of when coupled with a linearly inde-
                             t

specification of any diagonally structured will play a benign role in regard
to multicollineari-ty problenE and identification.

        As   mentioned in Section 2, the econarietric time-varying estimation
problem is characterized by a two-step plx)cedure, the first step dealing
with the estimation of the unkncMn initial parameter vector , and                                  the

identified for      some t   via satisfaction of (4 • 4),        then            can always be recovered

by   solving (4.3a) backwards using            as a terminal condition. The identifi-

                  given that of       can also be deduced from a rederivation of either

the observability or classical information matrix                 in the         special case where

is to be estimated instead of              given data over 0 <       t   <       T:

                   O(T,O) =
                               TOT             XT
                                                     T—t

or

                               T0
Since      i(T,0) will be full rank if O(T,0) is, identification of                           reduces once

again   to a rank test on      O(T,0). But the observability matrix                       can be   written as,

                   o(T,o) =   M   M

where                                                                        -

identification of the initial paremeter vector,                 ,
                                                    and the identification of

The introduction of stochastic paranter variation sonEwhat canplicates the
derivation of identifiability conditions. The canplication is due to the
presence of u in (2 • 3) which leads to a correlated error structure in the
observation equation (2.2). This invalidates the construction used for

    In    order to     have        identified, (4.12) must be a negative definite matrix.

    Since 2 is        a variance—cova.rjance matrix of a nonsingular stochastic process
    it is always positive definite, thus identification will obtain if and only if

                  C'(O,t)x I c(1,t)x
    is full rank. But this is just the observabiity condition once again! Thus

           Theorem 2. The fully stochastic TVP model (2.2)- (2.3), i.e. with
           Q >   0,   is   completely identified at t if and only if it is uniformly
           completely observable at time t.

    Note   that with Q         0,   2   reduces to a block diagonal matrix in     so    that
    (4.12) can then be written as (3.13).
           The identifiability of an empirically determined prior b0 can be inves-
    tigated using Theorem 2 with t = 0. In this case, given data up through tine
    t, the identifiability (observability) criterion reduces to a test for the full
    rank of
                              —I
                           [x0 ,

                                   c1

    But this is just (1(o ,-t)) Z so once again, the identifiability of f implies
    the identifiability of for any 0 < T < t. This is the sane result as
    obtained in the systematic variation case, although not so obvious.

        It was noted in section 2 that estimation is a two—step procedure
where    the first step is the estimation of            and      the   covariance Structures
and     subsequent step the determination of particular realizations
      the

conditional on b0 . As the above result indicates, hever, the identifi-
cation of these realizations is a trivial matter, given b0, because the

The usefullness of the concepts          of observability and          controllability is not

confined     to questions of identification in time-varying                 models. The consistency

of   the Kalrnn   filter   estimates can also be examined using these concepts. In
fact, unifonn complete observabii-ty and controllability, together with Lemma 1,
permit an almost trivial treatment.
      Constant Parameter's. Considering the behavior of the estimates based
on all of the     observations, Lemma 1 yields,

where t > N.      Na it    is possible to express °R as           the sum,

(4.14)
                          OR(t,0) OR,0) + OR(2N, +
Given uniform complete observability, OR(t,0) become the sum of positive
definite matrices so OR(t,O) ÷ 0 as t +                 .       Thus   (4.13) implies that

said of the structure of before (              •   13)   can be used to establish consistency.
A simple sufficient condition resulting in consistent filtered estimates is
that only with eigenvalues on or within the unit circle be considered in
specifying the ixodel structure. For such , N-t (t > N) is an unstable
matrix so all three factors in (.l5) grow without bound as t ÷                         . If     =   I
then the above problem reduces to that of the constant paranter case, even
though rz 0.
        Stochastic Parameter Variation. In the general stochastic case the upper
bound fran Lemma 1 must include C(t,0):

('4.16                  0 <         <
                                        O    (t,o) +        C(t,0)

Since     Q 0 implies CC t ,0)      0, uniform complete            observabiity with an

appropriately    chosen       (i.e., o t , 0)       -'- 0   as t     cc)   is   no longer sufficient

to   guaxntee consistency. Moreover, reference to (2.10) reveals that                                   0

for any t so long as Q          0. Thus at each thservation                       can never be zero
because /t—l is never zero. The best that can be hoped for is that sane
finite limiting distribution exist for         and -to achieve this ( 16) suggests         •



that be specified such that C Ct ,0) - ct                <
                                               as t - 00• In turn, the definition

of C Ct, 0) reveals that, in order to obtain an a. pk..Lo finite distribution
on         must be a stable matrix (i.e., all ei-ievalues within the unit circle).
However, it should be noted that this is not necessary--it only iJ1lies that the
bounding technique stemming fran Lemma 1 loses its usefulness in such situations.
                                       —30--




 Thus, the stability of is again only a sufficient condition for the
 boundness of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients.
 Whether one should consider unstable transition matrices would appear to
 depend on the properties of the inputs (the xt), because the observability
 of the system will depend upon these properties. If the system is observable
 then it is not clear that one should attach too much importance to the
 consistency property. In such instances, it seems that it is more inortant
 to worry about whether an estitor is efficient. Cooley and Prescott [1972]
 have shn that estimators with = I will be efficient.
     The inability of the filter to produce consistent paremster estimates
 under stochastic variation suggests that the optimal "smoother" estimates
 might be a better alteniativeJ5 HcMever this is not the case; inconsistency
 still persists so long as Q       0. This claim can best be substantiated by
 viewing the optimal smoother as a conilination of two optimal filters, one
 run forward in time from t=0 to t, and the other run backwards in ti fran
 tT to t, (See     Fraser and   Potter [1969]).
The smoothed estimation error variance-covariance matrix is given by
                               -rD1            -
                       t/T Lt/t
                       1D      -
                                        t/t
 where       denotes the forward filter variance-covariance matrix and
 denotes the backward filter variance-covariance matrix. As T + oo only
will change since only it depends on T. By increasing the data length, T,
it might be hoped that the solution for     could be initialized far enough
 into the futiule such that Pt,t+ 0. But this can never happen. So long as
Q    0, the matrix Ricatti solution to the backward filter can never degenerate
 to zero, no matter hcw long in the filter its solution is initialized (Potter
[1965]. Thus                and t/T> 0 for all T + .   Neither filtering or smoothing
 can yield   consistent paremeter   estimates under stochastic parameter variation.

                   5. SuirmEry and Conclusions


In the foregoing sections we have used the equivalence of the concepts
of observability in control theory and information in statistics to
establish the conditions for the identifiability of time varying struc-
tures in econometrics. Our intent has been to shed further light on
the properties of time varying parameter estimation methods that have
been introduced into econometrics in recent years. Several interesting
albit possibly obvious, conclusions emerge; the requirements for
identification in time varying riodels are not in principle irore stringent
than in the classical constant parameter case and may be less so because
of the additional structte imposed on the problem. The identifiability
criteria arid the asymptotic properties of the estimators suggest that it
may not always make sense to consider processes with unstable transition
structures. This latter caveat is not completely clear, however, because we
have concentrated throughout on sufficient conditions for identification.
Finally, the estimators for models subject to stochastic parameter varia-
tion will not be consistent in the usual sense. It has been shown, however,
that a sufficient condition for them to have stable asymptotic distribu—
tioris is that the transition matrix be stable (have eigenvalues within
the unit circle). It should be noted that in the econometric environment
where all observed data is to be processed "off-line" (i.e. in batch imde),
it is always possible to verify the conditions for observabiity and
controllability.
                                    —32—




      In   the develornt of the results in this paper it has         been
assumed throughout that , is known. It should be obvious that there
is a deeper issue of identifiability that should be dealt with and
that is the identifiability of when it is unknown as it is in most
applications. This is indeed a more complex problem which requires
further investigation. It appears at the present tine that a fruitful
approach to the problem is to concentrate on the connection between
specification errors in and       the   serial   correlation   properties   of

the   innovations   proce s (the estimated residuals). In this approach

one   is essentially searching   for   the structure   that   is empirically best.
This can be thought of as a generalization of the Box-Jen]dns approach
to modelling. Similar approaches have been taken in the engineering
literature to studying the sensitivity of the Kalman Filter. See for
example Mebra [1970], Bzer and McDaniel           [1972], Martin and   Stubberud
[19714].
      Finally, all of the current discussion has        been confirmed   to the

reduced    form models. A more difficult problem would be to look at the
identification of tine varying structural models. Before this can be
done, however, the estimation methods must be extended to structural form
models.

                                                     in
       are several definitions of observabiity, but only the one most use-
       ful with respect to time-varying parameter estimation and identifica-
       tion has been employed.
111.   Since Ht is generally some time-varying matrix constructed of known
       time functions other than explanatory variables, the control litera-
       ture emphasises how "controllability and observability are quantities

      exhibited by the system and not the data". This is clearly not the
      case with the Kalman filter representation of the TVP estimation
      problem ..then     replaces Ht. The strict intrinsic interpretation
      of controllability does, hoWever, remain valid since the data never
      enters into the definition of Ft or Gt.
15.   The correct criterion for establishing the ability to determine
      instead of tN uld involve O(t-N,t). But this can be obtained
      from 0 (t ,t-N) merely by exchanging the arguments in in (3.5),
      i.e. by employing t1,t). Since ' is nonsingular and
             , r), this can always be done.
16.   Since Q is a variance-covariance matrix, it is symmetric and at least
      positive semi-definite. If it is positive definite it is always
      possible to find a. unique factorizat ion Q  Q( Q)'. Then (2.3) is
      equivalent   to

                        t + Gp         -
                                           N(O,I)

      stochastic   omponents due to any elemerrt of   p.r,
                                                             then   Q can only be
      positive semi-definite. A re-ordering of equations could then be
      employed to obtain


                         La      oj
      where Q1   is a k1xk1 positive definite matrix. The unique factorization
      of Q1 could then be effected and employed in the first k1 rows of
      G with the last k—k1 rows being replaced by a null matrix.
