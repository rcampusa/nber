                                            ABSTRACT

We provide the first econometric study of foreign exchange market intervention for the UK during
the sterling crises from 1964–1967. We use daily data on spot and forward dollar/sterling exchange
rates and reserve movements which allows a more precise description of the loss of credibility during
four currency crises. Reserve losses are consistent with exchange rate crises. External assistance given
to sterling throughout this period shored up the reserves and allowed the sterling peg to be maintained.

1.       INTRODUCTION


The Bretton Woods agreement in July 1944 established an international monetary framework
that would overcome the perceived problems of the interwar period, especially the
perceptions that floating exchange rates and capital flows (hot money movements) were a key
source of the instability of the 1930s and that international cooperation had failed. The
implicit goals of the system were exchange rate stability and trade liberalisation. The former
was to be achieved by countries operating a pegged but adjustable exchange rate and the
latter through the acceptance of current account convertibility. Once the European members
declared current account convertibility in December 1958, however, the system quickly
evolved into a gold dollar standard with many of the flaws of the interwar gold exchange
standard combined with some new ones: the inability of the adjustable peg to adjust because
of fear of the speculative attack that would ensue if even the hint of devaluation were made;
and the inability to seal off capital flows (Bordo, 1993). These flaws opened up the prospects
of currency crises in the face of inconsistency between domestic financial policies and/or
changing competitiveness and the declared peg.


One of the most vulnerable currencies to speculative attacks was sterling and one of the key
dramas of the demise of Bretton Woods was the series of sterling crises between 1964 and
1967. The 1964–67 period has long fascinated academics and with the release of new papers
from the archives, important new questions can be raised about the management of sterling in
this period.1 This paper focuses on the speculative attacks of the 1964 to 1967 period and the
behaviour of reserves. Sterling acted as the second reserve currency of the international
monetary system after the dollar and because of this, was defended against speculative
attacks by exchange market intervention,2 especially forward market operations by the Bank
of England (henceforth ‘the Bank’) and by the protection of the UK’s foreign exchange
reserves. Reserves were the key measure of the status of the defence of sterling and

understanding the management of the crises between 1964 and 1967 hinges on an analysis of
reserves.


There are two analytical approaches to explaining the behaviour of international reserve
intertemporally. The first, which we may label the theory of international reserves, is
essentially partial equilibrium in nature and posits that observed reserves respond to
discrepancies between desired and actual reserves held by a country, and in this literature
much of the focus is on the adequacy of international reserves on a global basis (Clark, 1970;
Grubel, 1971). The second approach takes a macroeconomic perspective and draws on the
classic monetary approach to the balance of payments (MABP), which in turn is largely a
variant of the Humean price-specie-flow mechanism (Frenkel and Johnson, 1974). In
summary, in this view excessive movements in the supply of money relative to the demand
for money will produce equal and offsetting reserve movements for a small open economy
with a fixed exchange rate and facing perfect capital mobility. In the MABP therefore reserve
changes are essentially a residual term and this would seem to contradict the theory of
international reserves. However, the two approaches can be reconciled once it is recognised
that if there is a stable demand for international reserves, domestic credit cannot be
exogenous (Edwards, 1984).


On the face of it a strict application of the MABP to the UK position in the 1960s would
seem to imply that the large reserve losses sustained in the 1960s, due to the large balance of
payments deficit, should have led to a currency devaluation much sooner than the actuality.
However, for a country which is not small, which faces less than perfect capital mobility, and
whose currency was regarded as a reserve currency (i.e. was held for reasons other than the
settlement of transactions) – which seems to be a better description of the position of the UK
in the 1960s than the baseline MABP model – the link between changes in the money supply
and reserves would not necessary be equal and opposite thereby postponing the inevitable
day of reckoning. Nonetheless, of course, the underlying MABP relationship still existed for
the UK in the 1960s, as the very large UK balance of payments deficit in the period
demonstrate, and so understanding why the inevitable devaluation of sterling did not occur
until the late 1960s indicates that the institutional structure within which the monetary–
reserve relationship is embedded is important in understanding the sterling crisis in the 1960s
and that is the key focus of this paper.

This paper is divided into five sections. Section two provides a chronology of the sterling
crises from 1964 to 1967. Section three examines evidence from credibility tests to show that
the sterling peg was often not credible and that the speculative attacks were justified. Section
four presents new daily data on sterling reserves from the archives of the Bank which show
that UK reserves were lower than official estimates at the time and in worse shape than
policymakers admitted to the general public and their own creditors. Section five examines
the relationship between reserves and the exchange rate (the expected rate of realignment) as
well as the Bank’s reaction function for reserves. Consistent with first-generation speculative
attack models (adjusted for the presence of partial capital controls) we find that reserve
movements driven by monetary and fiscal indiscipline are a key driver of the expected rate of
realignment. We also show that the Bank was responsive to lagged exchange rate changes – a
leaning against the wind effect – and was also sensitive to movements of the exchange rate
with respect to the exchange rate band. Finally, we offer some conclusions.


2.       CHRONOLOGY OF STERLING CRISES


At the outset of this paper we need to be clear about what constitutes a currency crisis.
According to Bordo and Schwartz (1996, p. 438), a currency crisis is a ‘market-based attack
on the exchange value of a currency. It involves a break with earlier market judgment about
the exchange value of a currency. If a devaluation, which also involves a change in the peg,
does not occur because of market pressure, it does not qualify as a currency crisis’. A similar
definition has been employed in the study by Bordo et al. (2001, p. 55), but they also add an
international bailout to the list of qualifying criteria.


Based on this criteria, there were several sterling crises after 1945. Two of the most
damaging to sterling’s status as a reserve currency had been the ill-fated attempt at
convertibility in July 1947 and the devaluation of September 1949, when the pound was
devalued from $4.03 to $2.80 (Cairncross, 1985, pp. 121–64; Cairncross and Eichengreen,
Sterling, 2003, pp. 111–55).3 Although the proximate cause of these and subsequent crises
was due to a combination of substantial deficits in the government’s international
transactions (which were responsible for the weakness in the current account balance) and the

scale of overseas direct and portfolio investment (which put the overall balance of payments
into deficit), they also reflected some fundamental weaknesses with the British economy,
such as the lack of competitiveness (Hirsch, 1965; Middleton, 2002).


Contemporaries pointed out that one of the impediments to faster growth in the 1950s was the
attempt by the Conservative government to fine-tune the economy (referred to as ‘stop-go’)
which ‘caused (or failed to restrain) faster growth than could be sustained, which then had
later to be restrained’ (Dow, 1998, p. 263; Dow, 1964). The pursuit of higher growth was
undertaken with the sole objective of keeping unemployment (artificially) low using very
crude macroeconomic tools. This created cyclical instability which generated additional costs
and uncertainty for businesses, adversely impacting upon the marginal efficiency of capital
and the inducement to invest. These ‘stop-go’ economic policies were also inextricably
linked to the deep-seated balance of payments problems of the British economy, namely that
weak export growth could not support the full employment level of imports (Middleton,
1996, pp. 42–43).


Although the UK held official reserves to counter a ‘run’ on the pound, these were
inadequate by themselves to offset a major attack on sterling and on occasions (e.g. 1956 and
1961) it was necessary to seek short-term central bank assistance through the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The low level of
reserves became a further concern for policymakers for two reasons. First, sterling was a
reserve currency and if it was forced off its parity then the US dollar would likely become
more vulnerable to speculative attack. Secondly, foreign banks and monetary authorities
overseas held sterling-denominated reserves, known as the ‘sterling balances’. At the end of
1945, the UK’s gross sterling liabilities stood at £3,602 million and by the end of 1963 these
had risen to £4,232 million. The worry for the Bank was that the value of the sterling
balances exceeded its foreign exchange reserves and could have grave repercussions if these
funds were repatriated to London and presented for exchange for US dollars or other
convertible currencies (Schenk, 1994).4 This might not have been a cause for concern if the
balance of payments deficits had not led to a persistent fear that the pound might be devalued.
A devalued pound would mean that the Bank would be faced with demands for compensation

for overseas sterling holders and it would most likely be co-opted to offering costly
guarantees against future exchange risks.


By early 1964, the generally accepted view had been that the deficit on current account
would continue to grow, the out-flow of long-term capital would be above the 1963 figure
and the overall balance of payments would continue to deteriorate (Blackaby, 1978, pp. 24–
25; NEDC, 1964; National Institute Economic Review, 1964, p. 9). Despite this, there was no
widespread call for devaluation by economists and the Treasury and Bank were also opposed
to a change in parity. They argued that devaluation would severely strain Britain’s relations
with other countries, particularly the Sterling Area, where the main holders of sterling would
begin to withdraw their balances from London; threaten the stability of the international
monetary system by throwing into question the practice of reserve currencies; and finally,
provoke retaliatory measures in Western Europe and a ‘scramble for gold’ as the future of the
dollar would be put into question.5


Upon taking office in October 1964, the Labour government announced its intention to end
‘stop-go’ economic management and shifted its strategy towards an emphasis on incomes
policy and selective intervention to improve the industrial structure of the economy
(Tomlinson, 2004). The triumvirate of the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer and
the First Secretary of State quickly denounced devaluation as a solution to Britain’s economic
difficulties. However, this economic strategy – famously described by the Prime Minister’s
economic adviser, Thomas Balogh, as ‘the third way’ – was ill equipped to address the
frequent short-term crises of confidence which gripped sterling in the foreign exchange
markets.


The short-run prospects for the balance of payments were grim. Ten days after taking office,
the government publicised that the balance of payments deficit for 1964 was going to be £800
million. This announcement was accompanied by some details about the government’s long-
term strategy for dealing with the balance of payments, but this did not go far enough to
placate deteriorating market sentiment about sterling. Following a neutral budget in
November, the foreign exchange markets began to lose confidence in the ability of the
government to keep the parity at $2.80 and sterling came under heavy pressure from 11

November. There was an inordinate delay in raising Bank Rate and by the time it was
increased from 5 per cent to 7 per cent on 23 November, it did not stem further heavy reserve
losses over the following two days. If the Governor of the Bank, Rowley Cromer, had not
managed to secure $3 billion of credits from other central banks on 25 November, the Labour
government would have been forced to devalue or float the pound (Cairncross, 1996, p. 105).


Following this first sterling crisis, the pound remained weak throughout December 1964 and
into the first few months of 1965 as doubts persisted about whether $2.80 could be defended
unless further deflation was forthcoming. Sterling was undersold heavily during March 1965
although the Budget on 6 April and some tough talking by the Prime Minister in New York a
week later did modify some of the pressure for the rest of the month into May. In June,
however, trade figures were released for May and showed a heavy deficit. This revived
doubts about whether the UK had really addressed its basic economic problems.


A second sterling crisis began in July 1965, prompted by a remark from the Chancellor on 15
July that no new measures were needed to strengthen the British economy, despite published
reserves and trade figures which failed to show any real recovery (Cairncross and
Eichengreen, 2003, pp. 177–78). Sterling was sold heavily on the exchanges in the week
ending 24 July and further measures were announced on the 27 July to reduce public
expenditure, tighten credit and to make Exchange Control more effective. The markets were
not convinced that the crisis was under control, however, and two news items provoked
heavy and widespread selling and renewing rumours about a possible devaluation. First, the
reserve statement for the end of July was published on 3 August and although it was reported
that £50 million had been lost, it was known that the UK had received a special receipt of £41
million from Germany, prompting suggestions that the true loss was over £100 million.
Secondly, it was announced that President Johnson had met with the Chairman of the Federal
Reserve and had drawn pessimistic conclusions about sterling. This prompted a further run
on the pound between the 3 and 6 August. Following the publication of July trade figures on
10 August – which showed record exports and a deficit of only £5 million – the market began
to stabilise and sentiment began to improve. New international support for sterling totalling
$925 million was arranged by several European countries, the US and Canada on 10
September 1965. Between September 1965 and March 1966, confidence returned and the
spot rate strengthened.
                                                                                             8


Between March and May 1966, however, signs of weakness began to appear. First, there was
some nervousness about the outcome of the General Election campaign, but this disappeared
with the re-election of the Labour government. Secondly, the Budget at the beginning of May
had introduced some new taxes but it failed to give sterling a significant boost and following
indifferent trade figures and the outbreak of the seamen’s strike, sterling was sold and
confidence took a dip. The third sterling crisis occurred between June and August 1966, and
it reached its peak in July when confidence in sterling collapsed and the Government was
forced to announce a wide-ranging package of measures. These included an increase in Bank
Rate from 6 per cent to 7 per cent; tightening of Hire Purchase; travel restrictions; a six-
month standstill of wages and prices; and cuts in public expenditure (Cairncross and
Eichengreen, 2003, p. 180). In September 1966 another package of aid for sterling was
assembled totalling $400 million and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York increased its
swap facility to $1.3 billion from $750 million which had been granted at the time of the first
sterling crises in November 1964.


From September 1966 to April 1967 there was again a period of recovery in sterling. Bank
Rate was gradually reduced to 5½ per cent in early May and policymakers began to express
hopes that the balance of payments would be in surplus by the end of 1967. It was not long
before this second ‘false dawn’ came to an end. In May and June 1967 there was a sharp
break in confidence as bad trade figures were published and tensions rose in the Middle East.
Both events pushed the spot rate down and unease continued into July and August with the
closure of the Suez Canal, rumours of Arab sales of sterling, the publication of further bad
trade figures and rising unemployment. As sterling came under pressure, the press began to
discuss the likelihood of devaluation, which was also stimulated because the government had
made a formal application to enter the European Economic Community. Hire purchase
restrictions were relaxed in August and social security payments increased in September,
both of which were seen by the markets as a sign that the defence of sterling was not the
government’s chief priority and instead prompted more selling of sterling. A dock strike and
further bad trade figures kept sentiment adverse, and the raising of Bank Rate in October did
little to restore confidence.


In early November, rumours continued to circulate that the pound would be devalued and
sterling came under heavy pressure. Despite a further raise in Bank Rate on 9 November,
sentiment for sterling continued to ebb. Rumours that a potentially new massive support
                                                                                             9


package for sterling was being assembled began to circulate during the week commencing 13
November, and as the authorities neither confirmed or denied this, the foreign exchange
market was further destabilised. Although the Chancellor still hoped that a bailout from the
IMF and the US Treasury could be raised, the government agreed to devalue the pound on
Thursday 16 November. No loan was forthcoming and following unprecedented sales of
sterling on Friday 17 November, the Prime Minister announced that the pound would be
devalued from $2.80 to $2.40 on Saturday 18 November 1967 (Cairncross and Eichengreen,
2003, pp. 186–91).


Aside from September 1965 to May 1966 and September 1966 to May 1967, the weakness of
sterling between 1964 and 1967 suggests sterling was suffering from a fundamental
disequilibrium. However, this was not how contemporaries saw it. As Hutchison has argued,
a myth grew up after devaluation that the majority of the economics profession was in favour
of devaluation between 1964 and 1967, when there is no evidence to show that this was
indeed the case (Hutchison, 1977, pp. 131–136). To be sure, there were some who did argue
that the pound should be devalued (particularly after the July 1966 crisis), but many
‘hesitated to state publicly the case for devaluation, recognizing that, the more convincingly
the case for devaluation was stated, the more difficult it would be for the government to bring
it about smoothly and without speculative urges’ (Cairncross and Eichengreen, 2003, pp.
159–160).


With the number of speculative attacks and reserve losses over the period, how did the UK
manage to hold sterling at $2.80? Quite simply, between 1964 and 1967 the UK received
lines of credit from central banks and the IMF and enjoyed use of a swap network with the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York. What is often not appreciated however, is the scale of
the assistance given to sterling throughout the period. Much of this assistance, such as the
overnight swap with the US and the Bank for International Settlements gold swap was secret,
so that the scale of the figures involved would not become public knowledge and undermine
confidence in sterling. The UK was also provided with short-term central bank assistance and
had medium-term facilities available under IMF drawing rights. To give some idea of the
figures involved, it should be noted that in September 1964 the UK authorities had at their
disposal $2,000 million. At the end of September 1965, this figure had risen to $3,310
million, rising to $4,370 million by September 1966 and falling slightly to $4,323 million in
the weeks preceding devaluation.

3.        TESTS OF STERLING’S CREDIBILITY


The exchange rate arrangements for sterling in the 1960s – with its central parity and margins
for flexibility above and below that parity, defined by the exchange rate bands – are
described as a target zone in the international finance literature (MacDonald, 2007).6 If a
target zone is credible, in the sense that market operators believe that the central bank’s
commitment to defending the parity is credible, because the underlying macroeconomic
policies are consistent with the peg, then this should show up in a number of simple tests.
Perhaps the simplest test of credibility involves plotting the forward exchange rate against the
upper and lower bands of the target zone (Svensson, 1993). The idea here is that in a credible
target zone the forward exchange rate will be the markets expected exchange rate and should
be bounded by the upper and lower bands of the target zone:
                                      sl ≤ ft ≤ su ,
where sl is the lower band of the target zone and su is the upper band. If the forward rate were
to lie outside the band this would be prima facie evidence that the target zone was non-
credible. We now consider the behaviour of the spot and forward rates for our data sample.


Figure 1 shows the spot and three-month forward rate from the 2 January 1963 to 17
November 1967. Data are daily exchange rates in London, collected from The Times. The
horizontal, dashed line shows the central parity, while the upper and lower edges of the figure
coincide with the Bretton Woods band. The spot rate weakened during the third week of
August 1963, but had recovered by March 1964. Thereafter, it fell below its $2.80 parity, and
came close to $2.78, the level below which, under the IMF rules, the Bank could not permit it
to fall. The spot rate was then particularly weak for two periods: the first ten days after the
Labour victory of 16 October 1964 and between the time of the budget and until the interest
rate rise on 23 November 1964. However, aside from the first ‘false-dawn’ (November 1965
to March 1966) and the second ‘false-dawn’ (September 1966 to July 1967), sterling

     Although the target zone literature was originally formulated for exchange rates in the
Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, Svensson (1993) has
indicated that nearly all fixed exchange rate regimes in which there were either explicit or
implicit bands – such as Bretton Woods and the Gold Standard – may be regarded as target
zones.

remained close to the bottom of the band.


                                         Figure 1 here


The three-month forward rate peaked on 28 October 1964 and then fell until the crisis of 25
November 1964 where it spiked above $2.78 briefly as details of the $3 billion loan were
announced. However, credibility at this maturity was very short-lived and did not return until
just before the 1965 crisis. There had been a very significant change made to forward market
policy at the time of the first sterling crisis in 1964. Prior to 24 November 1964, it had been
common ground for the Treasury and the Bank to avoid continuous intervention in the
forward market at a relatively narrow margin, largely because it reduced the insurance
premium which had to be paid by those who sought to cover themselves (in other words, it
made the cost of speculation cheap) (Oppenheimer, 1966). From this point, operations in the
forward market had the objectives of protecting the spot reserves by making forward cover
cheaply available and to retain in London the large amount of arbitrage funds which had built
up to the end of 1964. The intervention, which began modestly at first, strengthened and
between November 1964 and November 1967, there were only two periods when forward
cover was reduced by the Bank: between September 1965 to February 1966 and October
1966 to April 1967. Aside from these two periods, the forward rate was under pressure,
particularly so during the choppy waters of July and August 1966 and in November 1967.
The Treasury, who were not privy to the exact magnitude of the large forward positions built
up by the Bank, estimated that the average size of the Exchange Equalisation Account’s
oversold position was between $1.8 billion and $2 billion from November 1964 until August
1966; in fact the true position by this later date was $3 billion and by the time of the
devaluation it stood at $4.6 billion.7


Overall, then, the behaviour of the 90 day forward rate suggests that for much of the period
sterling was credible, although there are important exceptions such as the period September
1964 to the end of 1965, the summer of 1966 and the immediate run up to the 1967
devaluation. Plotting the forward rate against the exchange rate bands, as we have considered
in the above, is informative but it does not give an indication of the significance of the
violations of credibility. To address this we construct the so-called 95 per cent credibility

confidence intervals which focus on whether the expected rate of realignment is significantly
different from zero (which contrasts with the simplest test which focuses on the total
expected exchange rate and are not tests of the significance of non zero values of the
expected rate of realignment). Svensson (1993) has argued that the 95% confidence interval
test is a much tighter test of credibility than simply plotting the forward exchange rate against
the target zone bands and their derivation may be explained in the following way.8 By
decomposing the actual spot rate may be decomposed into the central parity (ct) and the
deviation of the exchange rate from the central parity (xt) the so called 95% confidence
interval can be expressed as9:
                 (it − it* ) − ( xt+5 − xt ) ≤ Et Δct ≤ (it − it* ) − ( xt−5 − xt ) ,
where the +5 and -5 superscripts on the x term represent the +/- 5% values around the fitted
value of x. The 95% confidence intervals are constructed on the basis that xt is the single
determinant of the expected change in the current deviation of exchange rates from the centre
and this is consistent with the majority of studies which estimate (5) (Rose and Svensson,
1995; Caramazza, 1993; Hallwood, MacDonald and Marsh, 2000). The estimated 95%
confidence interval is presented in Figure 2 and the message from this figure is stark: absent a
few observations in 1963, after 1964 sterling was essentially a non-credible currency.


                                                   Figure 2 here


The figure predicts well the November 1964 crisis, with the expected rate of realignment
dropping sharply mid-1964 and credibility recovering soon after the crises although it dipped
again in early 1965. The stabilising effect of short-term central bank assistance in September
1965 seems to be clear in Figure 2 with the expected rate of realignment rising to a value
which was almost insignificantly different from zero toward the end of 1965. However, early
in 1966 credibility took a further dip, which would seem to be an anticipation of the pressure
sterling was under in the summer of 1966. The recovery of sterling in the winter of 1966 and
the early spring of 1967 is confirmed in these figures by the rise in the expected rate of
realignment towards zero. However, this was short lived with credibility starting to take a hit
as early as late August 1967 and then recovering somewhat in late September but then from
late October credibility fell sharply.

4.     RESERVES


It was recognised in the mid-1960s that Britain had the lowest level of reserves of all the
western European countries, which was made worse because she required a considerable
margin for key currency status and to provide for the outstanding liabilities of the Sterling
Area (Heller, 1966, pp. 305–7). As Harold James (1996, p. 186) has noted, ‘the instability
caused by the sterling balance overhang and the danger of liquidation ... lay behind each of
the major British crises of the second half of the 1960s’.


From our earlier discussion it was suggested that the underlying story in this period is one of
macroeconomic weakness of the UK economy coupled with an unwillingness to adjust the
exchange rate, which led to a growing inconsistency between the peg and the economic
fundamentals. If this is the case, it might make an analysis of foreign exchange intervention
of limited interest other than as a measure for the pressure on the exchange rate. However,
the prevailing view of the authorities at the time was that they could finance the external
deficit in the short-run by use of the reserves and bolster the reserves where necessary with
international rescues. An analysis of the extent of changes in the reserve position is thus
highly relevant to understand how the government managed to avoid devaluation.


The extent of reserve losses over this period have never before been revealed as the published
figures by the Bank were subjected to extensive ‘window dressing’ with swaps and Treasury
bonds sales typically not reported or seen as part of the reserves. This allowed a false picture
of the reserves to be presented and allowed the asset side of the reserve position to be
presented and any sterling liability to be hidden. Regarded as a standby which could be
activated on demand, the transaction would not affect the exchange rate directly at least not
until one or other central bank sold its holdings of the other central bank’s money.


Table 1 shows an exact tabulation of gold and convertible currency reserves, levels at end-
months, between June 1964 and December 1967.


                                          Table 1 here
                                                                                             14


The true position of the reserves can be seen in column 4 (the extent of the Bank’s ‘window
dressing’ can be seen in column 3), which highlights the scale of the assistance given to
sterling over the period. Although the figure for net reserves at the end of March 1966 was
over one billion pounds, this was due to a liquefied portion of the dollar portfolio being
brought into the reserves at the beginning of February. Column 5 illustrates the enormous
scale of forward sales over the period. The magnitudes of these net forward sales of sterling
have been hinted at by Cairncross and Eichengreen (2003, pp. 185-86), but the exact figures
were a closely guarded secret by the Bank and are revealed here for the first time.


We have used the dealers’ reports from the Bank to reconstruct changes in the reserves on a
daily basis between 1964 and 1967 (Figure 3).10 Positive entries represent increases in
reserves, while negative entries represent losses of reserves. Each of the currency crises
discussed in Section 1 are marked on the figure.


                                        Figure 3 here


Hamilton (2008, p. 79) has suggested that the strength of the reserves on the eve of the 1967
devaluation meant that sterling ‘could have weathered the storm’ and that the day before
devaluation ‘the till was still far from empty’. Although this is an intriguing suggestion, the
evidence does not support it. Hamilton quotes from a Treasury document which estimates
that the published figure for the reserves at the end of October would be $2,780 million. The
addition of the dollar portfolio, central bank facilities and the IMF drawing rights brings the
amount of assets available to $5.1 billion. However, when Britain’s short and medium-term
liabilities are factored in, this figure falls to $2.5 billion. On the 16 November 1967, the
Treasury assumed that a little over $1 billion of resources would still be available at the end
of November, and coupled to the IMF drawing rights, the UK had at its disposal, a total of
$2.2 billion with which to defend sterling.11 Due to window dressing, published reserve
figures are misleading, however, and Column 3 of Table 1 shows that at the end of October
net reserves stood at $244 million, which at that point, was probably the lowest end of month
figure ever. The dealers’ report show that by 16 November, a further $728 million had been
spent trying to defend the parity so in reality, the situation was much worse. Without a further

massive rescue (which had been ruled out by the IMF and US officials over the weekend of
10/11 November 1967), the $2.80 parity was simply untenable.


The scale of the total reserve losses during the crises between 1964 and 1967 can be
compared to earlier post-war crises. Between 1 April 1949 and the devaluation of 18
September 1949, the reserves fell by $564 million (Cairncross and Eichengreen, 2003, p.
147). During the sterling crises of September 1951 to January 1952, the reserves fell by
almost $900 million (Dow, 1964, p. 73). Klug and Smith (1999, p. 193) report that in the
1955 crisis (July to December), $248 million was lost and in the Suez Crisis (July 26 to
December 7 1956) $655 million was lost. During the Suez Crises, $400 million was lost in
one month alone (November 1956), which was the highest single monthly figure post-war,
since a loss of $256 million in October 1951 (Boughton, 2001, pp. 434–35). The losses
during the period between 1964 and 1967 were on a scale far larger than anything prior to
this date, as can been seen from Table 2.


                                            Table 2 here


Table 2 shows how market intervention was the overwhelming cause of the reserve loss,
particularly in the form of support to forward sterling. As discussed earlier, this policy was
unprecedented. In November 1956, only $13 million were spent on supporting forward
sterling and only $30 million were spent in the year as a whole; the totals for 1964, 1965,
1966 and 1967 were $1.6 billion, $1.7 billion, $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. The
steady loss of reserves illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 3 at the time of each currency crisis
followed by acceleration in reserve losses and intervention are typical of the other currency
crises described by economists and economic historians (Bordo and Schwartz, 1996;
Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz, 1996; Bordo et al. 2001).




5.     EXPECTED RATE OF REALIGNMENT, RESERVE CHANGES AND
       REACTION FUNCTIONS


In this section we examine the interactions between reserve changes and two measures of
exchange rates – the change in the spot rate, in terms of a standard reaction function, and the
relationship between the expected rate of realignment and the change in reserves. The former
                                                                                           16


relationship gives an indication of the interaction between two measures of financial crisis
and, specifically, quantifies how reserves react to exchange rate changes. The latter
relationship should shed light on how important reserve changes were during the period in
driving the lack of credibility which we demonstrated in Section 3 was the norm in the 1960s.


5.1       Reserve changes and the expected rate of realignment


In this section we examine the extent to which the evident non-zero expected rate of
realignment was related to reserve changes over the period. First generation speculative
attack models emphasise the importance of poorly managed monetary and fiscal policy for
the evolution of a currency crisis and the ultimate attack on a currency (Krugman, 1979;
Obstfeld, 1984). Monetary/fiscal indiscipline should show up in reserves and they should be a
key driver of the expected rate of realignment. Of course, there may be an important degree
of endogeneity in such a relationship in the sense that if interventions are successful in
transitorily raising credibility there will be less reserve losses, thereby resulting in an
inconsistent coefficient estimate on the measure of reserves.12 In our econometric estimates
we account for such potential endogeneity using an instrumental variables estimator in which
the instruments are a constant and two lagged values of both the dependent and independent
variables. Additionally, since the model of Krugman is one in which capital controls are
absent, we do not expect the reserves/credibility relationship to conform exactly to that
predicted in the standard first generation speculative attack model. For example, it is well
known that the UK in the 1960s had partial capital controls in place and the existence of such
controls allowed the UK authorities to borrow to prolong the period before sterling had to be
devalued. In the base line speculative attack model, with no capital controls, the loss of
reserves is a characteristic of an attack and when this occurs borrowing new reserves cannot
prolong the life of the peg.13 Nonetheless, and as Wyplosz (1986) demonstrates in a variant of
the first generation model with capital controls, the relationship between reserves and
credibility should still exist in a modified form for our period.


We use three measures of reserve changes – for spot (rspot), gold (rgold) and total reserve
changes (rtotal) and provide two sets of coefficient estimates – GMM is an OLS estimate in

which the standard error has been corrected for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation using
a standard Newey-West damp factor, and GMMIV is an Instrumental variables estimate in
which the standard error has also been corrected for heteroskedasticity and serial correlation
using a standard Newey-West damp factor. The results are reported in Table 3 and with the
GMM results we see that for all three measures of reserves that there is a negative
relationship (note that to make the interpretation clear we are using the sterling-dollar rate)
between the expected rate of realignment and reserves, although this is statistically significant
only in the cases of gold and total reserves: in terms of gold reserves, a one percent
worsening of UK reserves produces a 0.1 percent increase in the expected rate of realignment
of sterling (sterling-dollar). Using the IVGMM estimator we note a much stronger
relationship between the reserve measures and credibility, although again the coefficient on
spot reserves is insignificant. The correction for endogeneity, therefore, produces a much
sharper relationship between reserves and credibility, with the coefficient rising by a factor of
10 in absolute terms. These results seem intuitive enough and provide confirmation of the
main message of first generation speculative attack models: namely, that poorly disciplined
macroeconomic policy, particularly monetary policy, will have serious implications for
reserves and the credibility of the peg (note since the UK had capital controls in the 1960s
our results cannot be seen as confirmation of a specific first generation speculative attack
model, such as Krugman). Further light may be shed on this by looking at the evolution of the
coefficient on reserves over time – is it relatively constant or does it change as a crisis
approaches?


                                         Table 3 here


In Figure 4 we report recursive estimates of the coefficient generated from the regression of
the expected rate of realignment on total reserves. The picture indicates that the weight
placed on reserves declines from the early 1960s down to mid 1964 and then rises steadily
until it peaks at the time of the devaluation in 1967. It would seem that the importance of
reserves loomed larger and larger as devaluation approached.


                                         Figure 4 here


5.2    Reaction functions
                                                                                               18


Reserve and exchange rate movements (both spot and forward rates) are often taken as
measures of financial crises and in this sub-section we attempt to link these two measures by
estimating reaction functions for sterling. A standard reaction function linking reserve
changes to the exchange rate is given as:
                                                             _
                        Δrt = λ0 + λ1Δrt −1 + λ2 ( st −1 − s t −1 ) + λ3Δst −1 ,



where the lagged reserve terms is included to allow for serial correlation in the change in
reserve process, the second term on the right hand side captures the deviation of the actual
exchange rate from some target or equilibrium level (as captured by s overbar) and the last
term is a standard leaning against the wind term. To be consistent with the extant reaction
function literature we define the exchange rate as the home currency price of a unit of foreign
currency (sterling-dollar) and take as the target exchange rate the reciprocal of the dollar
sterling lower point (2.77) which is 0.360: a depreciation of the exchange rate above this
point should trigger a reserve change to defend the currency.


The results from estimating variants of this reaction function are reported in Table 4. In the
first regression we exclude the ‘leaning against the wind’ term and find a significantly
negative coefficient on the deviation of the exchange rate from the edge of the band: a 1 per
cent depreciation of the rate above the band produces a 21 per cent change in reserves. In the
second specification we drop the deviation term and include the ‘leaning against the wind’
term. This also produces a significantly negative coefficient, although the magnitude is not as
large as for the deviation term. Finally, the last equation includes both exchange rate effects
and both appear statistically significant: the coefficient on the deviation term is similar to the
first regression whilst the coefficient on the leaning against the wind term is about double that
on the same term in equation 2.


                                                Table 4 here


Clearly then it would appear that the Bank during the 1960s was reacting to both exchange
rate pressure within the target zone bands – intra marginal intervention - and also intervening
at the lower band itself (marginal intervention) and that this intervention had a relatively
large effect on the reserve position.

6.     CONCLUSION


This paper has contributed to the literature on sterling by drawing on new archival sources of
information and fresh data on reserves and exchange market intervention. Our research shows
that the sterling peg became increasingly incredible in the 1964 to 1967 period as it flirted
with and fell below the lower credibility bands we estimated. Moreover we show that the
pound was propped up by international rescue loans from the G11 and the IMF. The peg
collapsed when the rescues ceased. Thus the new reserves data reveals that the UK’s
international reserves were inadequate at the same time as the credibility of the peg was low.
Indeed without the international rescues, sterling would have been forced to devalue earlier.
The addition to its reserves gave the British authorities the breathing room to manage the
inevitable exit from the sterling peg of $2.80. At the time, the monetary authorities found it
hard to admit to themselves that sterling was doomed.


The sterling crises represented key examples of a flaw of the Bretton Woods adjustment
mechanism under which overvalued countries reluctant to deflate were forced to adjust by
devaluation. The crises were good examples of first generation speculative attack models
driven by a growing inconsistency between the peg and the domestic fundamentals. The
crises also showed the operation of the famous trilemma which posits that pegged rates, open
capital accounts and independent financial policies cannot coexist. Under Bretton Woods
rules the trilemma was supposed to work because of capital controls. Like the crisis of the
1940s and 1950s, the crises of the 1960s showed that capital controls were porous.


Finally, although the crises of 1964 to 1967 were some of the most important milestones in
the saga of the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods system, devaluation also represented a
climacteric for sterling. The change in parity signalled the end of sterling as a major reserve
currency, bringing to a close a story going back to the mid-nineteenth century. The
devaluation also represented a breach of the first line of defence of the dollar as the linchpin
of the gold dollar standard that Bretton Woods had evolved into by the end of the 1960s.
Moreover, worse was to follow after the 1967 devaluation as the gold crisis in March 1968,
the rumours about an expected devaluation of the franc and possible revaluation of the
Deutschmark in the autumn of 1968 all impacted on sterling with the result that there were
further substantial reserve losses.

for the purpose of increasing the UK’s reserves of gold and foreign currencies; col. 3 excluding guaranteed sterling, special BIS and market
swaps and deposits and Israeli deposits and Swiss loan; col. 4 excludes IMF drawing but includes the dollar portfolio; col. 5 excludes the
