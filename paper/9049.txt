                                              ABSTRACT

        Corporate events, such as new issues and new lists, appear in waves. These waves imply that the
market portfolio has a time-varying weight in new lists, and one can decompose the market return into
a fixed weight return plus a timing return. Most of the reduction in aggregate market returns caused by
holding new lists comes from timing, not from average underperformance. When new lists are a high
fraction of the market, subsequent returns for both new and old lists are low. A mean variance optimizing
investor holding the market would be better off replacing holdings of new lists with old lists, t-bills, or
even currency stuffed in a mattress.

       The market, defined as the total value of publicly traded US equities, is an object of

intense interest in financial economics for obvious reasons. It represents the total net position of

all equity holders. Although one might be interested in many possible portfolios with associated

portfolio weights, the market portfolio with its value weights is a central concern. This paper

shows how to use these value weights to identify the sources of asset pricing puzzles and

understand their economic significance from the perspective of an investor who holds the

market. It constructs portfolios consisting of various subsets of the market, and decomposes

their contribution to market returns into components due to fixed weights and timing. Fixed

weight returns reflect the different portfolio’s average returns and their average weights in the

market portfolio. Timing returns reflect the effect of varying one’s exposure to different

portfolios (by changing the market weight given to each portfolio). This paper studies portfolios

based on new lists and shows that new lists reduce market returns mostly due to timing, not due

to the average underperformance of new lists.

       The market is often thought of as the epitome of a passive portfolio. But as emphasized

by Grossman (1995), the market is actually an actively managed portfolio due to incomplete

equitization of assets. When a nontraded firm decides to go public, the composition of the

market changes. This makes the market an active portfolio where the portfolio managers are

corporate managers who make decisions about holding assets and issuing securities. The market

portfolio automatically buys all new IPOs (initial public offerings) in proportion to their market

capitalization. Since IPOs come in waves, this rule means the market is taking bigger positions

in IPOs during waves.

       The goal of this paper is to understand the contribution of new lists to total returns on the

market. To do this, the paper introduces a simple method for decomposing the market into




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 1
subcategories that have time varying weights. The focus is new lists since that is the case most

cleanly matching the existing literature on IPOs.

       Consider the following two statements:

       1)         IPOs have returns that are lower than non-IPOs over the first few years

                  following issuance, but do not have lower risk.

       2)         An investor who is seeking to maximize his Sharpe ratio would prefer to shun

                  IPOs in the first few years following the IPO, rather than hold the market

                  portfolio which includes IPOs in proportion to their market capitalization.

At first glance, it seems that the two statements say the same thing, and that the answer to

statement (2) must be the same as statement (1). In fact, these two statements are different. It is

logically possible, for example, that it would be better to shun IPOs even if IPOs on average

have higher returns than nonissuers. The reason the statements differ is that (1) is static and

cannot accommodate the fact that IPOs come in waves. Within the framework of (2), one can

include the fact when holding the market, one is engaged in a dynamic strategy with time-

varying allocations to IPOs. The returns to dynamic strategies are significantly affected by the

covariance between the returns and portfolio weight of IPOs.

       A numerical example of the logical distinction is as follows. Suppose the risk free rate is

zero. At the beginning of year 1, suppose IPOs are one percent of the entire market, while at the

beginning of year 2, IPOs are ten percent of the market. Suppose the year 1 return for IPOs is 20

percent and for non-IPOs is 10 percent, while the year 2 return for IPOs is -10 percent and for

non-IPOs is -5 percent. The important feature of this example is that IPOs do relatively poorly

following “hot” markets where IPOs have larger weight. In this example, average calendar time

returns are 5 percent for IPOs and 2.5 for non-IPOs, so IPOs have average outperformance.




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 2
IPOs have a large positive α, and IPOs and non-IPOs have identical Sharpe ratios of 0.33. Thus

statement (1) is false. But the average calendar time market return is 2.3 percent with a Sharpe

ratio of 0.29, and since both of these numbers are less than non-IPO values, statement (2) is true:

one would be better off shunning IPOs entirely despite their average outperformance, and

replacing one’s IPOs with non-IPO stock. A further statement about this example, which

previews some results of this paper, is that it would be even better for one’s Sharpe ratio to

substitute cash holdings (rather than non-IPOs) for IPOs holdings, since when IPOs have greater

weight non-IPOs have low returns.

       Statement (1) is the traditional concern of an extensive literature on IPOs starting with

Ritter (1991). How to test hypotheses such as statement (1) is a hotly debated topic.1 Some

advocate using calendar time portfolios rather than event time (weighting each month equally

rather than weighting each observation equally) and value weighting rather than equal weighting

(within each month, weighting each stock’s return by its market capitalization). These two

procedures generally decrease the observed magnitude of mispricing. Loughran and Ritter

(1995, 2000) argue that calendar time returns obscure mispricing because they average over hot

markets (with high mispricing) and cold markets (with low mispricing).

       Statement (1) is an interesting economic hypothesis to examine, but from the perspective

of an investor it is not the only relevant question to ask. This paper tests statement (2). I use

calendar time value weighted portfolios, but take value weighting a step further to examine how

it affects the ultimate value weighted portfolio, the market. In doing so, I am able to identify the

timing component of investing in new lists, and address in a natural way the “windows of

opportunity” hypothesis put forth in Ritter (1991) and Loughran and Ritter (1995, 2000).

       The results show that is possible to beat the market, in terms of constructing a portfolio




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 3
with a higher Sharpe ratio, by deviating from market weights. This deviation involves both

average weights that are different from market weights, and time-varying weights that are

different from market weights. Thus the benefit of shunning new lists comes both from avoiding

the average underperformance of new lists and avoiding the timing strategy pursued by the

aggregate market. Most of this benefit comes from the timing component. One can earn higher

profits at lower risk by being contrarian: when the market is investing a lot in new lists,

underweight new lists relative to the market. The strategy of completely shunning new lists is

mispriced by the 3-factor model of Fama and French (1993).

       What do these results say about market efficiency? Testing for underperformance of

issuing firms is a joint test of market efficiency plus a specific asset pricing model. The

proponents of value weighting and the Fama French (1993) three-factor model have interpreted

previous failures to reject the null hypothesis as consistent with market efficiency. Thus by this

standard, the evidence presented here is evidence against market efficiency, at least along with

the joint hypothesis that the Fama French (1993) three-factor model is correct. Since the whole

basis of the analysis is market weights, one cannot dismiss this evidence as reflecting only a

small and economically unimportant part of the market.

       However, it is not obvious that the profitability of contrarian strategies in this setting

really says much about the rationality of market participants. For example, virtually any story

involving rational firms should have firms issuing equity and stock prices rising when future

expected returns fall. Thus, by itself, the existence of market timing does not distinguish

between rational and irrational stories. What is certainly rejected is any story involving constant

expected returns on all stocks or the same expected returns on new and old lists.

       The main contributions of this paper are first to present a general framework for




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 4
understanding the economic significance of market timing for any arbitrary portfolio, and second

to estimate the importance of market timing for the specific case of new lists over the period of

1926-2001. This paper is organized as follows. Section I presents the quantitative framework for

identifying market timing. Section II examines the evidence for new lists, and shows the relative

importance of timing and fixed weight components. Section III discusses the benefits of

shunning new lists from the perspective of a mean variance investor, and shows the dynamic

interpretation of seemingly static optimization techniques. Section IV looks at the more general

case of net corporate issuance. Section V looks briefly at decomposing the market based on

value, growth, and size. Section VI presents conclusions.

                         I.          A framework for evaluating time-varying weights

This section describes a simple framework for identifying the contribution of asset class timing

for total market returns in the case of K assets. The body of the paper focuses on the case of two

assets only, so the math is even easier.

       Consider K different value weighted portfolios with returns Rtk between the end of period

t-1 and t. Suppose one combines these portfolios into a single portfolio using value weights wk

for each asset, where the w’s sum to one. Value weights are based on market equity (ME) in the

previous period,

                     ME tk−1
(1)     w kt ≡     K

                 ∑ ME
                  j =1
                               j
                              t −1




Call the market portfolio using value weights M. The returns on the market are:

                 K
(2)     RtM = ∑ wtj Rt j
                 j =1




                                        Evaluating value weighting – Page 5
       One can always rewrite the return on M as

               K               K         K
(3)     RtM = ∑ wtj Rt j = ∑ w j Rt j + ∑ ( wtj − w j ) Rt j = FIXWEIGHTt +TIMINGt
               j =1           j =1       j =1



using the sample average of the time-series of weights. The first term, FIXWEIGHT, is the

return one would get using fixed weights to combine the K different portfolios,

                             K
(4)     FIXWEIGHTt = ∑ w j Rt j
                             j =1



The second term, TIMING, is a differential return one would get from a strategy that deviates

from the fixed weights in order to hold varying weights.

                      K
(5)     TIMINGt = ∑ ( wtj − w j ) Rt j
                      j =1



This decomposition is similar to standard performance attribution for portfolio managers, for

example in Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997), except that it uses market weights

instead of the weights of an individual portfolio manager.

       Using these definitions and taking averages, one can write the mean return on a portfolio

with time-varying weights as a function of the mean returns on its constituent components and

on the way the weights covary with returns:

                                                K       K
(6)     R M = FIXWEIGHT +TIMING = ∑ w j R j + ∑ cov ( w j , R j )
                                                j =1    j =1



A. The effect of excluding some portfolios

       One can use this framework to examine a specific economic hypothesis: what is the

benefit of including a particular set of assets in the market portfolio? Call this set “candidate”

portfolios. One can answer this question by calculating the returns that one would earn by

holding the market excluding this set of assets. Suppose one is interested in excluding portfolios




                                     Evaluating value weighting – Page 6
1 through K-1 from the market, and just holding portfolio K. For example, if one is interested in

the effect of excluding new lists, one could calculate the returns that one could earn on a

portfolio of old lists (portfolio K), and compare that with the actual market portfolio including

new lists (portfolio M). What would be the benefit of including the candidate assets in the

market portfolio using value weights? The answer is simple: just take the difference between the

market portfolio and the market excluding the assets in question: RtM - RtK . Once one has

calculated market returns and portfolio K returns, one can look at their properties, for example

mean, variance, Sharpe ratio, α, etc.

       This difference, RtM - RtK , is directly related to the framework of timing and fixed

weights. Since the portfolio weights have to add to one:

                              K-1                    K-1                  K-1
(7)             RtM - RtK = ∑ wtj ( Rt j - RtK ) =∑ w j ( Rt j - RtK ) + ∑ ( wtj − w j )( Rt j - RtK )
                              j =1                   j =1                 j =1



       The average difference is
                            K-1                      K-1
                R M - R K = ∑ w j ( R j - R K ) + ∑ cov (w j , R j − R K )
                            j =1                     j =1
                           K-1               K-1
(8)                      = ∑ FIXED j + ∑ TIMING j
                           j =1               j =1

                            = FIXED + TIMING

       This TIMING is the same as in equation (5). The variable FIXED is FIXWEIGHT minus

the return on portfolio K, and shows the differential return from holding the K different

portfolios in fixed weights rather than just holding portfolio K. FIXED shows the contribution

of average returns to the left hand side variable. The left hand side variable, R M - R K , is the

benefit in terms of average returns of including portfolios 1 through K-1 in the market portfolio

using value weights. If this number is negative, it shows that excluding the candidate portfolios




                                     Evaluating value weighting – Page 7
raises average returns.

        Thus excluding the candidate portfolios has two effects on average returns. The first is

that the candidate may have average returns that are different from the non-candidate. The

second is that by excluding the candidate, one is no longer involved in a strategy that changes the

weight of the candidate over time. The timing component is the focus of this paper.

B. Relation to other approaches

        The approach here is somewhat different from related work. Another way of

understanding the timing contribution is to see its relation to standard forecasting regressions.

For candidate j, average timing is cov (w j , R j − R K ) . If one runs a forecasting regression of

R j − R K on wj (which is in the information set at time t-1), the coefficient in this regression is

cov (w j , R j − R K ) var (w j ) . Thus the timing component is just a rescaled coefficient from a

predictive regression. The difference from other forecasting regressions is that this regression

coefficient has a special interpretation. It reflects not some arbitrary forecasting variable, but the

specific choices made by the market. The rescaled regression coefficient is measured in

meaningful units that show the economic size of the forecasting relation.

        The goal of this paper is to understand market weights and their dynamic properties. The

goal is not estimate optimal weights, optimal dynamic strategies, or the conditional mean-

variance frontier. The optimal weights are of course interesting objects to study (as is done for

example by Pastor and Stambaugh (2000) for the cross-section of stocks and by Barberis (2000)

for the time series of stocks vs. bonds). Yet another approach is to look at the portfolios chosen

by specific subsets of agents, for example individual vs. institutions (as is done in Barber and

Odean (2001)). In contrast, the focus here is on value weights coming from the market,

representing the net positions of all equity investors.

                                         II.     New Lists

       This paper examines new lists, defined as firms that newly appear in the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. Stocks are added to the CRSP database when they

first list on a major exchange. This definition follows Fama and French (2001) in identifying a

historically long and broad sample of new lists. New lists proxy for, but are not identical to,

IPOs. After 1973, most new lists are IPOs; prior to 1973, most new lists are stocks that were

previously traded over the counter before being added to the New York Stock Exchange.

       I examine new lists for three reasons. First, new lists are interesting in their own right.

They are similar to IPOS since listing reflects decisions made by firms based on market

conditions. Dharan and Ikenberry (1995) find that new lists earn low returns. Second, one can

construct a long time series of new lists going back to 1929. More data is always a good thing to

have for testing hypotheses: one wants more observations, and one wants samples in which the

independent variable has lots of variance. In the specific case of examining timing, one wants to

be able to observe periods in which the market weight in new lists varies a lot. As shown later, it

turns out that due to a wave of new lists in the late 1920’s, the 1920’s are a particularly important

and informative time. Third, the goal of this paper is to decompose the market returns as

commonly measured using the CRSP value weighted aggregate. To do this, one has to focus on

stocks that are in the CRSP database. Gompers and Lerner (2001) report that it is rare for recent

IPOs to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the period 1935-1972, and to study

IPOs in the pre-1973 era they are forced to collect return data by hand since recent IPOs are not

in CRSP (since they do not study the 1920’s it is unclear how many of that wave of new lists

were IPOs). Since the goal of this paper is to decompose CRSP returns, it is obvious that recent

IPOs can have no effect on CRSP returns if they are not in CRSP.




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 9
       In general, then, new lists are a proxy for IPOs and IPO-like stocks. Before 1973 they are

mostly not IPOs but are similar to IPOs in that they have not previously traded on major

exchanges, and have done well enough to be added to the exchange. The decision to list on a

major exchange, like the decision to do an IPO, is a corporate event reflecting both the

information possessed by firm management and market conditions.

A. The sample

       The sample includes everything that gets into the CRSP value weighted return series,

namely all securities on CRSP except American Depository Receipts. All stocks fall into two

categories: they are either new lists or old lists. Thus

(9)             RtM = (1 − wtLIST ) RtOLD + wtLIST RtLIST

A new list is any stock whose CRSP identifier PERMCO appears for the first time in CRSP, for

the first 36 months of its appearance, and which is not added as the result of a distribution of

some existing CRSP stock. Thus new lists include IPOs, carve-outs, and publicly traded firms

that move onto an exchange covered by CRSP, but exclude spin-offs. Any stock that is not a

new list is an old list. NYSE first appears in CRSP in December 1925, American Stock

Exchange (AMEX) in August 1962, and NASDAQ in January 1973; all stocks that enter in these

months on these exchanges are classified as old lists.

       The sample period is January 1929 to December 2001. The top part of Table I shows

summary statistics for new lists in the 876 months of the sample. On average, new lists are about

five percent of the total value of the market, varying over time between one and 15 percent.

Figure 1 shows the time-series behavior of the new list weight. It is clear that 1929/1930 and

1999/2000 were unusual historical episodes (the two peaks are May 1930 and March 2000).

       Researchers have studied waves of IPOs for many years. Ibbotson and Jaffe (1975) show



                                  Evaluating value weighting – Page 10
“hot” IPO markets, defined as periods with high initial returns from buying at the offer price, are

accompanied by a large number of new issues. In contrast, my interest is in waves that

significantly affect the composition of the market portfolio, and returns using market prices not

offer prices.

        Looking at returns after the initial day, Ritter (1991) and Loughran and Ritter (1995,

2000) find that IPO underperformance is larger when the number of IPOs is high. They

interpret this finding as consistent with windows of opportunity, where corporate insiders go

public when equity is overpriced (as would be predicted by Stein (1996), for example). Other

evidence is consistent with this hypothesis. Corporate managers certainly say they are trying to

time the market (Graham and Harvey (2001)). Contemporary observers also describe the waves

as opportunistic behavior by firms and underwriters. Benjamin Graham described the wave in

1929 as “a wholesale and disastrous relaxation of the standard of safety previously observed by

the reputable houses of issue” (Graham and Dodd (1934) p 9) and the smaller wave in 1968-69

as “unprecedented outpouring of issues of lowest quality, sold to the public at absurdly high

offering prices and in many cases pushed much higher by heedless speculation…the familiar

combination of greed, folly, and irresponsibility...” (Graham (1973) p. 142). These comments

may resonate for those who lived through the events of 1999/2000.

B. Results for new lists

        The average returns in Table I show the main results of this paper. In the language of

Section I, the candidate portfolio is new lists. The total effect of including new lists on average

market returns is shown by the average value of RM - ROLD. New lists cause the average return

to fall by 1.7 basis points per month. 2 The t-statistic on this difference is 2.4. Another way of

saying this result is that a portfolio of old lists significantly outperforms the market by 1.7 basis




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 11
points per month. This result tells us that excluding the candidate, new lists, has a statistically

significant effect on the average market return.

       Is 1.7 basis points per month big or small? There are several ways of interpreting the

magnitude of the effect. First, since the average excess return on the market is about 61 basis

points per month, 1.7 basis points is three percent of the whole equity risk premium (similarly,

Section III shows that Sharpe ratios rise about four percent by holding only old lists).

Considering that new lists are only five percent of the market on average, a three percent

reduction in excess returns is sizeable. Second, it is useful to compare with pre-existing results

and a world of fixed weights. Ritter (1991) reports cumulative abnormal returns (IPO returns

minus matched firm returns) of -29 percent over 36 months. Under constant weights of 0.046,

the total effect on RM - ROLD would be -3.7 basis points per month. So of the total, controversial

amount of 3.7 basis points per month, I find about half when value weighting. Third, one can

compare the magnitude of this effect with other celebrated asset pricing patterns. Section V

looks at value and growth firms, and finds total effects (timing plus fixed weight) of 4.5 basis

points for value and 7.6 basis points for growth. Thus the new list effect has the same order of

magnitude as value or growth, though is somewhat smaller (due largely to the fact that new lists

are a smaller fraction of the market). In sum, then, 1.7 basis points does not look small.

       One can split this 1.7 basis point effect into two components using equation (8). The

average value of FIXED is w LIST ( R LIST − R OLD ) and the average value of TIMING is

cov ( w LIST , R LIST − R OLD ) . Table I shows that 1.1 basis points are due to timing while 0.6 basis

points are due to fixed weights. Thus more than half the effect comes from timing. The timing

component has a t-statistic of about 3, while the fixed weight component is insignificant at

conventional levels.


                                Evaluating value weighting – Page 12
       This result, that timing is significantly negative and accounts for most of the decrease in

market return, is the main contribution of this paper. The previous literature has focused on the

average value of FIXED, that is, whether new lists and old lists have different average returns

(after risk-adjusting). Table I shows only weak evidence that FIXED is negative (the next table

shows that risk-adjusting using multifactor models also gives weak evidence for FIXED). Table

I shows that most of the economic significance of new lists comes not from FIXED, but from

TIMING. To understand how an investor holding the market is hurt by new lists, one must

understand the dynamic way in which the market weights new lists. TIMING is strongly

negative, and as shown in the next two tables, is robust to different ways of measuring and risk

adjusting.

       The bottom part of Table I shows correlations. The correlation between the new list

weight and differential returns on new minus old lists is -0.13. This negative correlation is

another measure of the negative covariation that drives the mean value of TIMING. As it turns

out, the new list weight is also negatively correlated with excess returns on new lists and on old

lists. Thus when new lists are a large fraction of the market, both new and old lists subsequently

have low returns, with new lists having lower returns than old.

C. Why different measures give different results

       Different ways of posing the question lead to different results. The traditional approach

has been to look at the return on a portfolio of new lists and risk-adjust using matching firms,

using market returns, or using factor regressions. This subsection discusses why market-

adjusting fails to capture timing. Later, section III.B discusses the issues involving α.

       Table I shows that market adjusting new lists give weak results. New lists do not

significantly underperform the market on average, since the t-statistic on RLIST - RM is only 1.2




                              Evaluating value weighting – Page 13
(similarly, Fama and French (2001) find that market-adjusted new list returns are not

significantly different from zero).3

       Why do RLIST - RM and RM – ROLD give such different answers? The effect of

subtracting the market return from the candidate portfolio is straightforward:

(10)             RtLIST - RtM = (1 − wtLIST )( RtLIST - RtOLD )

                         1 − w LIST
(11)    R LIST - R M =              FIXED − TIMING
                           w LIST

Market-adjusting the candidate just combines the two components in a different way. First,

when w is small it gives greater weight to the fixed weight component. Second, it gives the two

effects the opposite sign, so they tend to cancel out. Thus market-adjusted returns cannot tell the

whole story.

       The fact that the fixed weight return and market-adjusted return on new lists are

insignificantly different from zero, but the timing component is not, shows the importance of

looking at new lists in the context of the market. Part of the debate over how to measure the

economic relevance of an asset class involves which methodology is most relevant for actual

investors. For example, Lyon, Barber, and Tsai (1999) argue that one should use buy-and-hold

returns (rather than monthly returns) because they “precisely measure investor experience.”

However, Table I gives a different insight on investor experience, since the net equity position of

all investors is the market. Looking at new lists in isolation, they have a mean return that is

certainly higher than t-bills and a healthy Sharpe ratio similar to the market. But looking at RM –

ROLD, it is clear an investor would be better (in terms of mean returns) by shunning new lists.

Previous results have looked at new list returns in the context of the whole market by either

market adjusting or by running CAPM regressions and showing α and β. But these techniques




                                   Evaluating value weighting – Page 14
do not evaluate the dynamic strategy pursued by the market, and thus don’t put new list returns

in proper context.

D. Regression results

       Table II contains regression results for new lists. For clarity it shows several different

ways of expressing the basic point, although as a result some columns contain redundant

information. Table II shows α from various factor models, showing risk adjusted returns. The

first model is the CAPM. The second is the Fama and French (1993) three-factor model, which

includes the excess market return, SMB (the return on small stocks minus big stocks) and the

HML (the return of high book-market stocks minus low book-market stocks). The last is a four-

factor model as in Carhart (1997) which adds a price momentum factor, UMD (the return of

stocks with high prior year returns minus stocks with low prior year returns).4 The table shows α

for the CAPM and the three-factor models, and shows the complete regression results for the

four-factor model. Table II also shows results splitting the sample approximately in half before

and after August 1962 (the date when AMEX firms enter CRSP).

       Column’s (1) and (2) are traditional excess returns on the portfolio of old and new lists.

Column (1) shows that old lists have a positive α with respect to the market, the three-factor

model, and the four-factor model. The table shows these positive α’s are stable and significant

both before and after 1962. This is one way of seeing the basic result that one would be better

off shunning new lists. Shunning new lists is not a difficult strategy to pursue: it does not require

any costly information gathering or frequent trading. Investors just need to refrain from buying

new lists until 36 months have passed.

       Column (2) shows excess returns for new lists. New lists have negative α’s, but only

strongly significant for the four-factor model. Based on these results alone, one would not think




                              Evaluating value weighting – Page 15
there is strong evidence that new lists are mispriced. It turns out, as shown in section III.B, that

α can reflect dynamic portfolio weights in unexpected ways. Looking at the factor loadings, it

appears that new list returns behave like small growth stocks with positive price momentum.

Column (5) shows market-adjusted returns on new lists. Since the market return is already on

the right hand side in all regressions, α in column (5) is identical to α in column (2). Again, the

market-adjusted raw return of -12 basis points is far from significant. In summary, by most

measures the underperformance of new lists is insignificant.

          Column (3) shows the difference between market and old lists return. This statistically

significant difference of 1.7 basis points is the central measure of the cost of holding new lists

using market weights, and is the number that is decomposed in columns (6) and (7). The α’s is

of course identical to column (1), and show that the 1.7 basis point number is basically

unaffected by various risk corrections.

          Column (4) shows the differential return approach of subtracting old lists from new lists.

This return differential of 14 basis points per month is insignificantly different from zero,

although the CAPM and four-factor α’s are more than two standard errors from zero.

          Column (6) shows the timing component of column (3). In terms of mean return, the

timing component is 1.1 basis points per month, and the full samples α’s range from 1.2 to 0.9,

all significant. The strength of the timing results (the t-statistics are around three) contrasts with

the weakness of the fixed weight component shown in column (7) (the estimates in column (7)

are simply five percent of the estimates in column (4)). The robustness of TIMING shows that

the central result of this paper is not caused by measurable risk exposure or by a specific sample

period.

          In summary, Table II shows that there is a significant cost to holding new lists, to the




                                 Evaluating value weighting – Page 16
tune of 1.7 basis points per month for the investor holding the market. More than half of this

cost comes from the timing feature of holding new lists. The timing component is mispriced by

the CAPM, and three- and four-factor models, and is present in both halves of the sample period.

E. Robustness tests

       Table III shows robustness tests. First, it looks at only common stock as is typical in

previous work. In calculating the two components, non-common stock gets discarded and does

not appear in the return series or in the weights (the right-hand-side factors are all calculated in

the regular way, however). This change has no effect. The main body of the paper includes non-

common stock because the point is to decompose the standard market return, which includes

non-common stock. Further, it is not clear why one would want to arbitrarily exclude other

classes of stock, such as closed end funds, from the analysis. If one is interested in the

hypothesis that new issues appear in response to mispricing, closed-end funds are valuable

evidence to examine. Indeed, relative mispricings, such as those found in closed end funds or

intercorporate holdings (as in Lamont and Thaler (2001)) are one of the few ex ante ways of

knowing whether an IPO is overpriced.5

       Table III also looks at equal weighting instead of value weighting in calculating the

decomposition. Here the analysis decomposes returns for the equal weighted CRSP return

instead of the value weighted return, and the waves are in the number of new lists instead of the

market value of new lists. As is usual, equal weighting makes the effects bigger.

       Table III next looks at a definition of timing that could be implemented in real time. The

timing portfolio previously used involves the average weights over the entire 1929-2001 sample

period, a number that could not be known in 1929. “Real timing” replaces the average weight

calculated over the entire period with a backward looking weight that uses the sample average up




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 17
to month t (thus the number of observations used to compute this weight grows over time). This

series starts in 1934, so that a minimum of five years is available. The table shows that this

change has little effect, lowering mean timing from 1.1 to 0.8 basis points.

       The last part of Table III shows the effect of different sample periods (in addition to the

subperiods shown in Tables II). First, it shows the effect of starting in 1973, when NASDAQ

firms get added to CRSP. After this date, most new lists are IPOs. The table shows that this

change makes mean TIMING higher, rising to 1.6 basis points (although standard errors also rise

substantially). Figure 2 is helpful in understanding the different periods. It shows that the timing

returns are highly variable at the beginning and end of the 1929-2001 period (not surprisingly,

given the higher portfolio weights at these points). The 1999/2000 period is particularly volatile,

and helps explain why the standard errors rise so much. In terms of the three-factor model,

Ritter and Welch (2002) find that the 1999/2000 period has an extreme effect on three-factor

regressions, and argue that one should be especially wary of three-factor α’s in this period.

       To see whether the late 1990’s are driving the results, the last rows of Table III show the

effect of looking at 1973-1998. Here mean TIMING drops from 1.6 to 1.0, while the standard

error drops in half as the highly variable end period is excluded. Timing is strongly significant in

this subperiod as well.

       In summary, the average value of the timing component of new lists is robust to alternate

sample periods and alternate methods of calculation.

F. Predictive ability of portfolio weights for returns

       This subsection examines more traditional regression evidence on the predictive power of

new list portfolio weights for subsequent returns. As shown in Table I, both market excess

returns and differential returns between new and old lists are negatively correlated with the new




                              Evaluating value weighting – Page 18
list weight. To understand how this covariation is related to the timing component, it is

important to recognize that average TIMING is only non-zero if the portfolio weight covaries

with the differential between the two classes of stock. One can look at the two separate

components of timing:

(12)     TIMING = cov ( w LIST , R LIST − R OLD ) = cov ( w LIST , R LIST − R F ) − cov ( w LIST , ROLD − R F )

         The fact that the average value of timing is the difference between these two covariances

reflects the fact that this timing component is not about timing the whole market. Rather, timing

reflects the ability of the weights to forecast differential returns. Put differently, timing can only

be non-zero if the weights have different forecasting ability for excess returns on new and old

lists.

         The timing component thus reflects the fact that when holding the market, one has to sell

old lists in order to buy new lists. Since (as shown in Table I) returns on both old and new lists

are negatively correlated with the new list weight, these two covariances tend to offset each other

as in equation (12). The fact that one is buying new lists when they have low returns is offset by

the fact that one is selling old lists when they too have low returns. This effect makes it harder to

reject the null hypothesis that TIMING has mean zero.

         The first column of Table IV examines the covariance between portfolio weights and

subsequent differential portfolio returns. It shows that the new list weight negatively forecasts

subsequent returns of new lists minus old lists.6 This regression coefficient is just a rescaled

TIMING average, as discussed in Section I.B. The rest of the columns in Table IV show how

the portfolio weights predict aggregate returns. This predictive power is logically distinct from

the predictive power for differential returns between new and old lists. The table shows that the

new list weight is a powerful forecaster of future returns, even in the presence of other variables



                                   Evaluating value weighting – Page 19
such as scaled aggregate prices.

       The first aggregate return regression shows that the new list weight is a significant

predictor of excess returns on the market. The next column shows a forecasting regression with

market excess returns on the left-hand-side and the price/dividend (P/D) ratio on the right hand

side, along with the T-bill yield. The P/D ratio does not do well, mostly because the last few

years of the sample were not kind to the forecasting relation. The second column shows that the

ratio of price to the last 10 years earnings, P/E10, does somewhat better (both these scaled price

variables come from Shiller’s web page).

       The next two columns add the new list weight. This variable comes in strongly negative,

and drives the P/E10 variable out of significance. The results show that when the market is

overweight in new lists, market excess returns are subsequently low. These results suggest that

firms issue equity when expected returns on equity are low (or when equity prices are high).

       The last two columns in Table IV look at annual forecasting regressions for market

excess returns. These regressions include the variable SHARE from Baker and Wurgler (2000).

Baker and Wurgler (2000) show that aggregate equity issuance negatively forecasts aggregate

stock returns, which they interpret as managers issuing equity when it is overpriced. Their

variable is the ratio of gross equity issues to the sum of gross equity issues and gross debt issues.

SHARE is a similar variable to the portfolio weights; both use the dollar amount of new issues

scaled by some other variable. They differ in that the portfolio weight scales by the value of the

market where SHARE scales by the value of financing (SHARE also uses issues for a single year

rather than the last three years). The first annual regression shows that both measures come in

negative and significant. The second shows that with the addition of P/E10 and the T-bill yield,

the coefficient on the new list portfolio weight falls and is less than two standard errors away




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 20
from zero. Thus it appears that the new list weight combines information in the price level and in

SHARE, but does not add much new information (the new list weight has an annual correlation

of 0.39 with P/E10 and 0.20 with SHARE).

              III.    An investment perspective on new lists and market timing

A. Benefits of shunning new lists

       Tables I-II show that holding new lists results in lower mean returns, and that the

difference in returns (between the market and a portfolio that shuns new issue lists) has a

negative α. How much would a mean-variance investor benefit by shunning new lists? This

question cannot be answered by α because α is not designed to describe dynamic strategies.

       Table V shows an investment perspective on new lists. This perspective examines

various different portfolios that investors might want to hold, instead of holding the market. The

top part of Table V shows some simple portfolio strategies, while the bottom part shows the

result from textbook portfolio optimization techniques. The first row in Table V shows that the

Sharpe ratio for the market during this period was 0.109 using monthly excess returns. The next

row shows that by substituting old for new lists, an investor can raise his mean return and lower

his standard deviation. In this sense, one can meaningfully say that a mean-variance optimizing

investor would be better off by doing the substitution. New lists are inferior to old lists.

       A further question one could ask is: are new lists inferior to T-bills? The answer is yes.

The next row shows the result one would get by replacing new lists in the market with T-bills.

Again, this is dynamic strategy that holds different weights at different times. Table V shows

that an investor could boost his Sharpe ratio 7.3 percent higher than the market, using this simple

strategy. By doing the substitution, one is engaged in a contrarian strategy that underweights the

market when new issues are booming. It is bearish during waves of IPOs. The improved Sharpe




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 21
ratio reflects the fact that wLIST forecasts negative returns on both old and new issues.

       The next row shows the effect of substituting cash for new lists. Cash is defined as non-

interest-bearing currency that has return zero. Even this primitive form of investment is superior

to new lists from the perspective of a mean-variance investor who is currently holding the

market. Thus it seems that by any reasonable benchmark, “investing in firms issuing stock is

hazardous to your wealth” as claimed by Loughran and Ritter (1995), at least for investors

looking to maximize their Sharpe ratios. To explain these low returns in a rational risk-based

equilibrium framework, one would need to find some reason that new issues are “safer” than

currency or are providing insurance to investors.

B. Understanding optimal portfolios

       Although it is not immediately apparent, the dynamic nature of market weights is a

pervasive issue in empirical finance. An example is standard portfolio analysis when both the

market and other equity portfolios are being considered. Whenever one calculates optimal

portfolios weights for mean variance efficiency where one of the constituent portfolios is a

subset of another, one is implicitly constructing a dynamic strategy. The bottom part of Table V

shows portfolio weights generated using standard mean variance calculations based on the

sample period means, variances, and covariances,

       Consider the meaning of the α of -0.197 for new lists versus the market, reported in Table

II. A well-known result from portfolio theory is that a negative α implies that one can construct

a portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio than the market by combining a long position in the market

with a short position in the left hand side portfolio. Table V shows that this optimal combination

of new lists and the market happens to be 200 percent long in the market and 100 percent short in

new lists. Call these weights the “apparent” weights. This combination results in a higher




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 22
Sharpe ratio of 0.128. On the face of it, this optimal portfolio looks like a static combination of

two portfolios. In fact, this portfolio is a dynamic strategy with a peculiar constraint. Since the

market is a weighted combination of old and new lists as in equation (9), the implied weights on

new and old lists are a function of the apparent weights. The constraint is that if the apparent

weight on new lists is a constant x, the implied weight on new lists must be x + (1-x) wtLIST .

Since x is 100 percent in this case, the implied weights are -1 + 2 wtLIST , and based on the fact that

average wtLIST is five percent, this portfolio has an average weight of -91 percent in new lists. In

order to get a constant of negative one in the implied weight, the optimizer is forced to put a

positive two in front of wtLIST . Thus instead of following a contrarian strategy of underweighting

new lists when they are a large fraction of the market, it is constrained to dynamically

overweight them. Thus a simple α actually embodies a convoluted compromise between

(productive) average underweighting and (counterproductive) timing.

        The next row in Table V shows the optimal combination of old and new lists, without

using the market as one of the constituent portfolios. Here the optimizer is able to achieve a

constant weight of -92 percent in new lists, similar to the average weight before, but without

being forced to engage in a counterproductive timing strategy. Consequently, the Sharpe ratio

rises slightly.

        The last row of Table V shows the optimal combination of three portfolios: the market,

old lists, and new lists. The optimizer now has two parameters (instead of one) to choose, and

consequently it can engineer a strategy that has both a low average weight in new lists and a

contrarian weighting during waves of new lists. The average weighting in new lists is -39

percent. The huge contrarian coefficient of -40.56 on the weight on new lists implies that when

new lists reach their peak of 15 percent of the market, the strategy has a weight of -460 percent


                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 23
in new lists. When new lists reach their low of one percent of the market, the strategy has a

weight of 107 percent in new lists. This ability to engage in productive timing boosts the Sharpe

ratio of this strategy to 0.156.

        Thus the conclusions from Table V are that the market is far from the optimal portfolio

combining new and old lists. Going from the market to the optimal combination, the Sharpe

ratio increases from 0.109 to 0.156. As before, most of the benefit comes not from avoiding the

average underperformance but rather from avoiding (or doing the opposite of) the waves of new

lists. A static combination alone raises Sharpe ratios to only 0.128. To get the full benefit of the

optimal strategy, dynamic weightings are necessary.

                                     IV.     Net corporate issuance

        This section broadens the analysis to examine more generally all corporate events that

affect the composition of the market, not just new lists. An investor who is holding the market

portfolio has to respond to any event that changes the number of shares outstanding of a

particular old list stock. For example, he has to buy in response to seasoned equity offerings

(SEOs) and sell in response to repurchases. Ikenberry, Lakonishok, and Vermaelen (1995) find

that firms repurchasing their own stock have high subsequent returns. Loughran and Ritter

(1995) find that firms doing SEOs have low subsequent returns. This evidence is consistent with

the idea that firms take advantage of overpricing to sell stock, and take advantage of

underpricing to buy stock back.

        This section jointly examines these actions by looking at net new issues by corporations.

Net new issues are events that change the number of (split-adjusted) shares of the firm. In

addition to IPOs and new lists, share increasing events include SEOs, stock-financed

acquisitions, and exercise of stock options. Share decreasing events include open market




                                   Evaluating value weighting – Page 24
repurchases and tender offers. All these events reflect conscious choices by firms, and might be

considered economically equivalent. For example, the number of shares increases when an

executive exercises options. Although this event does not involve the firm selling shares to the

public, it is economically equivalent to the case where the firm sells equity, gives the proceeds to

the executive, and the executive buys stock. In both cases value is being transferred from

existing shareholders to the executive, and in both cases the existing shareholders have their

stake diluted.

A. Change in the number of shares

       The total capitalization of the market at any period t is the sum of listed stocks that were

not in the market 36 months ago, plus the sum of listed stocks that were. So far I have been

focusing on this distinction. I now further subdivide the market capitalization of old lists into

three portfolios: the market equity of old lists in proportion to their shares outstanding 36 months

(portfolio LAG), plus the market equity of firms in proportion to their newly added shares over

the past 36 months (portfolio PLUS) , minus the market equity of firms in proportion to their

decrease in shares over the past 36 months (portfolio MINUS). Let there be N old lists with split

adjusted shares outstanding of Q. Let ADD be a dummy variable equal to 1 if the number of

shares outstanding increases between t-36 and t. Then the entire market equity of old lists is:

                               Nt            Nt             Nt
                 ME OLD
                    t   = ∑ Pti Qit = ∑ Pti Qit-36 + ∑ Pti ( Qit -Qit-36 )
                               i=1           i=1            i=1
                    Nt               Nt                           Nt
(13)             = ∑ Pti Qit-36 + ∑ Pti ( Qit -Qit-36 ) ADD t + ∑ Pti ( Qit -Qit-36 ) (1-ADD t )
                   i=1               i=1                          i=1

                 = ME    LAG
                         t     + ME   PLUS
                                      t      + ME   MINUS
                                                    t



       The same stocks appear in both LAG and either PLUS or MINUS. MEMINUS is a

negative number that shows how much the total market equity of old lists has decreased due to

repurchases and other share decreasing events.


                                     Evaluating value weighting – Page 25
       Using these three portfolios, one can now decompose the market into four portfolios:

LIST, PLUS, MINUS, and LAG. The first three are the candidate portfolios that are collectively

net new issues. Thus the difference between market returns and returns on LAG are:

(14)            RtM − RtLAG =w tPLUS ( R tPLUS − RtLAG ) + w tMINUS ( R tMINUS − RtLAG ) + w tLIST ( R tLIST − RtLAG )

Thus wPLUS is the percent by which the total dollar value of the market is higher due to share

increases, while wMINUS is the percent by which it is lower due to share decreases (Daniel and

Titman (2001) study a related variable).

       And one can decompose this further into three fixed weight returns and three timing

returns. The timing and fixed weight components for new lists is the same as before, except now

using portfolio LAG instead of portfolio OLD in the calculation. Portfolio LAG and OLD

contain exactly the same set of old lists, but using slightly different portfolio weights.

       The returns in equation (14) are somewhat different from what one would calculate using

the traditional approach. A traditional value weighted calendar time return from a portfolio of

SEOs, for example, would consist of the same firms as PLUS, but with different portfolio

weights. The traditional return would weight each SEO firm according to its market equity.

Instead, PLUS weights each firm according to its market equity times the percent of the firm that

is newly issued. Thus a $1 billion stock that doubles its number of shares gets ten times the

weight of a $1 billion stock that issues ten percent more shares.

       As with new lists, there are costs and benefits from using only CRSP share data to

identify net issuance, rather than traditional databases of SEOs and repurchases. The benefit is

that one can construct a very long time series going back to 1929. One cost is that one is forced

to lump together various different corporate events. Another cost is that this method might be

particularly prone to errors in the CRSP database. There is no doubt that shares outstanding data



                                  Evaluating value weighting – Page 26
from CRSP contains numerous errors. In the course of this study I discovered numerous errors

(now corrected) in number of shares, mostly occurring in months surrounding stock splits or

distributions. Of course, this type of error affects any study involving market capitalization or

value weighting.

B. Empirical results

       Net new issues are nine percent of the market on average, ranging from two percent to 27

percent. This number is the percent of the market that is new lists, plus the percent that has been

added by old lists, minus the percent that has been subtracted by old lists. Looking within net

new issues, the PLUS and LIST portfolio are both around five percent of the market on average,

with the MINUS portfolio about one percent of the market on average. Figure 3 shows the

portfolio weights of PLUS and MINUS. Comparing figures 1 and 3, it is clear that new lists and

additional shares issued by old lists have weights that move together over time, both peaking at

the end of the 1920’s and 1990’s (the correlation is 0.56). Similarly, Loughran and Ritter (1995)

show that the number of SEOs and the number of IPOs are positively correlated in the period

1970-1990. Reductions in shares are negligible until the 1980s (as documented by Bagwell and

Shoven (1989), repurchases became popular then).

       Table VI show the timing and fixed weight components for net new issues and its three

parts. The total effect of net new issues is shown by RM – RLAG. The timing component for net

new issues is the sum of the three timing components for LIST, PLUS, and MINUS components,

and similarly for the fixed weight component.

       Overall, shunning net new issues would increase mean returns by 3.5 basis points per

month, and this quantity is not substantially changed by risk adjustment using the various factor

models. Operationally, holding LAG rather than the market is easy to do and places low




                              Evaluating value weighting – Page 27
informational demands on investors. Just hold all stocks in proportion to the shares outstanding

36 months ago, rather than in proportion to shares outstanding today.

       Of the 3.5 basis points, 2.2 are due to the fixed weight component and 1.3 are due to the

timing component. Most of this timing component comes from new lists, with the PLUS and

MINUS contributing almost nothing to the mean of the timing component. The timing

component is statistically indistinguishable from zero for PLUS and MINUS. Thus timing

appears important only for new lists, not for old lists doing net issuance. Similarly, Mitchell and

Stafford (2000) do not find much evidence in favor of a timing effect for SEOs, acquisitions, and

stock repurchases. In contrast, Loughran and Ritter (1995, 2000) find that underperformance of

SEOs is larger when the number of SEOs is high.

       The PLUS and MINUS fixed weight components are statistically different from zero,

with the expected result that both types of corporate events reduce market returns. In terms of

fixed weight returns, all three portfolios contribute to lower market returns, with new lists

contributing seven basis points, share increases contributing 11 basis points, and share decreases

contributing three basis points. The fixed weight component is not much affected by the various

factor models and is stable over the two subperiods.

       To summarize, almost all of the timing contribution comes from new lists. For share

increases and decreases, there is little evidence for timing, but ample evidence for fixed weight

returns causing a lower market return.

                         V.      Comparison to growth, value, and size

       This section briefly examines growth, value, and size using the framework of this paper.

Setting aside the topic of new issues, it measures the impact of the market’s dynamic weighting

of stocks sorted into various categories. This measurement is useful both for comparing to new




                              Evaluating value weighting – Page 28
lists, and for testing whether these portfolios have time-varying expected returns. Before

discussing the specific results, it is useful to lay out what might be expected for the timing

component. If there are time-varying expected returns (perhaps due to temporary mispricing) on

different categories of assets, the timing effect should be negative. For example, by holding

growth stocks using market weights, investors are giving low weight to growth when it is cheap,

and high weight when it is expensive. According to this view, by leaning against the wind and

holding growth stocks in fixed weights one can earn higher return.

       Table VII first looks at the effect of excluding growth stocks, defined as stocks in the

bottom 30 percent of book-market (B/M) using NYSE breakpoints. Book values come from an

updated version of the data in Davis, Fama, and French (2000), generously supplied by Ken

French. Growth stocks are 49 percent of the market on average. Excluding these stocks has a

surprisingly small effect. The portfolio excluding growth stocks has mean returns that are 8

basis points higher than the market. Neither this effect nor its timing and fixed weight

components are statistically distinguishable from zero. There is no evidence that the timing

component is different from zero using the various factor models.

       Looking at value (the top 30 percent of B/M) rather than growth, there is again little

evidence for timing ability. Value stock are 17 percent of the market on average. They have

returns that are significantly higher than non-value stock returns. Last, looking at small stocks

(defined as firms in the bottom 30 percent of market capitalization using NYSE breakpoints),

there is a bit of evidence for timing in mean returns but not much after risk-adjusting using the

CAPM or the factor models.

       In summary, although growth, value, and small firms all have timing components with

the expected negative sign, none of the timing effects are strongly significant. It appears that




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 29
statistically significant timing is confined to new lists. Of course, this analysis uses no

conditioning information other than value weights. Other variables (for example the ratio of

market weights to book weights as in Cohen, Polk, and Vuolteenaho (2001)) might produce

different results.

                                          VI.    Conclusions

        This paper presents a framework for understanding the contribution of particular asset

classes to market returns. The framework decomposes market returns into the returns due to the

average performance of asset classes and their average weight in the market, and the returns due

to the implicit dynamic strategy that the market takes in different asset classes. This framework

can be used for any asset classes with fluctuating weights. One cause of fluctuating weights is

waves of corporate events. For the specific case of new lists, the results show that waves of new

lists are negatively correlated with differential returns on new minus old lists. Most of the effect

of new lists on the total market comes from this timing component. Unlike other phenomena,

such as value, growth, or new share issues by existing firms, for new lists the timing component

is a central part of the story.

        There are several benefits to this framework. First, it connects various disparate pieces of

information (such as average underperformance, waves, and predictive regressions for returns)

and shows how they fit together to affect the market portfolio. Second, it provides a measure of

the economic significance (as opposed to statistical significance) of timing. Third, it reveals the

perils of studying asset pricing phenomena in isolation. Looked at in isolation, the

underperformance of new lists is not terribly strong. Only in the context of the overall market

can one see the true costs of holding new lists. This context is necessary because it is not always

obvious how the dynamic nature of the market changes inferences about asset pricing.




                                  Evaluating value weighting – Page 30
A. Interpretation of results

       The fact that issuances are negatively correlated with future returns does not, by itself,

say much about the rationality of stock prices. If expected returns on equities fall relative to

other assets, one would expect to see firms issuing equity whether or not the stock market is

rational. This statement holds true for both differential returns and aggregate returns. Not only

do new lists do poorly when the market heavily weights new lists; old lists also do poorly.

       It turns out that the portfolio weight that the market puts in new lists is a powerful

forecaster of aggregate market returns. One possible explanation is that when expected returns

fall, firms issue equity in order to invest in physical capital; consistent with this story, Lamont

(2000) shows that investment plans by corporations predict future excess stock returns. This

relation could reflect mispricing due to cognitive errors or sentiment. It could reflect changes in

rational risk premia. It could also have nothing to do with either mispricing or risk – perhaps

liquidity, taxes, or some other force is at work.

       For example, suppose for some reason equities become more liquid. In that case, equities

will have a lower required rate of return (the illiquidity premium falls), and companies should

rationally respond by issuing more equity (replacing illiquid debt, perhaps). This paper provides

some support for this explanation, since new lists as a percent of the market in 1929-2001

corresponds to patterns of liquidity and turnover presented in Jones (2002) and Chordia, Roll,

and Subrahmanyam (2001). On the other hand, section III shows that from a Sharpe ratio

perspective investors would be better off holding currency, the most liquid of all assets, rather

than IPOs, so a liquidity explanation may be implausible. And of course, new issues could still

be overpriced even if they are more liquid (Baker and Stein (2001) provide a model where

liquidity and mispricing go together.)




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 31
        Thus additional evidence is necessary to discriminate between rational and irrational

stories. Various pieces of circumstantial evidence from the period 1999/2000 hint at a

mispricing explanation, particularly for technology IPOs. As shown in Figure 1, the period

1999/2000 was an important episode in financial history, and it is useful to study it closely

because it is a very well documented case of alleged mispricing. First, Lamont and Thaler

(2001) show that there were several technology IPOs in the period that were blatantly overpriced

relative to other securities, but that short sale constraints prevented arbitrageurs from correcting

this overpricing. Second, Ofek and Richardson (2002) show that various IPO-related anomalies,

such as predictable declines in prices around the ending of lockups and predictable rises around

the ending of the quiet period, were more severe for internet IPOs in this period. These

predictable returns are consistent with mispricing. Third, Loughran and Ritter (2002) document

that during this period, average first day IPO returns exceeded 60 percent, far higher than the

historical mean. It is not clear exactly how this fact fits in, but it is clear that one way for IPOs to

get overpriced is for their price to rise in the first day. Fourth, various hard-to-quantify

phenomena occurred in the IPO market during this period that seem best described by words

such as “mania,””irrational,”or “sentiment.” In February 2000, chaos erupted in the street of

Hong Kong. Huge crowds gathered around 10 different banks. The police were called in to

maintain order. Some branches closed their doors, while others extended their hours to

accommodate the impatient mob. A bank run? Sort of. But instead of fighting to get their

money out, these people were fighting to get their money in. They were applying to subscribe to

the IPO of a new Internet company. It seems unlikely these investors thought that the IPO had a

low expected return but were willing to hold it due to its high liquidity or low risk.

        Any complete explanation for the timing phenomenon needs to address the comovement




                               Evaluating value weighting – Page 32
of several variables. Aggregate issuance, the level of aggregate stock prices, and aggregate

volume are all positively correlated over time. All three things peak in the late 1920’s and late

1990’s (with perhaps a lower middle peak in the late 1960’s). All three things are negatively

related to subsequent aggregate stock returns.

    Here the definition of a new list is a firm newly listed in the past three years, where Fama and

French (2001) look at the first three years separately. Their approach has the drawback of

producing portfolios that contain very few stocks in some months, creating high volatility and

high standard errors.

    Weiss (1989) and Peavey (1990) find that closed-end funds do poorly after their IPO. This

finding is consistent with the fact that they typically sell at a premium to their net asset value

initially (Klibanoff, Lamont, and Wizman (1998) mention an extreme example of the 92 percent

premium for the Taiwan fund two months after its inception). A piece of time series evidence

suggests another connection between IPOs and closed end funds: Lee, Shleifer and Thaler (1991)

find that IPO waves by operating companies correspond to times when closed end fund prices

are atypically high relative to NAV.

    A concern in this regression (and more generally in the TIMING measure) is spurious

predictability. Shultz (2001) discusses the possibility of “pseudo market timing” creating

spurious predictability of returns using waves of issuance. A well known small sample bias,

discussed in Stambaugh (1999), exists in this situation due to persistence in the independent

variable and covariance of shocks to new lists weights and new list returns. Using the formula

on page 273 of Campbell, Lo, and Mackinlay (1997), the bias is only -0.26, which is small

compared to the actual coefficient of 16.35.

Summary statistics for new lists

RM is the CRSP market return. RF is the t-bill portfolio return. ROLD is the return on old lists not newly
appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months. RLIST is the return on new lists newly appearing in CRSP in the
last 36 months. All returns are value weighted, monthly, in percent. wLIST is the portfolio weight of the
market in newly listed stocks, and has average value of w LIST over the entire sample period. FIXED is
w LIST ( RtLIST − RtOLD ) and TIMING is ( wtLIST − wLIST )( RtLIST − RtOLD ) . The sample period is January
1929 to December 2001.

Notes

RM is the CRSP market return. RF is the t-bill portfolio return. ROLD is the return on old lists not
newly appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months. RLIST is the return on new lists newly appearing
in CRSP in the last 36 months. All returns are value weighted, monthly, in percent. wLIST is the
portfolio weight of the market in newly listed stocks, and has average value of w LIST over the
entire sample period. FIXED is w LIST ( RtLIST − RtOLD ) and TIMING is
(wt
   LIST
          − wLIST )( RtLIST − RtOLD ) . The CAPM α is the intercept term from a regression on RM - RF.
The three-factor α is the intercept term from a regression on the three variables of Fama and
French (1993), including the excess market return, SMB (the return on small stocks minus big
stocks) and the HML (the return of high B/M stocks minus low B/M stocks). The four-factor
model adds UMD, a momentum factor reflecting the return of stocks with high prior year returns
minus stocks with low prior year returns. Pre-1962 is prior to August 1962. Post-1962 is after
July 1962. The table shows four-factor loadings as well as α. The sample period is January 1929
to December 2001. Standard errors in parentheses.

Table III
Robustness tests for timing

The table shows the average value of TIMING and its α’s for different specifications and time
periods. RM is the CRSP market return. RF is the t-bill portfolio return. ROLD is the return on old
lists not newly appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months. RLIST is the return on new lists newly
appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months. All returns are value weighted, monthly, in percent.
wLIST is the portfolio weight of the market in newly listed stocks, and has average value of
 wLIST over the entire sample period. TIMING is ( wtLIST − wLIST )( RtLIST − RtOLD ) . The CAPM α
is the intercept term from a regression on RM - RF. The three-factor α is the intercept term from a
regression on the three variables of Fama and French (1993), including the excess market return,
SMB (the return on small stocks minus big stocks) and the HML (the return of high B/M stocks
minus low B/M stocks). The four-factor model adds UMD, a momentum factor reflecting the
return of stocks with high prior year returns minus stocks with low prior year returns. “Common
stock only” uses only stock with CRSP share code 10 or 11 in the calculation of the old and new
list portfolios returns and weights. “Equal weighted” replaces all value weights with equal
weights. “Real timing” uses average weights calculated as the average of all weights up to
month t, provided at least 5 years of data are available. For common stock only and equal
weighted, the sample period is January 1929 to December 2001. For all regressions, the factors
on the right hand side are calculated in the regular way. Standard errors in parentheses.

Table IV
Predictive power of new list portfolio weight for returns

Forecasting regressions of returns on portfolio weights. The dependent variable is RLIST – ROLD in the first
column and RM - RF in the other columns. ROLD is the return on old lists, a portfolio of stocks that have
not newly appeared in CRSP in the last 36 months. RLIST is the return on new lists, a portfolio of stocks
that have newly appeared in CRSP in the last 36 months. wLIST is the portfolio weight of the market in
newly listed stocks. RM - RF is the excess return on the CRSP value weighted market. P/D is the ratio of
current price to past year dividends for the S&P Composite index. P/E10 is the market ratio of current
price to average earnings per share over the past 10 years, for the S&P Composite index. BILLYIELD is
the t-bill yield. SHARE is the equity share over the past year, calculated as gross equity issues divided by
gross equity issues plus gross debt issues. All returns are value weighted, monthly, in percent. For
monthly regressions the sample period is January 1929 to December 2001. For annual regressions (the
last two columns only) the sample period is 1929 to 2000. Regressions include a constant term, not
shown. Standard errors in parentheses.

Table V
Sharpe ratios and portfolio weights

The table shows Sharpe ratios and portfolio weights for different portfolios. RM is the CRSP market
return. RF is the t-bill portfolio return. ROLD is the value weighted return on a portfolio of stocks that have
not newly appeared in CRSP in the last 36 months. wLIST is the portfolio weight of the market in newly
listed stocks. “Substitute t-bills for new lists” is the return (1- wLIST)(ROLD - RF). “Substitute t-bills for
cash” is the return (1- wLIST)ROLD - RF. “Apparent weights” are (seemingly static) portfolio weights
produced by a standard mean variance optimizer using means, variances, and covariances from
the full sample period. “Implied weights” are the (possibly time-varying) portfolio weights in
new and old lists implied by the apparent weights. The sample period is January 1929 to
December 2001.

Notes

RM is the CRSP market return. RF is the t-bill portfolio return. RLAG is the return on a portfolio
of stocks not newly appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months, using value weights calculated
with the number of shares outstanding 36 months ago. RLIST is the return on new lists, a
portfolio of stocks newly appearing in CRSP in the last 36 months. RPLUS is the return on shares
added in the last 36 months by firms that were on CRSP 36 months ago, using value weights
calculated with the number of shares that have been added. RMINUS is the return on shares
subtracted in the last 36 months by firms that were on CRSP 36 months ago, using value weights
calculated with the number of shares that have been subtracted. All returns are value weighted,
monthly, in percent. All calculations using shares are split-adjusted. wLIST is the portfolio
weight of the market in newly listed stocks, and has average value of w LIST over the entire sample
period. For new lists, FIXED is w LIST ( RtLIST − RtLAG ) and TIMING is
(wt
   LIST
          − wLIST )( RtLIST − RtLAG ) . The weights, fixed weight returns, and timing returns are
calculated similarly for PLUS and MINUS. For “net new issues,” the FIXED component is the
sum of the three LIST, PLUS, and MINUS components, and similarly for TIMING. The CAPM
α is the intercept term from a regression on RM - RF. The three-factor α is the intercept term
from a regression on the three variables of Fama and French (1993), including the excess market
return, SMB (the return on small stocks minus big stocks) and the HML (the return of high B/M
stocks minus low B/M stocks). The four-factor model adds UMD, a momentum factor reflecting
the return of stocks with high prior year returns minus stocks with low prior year returns. The
table shows four-factor loadings as well as α. Pre-1962 is prior to August 1962. Post-1962 is
after July 1962. The sample period is January 1929 to December 2001. Standard errors in
parentheses.

Value and size

RGROWTH is the value weighted portfolio of all firms that are in the top 30 percent of stocks sorted
on market/book ratios. RVALUE is the value weighted portfolio of all firms that are in the bottom
30 percent of stocks sorted on market/book ratios. RSMALL is a value weighted portfolio of all
firms that are in the bottom 30 percent of stocks sorted on market capitalization. REX_GROWTH,
REX_VALUE , and REX_SMALL are the complements. wGROWTH is the portfolio weight of the market
in firms in the top 30 percent sorted on market/book. FIXEDGROWTH is
 wGROWTH ( RtGROWTH − RtEX _ GROWTH ) and TIMGROWTH is
(wGROWTH
  t        − wGROWTH )( RtGROWTH − RtEX _ GROWTH ) , and similarly for value and small. The CAPM α
is the intercept term from a regression on RM - RF. The three-factor α is the intercept term from a
regression on the three variables of Fama and French (1993), including the excess market return,
SMB (the return on small stocks minus big stocks) and the HML (the return of high B/M stocks
minus low B/M stocks). The four-factor model adds UMD, a momentum factor reflecting the
return of stocks with high prior year returns minus stocks with low prior year returns. The
sample period is January 1929 to June 2001. Standard errors in parentheses.
