            CHANGING THE SOCIAL SECURITY RULES FOR WORKERS OVER 65:
                      PROPOSED POLICIES AND THEIR EFFECTS


                                    ABSTRACT

     This paper simulates the effects of proposals to modify procedures for

adjusting the Social Security benefits of those who work after normal

retirement age.   A basic set of policies, currently under consideration, is

projected to raise long run costs by $30 billion dollars net of taxes,

while inducing an increase of 5 percent in the number of full-time male

workers between the ages of 65 and 69.   Alternative policies may create

very different flows of funds.   Outcomes, especially in the short run, will

vary widely with the timing of the application decision for benefits.
