                                           ABSTRACT

Problems with mortgage financing are widely considered to be a major cause of the recent financial
meltdown. Several modern programs have been designed to mimic the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation
of the 1930s. The HOLC replaced the toxic assets on the balance sheets of financial institutions by
buying troubled mortgages and then refinanced the mortgages to allow home owners to avoid losing
their homes. We analyze the impact of the HOLC on the nonfarm rental and owned home markets
after developing a new data set for over 2800 counties in the United States. In counties with fewer
than 50,000 people, where financial markets were not as well developed as in larger cities, the HOLC’s
financial interventions helped stimulate the demand for owned housing more than it influenced the
supply. In rental markets the HOLC appears to have contributed to an increase in the supply of rental
housing that was likely associated the improvement of the balance sheets of lending institutions.

              The Influence of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation on

                          Housing Markets During the 1930s

       Problems with mortgage financing are considered to be a major cause of the

2007-2008 financial meltdown (Gorton, 2009). A large share of the “toxic assets” held

by financial institutions is composed of an admixture of credit default swaps insuring

collateralized debt obligations largely composed of mortgage-backed securities. As the

bailout of financial institutions starting in 2008 progressed, the government began

developing programs to refinance mortgages. Several programs were introduced in 2008

but were slow to get started. In February 2009, the Obama administration announced the

Homes Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which committed $75 billion to aid

up to 3 or 4 million at-risk homeowners in refinancing into loans with more affordable

monthly payments. Through January 2010, the HAMP had made offers of 1.3 million

trial modifications, over 940 thousand were active, 117 thousand modifications had been

accepted by loan service providers, and approximately 1,000 had been canceled. 1


       How will programs like the HAMP influence housing markets in the longer run?

Since the program has several years to run, we will not know for some time. However,

we can begin to make forecasts about its impact by examining the impact of the Home

Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) on non-farm housing markets during the Great

Depression. The government allowed the HOLC to issue bonds to purchase from lenders

approximately one million nonfarm mortgages that were in danger of foreclosure

between 1933 and 1936; therefore, it replaced toxic assets with more secure government
                                                                                          4


bonds. In the process the HOLC refinanced the mortgages at better terms for a large

number of households that had been in danger of losing their homes. Despite the

improved terms, the HOLC eventually foreclosed on 200 thousand of the loans by the

early 1940s.


       To date, discussions of the HOLC have largely been descriptive discussions of

overall macroeconomic effects (Grebler, Blank, and Winnick, 1956; Harris, 1951). Yet,

there was enormous variation in the distribution of HOLC loans and purchases that can

be used to identify the influence of the program on housing markets. To the extent that

the HOLC refinancing of loans prevented foreclosures, the program likely staved off a

decline in the demand for owned housing, prevented a surge in demand for rental

housing, and prevented an increase in the supply of both owned housing and rental

housing. In addition, the HOLC loan purchases provided more secure assets that could

be used as backing for more mortgage loans that would increase the demand for owned

housing, as well as make more construction loans that could lead to increases in the

supply of rental and owned-home housing.


       To measure these effects, we examine how the distribution of HOLC mortgage

funds influenced the number of homeowners, renters, rents and the values of owned

homes in nonfarm housing markets in nearly three thousand U.S. counties in 1930 and

1940. Using estimates of the effects measured by reduced-form equations, we can

measure the summary effects of the HOLC on these markets and make some statements

about the relative size of the HOLC’s impact on supply and demand shifts.    We use an

instrumental variable approach to control for endogeneity of the distribution of HOLC

funds that might have arisen because the HOLC distributed more funds to areas with
                                                                                            5


more troubled markets. The results show no effect of the HOLC in a sample that

includes counties of all sizes. When the sample is limited to counties with populations

under 50,000, where financial institutions were more focused on local lending, the HOLC

appears to have propped up the demand for owned homes and stimulated the supply of

rental property.




HOUSING TROUBLES IN THE 1930S


       Housing markets boomed in the 1920s, as building construction and housing

prices rose. The horizontal axis of Figure 1 shows the ratio of the value of owner-

occupied housing in 1930 to the value of mortgaged owner-occupied housing in 1920 for

278 of the largest cities in the U.S. The average ratio across the cities was about 1.45.

Some cities experienced declines and one outlier in Rhode Island experienced a tripling

of prices. These ratios likely understate the boom in housing prices because HOLC

surveys of neighborhoods from the mid-1930s report the peak in housing prices as

occurring around 1927 in a number of cities (HOLC Area Surveys).

       The boom was soon followed by a strong reversal as the housing sector was one

of the leading casualties of the Great Depression. Alexander Field (1992) argues that

housing markets actually played a key role in contributing to the downturn from 1929

through 1933 and acted as a drag on recovery of GDP and housing after 1933. Figure 1

shows that the housing markets where home values rose more in the 1920s tended to fall

more in the 1930s.
                                                                                             6


          Nationally, housing markets did not recover to 1929 levels to the same extent as

the rest of the economy. At the national level, real average personal income and real

average retail sales had re-achieved their 1929 values by 1939, and this was true in a

majority of the states.2 In contrast, even though the overall CPI in 1940 was 16 percent

below its 1930 level, the nominal median value of an owned home in 1940 had fallen

48.6 percent below its 1930 value, and nominal median nonfarm contract rents for rental

property had fallen 24 percent (U.S. Bureau of Census 1975, 210-211). Meanwhile, ten

years of extra-ordinary unemployment had contributed to a decline in the home

ownership rate from 47.8 percent in 1930 to 43.6 percent in 1940. Figures 2 through 4

show that that there was substantial variation in the housing market changes in the 1930s.

In fact, there were increases in home ownership rates in several western and southwestern

states.




THE HOME OWNERS’ LOAN CORPORATION


          The Great Contraction from 1929 through 1933 led to a 30- to 40-percent fall in

housing prices, a large number of failures of financial institutions, and a sharp rise in

mortgage foreclosures. In response, a large number of states adopted mortgage moratoria

that prevented foreclosures. As part of the broad range of New Deal programs

established during their First Hundred Days in office, the Roosevelt Administration

adopted the HOLC to aid home owners “in hard straits largely through no fault of their

own (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28).” There were plenty who fit this

description because 25 percent of the workforce was unemployed and many others were

working less than full time. Between 1933 and 1936 (mostly in 1933 and 1934) the
                                                                                              7


HOLC used bonds to purchase 1,017,827 troubled mortgage loans with an average value

of $3,039 ($48,865 in 2008 dollars) from lenders and then refinanced the loans on better

terms for borrowers (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1939, 125; (Harris 1951, 1) The

HOLC rejected over 800 thousand applications, some because the household was not in

dire need, others because the borrower was not likely to repay the loan.


       The HOLC loans to troubled borrowers more closely resembled modern

amortized long-term mortgages than the loans they replaced. Prior to the 1930s most

mortgagees were required to place large down payments of between 40 to 60 percent of

the property value. The typical mortgage loan required repayment of interest for five

years with a balloon payment of the principal at the end of five years. Most loans were

refinanced at the end of the five year period. Opportunities to obtain amortized loans

were available from some types of lenders. For example, a number of Building and

Loans offered a “Philadelphia plan,” in which a second amortized mortgage was issued

for 30 percent of the value of property after the original loan was obtained. The borrower

then repaid interest only on the first loan and the amortized amount on the second

mortgage for five years and then could refinance the principal into an amortized loan

through the Building and Loan.3


       The HOLC replaced the five year interest-only loans with fifteen year amortized

loans in which the borrower made equal payments throughout the life of the loan. The

loan to value ratio was allowed to rise from the traditional 50 percent of the value of the

home to 80 percent. In many cases the 80 percent figure was applied to the value of the

home from better times, so the true percentage loaned on the value of the house was

much higher (Rose, 2009, Harris, 1951, 25). The interest rate on the loans was 5 percent
                                                                                           8


when low risk private home loans were offered at 6 to 7 percent.4 Borrowers could opt to

pay interest only for the first three years of the loan and there was no prepayment penalty.


       The typical mortgage refinanced by the HOLC in 1933 was more than two years

in default on the principal, due to a combination of forebearance by lenders and state

mortgage repayment moratoria. In addition, the typical loan refinanced had not paid

taxes on the property for two to three years (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1938, 27).

The HOLC paid delinquent taxes and by 1937 had reconditioned about forty percent of

the homes while folding the costs into the principal of the mortgage (Federal Home Loan

Bank Board 1938, 29).


       People who anticipated that the HOLC would fully resolve the problem likely

were disappointed. The mortgage foreclosure rate only fell slightly over the next three

years. In June 1936 39.4 percent of the HOLC borrowers were more than three months

behind on their mortgage payments (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28). By

1940 the HOLC had foreclosed on 17 percent of its loans. Most of those foreclosures

occurred after delinquencies in both principal and interest had run for more than 18

months with taxes unpaid (Federal Home Loan Bank Board 1937, 28). At some point

between 1936 and 1940, the HOLC owned and then resold roughly 2 percent of the

owner-occupied nonfarm dwellings in the United States. The foreclosed dwellings were

eventually sold off at an average loss of 33 percent per foreclosure, as the HOLC sought

to avoid roiling housing markets with their sales (Comptroller General of the United

States 1950, 11). Based on current mark-to-market accounting standards for financial

institutions it is very likely that the HOLC would have been considered insolvent in the

late 1930s.
                                                                                           9


       The HOLC benefitted many home owners who had been in dire straits and the

absence of a prepayment penalty allowed many to repay the loan long before the fifteen

year period of the loan had ended. When the HOLC was closed down after the last loan

was repaid in 1951, the auditor reported that the HOLC had paid net earnings to the U.S.

Treasury of $13.994 million between its inception and June 30, 1952. However, the

auditor suggested that the net earnings should not be considered profit. The cost to the

Treasury of supplying funds to the Corporation since 1933 was about $91.9 million, so

“the net overall cost to the Government has been about $78 million (Comptroller General

of the United States 1953, 9). Since the HOLC had added nearly $60 million to its

balance sheet through investments in savings and loans and in the Federal Savings and

Loan Insurance Company, the losses on the HOLC program were probably closer to or

more than $100 million.5


ANTICIPATED EFFECTS OF THE HOLC


       The annual reports about the HOLC suggest that the program was designed to

achieve two goals. First, it should insure that homeowners who were in danger of

defaulting on their mortgages through “no fault of their own” would be allowed to stay in

their homes. Second, by buying the weakened mortgages from mortgage lenders,

typically with government bonds, the HOLC was injecting more capital into the lending

markets that could insure a continued flow of funds for lending in mortgage markets,

residential building, or other types of lending.


       Consider the impact of these factors in a demand and supply framework for

owned homes and rentals in these local areas. The predictions described here rely on the
                                                                                            10


following assumptions. In each year households make the decision whether to move or

stay in their current dwelling; therefore, the entire stock of housing is included in the

supply and demand analysis for owned housing and rental housing markets. Holding

other factors constant, the supplies of owned housing and rental housing have positive

slopes, and the demands for each have negative slopes. Even though there is a reasonable

degree of substitutability between owned housing and rental housing, there are quality

differences in the housing associated with tenure. Thus rents on rental housing and the

values of owned homes do not move in lock-step and can even move in different

directions when demand and supply shifters in the two markets dictate such a change.


        In the owned home market the HOLC potentially had multiple effects on both the

demand and supply side of the market. On the demand side of the market, more HOLC

financing directly propped up the demand for housing in multiple ways. First, by

offering lower interest rates, higher loan to value ratios, and a longer, amortized

repayment structure, the HOLC provided troubled borrowers with the funds to stay in

their homes. Even in good times, modern studies have shown that relaxation of credit

constraints can have a significant impact on the transition to home ownership.6       Second,

lower interest rates lowered the discount rate used by home buyers and stimulated

demand for owned housing by raising the present value of the stream of benefits from the

home. Finally, HOLC funds were also used to improve the quality of housing, which in

turn, raised the demand for housing.7


       On the supply side of the market the HOLC relaxed credit constraints on lending

by replacing toxic assets with safer HOLC bonds in the lenders’ asset portfolios. To the
                                                                                         11


extent that the HOLC bonds underwrote construction loans, the supply of housing for

ownership would have increased.


       After combining these multiple effects, the HOLC loans are anticipated to have

stimulated the demand for owned housing, which would have increased values of owned

homes and the number of home owners. They also might have stimulated supply, which

would have raised the number of home owners and led to lower owned home values.

The combined effects would have led to an increase in the number of homeowners and an

uncertain effect on price. Prices would have risen if the demand rise dominated the

supply rise, fallen if the supply rise dominated the demand rise, and stayed the same if the

two shifts offset each other.


       In rental markets, the HOLC loans would have been associated with a reduction in

demand for rental housing by reducing the number of foreclosure households entering

rental markets. On the supply-side, the HOLC also would have reduced the amount of

foreclosed property that was temporarily for rent until it could be sold. As a

countervailing force on the supply side, the HOLC’s purchase of mortgages would have

freed up more capital for the construction of rental housing that would have increased the

supply of rental housing. The summary effects of the HOLC in the rental market would

have been to reduce demand for rental housing and have conflicting effects on the

supply-side of the equation. Had the demand change associated with the HOLC

dominated, the HOLC would have been associated with lower rents and fewer renters. If

the supply reduction dominated, the HOLC would have been associated with higher rents

and fewer renters. If the supply increase dominated, the HOLC would have been

associated with lower rents and more renters.
                                                                                          12


       The HOLC’s impact on these markets would have been diminished to the extent

that the HOLC was forced to foreclose on properties itself. We know that nationwide the

HOLC foreclosed on 17 percent of the properties on which it made loans in the 1930s.

To the extent that the distribution of foreclosures was the same as that of the flow of

HOLC funds, holding constant the other factors in the regression, the effect of the HOLC

on the various housing outcome variables should be dampened but the signs not affected.




DATA


       The data set used to study the impact of the HOLC is composed of information

from 2854 counties that reported information on all of the following housing variables in

the 1920 Integrated Public Microdata Sample, and 1930 and 1940 population and housing

censuses (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1933, 1943): median contract rents for non-farm

rentals in 1930 and 1940, median values of nonfarm owned homes in which the owners

lived in 1930 and 1940, the number of non-farm renters in 1920, 930 and 1940, and the

number of non-farm home owners in, 1920, 1930 and 1940. Information was reported

for some of these variables in the remaining counties, but we chose to focus only on

counties that reported all of the information so that the sample was consistent across

equations estimated. We focus on non-farm monthly contract rents and owned home

values because the HOLC was a non-farm program. The monthly contract rent included

related expenses, such as utilities and fuels only if they were included in the rental

contract. It also included non-cash rent payments (labor, goods, etc) that were converted

to a dollar amount. The full contract rent was reported, even when the tenant might have
                                                                                          13


been delinquent with the rent. The house values are the owner’s estimate of the sale

value of the housing unit. For single-family, non-farm houses, the estimates included the

value of the house and the land. For owner-occupied units that were part of a building

containing other households or businesses, the estimate included the value of only the

part where the household resided.8


        The information on New Deal programs was collected and reported in mimeos by

the U.S. Office of Government Reports (1940b) and has been computerized and made

available at Price Fishback’s website at the University of Arizona.

(http://economics.eller.arizona.edu/faculty/fishback.asp) under Datasets from Published

Research Projects. Data on the housing value and most other correlates also come from

the 1930 and 1940 population censuses and are available in computerized form in ICPSR

dataset 2896 (Haines, no date). See the Data Appendix for further information on

sources.


EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE HOLC


       To investigate the impact of the HOLC funds, we develop two groups of four

reduced-form equations that examine the relationships between HOLC funds and the

median value of owned nonfarm homes, the median nonfarm contract rent, the number of

nonfarm home owners, and the number of nonfarm renters, while controlling for other

correlates that were likely to influence nonfarm housing markets. For brevity of

exposition, we show the equations with owned home housing values as the dependent

variables. The equations for the other three housing measures have the same structure

but with different coefficients and error terms.
                                                                                           14


        The first set of equations treats the analysis as a cross-section from 1940 with no

dynamic feature to show the results from a more sophisticated version of the types of

comparisons of means that were commonly performed for programs by New Deal

administrators to show the impact of their programs in the late 1930s.


HVi,40 = β1 HOLCi,33-36 + γ1 Xi,40 + α1Ss,40 + θ1,i + u1,i,40.               (1)


Where HVi,40,k is the median value of owned housing in county i in 1940. HOLCi,33-36 is

the annual value of HOLC loans distributed between 1933 and 1936 per person in 1930,

Xi,40 is a Mx1 vector of M measured factors, including other New Deal programs that

influence the supply and demand of rental housing and of owned housing in 1940. Ss,40 is

a 47x1 vector of time-varying state policies that were common influences on housing

markets in the counties in state s. The vector θ1,i captures a set of supply and demand

factors that are unmeasured, time-invariant, and idiosyncratic to each county. The error

term, u1,i captures stochastic error and other time-varying unmeasured factors. The

coefficient β1 measures the marginal impact of the HOLC spending on the housing

variable, γ1 is a 1xM vector of coefficients for the measured influences of the New Deal

and α1 is a 1x47 vector of coefficients for the state dummy variables.


        We can control for the unmeasured, time-invariant county factors, θk,i by taking

difference between the values in 1940 and the values in 1930. We therefore estimate the

following equations.


ΔHVi,40,k = βk HOLCi,33-36 + γk ΔXi,40 + αk ΔSs,40 + Δuk,i,40.               (2)
                                                                                              15


Since there were no HOLC loans prior to 1930, the change in HOLC loans is the same as

the level of HOLC loans in 1933 to 1936. In the analysis, we capture the changes in state

tax and real estate policies ΔSs,40-30 with a series of 47 state dummy variables.


       Since housing is one of the most durable of goods and there is considerable inertia

in housing decisions, it is likely that there will be strong persistence across time in the

housing measures.9 Therefore, we estimate a second set of equations to capture the

persistence in the nature of the housing markets across time by adding lagged values from

1930 to the analysis. It can easily be shown that if the structural owned home and rental

demand and supply equations that include past rents, owned home values, and the

number of homeowners and renters in one or more equations, then each of the reduced

form equations will be functions of all four of the past housing measures. Therefore,

each of the reduced form equations with persistence will take the form in equation 3. For

this example, the dependent variable is the owned home value in county i in 1940

(HVi,40).


HVi,40 = β1 HOLCi,33-36 + γ1 Xi,40 + α1Ss,40 + θ1,i + δ11 MRi,30 + δ21 Ri,30 + δ31 Hi,30

               + δ41 HVi,30 + v1,i,40.                                          (3)

Hi,30 represents the number of nonfarm homeowners, Ri,30 is the number of nonfarm

renters, HVi,30 is the median value of nonfarm homes and MRi,30 is the median rent on

nonfarm rental property. After differencing, the equation becomes



ΔHi,40-30 = β1 ΔHOLCi,33-36 + γ1 ΔXi,40-30 + α1 ΔSs,40-30 + δ11 ΔMRi,30-20 + δ21 ΔRi,30-20

               + δ31 ΔHi,30-20 + δ41 ΔHVi,30-20 + Δv1,i,40.               (4)

We calculated measures of the number of nonfarm homeowners and nonfarm renters in

1920 for the counties by aggregating up from the IPUMS sample (University of

Minnesota). Since the census of 1920 did not collect information on rents or home

values, we use annual earnings per employed wage worker in manufacturing as a proxy

for rents and home value.10




An Instrument for HOLC Loans


       The differenced analyses above controls for many of the time-invariant features

that might have led to omitted-variables bias in the analysis. However, there still remains

the potential of endogeneity bias arising from the way the HOLC distributed its housing

loans. The HOLC bought and refinanced troubled loans. To the extent that there were

more troubled loans in areas where housing values and home ownership were falling in

the mid-1930s, the coefficient on the HOLC is likely to be biased in a negative direction

in the change in home ownership and change in housing value regressions. The bias in

the change in rent and change in renter equations is less certain because the distribution

of HOLC loans would have been influenced indirectly by what was happening in the

home ownership markets. If the number of troubled loans that drew HOLC attention in

the mid-1930s were associated with foreclosure trends that led to foreclosed homes

becoming rental property and to more renters, the HOLC spending would have been

related to rising rental demand and rental supply. The combination would have had

offsetting impacts on rents but would have been associated with more renters. Thus, the

endogeneity bias for the HOLC loans might have been positive in the number of renters

equation and uncertain in the rent equation.
                                                                                          17


       To combat these potential problems with endogeneity, we sought an instrument

for the distribution of HOLC funds that is strongly correlated with HOLC funding but is

not correlated with the error term in the difference equations with state fixed effects

above. One way to approach this is through the administrative side. The HOLC

established 244 offices across the country with at least one in each state. Given the

paperwork associated with the loans and the inspections of property required, it seems

likely that it was more costly for borrowers who were more distant from the HOLC

offices to refinance their loans through the HOLC. It would be more costly to seek the

mortgage refinancing and more costly for HOLC workers to evaluate the value of the

property and administer loan information related to it. Therefore, as a start, we calculated

the difference in miles between the county seat of a county and the nearest county seat of

a county where the HOLC office was located. So that the value of the instrument would

have a positive relationship with the HOLC funds, we used the inverse of the distance.


       There still remains a potential problem if the HOLC chose the office locations on

the basis of the number of troubled mortgages in the area. It is not clear how the HOLC

would know this information except through using information that we have already

included in the regression for 1930, which was the previous census period. Most of the

nationwide information that would have been available for 1933-1934 was not collected

until the New Deal programs like the CWA and the FERA collected information, and

they did not collect information on housing until 1934. The one area where they might

have an accurate assessment might have been the building permit information collected

by the BLS for over 200 cities.11
                                                                                               18


        To avoid the potential problem of endogeneity in the choice of HOLC office

locations, we use an alternative strategy for picking offices as an instrument. As a

starting point for the location of federal offices in each state, a federal government that

was trying to minimize its administrative costs in each state would have started by

choosing to put an office in the state’s seat of political power, the state capital. The next

most likely location would have been the county with the largest population in the state,

so that they could reach the most people possible. Following the same strategy, if they

added another office in each state it would be in the second largest city. To add another

office, it would be in the third largest city, etc. In this alternative formulation, then we

developed an artificial administrative version of the HOLC that placed HOLC offices in

all state capitals and in the four largest cities in each state. After determining the distance

from the nearest artificial office to each county, we then chose the instrument to be the

inverse of the distance from the nearest artificial office in the state. In cases where the

office was in the county and the distance was zero, we counteracted this problem by

adding one mile to all distances before taking the inverse.12


        The artificial geographic distribution of HOLC offices matches the actual

distribution to a reasonable degree. The actual HOLC offices were dispersed across 228

counties (some had more than one), while the artificial distribution puts offices in 204

counties. There are 137 counties that had an HOLC office and also would have had an

artificial office; 91 counties had an actual HOLC office but would not have had an

artificial office; and 67 counties had no HOLC office but would have had an artificial

office.13
                                                                                            19


       The additional correlates in the analysis are listed in Appendix Table 1. The

HOLC coefficient estimates are therefore estimates of the relationship of the HOLC with

the housing variables holding constant a variety of measures of economic activity, the age

distribution, race, immigrant status, illiteracy, as well as other New Deal programs that

might have influenced housing markets. To the extent that there are feedback effects

from changes in the housing markets to economic activity and/or to the New Deal

programs, the coefficients of economic activity and of New Deal programs in the

equations might be subject to endogeneity bias. So far, we have been unable to develop a

full set of instruments that have enough strength to control for the endogeneity bias in all

of the programs simultaneously. In estimating the effect of the HOLC, we chose to

control for potential omitted-variable bias related to these programs by including them in

the analysis. There is a risk that endogeneity bias in estimation of the other New Deal

coefficients might spill over into the HOLC coefficient.14


RESULTS


       Plots of the raw data offer a preview of some of the findings from the estimation.

The plots in Figures 2 and 3 suggest positive relationships between the average value of

HOLC loans per capita from 1933 through 1936 and both the median value of nonfarm

owned homes and the number of nonfarm home owners for counties with less than

50,000 people in 1940. The graphs focus on counties with less than 50,000 people so

that it is not dominated by a few very large cities that disguise the pattern. When the

plots control for a variety of unmeasured time-invariant factors by looking at the change

in home values and in the number of homeowners in Figures 4 and 5, the positive

relationship of the HOLC loans with housing values and number of homeowners is no
                                                                                             20


longer present. The same patterns are generally present in plots of median rents and the

number of renters. The estimation procedures go further by controlling for time-varying

covariates, persistence, and also by controlling for endogeneity using instrumental

variables.

        The approach to the estimation that best matches what Roosevelt officials

typically followed in evaluating programs would be to run the regressions with the levels

in 1940 as a function of the HOLC per capita expenditures. This approach leads to the

conclusion that the HOLC worked well. The results in line 1 of Table 1 suggest that

areas with more per capita HOLC spending had higher home values and more

homeowners. The directions of change are consistent with a view that the HOLC raised

owned home demand more than it changed the supply of owned homes. In the rental

market areas with more HOLC spending had higher rents and fewer renters, which

implied that HOLC spending lowered the supply of rental housing by staving off

foreclosures more than it reduced rental demand. All of the coefficients are statistically

significant. The coefficient of 50.9 for home values implies that an extra dollar in annual

per capita HOLC spending was associated with home values that were $50.9 higher.

Elasticities estimated at the means are 0.08 for house values, 0.27 for the number of

owners, 0.05 for rents, and -0.24 for the number of renters.

       The cross-sectional coefficients are potentially biased by endogeneity, persistence

effects, unmeasured time-invariant features of the housing markets that are not controlled

for in the 1940 cross-section. Courtemanche and Snowden (2009) show that HOLC

spending was distributed to areas with higher home values and with higher home

ownership rates. Therefore, the cross-sectional results for 1940 might be just mimicking
                                                                                           21


the positive relationships that originally influenced the distribution of HOLC funds in the

mid-1930s.

       We estimated the 1940 cross section to control for persistence in the housing

market by including 1930 housing values, rents, nonfarm renters, and nonfarm

homeowners in each of the equations. When these factors are included in line 2 of Table

1, the coefficient of housing values falls below zero and the coefficient of the number of

homeowners is cut sharply and is no longer statistically significant. In the rental market

the rent coefficient changes sign so that the coefficients of rent and the number of renters

are both negative and statistically significant.

       We also estimated the model to control for unmeasured time-invariant

heterogeneity by differencing between 1940 and 1930. These results, reported in line 3

of Table 1, show that HOLC spending was associated with lower housing values and

rents and had no statistically significant relationship with the difference in the number of

homeowners or renters. A similar set of results arise from the estimation when we

estimate a persistence model with differencing as in line 4 in Table 1. These results

suggest that the HOLC was associated with a decline in demand that was greater than the

rise in supply in the owned home market and a decline in demand that was greater than

the rise in supply in the rental market.

       The results from the differenced models with and without persistence are still

likely to be affected by endogeneity bias if the distribution of HOLC loans was

influenced by the changes in the housing market between 1930 and 1936. Our

expectation is that the HOLC distributed more loans to areas with the most troubled

loans, and thus areas where housing values and the number of homeowners were falling
                                                                                            22


and where the number of renters was rising and rents were falling. We therefore

estimated the differenced models using the instrument based on the inverse of distance

from the nearest artificial office described above. Tests of the strength of the instrument

using the Kliebergen-Paap statistic suggest that strength of the instrument is not a

problem if we are willing to accept weak instrument bias of 10 percent in the IV

differenced estimation in line 5 and 15 percent in the IV differenced with persistence

estimation in line 6.

       The results from the IV differenced estimation without taking persistence into

account suggest that the HOLC was associated with reductions in housing values and the

number of owners, reductions in rents and more renters. The estimation that deals with

unmeasured time-invariant heterogeneity, persistence, and endogeneity of the HOLC

fully is the differenced IV estimation with differences in housing variables between 1930

and 1920 incorporated. The results show no statistically significant effect of the HOLC

on housing markets. The coefficients are all relative small and suggest elasticities with

respect to the HOLC of -0.05 for housing values, 0.13 for the number of nonfarm

homeowners, -0.02 for rents, and 0.03 for the number of nonfarm renters.

       The estimates in Table 1 include all cities in the sample. There were likely to be

differences in the responsive to HOLC changes based on the size of the counties. Even

as late as the 1930s, there were differences in access to capital markets based on the size

of the population in the county and state. There still remained significant variation

across states in the interest rates charged by banks on loans (Bodenhorn, 1996, 2010).

Further, many of the failures of banks and building and loans in the 1920s and in the

1930s were failures of relatively small institutions reliant on local lending. The smaller
                                                                                              23


was the population in the county, the less likely that the loan portfolio of local mortgage

lenders would be diversified across larger geographic markets or across a broader

economic structural base.

       Although we include these factors as controls in the estimations summarized in

Table 1 for all cities, there is no consideration of how the HOLC coefficient itself might

vary across different county sizes. To explore what happens with smaller cities we have

re-estimated the models using various groupings of county sizes. The estimates for

counties with fewer than 50,000 people in 1930 are reported in Table 2. As we add

counties with increasingly larger populations to the sample of counties with fewer than

50,000 people, the results have a tendency to move in the direction of the results reported

in Table 1.   As was the case with the estimates for the entire sample, the coefficient

estimates and the implied shifts in demand and supply in the housing markets change

markedly as we add controls for persistence, difference the equations, and use IV

estimation. The IV estimates for the differenced models both with and without controls

for persistence in lines 5 and 6 have the same signs and are similar in size so we will

focus on the results controlling for persistence.

       In counties with fewer than 50,000 people the point estimates of the coefficients

imply that a rise in demand was the dominant influence of the HOLC in the owned home

market.   The HOLC coefficients for owned home values and the number of homeowners

are both positive and statistically significant at the 10 percent level or better. The

elasticities with respect to per capita HOLC spending are 0.153 for the values of owned

homes and 0.111 for the number of home owners.          In the rental market, a rise in the

supply of rental housing may have more than offset a rise in the demand for rental
                                                                                          24


housing. More HOLC funds were associated with a statistically significant rise in the

number of nonfarm renters and a statistically insignificant decline in rents with respective

elasticities of 0.159 and -0.023.

       In an independent study of the values of owned homes and home ownership rates

in the 1930s, Charles Courtemanche and Kenneth Snowden (2009) also find that the

HOLC was associated with higher values of owned homes. They use an alternative

measure of HOLC lending, the ratio of HOLC loans made between 1933 and 1936

relative to owned homes in 1930, and have some different control variables. They

estimate the relationship of the HOLC lending rate with owned home values and home

ownership rates in 1940 in a cross-sectional analysis that includes the lagged housing

measures from 1930. As an instrumental variable, they use a measure of whether the

county was within 30 miles of an HOLC office. Their results also show a rise in housing

values for smaller counties.15



CONCLUSIONS

       Between 1933 and 1936, the HOLC purchased over one million nonfarm

mortgage loans from lenders and then refinanced the loans. Its dual purpose was to

replace the toxic assets on mortgage lenders’ books and to help homeowners who were in

danger of defaulting through no fault of their own stay in their homes.   If the HOLC had

worked as expected, the HOLC would have raised both the demand and the supply in the

owned home market and would have reduced demand and either raised or lowered supply

in rental markets.
                                                                                            25


       If someone were to rely on plots of housing market variables in 1940 against per

capita HOLC spending in 1933-1936 or a cross-sectional multi-variate regression

analysis in 1940 with controls for economic activity and state policies, they would argue

that the HOLC was a success. In the nonfarm owned home market more HOLC loans

were associated with higher owned home values and more home owners. This would

imply that the HOLC stimulated a demand increase for owned homes that more than

offset any increases in the supply of owned homes. In the regression analysis of the

rental market, the HOLC loans were higher in areas with higher rents and lower numbers

of renters. Such a finding is consistent with a view that the HOLC prevented foreclosures

that would have driven rents down and the number of renters up.

       The impact of the HOLC diminishes a great deal once we control for time-

invariant heterogeneity, persistence effects, and the endogeneity of the distribution of

HOLC funds. In the estimation including counties of all sizes, there are no statistically

significant effects of the HOLC.

       There are institutional reasons to believe that the HOLC might have been more

effective in smaller counties where financial markets were more local and many financial

institutions were oriented to local lending and thus were less diversified across sectors of

the economy. When the sample is restricted to counties with populations under 50,000

people, the HOLC contributed to a rise in demand in the owned home market that more

than offset changes in supply in that market. Thus, the HOLC seems to have worked as

expected in the owned home market by preventing a drop in demand for owned housing,

although the elasticities of home value and the number of home owners with respect to

HOLC lending were each less than 0.16. In nonfarm rental markets in counties with
                                                                                             26


fewer than 50,000 people, the results suggest that a rise in supply of rental housing may

have more than offset changes in demand. The results suggest room for further research

on lending decisions made by the mortgage holders whose toxic loans were replaced by

HOLC bonds.

       What lessons can we learn from the HOLC about how the HAMP program will

influence modern housing markets?       First, the HAMP appears to be moving faster than

the HOLC. The HOLC was created in June 1933 and did not make its first few loans

until late in the year, although it made the vast majority of its one million loans in the

calendar year of 1934. The HAMP was created in February 2009 and had offered about

400,000 modifications by mid-summer; it has offered 1 million modifications in its first

year, although only 116 thousand are finalized. Given that the HOLC had to build an

organization from scratch, improved communications technology, and the government’s

much larger role in modern markets, we might have higher expectations for the HAMP in

terms of speed of operation.


       Second, we should expect that the HAMP will likely lose money in the long run

and experience periods where there are a significant number of people aided who are

behind on their new mortgages or defaulting. The HOLC loan program lost money.

Within 3 years of the start of the HOLC more than one-third of the borrowers who

received refinancing were behind by three or more months on their mortgage payments.

Within 6 years the HOLC had foreclosed on 20 percent of its loans and was heavily

involved in renting the foreclosed housing and trying to time the resales to avoid

influencing housing values. On the other hand, the current economic crisis is much less
                                                                                             27


severe than the Great Depression, which should aid in reducing the eventual number of

foreclosures that the HAMP will face.


        Third, the effects of the HAMP might not be as strong as those of the HOLC

because the strongest effects of the HOLC were in smaller counties with less access to

deep financial markets in the 1930s. Local financial markets are much more tightly

integrated into the national and world financial markets in the modern era, and thus there

is much greater access to mortgage credit today throughout the country than in the 1930s,

even after controlling for the different severities of the crises. Finally, there are likely to

be effects on rental markets and other financial markets that are larger than might be

anticipated initially.

Notes. There were 2857 observations. Each level estimation equation includes the list
of correlates in 1940 or 1939 levels listed in Appendix Table 1. The level estimation
with lagged housing variables also adds the median nonfarm owned home values, median
nonfarm rents, the number of nonfarm homeowners, and the number of nonfarm renters
in 1930 to the list of correlates. Each differenced estimation includes the list of correlates
in change form in Appendix Table 2. The differenced estimation with lagged housing
variables also adds the changes in the annual average earnings of manufacturing wage
workers from 1919 to 1929, and the changes in the number of nonfarm home owners and
renters from 1920 to 1930.
        The Kleibergen-Paap Wald rank F-statistics for the first stage test of strength of
the instrument is 19.39 for the IV estimation in line 5, and 10.03 for the IV estimation in
line 6. The critical value for the tests of weak instrument strength is 16.38 if one is
willing to accept a maximum of 10 percent weak instrument bias, 8.96 for 15 percent
bias, and 6.66 for 20 percent bias.

         The New Deal program information is from the U.S. Office of Government

Reports (1940b). The data on the nonfarm contract rents, sale value of nonfarm owner—

occupied homes, number of renters, number of owners are from the 1930 census volume

on Families (volume 6) and the 1940 census volume on Housing (U.S. Bureau of the

Census 1933, 1943) and in computerized form in Haines ICPSR 2896. The information

on the population, retail sales, wholesale sales, value of crops, mining output, and the

percents black, foreign-born, illiterate, urban, and rural nonfarm are from the 1930 and

1940 Censuses and are available in computerized from in Haines (no date). Information

on average annual manufacturing earnings in 1919 and 1929 used in the differenced

model with persistence comes from the 1920 and 1930 Censuses and is also available in

the Haines (no date) compilation of data. The variable was created by dividing total

wage expenditures by the average number of employees. For counties with missing

observations on manufacturing earnings, we inserted state averages. Information on age

distributions in 1930 and 1940 comes from the population censuses and in computerized

form from Gardner and Cohen (1992). The infant mortality rate information comes from

information on births and infant deaths from the volumes on births, deaths, infant deaths

and stillbirths (The U.S. Bureau of the Census, various years). Information on the

number of tax returns in the county for 1940 is from Rand McNally (1943); for 1930 it

comes from U.S. Bureau of Internal Revenue (1932). The difference in the infant

mortality Rate is between the years 1940 and 1933 to include information on Texas and

South Dakota, which did not report infant deaths and births by county until 1933. The

differences for the per capita measures of retail sales, wholesale sales, mining, and value

of crops are for the years 1939 and 1929. The mining information was collected from

the published Censuses of 1930 and 1940. Information on the location and timing of

introduction of HOLC offices was collected from the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation

Minutes from 1933 through 1935.

ENDNOTES
       1
           See Home Affordable Mortgage Program (2010) for program statistics through

January. Borrowers are considered at risk if they are 60 days or more delinquent on the

loan Zibel 2010). The loans eligible for the program are first-lien loans originated on

owner-occupied properties with unpaid principal balances of up to $729,750. Borrowers

must fully document income. The loan servicer performs a net present value test on the

cash flow from loans at risk of imminent default in two scenarios: with and without

default. If there is no fraud or contract prohibition, the lender is expected to modify the

loan if the modified NPV is higher than the unmodified NPV. Loan services are required

to follow a sequence of steps involving reducing the interest rate on the loan (to a floor of

2 percent) and then extending the term or amortization of the loan to 40 years, and then if

necessary forbearing the principal Homes Affordable Mortgage Program (U.S.

Department of Treasury, March 4, 2009). A Home Affordable Refinance program was

made available to 4 to 5 million homeowners whose loans are owned by Fannie Mae and

Freddie Mac. The borrower had to have a solid payment history and the home values had

to have fallen so that the loan to value ratios is now above 80 percent (U.S. Department

of Treasury March 4, 2009). Several other programs were announced in 2008 but seem to

have been more limited in scope. Hope for Homeowners (H4H) was passed in summer

2008 and took effect on October 1, 2008. It was designed to allow lenders to move

borrowers into government-insured loans while reducing loan balances to 90 percent of

the market value of the home.    Anticipated to help about 400,000 home owners over

three years, only one borrower had been helped by May 2009 (Christie, 2009). In the fall

of 2008 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced stream-lined procedures to shift several
                                                                                         55




hundred thousand borrowers who were more than 90 days behind on their mortgage,

living in the home, not in bankruptcy, and owing over 90 percent of home value into

mortgages with monthly payments equal to 38 percent of their monthly income. In

December 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that it would

modify 2 million loans at a taxpayer cost of $24 billion to move the monthly payment to

31 percent of pre-tax income with lower rates, longer terms, forbearance on the principal.

By February 2009, most of the loans modified under the program had been held by failed

banks, although the FDIC had begun requiring that some banks receiving bailout funds

also use the program’s procedures (Keoun, 2009).

       2
           Glaeser and Gyourko (2001) argue that negative economic shocks lead to

decreases in housing prices that are greater in absolute value than decreases in

population. During the 1930s, nearly every geographic area experienced a negative

shock between 1929 and 1933 and despite recovery in real incomes to 1929 levels by the

end of the decade, the unemployment rate remained above 10 percent for the rest of the

decade. The comparisons here show that a severe negative shock can have a substantial

negative effect on housing values that can last for an extended period of time.

       3
           The Building and Loans combined two contracts to create an amortized loan.

One contract was the standard mortgage (interest only with balloon of principal) and the

other was a subscription to buy shares in the Building and Loan association in

installments that added up to the principal of the loan. The money for the shares went

into a sinking fund for the association, and after 11 or 12 years enough had accumulated

to cancel the debt on the principal. Since the borrowers were now members of the
                                                                                         56




association, the sinking fund feature created problems in the 1930s when many people

failed to finish paying into the fund. Those who were still paying in had to increase their

share payments to get the debts of the Building and Loan cancelled. This gave many

borrowers even more incentive to stop making share payments and many Building and

Loans were frozen and then worked to liquidate the loans and the real estate on behalf of

the members of the association. See Snowden 2009.

       4
           The HOLC’s shift to longer term amortized mortgages with lower down

payments coincided with and likely contributed to a shift in the terms in the entire

mortgage market. Data from Grebler, Blank, and Winnick (1956, 236) on loans for 1-to-

4-family houses made by commercial banks, savings and loan associations, and life

insurance companies show a 50 percent rise in the average contract length of loans and a

16 percent rise in the loan-to-value ratio between 1930-34 and 1935-1939. The average

nominal interest rate also fell by 12 percent (roughly one percentage point).

       5
           Cumulative earnings from interest and dividends from the HOLC’s $224 million

investments in Federal Savings and Loan Associations and state-chartered members of

the Federal Home Loan Bank System or insured by the Federal Savings and Loan

Insurance Corporation added $44.8 million to the plus side of the HOLC balance sheet.

Dividends on investments in the FSLIC added another $28 billion from inception through

1951 (Comptroller General of the United States 1949, 6; 1952, 27).

       6
           See, for example, Englehardt 1996, Engelhardt and Mayer 1998, Haurin,

Hendershott, and Wachter 1997, Linneman and Wachter 1989, and Zorn 1989).
                                                                                             57



       7
           Instead of describing the HOLC as increasing demand with its loans, another

way to describe it is as reducing the supply of housing that would have been dumped on

the market through foreclosures, which would have driven home ownership values down,

the number of homeowners down, increased the number of renters, and potentially raised

rents. Thus, the causal effect of the HOLC through this mechanism would have been to

raise housing values, raise the number of home owners, reduce the number of renters, and

reduce rents.

       8
           For definitions of the variables, see U.S. Bureau of the Census, Housing, 1943,

Volume I, Part 1, pp. 1-7 and U.S. Bureau of the Census, Families, 1933, Vol. IV, pp. 5-

11. The 1930 census asked questions about families, while the 1940 census asked

questions about dwelling units. Thus, the 1940 census contains information on vacant

dwelling units that are unavailable in the 1930 census.

       9
           Given the costs of moving, each homeowner’s decision to choose to stay in his

own home, purchase a new home, or move to a rental in the next year will be influenced

by his current status. Owners of rental property typically find it costly and time

consuming to change the property in ways that make it attractive as owned property, and

vice versa. Renters have more mobility but still face some costs to switch. In the

analysis data availability requires a ten-year lag. The persistence might be weaker across

a ten-year period, although cross-sectional regressions show a very strong relationship

between the 1940 and 1930 levels.

       10
            There was a 1920 mortgage census that collected information only on the value

of mortgaged homes and was limited in the scope of cities for which it reported
                                                                                             58




information. The 1920 census collected information on home ownership but the

published census did not report the number of nonfarm owners and the number of

nonfarm renters separately. Since the IPUMS sample is a one percent sample and the

number of observations of households in about half the counties is small enough there

may be measurement error.
       11
            We considered an alternative strategy in which we used the minutes of the

HOLC oversight committee in the National Archives to determine the date in which the

office first opened. The HOLC gave out loans in such a short period, we thought offices

that opened later would have been at a disadvantage in distributing loans. Here again,

there are worries that the date of opening was determined by the extent of problems with

troubled loans.

       12
            We experimented with different location algorithms starting with only the

largest city in each state, and then adding the second, then third, then fourth largest cities.

Using the four largest cities along with the state capital leads to the strongest instrument.

       13
            There was an HOLC office in the state capital in 37 of the 48 states, in 42

counties that had a state’s largest population, and in 37, 26, and 20 of the counties with

the second, third, and fourth largest populations respectively.

       14
            The New Deal program most closely correlated with the HOLC is the FHA

with a correlation between logged values of 0.5. Correlations with the other programs are

0.30 with the RFC, 0.176 with the public works and relief, -0.136 with the AAA, and -

0.19 with the farm loans.
                                                                                          59



       15
            When we use the data set we created and use our instrument strategy in a cross-

sectional model for 1940 with lagged housing values in 1930, we find results that are

similar to those found by Courtemanche and Snowden (2009). The results are available

from the authors. Although they do not focus on rental markets, they do find that the

HOLC is associated with a rise in home ownership rates. Our results, in contrast,

suggest that the HOLC increases the number of renters by more than the number of

homeowners.
