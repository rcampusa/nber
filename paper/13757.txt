                                             ABSTRACT

Adaptable property-rights institutions, we argue, foster economic development. The British example
illustrates this point. Around 1700, Parliament established a forum where rights to land and resources
could be reorganized. This venue enabled landholders and communities to take advantage of economic
opportunities that could not be accommodated by the inflexible rights regime inherited from the past.
In this essay, historical evidence, archival data, and statistical analysis demonstrate that Parliament
increased the number of acts reorganizing property rights in response to increases in the public's demand
for such acts. This evidence corroborates a cornerstone of our hypothesis.

1. Introduction

        Economists view secure property rights as necessary for economic development

(Acemoglu and Robinson 2005; La Porta et al. 2004). This observation initially arose from

studies of the property-rights system in nineteenth-century Britain (Coase 1960, 1974). The

British example, some scholars argue, proves that establishing secure property rights is not

merely a prerequisite, but is in itself sufficient, to trigger modern economic growth (North 1981,

North and Weingast 1989). This essay offers a new lesson regarding property rights and

economic progress. Britain’s economic ascent began after Parliament established institutions

enabling property rights to adapt to changing economic conditions and enabling land and

resources to be reallocated towards more productive uses. Adaptable property rights, in other

words, contributed to Britain’s economic development.

        Britain’s medieval property system possessed characteristics common to landholding

systems in developing nations, past and present. Rights of families and ancestors received

prominence over the rights of individuals and descendents. A complex spectrum of overlapping

privileges (common, communal, clerical, feudal, familial, statutory, and royal) enforced by an

array of courts (manorial, county, clerical, and royal) pertained to most plots of land. These

venues lacked uniform records and a unified framework for determining ownership, transferring

rights, and adjudicating disputes.

       Britain’s antiquated system posed problems for people trying to reallocate resources

towards more productive uses, particularly opportunities arising from technologies unanticipated

in the distant past. Holders of estates could neither mortgage, nor lease, nor sell much of the land

under their control. Holders under many types of tenures could only transfer property to

particular persons or members of a local community. Residents often had to keep land in

traditional uses. Residents could neither utilize resources in new ways, nor improve

infrastructure, nor repackage rights without reaching agreements with all other parties possessing

interests in a parcel, and such agreements could not, in most cases, be enforced by law, but

could, in many instances, be challenged through courts.

       Britain’s medieval property system also inhibited localities from providing public goods,

particularly those extending beyond the bounds of traditional communities or those necessitated

by the expansion of commerce and cities. Communities lacked mechanisms for raising revenues

and powers of eminent domain. Communities struggled to overcome free-riding, which inhibited

the provision of public goods, and hold-outs, who withheld resources needed for public projects

unless paid exorbitant sums. Market transactions might have alleviated these inefficiencies, but

in most cases, the necessary transfers could not be consummated and the requisite contracts

could not be enforced because of the restrictive nature of the anachronistic rights regime, which

valued tradition and stability above innovation and flexibility.

       English society struggled to improve the landholding system. In the six centuries

following the Norman Conquest, the nation reformed landholding laws repeatedly. But, the

principal problems persisted until the end of the seventeenth century, when Parliament embraced




                                                 2
novel ideas concerning property and began processing petitions from groups hoping to

reorganize rights to land and resources. Parliament reviewed requests from individuals, families,

and communities, and after considering the interests of all concerned and the general public,

rewrote rules regarding the use and ownership of property. Parliament enshrined these accords in

three types of acts: estate, statutory authority, and enclosure. Estate acts altered the rights of

individuals and families; eliminated restrictions on the uses to which property could be put;

authorized the sale, mortgage, and leasing of land; and facilitated the enforcement of contracts.

Acts establishing statutory authorities created new organizations that built, operated, and

maintained infrastructure and public services. Statutory authorities received new rights, such as

the authority to collect tolls, levy taxes, issue debt, and purchase land. These rights superseded

traditional rights, such as burgesses’ right to travel throughout the realm free from tax and toll,

enshrined for centuries in town charters and the Magna Carta. Enclosure acts disbanded

collectively-managed common-field villages and assigned to individuals rights to particular

pieces of property. Enclosure acts also shifted commonly-held agricultural land to new uses,

such as the construction of housing and workshops near growing towns and cities. Acts of all

three types embodied the public’s desire to reorganize rights and to reallocate resources towards

more productive uses.

       This essay shows that individuals and groups – including aristocratic estate holders,

yeomen holding by custom of the manor, tenants on small plots, urban landlords, rural villages,

nascent corporations, and growing urban communities – approached Parliament and requested to

reorganize rights when economic opportunities made it profitable to do so and that Parliament

accommodated the public’s demands. Parliament favored petitions that left all pertinent parties

as well (or better) off than under previous arrangements; that engendered little or no opposition;




                                                   3
and that enhanced productivity, improved infrastructure, or provided public services. Parliament,

in other words, functioned as a forum for facilitating agreements among individuals that

reorganized property rights in ways that enabled resources to be put to more productive uses.

This forum enabled society to voluntarily and peacefully restructure traditional arrangements in

response to arising opportunities. This politically-fostered flexibility of property rights was, we

argue, a key institutional innovation in England in the century preceding industrialization.

       A principal testable implication of our hypothesis concerns the relationship between

economic conditions and the passage of estate, statutory authority, and enclosure acts. If our

hypothesis is correct, then conditions that increased returns from reorganizing rights – for

example, economic booms that increased returns to investing in infrastructure or low interest

rates that decreased the costs of financing construction – should have encouraged people to

propose larger numbers of acts. Conditions that lowered returns from reorganizing rights should

have reduced the number of proposals. In turn, if our hypothesis is correct, Parliament should

have responded to increases (or decreases) in the public’s demand for acts by increasing (or

decreasing) the number of acts that it passed.

       This essay tests these implications with new data on the number of acts that reorganized

property rights and new methods designed to exploit that information to the fullest possible

extent. Our methods begin with simple assumptions about the way in which Parliament and the

political process operated, or in other words, the processes through which people proposed and

Parliament passed acts. These assumptions yield a simple, structural model of the Parliamentary

process, which in turn, yields a series of reduced-form equations that can be estimated to identify

whether Parliament responded to changes in the public’s demand for estate, enclosure, and

statutory-authority acts. Mathematical propositions link the reduced-form and structural




                                                  4
equations, illuminating the logical way to interpret our estimates. These methods enable us to

account for econometric issues – such as the non-stationarity and heterogeneity of the statistical

series – that complicate the process of drawing inferences from the data. These methods also

enable us to eliminate plausible alternative explanations for the patterns apparent in the evidence,

and thus, to draw causal conclusions from the correlations in the data.

         The rest of this essay carries out this endeavor. The second section reviews the literature

that sets the stage for our analysis. The third section describes the archival data that we employ

and the new times series that we analyze. The fourth section introduces our mathematical model

and statistical methods. The fifth section describes our empirical results. The concluding section

discusses how Britain’s gradual, consensual, and voluntary adoption of modern property rights

facilitated economic expansion in the century preceding the Industrial Revolution and whether

adaptable property-rights institutions can foster development in the world today.


1: Literature Review

         Scholars have long studied the connection between politics, property rights, and

prosperity in early-modern Britain. In The Wealth of Nations, for example, Adam Smith writes

that “commerce could not flourish if people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of

their property.”2 Douglas North and Barry Weingast (1989) emphasize the role of the Glorious

Revolution of 1688, which they argue, created a constitutional consensus that prevented royal

governments from expropriating citizens’ property. Security of property rights encouraged

investment and innovation, initiating Britain’s industrial expansion.

         Historians debate the accuracy of North and Weingast’s interpretation of the Glorious

Revolution. Critics include Gregory Clark and Patrick O’Brien. Clark (1996) argues that secure


2
    Smith 1976, p. 910


                                                  5
property rights existed far into the English past. Expropriation occurred only in exceptional

circumstances, such as when individuals rebelled against the regime. O’Brien (1994) argues that

the Glorious Revolution weakened property rights. After the Glorious Revolution, Parliament

raised taxes, embarked on foreign wars, and regulated a wide-array of industries. Alternative

interpretations of Parliament’s impact on the economy abound. Paul Langford (1991) stresses

Parliament’s active involvement in local legislation and argues that after 1688 propertied

Englishman used their control of the political system to enact changes in property rights

arrangements which benefited themselves as well as the larger economy. Julian Hoppit (1996,

1997) finds that the success rate for personal, communications, and enclosure acts increased

significantly in the early eighteenth century, and argues that Parliament had a capacity to meet

private or local demands for legislation. Hoppit’s work documents the rapid expansion of

Parliamentary activity after the Glorious Revolution and builds upon a venerable tradition of

categorizing and counting acts. Examples include Tate (1967 and 1978), Turner (1980 and

1984), Innes (1997), and Wordie (1983).

       We build upon this foundation by counting annual numbers of acts that altered property

rights between 1700 and 1830. We compare this count to economic and political variables that

influenced the benefits and costs of reorganizing rights to land. The spirit of this exercise

resembles the work of N.F.R. Crafts (1977) and Clark (2001). Both authors discuss the

correlation between the number of enclosure acts, wheat prices, and interest rates.

       This essay extends that line of reasoning in several ways. First, it examines all types of

acts that altered property rights arrangements, rather than one type among many. Second, this

essay deals with crucial issues of statistical inference and identification. Its statistical methods

ensure that correlations between property rights and economic incentives arise for real reasons,




                                                   6
rather than statistical phenomena that frequently generate spurious correlations between time-

series variables that trend across time. Third, this essay derives its statistical tests from

straightforward economic models that reveal how to appropriately interpret the estimates. Fourth,

this essay examines both treatment and control groups. The control groups consist of acts that

were processed using the same procedures as estate, enclosure, and statutory authority acts and

that performed tasks similar to those acts, but which did not alter property rights. Overall, this

essay’s statistical methods yield robust conclusions about the nature, causes, and consequences

of Parliament’s behavior.

        This essay extends the law and economics literature by emphasizing the importance of

adaptable property-rights institutions. Previous scholars emphasized the security of rights, which

historians believe existed long before the seventeenth century. We emphasize features of the

English political and legal system that arose after the Glorious Revolution at the end of the

seventeenth century. These novel features enabled Parliament to reform property rights on a

voluntary, gradual, and piecemeal basis. The Parliamentary forum that undertook this task

possessed no historical precedent.


2. Acts that Reorganized Rights to Land and Resources

        This section describes estate, statutory authority, and enclosures acts, which comprised

over half of all legislation passed between 1688 and 1830. These acts possessed common themes.

All affected individuals’ and organizations’ rights. Some created new rights. Others altered or

annulled old rights. Some created new organizations, such as turnpike trusts. Others disbanded

existing organizations, including ancient entities, such as village councils and manorial courts.


2.1     Estates acts




                                                   7
       Estate acts enabled holders of property to take some action prohibited by the rules under

which they had inherited their land. Estate acts were necessary because the inheritance system

limited estate holder’s power over their property, largely in an effort to adhere to the wishes of

the deceased (who bequeathed the property to their descendents as long as the latter fulfilled

conditions set out in the settlement), to protect the interests of dependents and heirs, and to

preserve a family’s estate for future generations (English and Saville, 1983, pp. 19-21). This

system of inheritance, known as strict settlement, solidified during the seventeenth century and

prevailed until the nineteenth century. A settlement was a generic name for a property

transaction and for the documents created in its consummation. While estimates vary, at the

peak, at least one-quarter and as much as three-fourths of land in England was held through strict

settlements (English and Saville, 1983, pp. 11-12, 30; Habakkuk 1994).

       Three features of settlements generated a need for Parliamentary involvement. First,

without an act of Parliament, holders of settled estates could only change the terms of the

settlement when their heir came of age (i.e. reached the age of 21). Then, the holder and heir

(typically father and son) could join forces and amend the settlement via the process of common

recovery. Limited life spans meant that settlements could be changed only infrequently. A family

might wait decades (or generations) for an heir to come of age and for the holder and heir to

reach an agreement about restructuring the estate.

       Second, settlements restricted the uses to which land could be put. The reason for these

restrictions was protecting the rights of dependents and future heirs. Holders of a settled estate

(who were just life tenants) could grant neither leases lasting beyond their lives nor leases from

which they benefited at the expense of their heirs (such as leases in which tenants paid lump

sums up front in return for concessions). Holders could seldom sell, swap, or mortgage property




                                                  8
under their control. Holders could not alter property, even if they considered the alterations to be

an improvement, without risking legal suits. The removal of trees, hedges, and buildings; the

mining of minerals, quarries, and peat bogs; and the conversion of arable lands into pasture (or

vice versa) could be considered waste, since these actions converted permanent resources into

current income. All those who benefited from such actions could be liable for damages if

dependents or heirs claimed to be harmed. Courts allowed sales, exchanges, mortgages,

improvements, and long-term leases only if the settlement contained specific clauses authorizing

such actions. Settlements written in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries seldom

provided such powers, although as the eighteenth century progressed and as the law concerning

settlements became increasingly sophisticated, settlements tended to provide broader powers.

         Three, conducting transactions and enforcing contracts on settled land could be costly,

uncertain, and insecure. Settlements were long, complex documents, often unpunctuated and

repetitious.3 Interpreting settlements required experience, skill, detailed knowledge of the

document, and a large library of property laws, precedents, and legal texts estimated at 674

volumes in 1826 (English and Saville, 1983, p. 18). Settlements were not part of the public

record. Copies of the deeds were usually held by the settlers, trustees, and lawyers. Settlements

had to be consulted before taking out mortgages, drawing up leases, or completing sales, because

if the settlement did not specifically authorize a transaction, the transaction could be voided.

Ambiguities in settlements often deterred individuals from acting for fear that the transactions

would be disputed.

         Estate acts solved these problems. Estate acts facilitated the enforcement of contracts by

clarifying permissible transactions and the rights of pertinent parties. Estate acts authorized


3
    The fact that until the Conveyancing Act of 1881, solicitors were paid for conveyances by the word (1s for every
    72 words in 1862), did not encourage conciseness (England and Seville, 1983, p. 18).


                                                         9
actions previously prohibited by settlements such as the mortgaging of property, cutting of old-

growth timber, and mining of ores and minerals. Estate acts authorized the sale and leasing of

land. The authorization of sales and leases may have been one of the most significant effects of

estate acts, since large tracts of English land became exposed to competitive pressures provided

by the marketplace, and began to be used in a more productive manner.


2.2 Statutory Authority Acts

         Statutory authority acts fostered the construction, improvement, and maintenance of

infrastructure and social services. Statutory acts focused on particular topics. Transportation acts

promoted roads, bridges, river navigation, ports, canals, and railways. Urban improvement acts

provided for street paving, gas lighting, garbage collection, sewage extraction, water provision,

and police protection. Government building acts fostered the construction of prisons,

courthouses, and county administrative offices. Poor relief acts provided assistance for the poor

and encouraged the construction of workhouses. Court of small request acts established legal

forums for adjudicating credit contracts valued at less than 40 shillings. Lighthouse acts

authorized whomever built lighthouses on particular plots of land to collect tolls from all ships

that passed.

         To accomplish these tasks, statutory authority acts created non-profit organizations and

enjoined the trustees of these entities to serve the public interest.4 The trustees tended to be local

landowners and merchants, who served without remuneration. For canals and railways, however,

statutory authority acts established for-profit organizations such as joint-stock companies, whose

directors purchased shares of the organizations and profited from their investments.




4
    See Webb and Webb (1963) for a description of the organizations established by statutory authority acts.


                                                        10
       Statutory authority acts granted rights to these new organizations. One was the right to

levy user-fees and/or raise revenue through other means. A turnpike act, for example, authorized

a trust operating a turnpike to levy tolls on road-users and claim labor (or the equivalent in taxes)

from inhabitants along the road. The tolls marked a significant departure from the existing

system, in which parishes paid for road improvements with local labor and property taxes, and in

which individuals possessed the right of free passage, enshrined in medieval town charters and

confirmed by the Magna Carta. Trustees also received the right to issue debt and equity. The

bonds were secured by the tolls. If interest payments fell into arrears, bondholders could seize

the toll revenues.

       Statutory authority acts gave organizations the right to purchase land along a route’s right

of way and defined procedures for doing so. The act authorized the organization to negotiate

with landowners. If the parties could not agree on the price for a necessary plot of land, the

organization could appeal to a body of commissioners who could compel the landowners to sell.

These procedures provided the legal origin for modern laws concerning eminent domain.

       Statutory authority acts limited the powers of trustees. Turnpike acts, for example,

defined maximum tolls. In each act, a schedule distinguished different types of traffic and goods,

and for each group, a maximum permissible toll. Similar schedules regulated the issuance of debt

and terms of interest.

       Statutory authority acts could be amended by subsequent acts which clarified the rights

and responsibilities of the organization. Canal acts were often amended in order to add branch

lines or to increase the authorized capital. Turnpike acts had to be renewed, since they expired

after 21 years. Renewals often expanded trustees’ authority, by allowing them to manage a larger

road network or altering the schedule of tolls.




                                                  11
2.3 Enclosure Acts

         Enclosure acts reorganized rights to property, usually in open-field agricultural villages.

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, approximately one-quarter of the arable land in

England lay in such villages, where residents shared rights to communal assets, such as water,

pasture, and woods. Villagers also shared rights in the large open fields, which served as

common pasture during fallow periods and as cropland during the growing season. The cropland

was divided among the residents, who possessed the right to grow grain on acre-sized plots

scattered throughout the fields and intermingled with those of their neighbors. Villagers managed

these collective assets, such as the open arable fields, through village institutions, including

customary laws and manorial courts.

         Enclosure acts replaced collective ownership of common resources with individual

ownership of particular plots of land, and replaced collective management through village

institutions by individual management of personal estates. An enclosure act appointed a

commission to implement the terms of the act.5 The commission employed surveyors to draw a

map of the village with its open fields and strips, tofts and crofts, waste and pasture, and other

physical features. The surveyors recorded the holders of rights to all of these assets. At a series

of public meetings, holders of land (and all other rights in the village) advanced claims as to

what they should receive under the new arrangements. The commissioners decided on the

validity of these claims. After they made their decisions, the surveyors created a map of the new

village, displaying the new features, such as fields, roads, fences, and irrigation channels, and the

owners of each.



5
    In 1801, the first General Enclosure Act simplified the administration of enclosure bills by providing guidelines
    for those drafting enclosure bills and parameters for permissible outcomes.


                                                         12
2.4    The Process of Passing Acts

       In the 1690s and early 1700s, Parliament standardized procedures for processing estate,

statutory authority, and enclosure bills. Estate acts began with a petition from an individual or

family desiring to change the rules regarding their estate. The petitioner hired a lawyer

specializing in estate law to prepare their paperwork. A Parliamentary committee investigated

the merits of the petition and issued a report. Petitions deemed beneficial to all interested parties

were written into bills, read to the public three times, passed through both Houses of Parliament,

and then sent to the King for royal assent. Public notice ensured that individuals with interests in

the estate knew about the proposal. Parties could oppose the bill by submitting counter-petitions

to either house of Parliament. Parliamentary committees considered the contending proposals,

and then passed one of the bills, modified the original bill to satisfy the opposition, or rejected

both proposals. The multiple layers for review and numerous opportunities for opposition

ensured that Parliament considered the interests of all concerned before coming to a decision

(English and Saville, 1983, p. 50).

       Statutory authority acts began with a petition from a community stating a problem, such

as insufficient road capacity between two places, and proposing a solution, such as the creation

of a turnpike between the cities. A Parliamentary committee considered the petition and drafted a

bill on this issue. The bill was read publicly three times before both houses of Parliament. The

readings allowed potential opponents to express opinions and propose amendments. Advocates

and opponents typically hired solicitors to present their cases and promote their interests. Like

modern-day lobbyists, these solicitors maintained regular contact with members of the

committees working on these issues.




                                                 13
         Enclosure acts went through a similar procedure. Parities interested in an enclosure held a

series of public meetings in their village to discuss the issue, and then drafted a petition signed

by a sufficient group (typically four-fifths) of individuals possessing rights to the land under

consideration. Advocates submitted the petition to Parliament, where the bill was read publicly

three times and considered by both houses.

         Parliament employed similar procedures for many types of acts that did not alter property

rights arrangements. The procedures for estate acts, for example, were identical to the procedures

for private acts of all types, including divorces, marriages, naturalizations, and appointments to

official positions that provided salaries or pensions.


3. Data

         The Parliamentary Archive is the principal repository for historical information on acts of

Parliament. The Archive maintains a computerized catalogue, Portcullis, which indicates the

clerical title, calendar year, regal year, and parliamentary session for all acts passed since the

sixteenth century.6 Clerks inscribed clerical titles on the exterior of a roll of parchment

containing the full text of an act when Parliament reviewed the original legislation. The clerical

title summarized the act, usually in a concise paragraph containing enough information for the

clerks to identify the act and its principal provisions amidst thousands of similar pieces of

parchment, without opening the rolls to read the full text.

         An earlier paper explains our process for converting the clerical title of every act of

Parliament into a vector of variables (Bogart and Richardson, 2007). In this essay, we convert

those vectors of variables into time series suitable for statistical analysis. Tables 1 through 3


6
    http://www.portcullis.parliament.uk. The clerical titles within Portcullis were first published in two nineteenth
    century compilations of Parliamentary legislation, Statutes of the Realm (Great Britain, 1800) and Statutes at
    Large (Great Britain, 1807), which were computerized during the 1990s.

standard deviation. Column (5) indicates the minimum number passed in a single year. Column

(6) indicates the maximum number. Columns (7) through (10) present the same information for

the series in differences (i.e. the change in the number of acts passed from year t-1 to year t).

Row (b) describes a time series indicating the annual number of estate acts that authorized the

sale of property. Row (c) indicates the annual number of estate acts that authorized the leasing of

property. Row (d) indicates the annual number of acts that authorized either sales or leases. Our

analysis emphasizes estate acts authorizing sales and leases because these acts placed land long

bound by the fetters of the past onto the market, which was (and is) one of the most efficient

methods for reallocating resources.

       The bottom-half of Table 1 describes data that serve as a comparison (or control) group

for estate acts. These non-estate private acts dealt with issues of marriage, naturalization, and

appointments to office. These appear in rows (e) through (g) respectively. The sum of these

series appears in row (h). Marriage acts permitted individuals to marry and/or divorce in

contravention of secular and religious statutes. Naturalization acts provided foreign-born

denizens with the rights of native-born citizens. Office acts appointed individuals to positions in

the royal household, courts of law, executive agencies, and other positions that provided

government-funded livings. Important similarities existed between these marriage,




                                                 15
naturalization, and office acts (collectively called non-estate private acts) and the estate acts

examined in the top of the table. When processing all of these acts, Parliament followed common

procedures. Similarities also existed in the clientele that requested these acts, the demographic

and social forces that generated demand for these acts, and the political factors that influenced

the supply of these acts. A key feature, however, distinguishes estate and non-estate private acts.

The value of estate acts varied with economic conditions that influenced the costs and benefits of

reorganizing rights to land. The value of marriage, naturalization, and office acts did not.

       The top-half of Table 2 describes statutory authority acts. Row (a) indicates the annual

number of statutory authority acts passed each year. Row (b) indicates the annual number of acts

pertaining to transportation, principally roads, canals, harbors, rivers, bridges, and railways. Row

(c) indicates the annual number of acts pertaining to urban improvements, principally the

provision of water, sewers, market infrastructure, public buildings, gas lighting, garbage

collection, church maintenance, courts of small request, poor relief, prison construction, and

police protection. Column (1) indicates whether these acts reorganized rights to land and

resources. Column (2) indicates whether these acts facilitated or financed the improvement of

infrastructure (I) or the provision of public services (S). The definitions of the columns (3)

through (6) and (8) through (11) are identical to the definitions of the corresponding columns in

Table 1. Columns (7) and (12) indicate whether the series are stationary, as determined by an

Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test. While several series are non-stationary in levels, all of the series

are stationary in differences.

       The bottom-portion of Table 2 describes data that serve as a comparison (or control)

group for statutory authority acts. We refer to the control group as finance acts. These acts dealt

with national government expenditure and taxation. Most pertained to excise, customs, and land




                                                  16
taxes; the development of economic and military infrastructure; and the provisioning of military

forces. Like statutory authorities, these acts financed the provision of public goods, and their

passage through Parliament required balancing local and broader interests. Unlike statutory

authority acts, however, demand for these acts depended largely on the dictates of foreign affairs,

and little on the costs and benefits of reorganizing rights.

       Table 3 describes enclosure acts. The last row of the table describes a useful control

group, amendments to enclosure acts. Amendments serve as an illuminating comparison because

their passage followed procedures identical to initial enclosure acts, but demand for amendments

arose primarily after random instances when errors crept into original legislation during the long

process of passing Parliament.

       The accuracy of the data depicted in Tables 1 through 3 depend upon our ability to

accurately determine the date on which acts passed. For most of our sample period, a convention

dated all acts passed by a session of Parliament as if they passed on the opening day of the

session. This convention lingered from an earlier period when Parliament met infrequently at

royal request and handled a limited volume of business in a short time period. In the eighteenth

century, Parliament met annually. Sessions began in the fall, usually in the months of October,

November, or December; lasted throughout the winter; and adjourned in the spring.

Complications arose, however, in the winters of 1714-1715, 1751-1752, and 1760-1761, when

the monarch died, and/or Parliament opened late. In 1714, for example, Queen Anne died.

George I assumed the throne. His ascension delayed the opening of Parliament until January of

1715. This parliament adjourned in the spring and another opened on schedule during the next

fall. So, in the year 1715, the conventional dating method assigned the acts passed in two

Parliamentary sessions – the winters 1714-15 and 1715-16 – to one calendar year, 1715. We




                                                  17
correct for this confusion in two ways. First, we run regressions with the raw data, while

assigning dummy variables to the years in which Parliament did not meet and the years in which

Parliament met twice. Second, we drop the period of problematic dating from our sample, and

run regressions for the years 1763 through 1830, when all acts are precisely dated. The two

methods yield similar results.

         Table 4 lists the explanatory variables. Rows (a) and (b) refer to two variables, the real

interest rate and the volume of foreign trade, which influenced the demand for estate, enclosure,

and statutory authority acts. The real interest rate determined the cost of investment and rate of

intertemporal exchange, which were principal factors determining the returns from reorganizing

property rights.7 The volume of foreign trade was a good measure of aggregate economic

activity, which was a principal determinant of revenues earned by improving infrastructure and

reallocating resources towards new and more productive uses. The volume of trade also

measured the health of the industrial and mercantile sectors relative to the agricultural economy.8

         Rows (c), (d), and (e) refer to variables that influenced the number of days that

Parliament sat in session and legislators’ incentives for passing large volumes of local

legislation. Together, these variables – years when the monarch died, years when a new prime

minister assumed office, and years when Parliamentary elections occurred – were principal

factors propelling annual variation in Parliamentary productivity.9 Additional explanatory

variables, listed in Rows (f) through (k), include indicators for years when Britain was at war,

when Britain suffered disease epidemics, and when Britain changed the structure of its land tax

7
    Our real interest rate is the nominal interest rate, measured as the yield on long-term government bonds, known
    as 2 ½ % consols from Neal (1990), minus inflation, measured as a three-year moving average of the percentage
    change in Clark’s (2001) consumer price index.
8
    Our measure of the volume of foreign trade, like most scholars, is the sum of the official value of imports plus
    exports (Mitchell, 1988). The official values reflect changes in the quantity of imports and exports weighted by a
    particular set of prices fixed at the outset of the eighteenth century.
9
    We take these variables from histories of England and its government by Holmes (1993), Holmes and Szechi
    (1993), and Evans (2001).

system. The set of explanatory variables also includes (g) the land tax rate in shillings per acre,

(h) an index of climatic conditions, based on tree ring measurements, which reflects exogenous

factors effecting agricultural productivity. Year-to-year changes in these variables were driven

principally by natural phenomena, such as weather and mortality, and international events, such

as relations with colonies and foreign rebellions. Thus, year-to-year changes in these variables

were largely exogenous to the British economy.


4. Methods

       This section establishes a framework for analyzing data described in the preceding

section. The goal is to derive straightforward statistical tests that yield robust results with broad

implications. The analysis begins with intuition standard among social scientists. Private parties

desired Parliament to pass acts. Their desires fluctuated as the value of acts fluctuated. Economic

conditions which altered the costs and benefits of acts propagated those fluctuations. Economists

summarize such relationships with an inverse demand function.

       (1)      p d = F (q d , X )

In this equation, pd indicates the maximum amount that the public would expend to secure the

passage of a certain quantity of legislation, qd. X indicates the array of economic factors that

influenced the costs and benefits of legislation. X ={x1, x2, …, xI}, where xi represents the ith

factor. To keep the notation clear, assume 0 < ∂F ∂xi < ∞ ∀ i = 1,..., I . Since F represents

demand, ∂F ∂q < 0 .

       The number of acts depended upon the time, effort, and resources that the legislature and

bureaucracy expended in the approval process as well as factors that influenced legislative

productivity, such as elections, changes in governments, monarchial mortality, and the need to

devote time to alternative matters, such as discussing military and international affairs. The


                                                  19
number of acts passed also depended upon the lawyers, lobbyists, and peripheral personnel that

supplicants employed to prepare and advance their petitions as well as the procedures, payoffs,

and side payments – both in London and the local community – that lubricated lawmaking in

London. We summarize this complex process with a supply function.

       (2)      ps = G (qs , Z )

ps indicates the costs of passing a quantity of legislation, qs. Z indicates the array of factors

influencing the supply of legislation. Symbolically, Z ={z1, z2, …, zJ}, where zi represents the jth

factor. To keep the notation clear, assume ∂G ∂z j > 0 ∀        j = 1,..., J . In the short run,

increasing the quantity of acts required more intensive employment of factors with diminishing

returns and rising costs. So, ∂G ∂q ≥ 0 .

       The interaction of supply and demand determines the quantity of acts that Parliament

passes. This equilibrium occurs when the demand price, pd, equals the supply price, ps, plus some

markup, m.

       (3)      pd = ps + m

If the markup exceeds zero, then someone in the act-passing process (either lobbyists, opponents

of the legislation, or members of Parliament) were able to extract some of the surplus generated

by the legislation, and the equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the supply and marginal

revenue curves. If the markup equals zero, then the act-passing process was completely

competitive, and the equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

       Substituting Equations (1) and (2) into Equation (3) reveals the number of acts passed in

equilibrium.

        (4)     F (q*, X * ) − G (q*, Z * ) = m




                                                  20
Here, the asterisk superscript indicates quantities of variables in equilibrium. Rewriting the

equilibrium condition emphasizes the implicit relationship between the equilibrium values of the

variables.

        (5)      H (q*, X * , Z * ) ≡ F (q*, X * ) − G (q*, Z * ) = m

The implicit function theorem describes the relationship between the function, H, the equilibrium

level of quantity demanded, q*, and the variables that shift supply and demand, X and Z.

        (6)              (
                q* = Q X * , Z *    )
                 ∂q *        ∂H (q*, X * , Z * )/ ∂xi          − ∂F (q*, X * )/ ∂xi
        (6’)          = (−1)                          =
                 ∂xi         ∂H (q*, X * , Z * )/ ∂q* ∂F (q*, X * )/ ∂q * −∂G (q*, Z * )/ ∂q *

                 ∂q *        ∂H (q*, X * , Z * )/ ∂zi           − ∂G (q*, Z * )/ ∂zi
        (6’’)         = (−1)                          =
                 ∂zi         ∂H (q*, X * , Z * )/ ∂q * ∂F (q*, X * )/ ∂q * −∂G (q*, Z * )/ ∂q *

        The total differential of (6) provides a linear approximation of the relationship in the

neighborhood of the equilibrium.

                                                     ∂q *           ∂q *
                                (       )
                                                I               J
        (7)      Dq* = DQ X * , Z * = ∑                  dxi + ∑         dz j
                                                i =1 ∂xi       j =1 ∂z j



This relationship can be estimated with the data described in the preceding section. The change

in the quantity of acts, Dq*, is the change in the number of acts passed from year t-1 to year t.

The changes in the independent variables, dxi and dzj, are changes in variables that influence

demand and supply from year to year. The estimating equation is

                          I                 J
        (8)      ΔAt = ∑ α i Δxi ,t −1 + ∑ β j Δz j ,t −1 + ε t
                         i =1               j =1



where ΔAt is the change in the number of acts from t-1 to t. Δxi,t-1 is the change in the ith demand

shift variable from t-2 to t-1. αi is an estimate of ∂q* ∂xi . Δzj,t-1 is the change in the jth supply

shift variable from t-2 to t-1. βj is an estimate of ∂q* ∂z j . εt is an error term.


                                                              21
          While the series, At, xi,t-1, and zj,t-1, exhibit trends and are non-stationary, the differences

of those series, ΔAt Δxi,t-1 Δzj,t-1, which enter the estimating equation, are stationary. The error

term, εt, is auto correlated and heteroskedastic. Because of these characteristics of the residual,

the Newey-West procedure for estimating a heteroskedastic and autocorrelation consistent

covariance matrix is the appropriate method for calculating the standard errors of our estimates.10

          Our estimates of ∂q * ∂xi and ∂q * ∂z j do not allow us to recover the parameters of the

underlying supply and demand curves, F and G. However, our estimates do enable us to

characterize the shapes of those curves. Propositions 1 and 2 indicate how.

          Proposition 1. If ∂q* ∂xi ≠ 0 for some i, then ∂G (q* , Z* ) / ∂q* < ∞ .

          Proof. This is a proof by contraposition. Assume ∂G (q* , Z* ) / ∂q* = ∞ . Then,
                  ∂q*       − ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂xi
                       =                           = 0 ∀ i = 1,..., I because ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂q < 0 and
                  ∂xi ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂q* − ∞
                  ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂xi < ∞ .

In prose, Proposition 1 indicates that if the quantity of acts fluctuated in response to fluctuations

of one (or more) of the factors that influenced the demand for acts, then the supply curve for acts

was not perfectly inelastic.

          Proposition 2. If ∂q* ∂z j ≠ 0 for some j, then ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂q* > −∞ .

          Proof. This is a proof by contraposition. Assume ∂F (q* , X * ) / ∂q* = −∞ . Then,
          ∂q*      − ∂G (q* , Z * ) / ∂z j
              =                            = 0 ∀ j = 1,..., J because by definition ∂G (q* , Z * ) / ∂q* ≥
          ∂z j − ∞ − ∂G (q* , Z * ) / ∂q*
          0 and ∂G (q* , Z * ) / ∂z j < ∞ .

In prose, Proposition 2 states that if the quantity of acts fluctuated in response to fluctuations of

one (or more) of the factors that influenced the supply for acts, then the demand curve for acts

was not perfectly inelastic.

        Determining whether αi, our estimate of ∂q* ∂xi , and βj, our estimate of ∂q* ∂z j , differ

from zero involves hypothesis tests. For the null hypothesis αi = 0, the alterative hypothesis is αi

≠ 0. For the null hypothesis βj = 0, the alterative hypothesis is βj ≠ 0. The test statistic has a t-

distribution.

        In addition to being straightforward, our tests have desirable properties. They are

consistent with almost any plausible structure for the system that produced Parliamentary acts.

They assume little about the data generating process and remain robust to a wide range of

statistical complications. They use the data at hand to answer the questions that we posed. Did

increases in the benefits of reorganizing property rights induce the passage of more estate,

enclosure, and statutory authority acts? Did Britain’s Parliament accommodate the public’s

demand to reorganize property-rights and reallocate resources towards more productive uses?


5. Results

        Table 5 presents results of this exercise for estate acts. Column (1) regresses the year-to-

year change in the annual number of estate acts on year-to-year changes in variables that

influence the demand for acts: the real interest rate and the volume of trade. The regression spans

the 124 years for which we have data suitable for statistical analysis. The initial year, 1705, lies

close to the point where Parliament formalized procedures for processing acts regarding property

rights. The final year, 1830, lies close to the nationwide reform of Parliamentary elections and

procedures enshrined in the Great Reform Act of 1832. The regression reveals a correlation

between changes in the number of acts and changes in the real interest rate. When the interest


                                                   23
rate rose and the cost of investing increased, the number of estate acts fell, as our hypothesis

predicts. The correlation is significant in statistical terms and substantial in magnitude. Column

(2) adds year-to-year changes in three explanatory variables that influenced the productivity of

parliament: election years, changes of the prime minister, and the death of a monarch. In this

specification, as in all others, the coefficient on the real interest rate remains statistically and

economically significant. Column (3) adds additional explanatory variables, including the year-

to-year changes in the real land tax rate, years where the tax code changed, tree ring growth,

epidemic mortality, and war years.11

          Columns (4) through (6) perform the same exercise for a control group: marriage,

naturalization, and office acts. These non-estate private acts resembled estate acts in many

dimensions – including typical clientele and procedures for passing parliament – but the value of

acts in the control group did not depend upon returns from reorganizing property rights. Why do

we need a control group? It is possible that the regressions in Columns (1) through (3) do not

control for some unobserved factor correlated with both the real interest rate (our independent

variable) and with the number of estate acts (our dependent variable). The exclusion of this

unobserved variable might make it appear as if the real interest rate influenced the demand for

estate acts, when in actuality, the excluded variable was the source of the correlation. Columns

(4) through (6) address this issue by indicating whether correlations existed between the

economic forces that influenced the passage of estate acts and non-estate private acts, for which

the demand did not depend upon factors that influenced the returns from reorganizing property

rights. If such correlations existed, then the coefficient on the real interest rate in columns (4)

11
     An array of robustness checks that we report in earlier versions of this paper demonstrate that the regressions are
     robust to a wide range of alternative specifications. Neither the signs nor the significance levels of the
     coefficients change when the endpoints of the analysis change by up to two decades. The signs and significance
     levels are also invariant to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables such as year-to-year changes in the
     level of population, industrial production, Parliamentary majorities, and military conflicts.


                                                           24
through (6) would be statistically and substantively significant. The coefficients are, however,

insignificant, indicating that excluded variables that influenced private acts’ passage through

Parliament did not drive the results of specifications (1) through (3).

        Columns (7) and (8) reinforce this result. Column (7) employs non-estate private acts as

an explanatory variable. Column (8) employs the residual from a regression of all non-estate

private acts on the explanatory variables in columns (4) through (6). The results of these

regressions indicate that non-estate private acts were correlated neither with the real interest rate

nor with acts that reorganized property rights. These results can be restated. In our analysis,

interest rates affected the treatment group but not the control group.

        Table 6 replicates these results for the years 1763 to 1830, which span the generations

during which the Industrial Revolution began, spread, and accelerated. The years also span the

period for which all acts are accurately dated and other statistical series pose the fewest

problems. Columns (1) through (3) and (6) through (10) demonstrate that the results of Table 1

hold for this key period and for the cleanest data. Column (4) shows that these results hold when

the dependent variable is limited to acts that authorized sales of strictly-settled land. Column (5)

shows that these results hold when the dependent variable is limited to acts that authorized the

lease of strictly-settled lands. Overall, Tables 5 and 6 indicate that changes in the interest rate

coincided with changes in the number of acts authorizing the sale, lease, and reorganization of

land.

        Table 7 presents the results of this exercise for statutory authorities. Column (1) regresses

the change in the number of statutory authority acts on the variables that influence the demand:

the change in the real interest rate and the change in the level of trade. Column (2) adds to the

regression variables that shift the supply curve including years of elections, changes in the prime




                                                  25
minister (and thus, the coalition controlling Parliament), and the death of the monarch. Column

(3) adds to the regression a vector of control variables including changes in climate (derived

from tree-ring data), changes in the disease environment (as measured by the onset and end of

epidemics), and changes in the real value of the land tax. Column (4) regresses the same

variables for the years 1763 to 1830, for which the dating of acts poses no problems. Column (5)

regresses changes in the number of transportation acts on the full spectrum of independent

variables introduced in the previous column. Column (6) regresses changes in the number of acts

pertaining to urban services and infrastructure on the full spectrum of independent variables.

          The results reveals a strong statistical correlation between economic conditions that

influenced the value of statutory authorities and the number of statutory authorities passed by

Parliament. The magnitude of the coefficients on our demand shift variables averages a little less

than -1.0 for the change in the real interest rate and a little below 1.0 for the change in trade. The

standard errors on those variables average about 0.30 and 0.28 respectively. The small size of the

standard errors relative to the magnitudes indicates that the coefficients are measured precisely.

The null hypothesis that the coefficients equal zero is rejected at the 1% significance level. This

result holds for all specifications, including numerous permutations which we examined to

determine the robustness of our result, but which to save space, have not included in this essay.12

          How responsive was Parliament to changes in the demand for acts reorganizing rights? A

few calculations reveal the answer to this inquiry. The standard deviation of the change in the

12
     The regressions are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications which to save space, we have not
     included in this essay. Neither the signs nor the significance levels of the coefficients change when the endpoints
     of the analysis change by a decade or more. Regressions employing data only for the period for which we can
     date acts precisely (1764 to 1830) yield coefficients nearly identical to those for the full sample. The estimates
     are also unaffected by the inclusion of additional explanatory variables. When the change in industrial
     production appears as an explanatory variable, the results remain the same, and industrial production is
     insignificant, unless trade is excluded. In the latter case, the coefficient on industrial production becomes
     statistically and substantively significant and explains about as much of the variation in the dependent variable as
     had trade. Adding indictors for the onset and cessation of military hostilities does not alter the results. Interacting
     years of military conflict with the principal explanatory variables strengthens the results.


                                                             26
real interest rate is 4.90. The average of coefficient on the real interest rate in columns (1)

through (3) is -1.03. Multiplying those numbers indicates that a one standard deviation decline in

the real interest rate coincided with an increase of 5.03 in the number of statutory authority acts.

The standard deviation of the change in the number of statutory authority acts is 16.84. Thus, a

one standard deviation decline in interest rates explains approximately 30% (~5.03/16.84) of a

standard deviation change in the number of statutory authority acts. Similarly, the standard

deviation of the change in trade is 4.66. The average of coefficient on trade in columns (1)

through (3) is 0.99. The product of those numbers is 4.61. Thus, a one standard deviation change

in the volume of trade explains 27% of a standard deviation change in the number of statutory

authority acts. In total, the two demand-shift variables in the regressions explain more than half

of the variation in the number of statutory authority acts. Parliamentary accommodation of the

public’s demands, in other words, explains the majority of the annual fluctuation in statutory

authority acts.

       Columns (4) and (5) indicate that this finding holds for subcategories of statutory

authorities associated with the modernization of the English economy: transportation

improvements and urban expansion. Multiplying the standard deviation of the real rate with the

coefficient in Column (4) and dividing by the standard deviation of transportation acts (11.9)

indicates that fluctuations in the real rate explain 24% of the fluctuation in transportation acts.

Similar calculations indicate that fluctuations in the real rate explain 21% of the fluctuation in

acts for improving infrastructure and public services in urban communities. Fluctuations in trade

explain 21% of the variation in transportation acts and 23% of the variation in urban acts.

       Political variables also have substantial correlations with the number of statutory

authorities passed by Parliament. The number of acts fell during election years and during years




                                                  27
in which monarchs died and rebounded one year later. Together, these perturbations in the

political process explain a little more than one quarter of the variation in statutory authorities.

        Columns (7) and (8) examine a control group: changes in the number of government

finance acts. The control group is uncorrelated with changes in interest rates and changes in the

volume of trade. Adding the control group as an explanatory variable alters neither the signs nor

the magnitudes of the other explanatory variables.

        Table 8 examines enclosure acts. Columns (1) through (3) show the number of enclosures

increased when interest rates fell. The number of enclosures fell when interest rates rose. This

result reinforces the decades-old observation of the inverse correlation between interest rates and

enclosures. We show that this relationship exists even after controlling for confounding variables

and autocorrelation. Column (4) shows that there is no correlation between enclosure

amendments and interest rates, which suggests that the variation in the number of enclosure acts

was not driven by changes in unobserved factors correlated with our explanatory variables (i.e.

factors that altered the costs or benefits of creating acts).

        Together, Tables 5 through 8 illuminate several important patterns. First, the equilibrium

number of acts reorganizing property rights changed in response to changes in the interest rate

and volume of trade, two of the principal factors influencing the returns from reorganizing

property rights. Proposition 1 reveals how to interpret this result. The supply curve for acts of

Parliament sloped upwards, but was not vertical. The political process, in other words, responded

flexibly to demands to reorganize property rights. When the public requested more acts,

Parliament passed more acts. When the public requested fewer acts, Parliament passed fewer

acts. Second, the equilibrium number of acts reorganizing property rights also changed in

response to changes in the productivity of Parliament, as measured by factors that shifted the




                                                   28
length of time that Parliament sat in session and legislators’ incentives for passing local

legislation. Proposition 2 reveals how to interpret this result. The demand curve for acts of

Parliament sloped downwards. When economic conditions increased (or decreased) returns from

reorganizing property rights, the number of acts that the public desired increased (or decreased).

         In sum, as the economy evolved, the public desired to adopt property-rights arrangements

that enabled them to reallocate resources towards more productive uses. Parliament

accommodated those desires.


6. Discussion

         At the opening of the eighteenth century, Parliament established a forum for reorganizing

rights to land and resources. This venue enabled individuals, families, and communities to

exploit opportunities that could not be accommodated by the inflexible rights regime inherited

from England’s past. During the next two centuries, Britain experienced agricultural and

industrial revolutions. The timing suggests a connection between Parliament’s revolutionary

approach to property rights and the economic events that followed. Evidence from an array of

sources indicates that Parliament’s actions did, in fact, foster economic development.

         Estate acts – particularly those authorizing the sale and lease of land – exposed land to

the invisible hand. Freeing resources from the shackles of the past loosened constraints on

landowners, facilitated the reallocation of physical and financial assets to new and lucrative uses,

and enabled the exploitation of opportunities arising in a dynamic economy. The lowering of

transaction costs enhanced efficiency and encouraged investment. The lowering of such barriers

has long been considered a principal force propelling European economic progress (North,

1981).




                                                  29
       The benefits of estate acts extended beyond the persons and property involved. Estate

acts established precedents. Knowledge of what Parliament would decide when confronted with

a case helped to resolve disputes within families, to safeguard the interests of investors, to

determine the distribution of rents within ongoing business arrangements, and to prevent the

holding-up of new projects by those seeking an inordinate share of the profits. The development

of institutions solving such problems has long been considered to be one of the principal

institutional innovations underlying modern capitalist economies (Williamson, 1985).

       Statutory authorities played a large role in two transcendent developments: urbanization

and commercialization. In rapidly expanding urban areas, statutory authorities provided fresh

water, removed garbage, aided the indigent, operated forums for dispute resolution, and financed

police forces. Large numbers of people living in small areas required these services. For

domestic and international commerce, statutory authorities established the high-volume, long-

distance transportation network. Turnpike trusts reduced freight charges and travel times by

widening, resurfacing, and maintaining thoroughfares (Bogart, 2005). Canal companies enabled

coal to reach emerging manufacturing centers, such as Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and

Leeds. Harbor-improvement authorities increased the number and draft of ships which could

dock in port, facilitating the expansion of maritime commerce.

       Statutory authorities of all types played a pivotal role in the accumulation of capital. In

1810, for example, the value of capital raised by statutory authorities for canals, rivers, turnpikes,

water works, docks, and gas lighting equaled 41 million pounds, or nearly 6.5% of the total

capital stock (Harris 2000, p. 195).

       Enclosures have been studied by numerous scholars. Many consider enclosures a catalyst

for increasing agricultural productivity (Richardson, 2001). Enclosures enabled farmers to




                                                 30
introduce new crops, improve livestock, reduce overuse of common resources, and react to

market opportunities. Robert Allen (1992) and Gregory Clark (1998) find these factors’ impact

on the productivity of arable land to be positive, but limited. Enclosure acts had additional

effects. Enclosures authorized the recovery of wastelands, the drainage of fens, and the

construction of irrigation channels. Enclosures also transferred agricultural land to urban and

industrial uses, particularly near expanding towns and cities.

          Britain’s system for reorganizing property rights was unique among European nations. In

other nations, the transition from medieval to modern landholding systems involved spasms of

reform and rebellion. In France after 1789 and Russia after 1917, for example, revolutionaries

annulled laws binding land and labor to traditional tasks; voided privileges possessed by nobles,

clergy, and corporations; redistributed political power; and restructured anachronistic property-

rights regimes.

          Before these revolutions, inflexible property-rights regimes prevented entrepreneurs from

exploiting emerging opportunities. In France, for example, the sclerotic landholding system

impeded the construction of infrastructure, such as canals, even when returns from their

operation would have substantially exceeded construction costs (Rosenthal, 1992). The principal

problem involved establishing rights of way. Local groups who opposed projects (or hoped for a

larger share of the profits) could perpetually delay construction by repeatedly suing in slow and

inefficient courts. Only after its revolution did France simplify procedures for establishing rights

of way.13

          Britain established procedures for establishing rights of way more than a century before

France and other countries on the continent. Britain created these procedures at the same time

13
     Evidence also indicates that during the eighteenth century, French cultivation continued as it had in the Middle
     Ages. In England, however, “agriculture entered a dynamic period of rapid and far reaching change (Sexauer
     1976).”


                                                          31
that Parliament established procedures for passing estate, statutory authority, and enclosure acts.

Why did Parliament act at that time? The proximate answer is the Glorious Revolution of 1688,

after which Britain became a constitutional monarchy, and the political system changed in

fundamental ways.

       Parliamentary supremacy triggered transcendent political and intellectual developments.

The Bill of Rights in 1689 (and subsequent legislation) encouraged the expansion of legislative

activity. Parliament began meeting on a predictable, annual schedule. Parliament began setting

its own agenda. Parliament established a permanent bureaucracy and procedures for processing

petitions. Streamlined procedures reduced the cost of submitting bills and increased the

predictability of passage. A cadre of professional solicitors and clerks emerged to help petitions

through the Parliamentary process. By the 1720s, capacity expanded to the point where the

legislative process could effectively accommodate almost any demand for legislation

reorganizing property rights.

       The political system that solidified at that time internalized a balance of political power

between landowning, mercantile, courtly, and aristocratic interests. That balance enabled

individuals interested in economic development to pass acts restructuring property rights and

promoting economic progress. Political stability ensured that those acts would not be overturned

by the ascension of new regimes, via either violent revolution or Parliamentary election.

Parliament’s decisions became the law of the land.

       The security of property rights was not absolute. Parliament felt free to alter rights

regarding resources that could be put to more productive uses. Parliament did not, however,

expropriate rights to resources without compensation. Our research indicates that individuals

often received remuneration for the rights that they lost. Remuneration typically left all parties as




                                                 32
well off as before. Parliament, in other words, provided security for income derived from rights

to property, but not security for the rights themselves. Rights typically defined who could use a

piece of property, what they could employ the property for, when they could employ the

property, and who would share in the resulting benefits. These rights were pliable. These rights

could be altered by common consent and political decisions. This flexibility of rights enabled

society’s institutional foundations to adapt to new conditions and emerging opportunities.

          This notion of security differs from the type of security discussed by North and Weingast

(1989), which referred to protection from arbitrary royal expropriation.14 The difference between

their ideas and our ideas stems from differences in opinion over the relative importance of

clauses in the British Bill of Rights. North and Weingast emphasize the Bill of Right’s initial

affirmative clause, which prohibited the monarch from interfering with the operations of the

legislature and judiciary, and which was a direct refutation of the reign of King Charles II. This

clause, however, reiterated similar clauses that appeared in the Magna Carta of 1215; in a

multitude of subsequent corroborating charters, confirmation, and statutes, passed during the

reigns of King Henry III through Elizabeth I; and the Petition of Right, a parliamentary

declaration in 1628 of the liberties of the people, assented to by King Charles I. We emphasize

clauses in the Bill of Rights that were new additions to the English constitutional lexicon. These

clauses enabled Parliament to sit in session for prolonged periods each year, to determine what

bills to consider during each session, and to set its own agenda. These clauses guaranteed

freedom of speech within Parliament and allowed opposition politicians in exile to return home.

These returnees brought with them new ideas about property and government. These changes in


14
     Like many economists, we believe that security from arbitrary expropriation is a prerequisite for progress. But,
     like most historians of early-modern Britain, we believe that such security existed in England long before the
     Glorious Revolution, which reestablished a status-quo that had existed before the Stuart’s attempted to impose
     an absolute monarchy on their united kingdoms.


                                                          33
the political system enabled Parliament to contemplate complex issues concerning property

rights and to establish a system that protected rights to income, which minimized opposition to

the reorganization of rights, and a system that encouraged institutional adaptability, which

facilitated the reallocation of resources to new and more productive uses.

          The seminal studies of Ronald Coase (1960, 1974) illuminate the importance of Britain’s

adaptable property-rights regime. Coase argues that in the presence of transaction costs, attaining

economic efficiency requires the proper definition and allocation of property rights. In “The

Problem of Social Cost (1960)” Coase argues that nineteenth-century British common and

statutory law recognized these principles, and that Britain’s courts and Parliament reallocated

property rights to encourage economic efficiency. In “The Lighthouse in Economics,” Coase

(1974) argues that in the nineteenth century, Parliament’s creation of statutory authorities

encouraged the provision of public goods and services. Coase illuminates his assertion with an

example. Parliament assigned ‘lighthouse rights’ to certain plots of land. Lighthouse rights

allowed anyone operating a lighthouse to collect tolls from passing vessels. The customs service

collected these tolls when merchants submitted customs forms, which indicated their port of

origin and arrival, and thus all of the lighthouses that they passed along the way. These new

lighthouse rights superseded ancient rights enshrined guaranteeing merchants transit free from

tax or toll. Our research suggests that Parliament began to operate in the way that Coase

described in the early eighteenth century, following the Glorious Revolution, when Parliament

gained control of government and political enlightenment reached England.15



15
     Previous scholars emphasized the first half of Coase’s essay, “The Problem of Social Costs (1960),” which
     models a world without transaction costs in which any assignment of secure property rights results in an efficient
     outcome. We emphasize the second section of Coase’s essay, which models a world with transaction costs. In
     such a world, some distribution of property rights lead to efficient outcomes, while others trap people in poverty.
     The market alone may not alleviate this affliction. Some institution, such as Parliament, must lower transaction
     costs and/or reassign rights in order for efficiency to arise.


                                                           34
        Puzzles remain concerning the causes and consequences of the property rights revolution

in Britain. One puzzle concerns redistribution. Changing property rights increased some group’s

incomes, but potentially lowered the incomes of others. Vested interests that could be harmed

would naturally lobby against legislation. Acts reorganizing property rights, however, often

passed without opposition and with the support of all concerned. Why? Parliament appears to

have overcome opposition by establishing mechanisms for ensuring that all pertinent parties

benefited from the legislation. Parliament, in other words, ensured that legislation contained

side-payments sufficient to satisfy vested interests.

        A second puzzle concerns the effort which members of Parliament put into designing and

passing estate, enclosure, and statutory authority acts. Parliament spent on acts affecting specific

individuals and communities as much time and energy, if not more, than Parliament did on acts

concerning war, taxation, trade, and colonies. Why did Parliament devote so much effort to

issues affecting localities and individuals? A possible explanation is that members of Parliament

devoted themselves to passing such legislation because it increased their chances of reelection

and their personal incomes. Localities supported members of Parliament who advanced local

interests. Competition for seats in Parliament, therefore, may have been a key factor underlying

political support for institutional adaptability.

        A third puzzle concerns the connection between the property-rights revolution and an

intellectual revolution occurring at that time: the Enlightenment. The essence of the

Enlightenment was the notion that natural laws could be identified and harnessed for the

betterment of society (Mokyr 2002, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c). The reform of parliamentary process

in the early eighteenth century coincided with the rise of prominent enlightened English thinkers

including John Locke. In December 1689, Locke published his magnum opus, Two Treatise of




                                                    35
Government. The second treatise focused on the concepts of property and legislature. Locke

wrote that property should be used industriously and rationally. Rights to property formed the

foundation for civil society. These rights existed by consent of the citizenry. That consent formed

the law of the land (Locke, Second Treatise on Government, Chapter V, On Property, Sections

34 and 35). Locke’s concepts of property rights, civil government, and consent of the governed

informed the individuals who reformed Britain’s political system in the late-seventeenth and

early-eighteenth century. These reforms allowed all citizens (not just the King and his

appointees) to utilize forms of petitions previously employed for the reorganization of royal

estates, appointments to royal offices, and the assignment of rights to aristocratic estates and

chartered towns. The principal modification of the old form was the addition of clauses

indicating that the acts would enhance the wealth of the realm and enable individuals and

communities to prosper. These clauses provide textual evidence that Enlightenment ideals

influenced estate, enclosure, and statutory authority acts.

       What are the broader lessons from Britain’s property rights revolution? Adaptable

property-rights may be as important as secure property-rights. Both may be necessary for

economic development. The pair may be sufficient to trigger modern economic growth. One way

to create adaptable property-rights is to establish political procedures that generate consent for

change and ensure that vested interests do not oppose development. Piecemeal actions that

address specific problems facing individuals and communities may be easier to implement than

widespread reforms that addresses general problems. Overtime, a piecemeal process may reveal

general patterns that could serve as the foundation for nationwide reforms. The Parliamentary

procedures that triggered the property-rights revolution in Britain (and which remain embedded




                                                 36
within Anglo-Saxon legal systems today) may have useful applications in modern developing

nations.
