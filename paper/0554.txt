                         Oil and the Dollar


                              ABSTRACT



     This paper develops a simple theoretical model of the effect of an

oil price increase on exchange rates. The model shows that the direction

of this effect depends on a comparison of the direct balance of payments

burden of the higher oil price with the indirect balance of payments benefits

of OPEC spending and investment. In the short run, what matters is whether

the U.S. share of world oil imports is more or less than its share of OPEC

asset holdings; in the long run, whether its share of oil imports is more

or less than its share of OPEC imports. Casual empiricism suggests that

the initial effect and the long run effect will run in opposite directions

an oil price increase will initially lead to dollar appreciation, but

eventually leads to dollar depreciation.

    Probably the two most watched prices in the last decade have been the

value of the dollar and the price of oil. A natural question is how they

are related: how does an increase in the price of oil affect the dollarTs

exchange rate? This paper sets out a model which can be used to analyze

this question.


    There are several reasons besides its practical importance why   this   is

an interesting subject for study. First, the interaction between oil

prices and exchange rates is inherently a problem of multilateral economic

relations, since we are concerned with the dollar rate against other

industrial countries' currencies rather than against OPEC currencies. Even

a minimal model in this area must involve at least three countries, in

contrast to the one— aid two—country models prevalent in the literature art

exchange rates.


    Second, the problem of analyzing an oil price increase is one in which

some commonly used siriplifications made in much recent analysis can be

showr to be misleading. Recent papers by Findlay and Rodriguez (1977),

Buiter (197), and Obstfeld Q980) have treated an increase in oil prices

as an increase in a single country's import bill, invoking "small country"

considerations in neglecting the consideration of the effects of the oil

price increase on othercountries or of how OPEC disposes of its income.

In this paper we will see that such neglect is never justified, regardless

of the size of the country concerned.


    Finally, the case of an oil price increase offers an interesting

example of possible conflict between an asset market and a goods

market   view of tile exchange rate. Suppose that one were, in practice,

to attempt to assess the effects of an oil price increase on the dollar.
                                              2




One approach would be to focus on "real" factors: how does U.S. oil import

dependence compare with that of other countries? How much of its increased

income will OPEC spend on U.S. goods? Another approach would be to look

at financial factors: ho will OPEC invest its surplus? As I will argue

later, these approaches can easily yield conflicting answers, and in the

case of the dollar appear to conflict in fact. The model developed in the

paper suggests a reconciliation: in the short run, before OPEC spending

has risen to absorb its higher income, the financial question is the right

one, while in the long run, when OPEC is spending its income, the real

questions become appropriateo

    The model developed here is a dynamic partial—equilibrium portfolio model

based in large part on Kouri (1981). The structure of this model is set

out in Section 1, and its dynamic behavior is analyzed in Section 2.

Section 3 contains the analysis of the effects of an oil price increase.

Finally, Section 4 contains an examination of the ways in which the analysis

would be modified if certain complications assumed away in earlier sections

are let back in.


1. Assumptions of the Node1

    Consider     a world consisting of three countries: America, Germany, and
OPEC. America and           Germany sell manufactured goods to OPEC and each other;

OPEC   has   a single export, oil, the price of       which is   assumed exogenously

 fixed in dollars.

       Germany's trade balance with respect to the U.S., measured in dollars,

 will be     assumed   to   depend   on the exchange rate:


               T=T(V)                                                                  (1)


 where V is the mark price of the dollar.               r,r'iting this partial equilibrium
 relationship we       are implicitly     taking industrial countries' real incomes and
                                         3



price levels as given.

    Oil imports will be assumed to be exogenously fixed in volume terms,

                                                                           (2)
          0A°A


Thus we assume away—until Section 4 below——the complications introduced by

the possibility that countries will be differentially successful in reducing

oil consumption.

    OPEC import behavior involves spending a share '     of   its expenditure on

German products, 1 —     y on American products, where y in general depends on
the dollar—mark exchange rate:


          XG y(V)X                                                          (3)


             =   [1 - y(V)]X

where XG, XA are OPEC dollar expenditures on German     and   U.S. goods, and X

is total OPEC dollar expenditure.

    What determines OPEC expenditure? The crucial aspect of actual OPEC

spending behavior that we will want to capture in this paper is the lag in

the adjustment of OPEC imports to export earnings. I will assume that OPEC

dollar spending adjusts gradually to the level of dollar export earnings:

          x =           -   x)                                              (4)
                 X(Pö
where 0      +          is total oil exports.2


    Notice that there is an asymmetry in the treatment of OPEC imports and

the imports of America and Germany. Industrial country imports are assumed

 to depend only on.prices, whereas OPEC's imports ate allowed to depend

directly on income. The basic reason for assuming this is, of course that
                                      4




the lag of OPEC spending behind income is central to our story, while

income changes in the industrial countries are not. One can, however, offer

an empirical justification. The redistribution Of world income caused

by oil price changes involves much larger percentage changes in OPEC real

income than in the income of, say, the OECD countries, for the simple

reason that oil imports constitute only a few percent of OECD GNP but most

of OPEC's GNP. Thus in considering the impact of an oil price increase it

may not be too unreasonable to take income changes into account izi analyzing

OPEC'S behavior, while ignoring them in industrial countries.


      Let us turn next to the asset markets. There will be assumed to be only

two assets, dollars and marks, each held by all three countries. Following

Kouri (1981), we will assume that America holds a fixed dollar value of

marks in its portfolio, and that Germany holds a fixed mark value of dollars
                                                           -
in its portfolio:3


           MA/V      HA


            DGVHG
where NA is American mark holdings, and HA and Hc are constant terms.

      OPEC will be assumed to allocate its wealth between dollars and marks.

Let      be OPEC wealth measured in dollars, i.e.,


                                                                        (6).
            WE D0 + N0/V

where D0 and      are OPEC dollar and mark holdings. Then we will assume that

a fraction ci. of this wealth is held in marks, 1 —       in dollars:

                                                               .




            MQ/V =   CLW0


               = (1   —     ç)                        .
                                                                        (8)
                                          5




    We have now specified a complete dynamic model. The next step is to

analyze its behavior, before applying it to the central question of the

paper.


2. Dynamic Behavior

    To understand the model's dynamic behavior, it is useful to begin by

deriving several balance of payments measures, First, let us derive the

German current account measured in dollars. This is German net exports to

America, plus exports to OPEC, less oil imports:

           BG = T(V) +     y (V)x —   P



    Similarly, the American current account may be written


           BA =    -T(V)   + [l—'y' (V)] x —P
                                                °A                    (10)


    We will assume that the appropriate Marshall—Lerner conditions hold, i.e.,

                   V > 0   and B/V < 0.

    OIEC's current account is simply the difference between exports and

imports:


           B0=P00—X                                                   (11)


    The equation for the rate of change in OPEC's wealth, however, must

also take into account capital gains and losses on its German currency

holdings; thus we have

              =
                  B0 -ct W0 ('/V)                                     (12)


    Next we can write down capital account balances. For Continuous

exchange rate changes, we can derive a net flow of capital into Germany

which equals purchases of marks by America and OPEC, less purchases of

dollars by Germany:
                                                    6



                                          —
            K0 MAIV + N0/V                                                             (13)

                       (MA/V) (V/V) + (M0/V) (V/v)

                      + P0 (V/V) + a

                  =            +       (1-a) W0 + D0] (/V) + a
                       [MA/V                                       B0


    Now consider the condition of overall balance of payments equilibrium

for Germany (we could equivalently use a condition of equilibrium for

America). We must have BG + KG =                   0;   that is,


             [MA/V + a (1—a) W0 +               G] (V/V)                               (14)


                       +aB0+B =0
    or      V/V           —[B0 + a B0]
                                                 ____
                                 + a (l—a)W0 +
                          MA/V                          DG

    This is a variant of the "acceleration equation" derived by Kouri. In

Kouri's two—country model, the rate of change of the eschange rate depended

on the ratio of the current account to gross international investment.

Here we have to extend the equation owing to. the presence of a third country,

but the principle remains the same. In the special case where OPEC holds

no marks, i.e., a =          O,(14)           reduces to Kouri's acceleration equation where

the rate of change of the exchange rate depends only on tile German current

account,

             •
                   —           _BG                                                         1
                                                                                        (14 )
                          A /V +D0
                       M


         Similarly, if OPEC holds no dollars, i.e., a =1, the rate of change

 of the exchange rate depends only on America's current account:



                      =            A
                 iv                                                                   (1411)
                                   + DG

     Except in these special cases, however, there i no one—for—one relation-

 ship between a country's current account and its exchange rate. Figure 1

illustrates      the dynamic system     defined   by equations (4) and (14).           OPEC expendi-

ture adjusts towards itS income,and this behavior is indicated by the vertical schedul

X = O     For reference I also indicate those combinations of X and V

for which the current account of each industrial country is in balance.

An   increase     in OPEC expanditure improves each country's current account,

and to   restore balance, this must be          offset by an   appreciation of the
dollar in   the case of America, a depreciation in the case of Germany. The

slopes of these schedules can be derived from (9) and (10):

            dV                  1y
            dX
                   B 0      T                                                                (15)
                    A       V

            dX
                    B-0
                     G          V V
      Finally,    we have the combinations of X and          V for which the exchange rate

is stationary, VIV-o. In the figure, this is shown as downward sloping, but

in fact it can be slope either way.                        From (14), the slope is



            dX
                            =a'                                                              (16)




Whether   the schedule slopes up or down          depends on whether a       —    the   s1are

of   marks in OPEC's portfolio — is        greater or less than y,         the   share of
German goods in OPEC imports. Clearly, also, the slope of V/V                         0 lies
between those of the current—account balance schedules (15). If                       OPEC

holds    only dollars, a        0 and   the schedule coincides with BG           0;    if OPEC

holds    only marks, a    = 1 and   the schedule coincides with BA
      The intuition behind these results is straightforward. Suppose OPEC

expenditure        were to rise from its long—run level. This would have two

direct    effects on     Germany's balance of payments. First, it would improve

the current      account, because part of        the   expenditure would   fall   on German

goods. On       the other   hand, it    would   worsen the German capital account, because
                                               9


OPEC would now be running a current account deficit which it would in

part finance by liquidating its holdings of marks. Only if OPEC holds

no marks can this second effect be neglected.

      As long as OPEC holds both currencies, neither country's current ac-

count provides an accurate guide to the direction of movement of the

exchange rate. At point I in the figure, America is running a current ac-

count surplus, yet the dollar is depreciating; at J America is running
a deficit, yet the dollar is appreciating. Nor does the bilateral trade

balance between America            and   Germany provide a guide, since given this
balance each country's          overall    balance   still depends on   OPEC expenditure.
      Finally, note that assuming that either Germany or America is "small"
does not remove these ambiguities. Suppose we wanted to assume that Germany
is "small", and wanted to argue that this would allow us to focus solely on
the German        current    account. Consider the slope of V/V       = 0 relative to that

of   BG =   0;only if these converge can we use the Gerniah current account
alone.      But the relative slope is 1 — ct/y. If Germany is small, both ci. and
y will be small numbers, but their ratio need not be. The only justification
for an exclusive focus on an individual country's current account is the as-
sumption that it is "sxaaller" in OPEC's asset holdings than in its import bill.
3.    Effects of an Oil        Price Increase
      The effects of an oil price increase on the exchange rate depend primarily

on three parameters: c, the share of marks in OPEC's portfolio; y,                  the   share

of   German goods in OPEC's imports; and a =             OG/O,
                                                                 the German share in world oil

imports.         The short   run   impact depends whether 0.      is greater or less than a;

the   long run impact depends on whether y is more or less than a.
                                                   10


      The intuition behind this is simple. Since OPEC spending lags behind

income, an oil pride increase initially increases industrial country import

bills without a corresponding increase in exports. While                    American and
German current accounts are thus worsened, however, there is an improvement

in capital accounts as OPEC invests its trade surplus in dollars and marks.

Whether the net effect is favorable or unfavorable for the dollar depends on

whether OPEC invests in dollars more or less than America's share of the

industrial wor1ds current account deficit.

      Over tiine hotever, OPEC's spending rises to match              its    income, and redudes

the   rate at which it acquires foreign assets. Thus the balance of payments
effects     of higher oil prices depend to a diminishing extent on OPECs asset

preferences, and increasingly upon its preferences for goods. In the long

run, OPEC ceases investing abroad, and only a comparison of import and ex-

port   shares matters.

      Formally, we can determine the impact effect of an oil price increase by

differentiating           (14) with respect to
                                                            .

equilibrium is at I.      An increase in the price of oil shifts V/V = 0

upward andX    0 right, sothat the new equilibrium is at J. By referring back

to Figure 1, we can see that America remains in current account deficit through-

out this process, whereas Germany after initially running a deficit, may

later move into surplus; but the mark will appreciate whether or not this

happens, and will begin appreciating before Germany's trade moves into

balance if it does.

    What makes this case interesting is that it seems to bear some. tesemblance

to the facts. If we view "Germany" as the OECD except for the U.S., the

relationship y' >   c >     appears to hold. The U.S. share of OECD oil imports

is comparable to its share of OECD GNP, while its share of OPEC imports is

comparable to its much smaller share of OECD exports. Except for the compli-

cating factors to be discussed in the final section of the paper, this suggests

that an oil price increase ought to lead first to dollar appreciation, and

later to an even greater dollar depreciation.


4. Some Complications


     The model presented in this paper contains enough structure so that

qualitative behavior depends on only a handful of easily quantifiable

parameters. In this section I will somewhat mar this simplicity by showing

that two other factors can matter. The first of these is the effect of

oil prices on oil consumption; the second of these is the effect of market

anticipation of exchange rate changes.


     Suppose that instead of being exogenously fixed, oil imports depend

on the price of oil in domestic currency. We would then have to rewrite

(2)as

                                                                           (19)

where        )   and   O( ) are    demand curves which may have different elasticities,

although in both cases we may safely assume the elasticity to be less than

one. The introduction of demand elasticity will modify both the short—run

and long—run effects of increasing P0                since Germany!s share of the

the marginal burden of an oil price increase will no longer equal its

share of current oil imports. The appropriate share variable now becomes

where C, CA are the price elasticities of oil demand in Germany and

 America——numbers much less accessible to casual, or even careful, empiri-

 cism than        and


        A more difficult analytical problem is posed by market expectations of

 exchange rate changes. I have been assuming that OPEC holds a fixed share

 a of its wealth in marks; that America holds a fixed dollar value of marks;

 and that Germany holds a fixed mark value of dollars. Realistically,

 all of these should depend on the expected rate of dollar appreciation:

             a = a(Tr)                                                              (20)

             HA = HA(Tr)



             HG    H(Tr)
    where 11 = E        [1/v].
        The effect of. introducing these expectations, particularly if we adopt

 the popular hypothesis of 'rationa1" expectations, is to blur the distinction

betwee short run and long run. As many authors have               emphasized, long—run
factors, even if they have no effect on the current distribution of asset

hoidings can still have an immediate effect on the exchange rate through

their effect on expectations. Thus the real factors can dominate the

financial ones even from the start.

     A complete analysis of the effect of speculation is a difficult task,

since it involves three differential equations and hence defies graphical

analysis. A heuristic approach, however, suggests the kind of results

which ought to emerge. Suppose we distinguish between the tnon_speculativeT

value of the dollar—the value it would have if investors expected its

value to remain unchanged——and its actual value. If expectations were


static, the "non—speculative   and actual exchange rates would always

coincide. What we showed In Section 3 was that if y >   a > a,   the path of

the rate would then look like the solid line in Figure 3. Now suppose that

expectations are rational. This will change the actual path of V; it will

also change the path of the "non—speculative" exchange rates because both

trade balances and capital gains will be different from what they would

have been under static expectations.

     If these effects are not too strong, the qualitative features of the

"non—speculative" rate1s path will not change: it will first rise, then fall.

                                    Figure 3

If this is the case——and I have assumed it, not proved it——then the actual

path of the exchange rate can be analyzed using the "non—speculative"

path as a reference. For V will lie above its non—speculative value if

V/V is positive, below it if V/V   is   negative.

     The possibilities are indicated by the broken lines in Figure 3.

Either V is initially expected to rise or it is expected to fall. In the

first case there must be an initial jump in the value of the dollar and

continuing appreciation for a time before V/V turns negative and the dollar

falls below its non—speculative value (this must happen while the non—

speculative rate is still rising). In the second case there is an initial

discrete devaluation of the dollar, followed by continuing gradual depre-

ciation. Thus in tLis case the long—run fundamental considerations of

current account balance dominate even in the short run. This case is

presumably more likely, the fast2r the adjustment of OPEC spending and

the more sensitive portfolio holdings are to expected exchange rate changes.

     In   this paper I have developed a simple model which   allows us   to consider

some of the channels through which changes in the price of oil affect

exchange rates. Although the model is necessarily a highly oversimplified

representation of reality, it does bring out two basic cnsiderations. First,

the effect of the price of oil depends on whether the burden to a country's

balance of payments created by higher oil imports is greater .or less than

the improvement due to OPEC imports and investment. Second, the relative

importance of OPEC investment preferences falls over time so that in the long

run it is OPEC's import preferences which matter.

1
     Alternatively, we might suppose that OPEC attempts to fix the real price

of oil by pegging the price to a basket of dollars and marks. This would

not alter the qualitative results.

2
     Strictly speaking, it might be more reasonable to assume that real as

opposed to dollar spending adjusts with a lag. Again the qualitative

results, though more difficult to derive, remain unchanged.

     This amounts to assuming that each country has a zero marginal propen-

sity to hold wealth in the other's currency. As Kouri and deNacedo (1978)

have shown, what is crucial for explaining the effect of current accounts

or   exchange rates is the "wealth transfer effect": each country has a
marginal propensity to hold wealth in its own currency which     is larger

than that of foreigners. The assumption made here can.be viewed as a

shorthand    way of capturing   this effect, one which will be a reasonable

approximation if foreign assets are a small fraction of each country's

portfolio.
