The Effectiveness of Workplace Drug Prevention
Policies: Does ‘Zero Tolerance’ Work?

                                           ABSTRACT

       Workplace drug testing programs are becoming increasingly more common although there
is little research demonstrating that they have any effect on drug use by employees. This paper
analyzes the deterrence effect of a particularly aggressive workplace drug-testing policy
implemented by the military in 1981. The military’s policy incorporates random drug testing of
current employees and zero tolerance. Using data from various years of the Department of
Defense’s Worldwide Survey of Health Related Behaviors and the NHSDA, we find illicit drug
prevalence rates among military personnel are significantly lower than civilian rates in years after
the implementation of the program but not before, suggesting a sizeable deterrence effect. These
basic findings are replicated with data from the NLSY. The NLSY are also used to explore
sensitivity of the deterrence effect to the probability of detection and severity of punishment,
which varied across military branches during the first few years of the program’s implementation.

I.     INTRODUCTION
       In recent years both private firms and government agencies have adopted various

programs to combat illegal substance abuse in the workplace. The percentage of medium- to

large-sized firms that use some form of drug testing nearly doubled in only four years, from 31.9

percent in 1988 to over 62 percent in 1992-93 (Hartwell, et al., 1996). The use of drug testing by

public sector organizations also has grown in recent years (Felman and Petrini, 1988). Unlike

most private firms that require only job applicants to submit to drug tests, many public sector

organizations, particularly those involved in public transit and public safety, require regular

random drug testing of current employees. A few organizations go even further than that by

adopting a policy of “zero tolerance,” which requires dismissal of workers who test positive for

drugs on urinalysis tests. The goal of such aggressive policies is to impose high enough sanctions

to deter drug use among current and potential users.

       Despite the growth in the use of drug testing, little research exists on the effects of these

programs in the workplace. Assuming rational behavior, drug testing policies should affect

decisions to use illicit substances by increasing the cost of such behavior. This cost is positively

related to the probability of detection, the probability of punishment given detection, and the

severity of the penalty imposed. Each of these components is to some extent determined by the

structure of the drug testing program. In some industries or firms, for example, drug (or alcohol)

tests are administered only when an accident occurs.1 Clearly, the primary goal of such a policy is

to detect those who may have been impaired by illegal substances and punish them accordingly.

The deterrence effects of such ex-post policies will tend to be weaker than when drug testing is

administered randomly to an entire work force. Even random drug testing strategies, however,

may not be very effective at detecting users. Borack (1997) shows that, for selected monthly




                                                  3
testing rates, the expected time until detection of a non-gaming user ranges from one year to as

high as 10 years. Of course, experienced users can try to “beat” the system by using illicit drugs

at certain low-risk times (like immediately following a drug test), and it has been shown that these

gaming users will generally avoid detection for longer periods (Borack, 1995). Thus, although

detection is a valuable component of anti-drug programs, especially a drug testing program, it is

not the primary output. Rather, the main output of such programs is the deterrence of potential

users. Little research has been done, however, on the effectiveness of drug testing as a deterrent

to either current or potential users.

        In this paper we explore the deterrence effect of a particularly aggressive drug-testing

program that has existed in the military since 1981. The military offers a unique natural

experiment to study the deterrence effect because it imposes mandatory random drug testing on

its current employees, which raises the probability of detection, and it assesses a very high penalty

-- job loss -- on those detected. This combination of random drug testing and zero tolerance is

relatively rare in the private sector or in other government agencies and is likely to yield the

maximum deterrence effect for alternative feasible drug prevention programs. However, the cost

of this program can be high due to the costs (recruiting and training costs) of replacing discharged

personnel. Assessing the true magnitude of the deterrence effect is therefore critical for enabling a

more complete assessment of the cost-effectiveness of zero-tolerance policies.

        Using data from the National Household Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA) and the

Department of Defense’s Worldwide Survey of Health Related Behaviors (DODWWS), we

examine the deterrence effect of the military’s rigid drug program by comparing differences in

illicit drug use between the military population and the civilian population. Although the civilian

accident (see Rhee and Zhang, 1993).
                                                         4
population is not a clean comparison group because some individuals may be subject to a similarly

aggressive prevention program, the vast majority of the population experiences far less rigid

programs, or none at all. Data from these two cross sectional studies in 1995 reveal that

significant differences in drug use exist between these two populations, with those in the military

being significantly less likely to report use of an illicit drug in the past year or in the past month.

It is not clear if this difference can be entirely attributed to a deterrence effect of the drug testing

program, however, given that people who decide to join the military know the program is already

in place and may self-select into or away from this occupation. Further, drug use may be

correlated with unobservable factors that influence an individual’s willingness to serve in the

military, such as patriotism and a strong belief in our nation’s laws. We, therefore, also examine

data from these two surveys prior to the implementation of the military’s rigid program to assess

whether there were significant differences in drug use patterns before the program existed.

Finally, to more directly assess the issue of selectivity bias, we examine self-reported drug use in

the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) both before and after the adoption of the

military’s program. The use of these longitudinal data enables us to restrict our difference-in-

differences approach to those individuals who are either “continuously in the military” or

“continuously in the civilian population.”

        The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the implementation of

the military’s program beginning in 1981 and how the program currently operates today. Section

III presents data from the NHSDA and DODWWS surveys to examine both post- and pre-

program differences in drug use between the civilian and military sectors. Section IV addresses

the same issues using longitudinal data from the NLSY. Section V provides some insight into the

separate effects of random drug testing versus zero tolerance policies, and Section VI concludes

the paper.

II.     THE MILITARY’S DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAM

        The Department of Defense (DoD) first began implementing a urinalysis drug testing

program in 1971 with the original intent of identifying illicit drug users, rehabilitating them, and

returning them to full duty status (Bray et al, 1992). It was not initially envisioned as a tool for

disciplinary or punitive actions. When in 1974 the DoD tried to change its approach and use the

results of drug tests for disciplinary and administrative action, these efforts were invalidated by a

Military Court of Appeals ruling. In 1980, that ruling was reversed and the DoD issued a new

directive updating its original drug testing policy. The new directive required each of the military

services to enact and operate urinalysis drug testing programs and clearly stated that drug testing

results could be used, with certain restrictions, in punitive or separation proceedings.

Immediately following this new directive, the U.S. Air Force adopted a policy of frequent and

random drug testing. Further, Air Force commanders were empowered to order spot testing

anytime they felt there was a reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol abuse. All of the service

branches adopted a general policy of “zero tolerance,” but these policies were not applied

uniformly to all personnel. For example, the Army allowed soldiers with less than three years of

service a reprieve from separation proceedings if it was their first offense.2 Similarly, the Navy

and Marine Corps allowed for the possibility of rehabilitation of junior personnel if their problems

were deemed treatable.3 Further, drug testing rates varied across the services. Army commanders

were given the freedom to set their own drug testing rates for members of their command

(Department of the Army, 1988), while commanders in the U.S. Navy and Marines were required

to test 10 to 20 percent of their commands on a monthly basis (Lieb, 1986). By 1995, however,

all of the services had changed their drug testing strategies to be consistent with each other and

zero-tolerance had become uniformly applied to all personnel.

       Despite some initial differences in program implementation, the introduction of the

military's drug program in 1981 was followed by a steady downward trend in illicit drug use

among active duty personnel. Drug prevalence rates fell from 27.6 percent in 1980 to only 3.4

percent in 1992. (Bray et al, 1995). The biggest drop occurred between 1980 and 1985 (from

27.6 to 8.9 percent), which spans the period when the Department of Defense (DOD) introduced

and refined its program. Some analysts have assumed these drops in drug use in the armed forces

were attributable directly to the military’s programs. However, data from the National Household

Survey of Drug Abuse (NHSDA) shows that past month drug use among civilians also fell during

this period. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether the drug use reductions were a true program

effect or simply due to changes in drug use patterns among the general youth population from

which the military recruits.

III.   ANALYSIS OF NHSDA AND DODWWS DATA

       The 1995 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) is part of a series of

nationwide surveys designed to measure the prevalence of drug use among U.S. households. The

1995 NHSDA is the 15th in a series of studies that began in 1971. The survey was based on a

stratified, multi-stage area probability sample that provides a nationally representative sample of

the non-institutionalized civilian population 12 years old and older (SAMHSA, 1996). For the

1995 survey, 115 districts were selected for the first stage of sampling and approximately 22,000

persons were screened for interviewing. Only 17,747 interviews were completed yielding a

response rate of 80.6 percent.4 In addition to collecting important socioeconomic and

demographic information, each year the NHSDA asks a series of questions pertaining to lifetime,


                                                  7
annual and thirty-day non-medical use of 11 or more illicit substances including marijuana,

cocaine, crack, inhalants hallucinogens, PCP, heroin, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers and

analgesics. The drug use questions have been developed and tested over time so as to maximize

response rates and minimize reporting biases. To further reduce reporting bias, the NHSDA uses

self-administered questionnaires for this portion of the household interview.

           Although the NHSDA contains some military personnel, this sample is small and not

representative of all uniformed personnel since the sampling frame excludes individuals living on

military installations. To examine drug use among military personnel, we therefore use the 1995

Department of Defense Worldwide Survey of Health Related Behaviors Among Military

Personnel (DODWWS). The DODWWS was the sixth in a series of surveys of active-duty

military personnel that started in 1980. The overall purpose of the series of surveys is to

determine the nature, causes and consequences of substance use and health behavior among

active-duty military personnel and to evaluate the impact of current and future program policies

targeting substance use and health decisions in this population. Included in the survey were 395

questions pertaining to illicit drug, alcohol and tobacco use within the military. In 1995, the

overall response rate for the eligible population was 69.6 percent. The final 1995 DODWWS data

set consists of 16,193 observations (4,440 Air Force, 4,265 Navy, 3,960 Marine Corps and 3,638

Army). 5

           Both of these surveys are based on self-reported data. Hoyt and Chaloupka (1993) show

that the method of administering these type of surveys can affect the magnitude of reported drug

use. However, both surveys were self-administered rather than interviewer-administered precisely

to minimize underreporting of drug use (Turner, Lessler, and Devore, 1992). Bray et al. (1995)

discuss specifically the validity of the self-reported DOD survey.

        Two indexes of respondents’ illicit drug use are constructed from both of these surveys,

one reflecting any illicit drug use in the past 12 months and one reflecting any use in the past

month. These variables measure drug participation rather than the quantity of drugs consumed.

These two analysis variables were selected in part based on the availability of questions that were

asked in both the NHSDA and DODWWS surveys and that were structured the same in both

surveys. The indexes are based on the prevalence of the nonmedical use of one or more of 11

categories of illegal substances.

        Standard demographic characteristics that are available in both surveys and measured the

same in both include gender, marital status, any children, education, age, and race and ethnicity.

Although there are other characteristics that have been shown to be significant correlates with

illicit drug use, such as religious participation, urbanity, and current living arrangements, these

measures are either unavailable in both surveys or not collected in a consistent fashion.

        No geographic identifiers were available for respondents in the DODWWS, therefore it is

not possible to include geographic-specific drug price information in the models. Although

omission of price variables in demand equations represents a specification error, the omission is

unlikely to bias the coefficient of the focus variable, military status, unless military installations are

consistently placed in areas where drug prices are systematically different. Even if geographic

location information were available, however, constructing a geographic-specific price measure

for military personnel would be problematic due to the high geographic mobility of military

personnel, who often deploy to areas (states or countries) far from their “home” unit.

Furthermore, because our dependent variable is non-drug specific, it is likely that any measure of


                                                    9
an illicit drug price used would only introduce more measurement error since prices exist only for

particular substances. No composite price for illicit drugs currently exists.6

        Table 1 provides definitions of the analysis variables and the weighted means. The civilian

data from the NHSDA is restricted to 17- to 49-year olds to align civilians with the age groups

represented in the military population. The restricted civilian sample from the NHSDA, contains

12,012 individuals, and the military sample has 16,067 observations. Table 1 shows that both

current (previous 30 day) drug participation as well as past-year drug participation are

significantly lower among the military population than the civilian population. However, there are

also a number of demographic differences that may be driving these utilization differences, such as

differences in marital status, age, and level of education, suggesting that multivariate analysis is

needed. To investigate this further, we pool the two samples and estimate the prevalence of any

illicit drug use in the past month and the past year.

        Coefficient estimates from logistic specifications of the probability of using any illicit drug

in the past year and in the past month for the pooled sample of 17- to 49- year olds are recorded

in Table 2. These estimates show that even after other correlates of illicit drug use are accounted

for, the military sample is still significantly less likely to report using any illicit substance in the

past year or the past month. The number in brackets shows the marginal effect of being in the

military (evaluated as a change from 0=civilian to 1=military) on the prevalence of any illicit drug

use. Individuals in the military are approximately 20% less likely to report use in the past year

and 14% less likely to report use in the past 30 days than their civilian counterparts, holding other

factors constant at their mean values. Although some of this difference may represent the

deterrence effect of the military’s drug testing program, it is not clear that all of it can be

 In addition, personal income is not available in the DODWWS. Military pay grade is available, which could be
converted to annual income, but pay grade would reflect seniority in the organization more than a true income

attributable to the program. For example, it may be that the military population is less willing to

self-report illicit drug use than the civilian population because of the enormous penalty imposed.

Alternatively, it may be the case that military participation is correlated with unobservable factors

that also influence an individual’s willingness to use illicit drugs.

          To determine the sensitivity of the estimated program effect to an individual’s willingness

to report drug use, we modify the sample in several ways. First, we omit all officers and college

graduates from the military sample. The reason for this restriction is the very low self-reported

drug prevalence rates among officers compared to regular enlistees (Bray et al., 1995). Military

officers are more indoctrinated into the military culture and have more to lose if they are caught

using illicit substances. The lower reported use rates among officers, therefore, may in fact

represent true differences in illicit drug use or they may simply reflect an increased unwillingness

to report illicit drug use. If it is the latter, then restricting the sample to just enlistees should

shrink the difference in reported drug use found between the civilian and military population. To

align the civilian comparison group more closely with military enlistees, the civilian sample is

restricted to non-college graduate workers in blue-collar occupations (civilians in professional,

technical, and administrative occupations are deleted).       The restricted pooled sample consists of

22,374 observations.

          Table 3 presents results from logistic specifications of the same model as in Table 2 for the

restricted sample. To conserve space only the coefficients of the military dummy variables are

presented. The results are similar to those obtained for the unrestricted sample in Table 3 that

includes officers and white-collar civilian workers. Column 1 estimates the drug use models for

the 17 to 49 age group to see the effect of the sample restrictions. A comparison of the

coefficients of the military dummies in column 1 to the coefficients in Table 2 reveals very little


effect.

change in their size or significance in either of the drug participation models. Columns 2 and 3 of

Table 3 provide estimates of drug use for samples further restricted to 17-34 year olds and 17-25

year olds, respectively. Even though the restriction to ages 17 to 34 eliminates about 6,000

observations, there is very little difference in the coefficient of the military dummy in column 2.

The sample falls by another 7,000 in column 3 for the youngest sample but, once again, the

program effect remains robust. That the various age restrictions do not alter the estimated

program effect appears to be due to a fixed relationship between drug participation in the two

sectors over various sub-groups. We interpret these findings as evidence that the willingness to

underreport is not a major component of the observed differences in illicit drug use between the

civilian and military populations.

        The question remains, however, as to whether the large deterrence effect estimated in

Table 2 is biased upward due to selection bias. Drug use among military personnel may be lower

even in the absence of the drug prevention program due to application of the military's entrance

standards and to self selection among applicants. One way of examining whether this is indeed

the case is to assess the difference in military and civilian drug participation in a period before the

military's drug program took effect. If adjusted prevalence rates for military personnel are also

lower when no punitive programs were in place (pre-1981), one may infer that the estimated

differences in drug use in 1995 are explained by unobserved differences between the two

populations rather than by a true program effect. If, on the other hand, military personnel use

drugs at similar, or higher, rates than civilians in the pre-program (pre-1981) year, one may infer

that the prevention program (in 1995) is causally linked to the lower drug use behavior among

military personnel.

        To conduct this difference-in-differences analysis we merge data from the 1980

DODWWS and 1979 NHSDA surveys. We were forced to use different survey years for each
                                                  12
survey because prior to 1981 there was no single year when both surveys were fielded. We

choose these two survey years because they immediately preceded the implementation of the

military’s program and they were two survey years in which the national trend in drug use

remained unchanged (we were at a peak in illicit drug use that started to decline after 1981). The

specification of the drug use models for the pre-drug program period is similar to those for the

post-drug prevention program period. However, due to differences in questions asked in the

older DoD surveys (see Burt, et al., 1980), the continuous age variable was replaced by dummies

for age categories, and the presence of children living in the household had to be omitted from the

analysis. Otherwise, model specification is the same as in the 1995 file.

        Table 4 provides weighted means for the 1979 NHSDA and 1980 DODWWS data sets.

The data from the 1979 NHSDA are restricted to individuals between the ages of 17 to 49 so as

to align civilians with the age groups of military members. It appears that current drug

participation still is significantly lower in the military population than in the civilian population,

but the magnitude of the difference is only 1.7 points, substantially smaller than in 1995.

Furthermore, past year participation is significantly higher for military personnel, by 8 points,

suggesting that some of the differences that were observed in 1995 may indeed reflect a program

effect. However, there are again significant differences in other population characteristics that

may be correlated with these observed differences in utilization rates, so multivariate analysis is

necessary if we want to make any definitive statements. We, therefore, use the same approach as

before and pool the sample so that we can estimate prevalence rates controlling for other

determinants of demand.

        Table 5 presents coefficient estimates from logistic specifications of the prevalence of past

year and past month use for the pooled 1979/1980 NHSDA/DODWWS data file. To conserve

space we again report only the coefficients of the military dummies, and only for the restricted
                                                   13
samples. Thus, these results can be compared to those in Table 3. Here we find that the

coefficient estimate on the military dummy variable in the past year model is positive but

statistically insignificant. Further, although the coefficient estimate in the past month model is

negative and statistically significant, it indicates a much smaller difference in magnitude than that

observed in the 1995 sample. Holding other variables in the model constant at their means, we

find that military personnel are only 3% less likely to report using illicit drugs in the previous

thirty days than the civilian population. This suggests that the military’s drug testing program has

been extremely successful at deterring drug participation, explaining as much as 80% of the

difference we see in 1995.

        These findings are not stable across younger cohorts, however. Columns 2 and 3 show

what happens to the estimated coefficients when we restrict the sample to ages 17-34 and 17-25,

respectively. As in column 1, column 2 reveals no significant difference in past-year drug use

between the two populations and that past month use is lower in the armed forces. However, the

partial effect of the military coefficient in the past month model has risen to 8.3 percentage points

for 17- to 34-year olds. The most notable difference arises in column 3 for the youngest age

group, 17-25 -- past year drug use is 4.3 points higher for those in the military in 1979/1980 and

the difference is statistically significant. Current use continues to be lower for enlistees among

17- to 25-year olds and the partial effect of military status is now similar to what it is in the 1995

data.

        Overall, the patterns are inconclusive regarding underlying differences in the two

populations. At least in the full sample, it appears that the differences in past year and past month

participation are significantly smaller in the pre-program sample than they are in the post-program

samples. However, as we restrict the sample to the younger cohorts and compare civilian blue-

collar workers with military enlistees we find conflicting results based on the dependent variable
                                                  14
being measured. Although past year use in the pre-program period is higher among enlistees,

supporting a strong program effect, current (30-day) drug participation is significantly lower

among enlistees. The difference in differences estimate based on the 30-day prevalence measures

falls to about 4 percentage points (10.12 – 14.97 = - 4.85), suggesting that only about one-third

of the difference in prevalence can be attributed to the military’s stringent drug testing program.

One interpretation of the shrinking difference-in-differences estimates is that self selection is

greater among the youngest age groups.

IV.    DETERRENCE EFFECTS IN THE NLSY

       Part of the inconsistency in findings reported in the previous analysis may have to do with

inherent limitations of cross-sectional data. When considering the impact of a policy change on

the behavior of those in the military, cross-sectional data cannot account for entry and exit from

the sample of interest over time. Further, given the long time lag between periods being

evaluated, there may have been changes in the recruiting strategy employed by the military that

would make the military population more or less like the civilian population over time in ways we

have not measured. We therefore thought it would be useful to see if we could replicate our

findings of a deterrence effect using longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth (NLSY).

       There are several advantages of using the NLSY for evaluating the deterrence effect of the

military’s drug testing program. First, because the NLSY tracks the same individuals over time, it

is possible to separate people who choose to leave the military after the military’s drug testing

program went into place with those people who choose to stay. We can therefore evaluate how

drug use patterns change for those entering and exiting the military, thus making it possible to

isolate the deterrence effect to some extent from the selection effect. Second, we can track how

individuals who choose to stay in the military change their drug use over time given the
                                                  15
implementation of the military’s drug testing program and compare this with changes in the

civilian population during the same time period. Finally, the NLSY contains a richer set of

demographic and background characteristics that enable us to obtain a better specification of the

individual’s demand function. Variables omitted from the earlier analysis that can now be

accounted for include parental education, a measure of cognitive ability (AFQT scores), and

mother’s work status while the respondent was growing up.

        The NLSY’s advantages are countered by a major disadvantage -- drug use is not

collected in every survey year. Although an extensive array of drug use questions were asked in

1984, 1988, and 1992, only the 1980 survey contains information on illicit drug use prior to

implementation of the military’s program. Further, the 1980 survey only asked use of marijuana

in the previous year. It contains no information on the use of other illicit substances. Since we

cannot construct a measure of any illicit drug participation for both a pre-program and post-

program year, annual marijuana use is analyzed instead. Given that marijuana is by far the most

widely used illicit drug, this change in the dependent variable should not have a dramatic effect on

our ability to identify a deterrence effect.

        The two years chosen for analysis, 1980 and 1984, straddle the change in the military's

drug policy, which occurred in 1981. Descriptive statistics for the civilian and military samples in

the 1984 NLSY are presented in the Appendix. In both populations, the vast majority of people

who report using any illicit drug in the previous year also report using marijuana in the previous

year, suggesting that limiting our analysis to past-year marijuana use should not jeopardize our

ability to find a deterrence effect. The appendix also shows that in 1984 statistically significant

differences exist between the military and civilian populations in all of our measures of illicit drug

use. For example, military personnel are only half as likely to report using marijuana in the


                                                  16
previous year as the civilian population. The question is whether this difference in utilization rates

existed before the military’s strict drug testing program.

       An important first step in answering this question is determining whether the sample

changed before and after the program was introduced and whether those changes are correlated

with marijuana use. Approximately 54.3% of those who were in the military in 1980 were still

serving in the military in 1984, so approximately 46% of 1980 military personnel separated from

the military during the four years. Among the 1980 civilian sample, 93.7% remained civilians

during this four year period, while the remaining 6.3% decided to join the military during the

intervening period.

       Table 6 provides a break down of marijuana prevalence rates by transition status. The

overall use rate for military members in 1984 was 17.9 percent. This compared to a prevalence

rate of 32.5 percent for civilians, a difference of 14.6 points. However, the military group

included individuals who entered the military between 1980 and 1984 and the civilian group

included veterans who left the military during this period. If we compare prevalence rates in 1984

between those who were continuously in the military during the period versus those who were

continuously civilians the difference becomes somewhat larger, 18.7 points (32 percent versus

13.3 percent). Marjuana use in 1980 had a different pattern, with the military sample reporting

higher annual prevalence of marijuana use than those in the civilian sector (56.5% and 45.8%,

respectively). However, if we limit the samples to those who remained in the military to those

who remained civilian, this difference in prevalence rates drops substantially, with the military

population reporting use rates of 48.5% and the civilian population reporting use rates of 45.9%.

The group that left the military after 1980 had the highest annual prevalence, as one might expect.

       There are other suggestive differences for the various transition groups. Use rates

dropped between 1980 and 1984 for all groups. However, the drop was the greatest for
                                                 17
continuous military personnel, from 48.5 percent to only 13.3 percent (a drop of 35.2 points),

followed by those who entered the military during the period (a drop of 27.1 points). By

comparison, continuous civilians reduced marijuana use by only 7.1 percentage points. As was

already mentioned, those who initially were on active duty in 1980 but who later separated had

the highest use rates of any group (61.9%). Their usage dropped in 1984 but not by as much as

those who remained on active duty. This suggests that some drug users in the military may have

been induced to leave by the new drug policies. Similarly, civilians who enlisted during the period

had a much larger drop in marijuana use, as compared to continuous civilians.

        Logistic specifications of annual prevalence of marijuana use for 1980 (column1) and 1984

(column 2) are presented in Table 7. In 1980, the year before the military’s drug policy was

introduced, there is no significant difference in self-reported annual marijuana prevalence between

the civilian and military sectors. However, by 1984 it appears clear that the military's drug

prevention program had reduced drug participation; marijuana use among military personnel in

1984 was 20% below that of civilians. This is consistent with the program effect estimated above

using the 1995 NHSDA-DODWWS data [see Table 2]. These results suggest that the adjusted

military-civilian marijuana participation differential has remained relatively steady over the decade

since the inception of the military’s strict anti-drug policies.

        As previously discussed, the composition of the military sample changes between 1980

and 1984. Estimates of the program effect calculated from the regressions presented in Table 7

may be biased by individual decisions to enter or leave the military over time. One way to

overcome this limitation is to remove from the sample those who transition between the military

and civilian sectors. We therefore re-ran our analysis on a restricted sample of individuals who

remained in either the military or the civilian population between 1980 and 1984. We find that the

coefficient estimate on the military dummy variable in 1980 remains fairly stable and insignificant.
                                                   18
The estimated coefficient on the military dummy variable in 1984 becomes –1.085 and remains

significant at the 0.01 level. The marginal effect of –23.7% is slightly larger than the estimate of

20.2% presented in Table 7, suggesting that the programmatic effect of the military’s drug testing

program is even larger than previously estimated. It should be stressed, however, that marijuana

use is measured for the past year. These basic results were also observed in the NHSDA/DoD

data for past year illicit drug use, but not for current drug use.

V.      THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCES IN DETECTION AND PUNISHMENT

        PROBABILITIES

        As note above in Section II, by 1995 all of the military branches had adopted similar drug

prevention policies that incorporated both random drug testing and dismissal of all members

testing positive for illicit drugs. This policy is much more stringent than programs found in most

private firms and government agencies. However, in 1984 the military’s policies were still

evolving and somewhat less stringent than they are today (see Leib, 1996; Martinez, 1999). In

addition, the policies created differences in the probabilities of detection and punishment across

service branches within the military.

        In this section we rely on natural differences that arose in the implementation of anti-drug

policies in the military. Although all branches implemented some form of drug testing after 1981,

not all immediately adopted zero tolerance. In particular, all branches allowed junior enlisted

personnel (in pay grades 1 through 3) who tested positive to continue their careers (a “two-

strikes” policy) under certain conditions. Considerable discretion was given to local commanders,

and only senior enlisted and officers were subject to automatic termination. Another difference

was that testing rates in the Army were lower than in the other branches. Due to the widespread

“two-strikes” policy for junior personnel, which reduced the probability of punishment for this

group, we would expect any deterrence effect of overall military policies to be smaller in 1984
                                                  19
than in 1995. Also, we would expect deterrence effects to be the lowest in the Army, which had a

lower probability of detection owing to a lower testing rate. Since the military sample in the

NLSY consists of junior enlisted, we use the NLSY to test for these hypothesized differences. We

estimate three drug participation models, one for current illicit drug participation, one for any past

year participation, and one for past year marijuana participation. The model contains dummies for

each military branch rather than a single military dummy. The results are displayed in Table 8.7

        The results in Table 8 reveal striking differences in the estimated overall deterrent effect

attributed to military polices in 1984 and 1995, and deterrence among the four service branches.

The size of the overall military coefficient in 1984 is -.886 for past year drug use, which is 20-40

percent lower than the range reported for 1995 past year participation in Tables 2 and 3.

Similarly, 1984 past month drug participation is considerably lower than the estimates in Tables 2

and 3. Furthermore, the magnitude of the negative coefficient for the Army in 1984 is between

one-third and one-half the size of the coefficients of the other branches in 1984.

        The military drug prevention program in effect in 1984 was closer qualitatively to those

currently being used by civilian employers.8 Thus, these results suggest the potential size of the

deterrence effect for policies that are closer to those currently in use by civilian employers. If we

assume that the results for the Army provide a lower bound estimate of this effect, due to the

lower detection risk and lighter punishment, then a deterrence effect of about 10 percent could be

expected from the programs in civilian firms.

VI.     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.



7
  We are not able to use the 1995 NHDA/DODWWS data file for this test because by 1995 service policy
differences had blurred.
8
 For example, local government transportation workers can be subject to pre-employmnent, random, and post-
accident alcohol and drug testing. Those who test positive may be referred to treatment and rehabilitation.
Although termination of employment is one outcome, it is used rarely. The most severe penalty appears to be
transfer of an employee to jobs that are not ‘safety-sensitive.’
                                                           20
       Using the U.S. military’s policy of random drug testing and zero tolerance, we find that a

strict employer anti-drug program is a highly effective means of deterring illicit drug use both

among current users as well as potential users. However, the size of the deterrence effect varies

considerably depending on which age group, which drug use measure, and which data set is used.

In the NHSDA/DoD surveys past year drug participation in the military is as much as 16% lower

than in the civilian sector for the program year (1995); furthermore, it appears that selection bias

does not account for much of this effect. Analysis of NLSY data on past year marijuana use

reinforce these results. However, civilian-military differences in past month use among younger

age groups appear to be more heavily affected by selection bias, which may account for as much

as 70 percent of the estimated deterrence effect. Based on these considerations, the deterrence

effect for the military program would range between 4% and 16%.

       It is interesting to note that even the strictest workplace anti-drug program cannot

eliminate illicit drug use among employees. Although drug participation rates in the military are

low, they are not zero. This raises the question as to whether or not such strict anti-drug

programs are worth their cost. The primary cost of zero tolerance is the cost of replacing

terminated workers. The program the military used in 1984 involved a two-strikes policy, and in

the case of the Army, lower random testing rates, yet still produced a sizeable deterrence effect.

These results suggest that policies that would be feasible today in the private sector can be

expected to reduce drug use in a cost-effective manner.
