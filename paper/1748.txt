            The Effect of the Union Wage Differential on Management
                    Opposition and Union Organizing Success




                                   ABSTRACT




     This paper argues that under current U.S. institutional arrangements, in
which managements opposition to unions is as important as workers and unions,
the magnitude of the union wage premium actually reduces organization rather
than increasing it. It reduces organizing success by lowering profits, thus
giving management a greater incentive to oppose unions. It shows that in the
traditional monopoly model, any given premium can cause management to donate
more resources to opposing a union than workers will donate to organizing.
Empirical evidence from NLRB elections supports the model in which larger pre-
miums induce greater opposition and thus reduce union organizing success.

         What is the effect of the union wage differental on union organiza-

tional success?

         It is common in economic models of unionization to assume that greater

differentials enhance the probability that unions will organize a group of

workers. After all, won't workers want to join a union the greater are the

potential economic benefits from joining? Following this line of argument some

studies of union wage differentials make unionization an endogenous. presumably

positive function of the potential differential.

         In this paper I argue that the conventional view that large union wage

differentials increase organization is incorrect for the U.S. today. It is

incorrect because organization is the joint decision of workers and management,

not a workers decision. While potential wage increases are a plus to workers,

they reduce profits and thus are a minus to management. In an institutional

setting in which management allocates significant resources to convince workers

to vote against unions, it is erroneous to analyze the effect of the union wage

differential on organizing solely from the workers side, just as it is erroneous

to analyze any economic outcome solely in terms of one blade of the market

scissors. My claim is threefold.

         (1) Current institutional facts indicate that, despite the secret

ballot election procedure in which only workers vote on whether to organize, the

decision to unionize in the U.S. is dependent on management as well as workers.

         (2) While in the most general model of organization, the dependence of

organizing success on management as well as labor makes the impact of potential
                                            2




wage differentials indeterminate, more structured models suggest that the magni-

tude of the potential differential will increase management opposition more than

It will increase worker desires for organization, causing an inverse relation

between the differential and union success.

            (3) Extant empirical evidence for the recent decline in union organi-

zation suggests that as much as one-quarter of the decline in the proportion

organized through NLRB elections may be attributed to the increased union wage

premium of the 1970s and its adverse effects on firm profitability, which raised

management opposition.

            If the argument in   the paper is correct, reduction in the union wage
impact in the 1980's and the observed willingness of unions to give concessions

to companies facing different economic circumstances, ought to reduce opposition

and improve organizational success, at least up to some point.

1. Institutional Facts

            Organization of workers through the NLRB procedure currently involves a

lengthy confrontation between two organized parties, the workers and their pro-

posed union representative, and managment, often abetted by outside union-

management consultants. The process is typically long (2 months between the

filing of a petition and an election),l with numerous possibility for delays and

pitfalls.

            In most cases management takes an active role opposing organizing,

hiring consultants in upwards of 70% of campaigns and often breaking the law by

firing union activists.2 (There are 13 illegal firings per NLRB election,
                                        3




according to NLRB data).3 Management campaign tactics range from personal

letters, in-plant meetings, supervisor's discussions, and a wide variety of

propaganda in the form of leaflets, posters, and so on. As a crude indication

of the potential effectiveness of such tactics caused the following evidence

from the AFL-CIO 1983 survey or organizers:4

                extreme (51*)                       33%

         While there are no good figures on the magnitude of the total resources

devoted by management to deter unionization a reasonable estimate might be on

the order of 100 million dollars annually..5

2. The Wage Differential, Labor and Management Organizing Effort, and

Organizing Success

         Consider first the most broad (and least informative) model of union

organization in which both managment and labor affect the outcome. The vote for

unionization (V) is taken to be a function of "objective" circumstances (x) and

of the resources spent by labor (RL) and managment (RM) on the organizing cam-

paign:

          (1)    V =
                       V(R1, RM. X)

         The resources allocated to the organization drive will depend on exoge-

nous factors specific to management X.,, and to labor X Land the logarithm (or


percentage) wage differential (W11).
                                          4




         (2)       =   g(W,   XM

                RL =   h(W,   XL

         From (1) and (2) the effect of the wage differential (here taken as

exogenous, though in a more complete model it will depend on elasticities of

labor demand and other factors) on organization is ambiguous. It depends on the

amount of resources it induces both parties to invest in the campaign and the

effectiveness of those resources.

         (3)    (dV/dW = V1     dR/dW +   V2   dR/dW]
where V1 < 0 and V2 > 0

         At this level of generality all that one can say is that to make

unionization a positive function of potential wage gains is erroneous because it

ignores the effect of those gains on profitability and thus on management

resources devoted to defeating unions in an organizing campaign.

         Under seemingly plausible assumptions one can go further and show that

the wage differential is more likely to deter than to increase organization.

Assume that management and labor resources have the same effect on outcomes

(when RM = RL, V1 =    V2.)   Then the standard monopoly analysis of union wage gains

suggests that management will increase its organizing resources more than will a

union as the wage differential rises. Figure 1 depicts the essential argument

in terms of a standard labor demand analysis of the welfare effects of union

monopoly wage gains. Here W,L are wages and employment in the absence of

unionism; W' and L', wage and employment due to the union wage premium         The

wage differential Wt-W transfers (W'-W)L' dollars to labor but costs management
                                         5

 (w'—w)12 +     (W'-W) (L'-L), where the latter term         is the welfare triangle

 loss. With a given union wage premium       W       (W'—W)/W end an elasticity of demand

 for labor of r, the welfare loss is                WI.

          Labor will be willing to spend the rectangle to organize. Management

will be willing to spend the rectangle plus the triangle. Assume           that   management

and labor do, indeed, spend the maximum amounts possible. Then:

          (4)     R -   RL               (WL)


Differentiating we see that      d(RM - R1)
                                                          W (WI) > 0
                                  dWIA

Management will devote greater resources than labor         in   an organizing campaign

and will increase those resources more as the wage differential increases.

          The model given in the (1) -       (3)   and the figure is simplistic. It can

be developed in various ways (more complex reaction functions; consideration of

unions and workers as separate groups; different expectations of W; and so

 forth). The point is simply that unless one believes that unions fficient1y
extract "rent" from firms along the lines of efficient contract models, it

is theoretically reasonable to expect the union wage differential to generate more

management Opposition than worker and union support in organizing drives.

3. Empirical Evidence

         I present two types of evidence on the actual impact of the union wage

differential on unionization: a time series analysis of 1950-1980 changes in

the union wage premium, management unfair labor practices and the number of

workers organized through NLRB elections; and a 1965-1980 pooled cross-industry

time series analysis of the effect of unfair labor practices on workers

organized across industries.

           Table 1 records the results of the time series analysis. Equation (1)

gives the regression coefficients for the determination of my indication of

management opposition --   unfair   labor practices (8A3 violations) per worker.

Equation (2) gives the regression results of the effect of those practices on

numbers of workers won in elections per employee while equation (3) shows the

"reduced form" effect of the wage differential on workers won per election. The

control variables include time and three indicators of the general state of the

economy.

           There are three findings. First, consistent with our argument that the

union wage differential increases managerial opposition the coefficient on log

   in the unfair labor practice equation is positive and significant. Second,

the unfair labor practices variable has a marked negative effect on workers won

in equation (2) while the wage premium has a negative effect in equation (3),

supporting our argument that the union wage advantage adversely affected

organization. Third, however, as the significant coefficients on the time trend

variable indicate, our analysis falls short of a complete explanation of the

pattern of organization in the period. To see how much of a change the key

variables explain I have multiplied the regression coefficients by the change in

the relevant explanatory factor and divided this by the observed change in the

explanatory variable. For 1970—1980, 47% of the increase in unfair management

practices are attributed to the rising wage premium; one-half of the decline in

workers won per employee is attributed to the rise in unfair practices; and

two-thirds to the rise in the wage premium, taken by itself. Over the longer

haul, however, the significance of the wage differential is, it should be noted,

smaller. All    told,   while the story is far from complete, the data suggest that 1

the 1970s the sizeable increase in the union wage differential augmented

management opposition and contributed to the decline in union organizational

success.

           Economists are, rightly, suspicious of the results of time series ana-

lysis, which often vary depending on model specification and years covered.

Accordingly, I have also estimated the effect of unfair labor practices on

members won by unions using a pooled cross—section industry file for the period

1965-1980 over which industry data was available. The advantage of this data

file is that it permits two     separate   types of analyses: first, a comparison of

patterns of -unfair practices and members won across industries; second, an

extremely strong test of the effect of the factors within industry—year cells.

The disadvantage is that we lack information on union wage differentials by

industry and thus can only examine effect of management opposition on union

success or failure in elections, and cannot estimate the effect of wage

differentials on managemenr unfair labor practices.

           1able 2 shows the results of least squares estimates of the effect of

unfair labor practice on number of workers won by unions. Consistent with the

results in table 1, these figures show a sizeable and significant impact of

management opposition ——     a measured by unfair practices —— on organizing
success. The greater the number of illegal acts by management the less likely

are unions to win members in one industry compared to another (column 1) or to

an industry compared to itself over time (column 2).

Conclusion

         While theory does not tell us whether union wage premiums raise or lower

organizing success, it does tell us that with current U.S. institutions the

effect of the premium depends on what it does to both labor and management

behavior and gives some reason for thinking that the higher premium may raise

managerial opposition more than it raises worker desires for unionization.

The empirical analysis attributes part of the union problem in organizing in

the 1970s to managerial opposition resulting from high union wage premium.

Hopefully, the analysis and finding will stimulate further work on organization

as the result of the behavior of both management and labor, in contrast to

existing focus on workers alone.
