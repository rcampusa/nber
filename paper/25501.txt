                                         ABSTRACT

We study the causes and consequences of patronage in Brazilian cities since the country’s re-
democratization. We test key mechanisms – fiscal rules, accountability, political ideology, and
rent-seeking – and estimate the consequences of patronage for public finances. Our data consist
of the universe of public sector employees merged with their party affiliations, and a dynamic
regression discontinuity design is applied to disentangle patronage from the growing political
participation. The short-term patronage effect is large, with winning political coalitions
increasing their shares of public sector workers and wages by 4 and 6 percentage points,
respectively, during a mayoral term. Part of this effect lasts longer than a decade, with winning
coalitions also occupying civil servant jobs that perform service-oriented tasks. This political
occupation of government jobs is not associated with ideology, though. Instead, lack of
accountability and rent-seeking are the primary driving forces, while reliance on
intergovernmental transfers only increases patronage for smaller cities. Higher patronage does
not affect the size of local governments, but it changes the composition of expenditures: hiring
politically connected workers crowds out, almost one-to-one, non-affiliated employees. Overall,
patronage accounted for more than half of the dramatic increase in public sector political
employment since the Brazilian re-democratization.

         1.       Introduction
         Do elections influence city finances? The size and type of public expenditures in the United
States are not significantly impacted by electing a democrat or republican to the mayoral office
(Ferreira and Gyourko, 2009), in part because of Tiebout (1956) sorting of voters. 1 But in places
with poor accountability and low quality of governance, for example, parties may use the
government for their own benefit. This can take different forms, ranging from general corruption
related to fraud in public procurements and diversion of funds (Ferraz and Finan, 2011) to the
occupation of the governmental sector via a higher degree of patronage (Folke, Hirano, and Snyder,
2011; Xu, 2018) and public workers who receive a large wage premium relative to the private sector
(Finan, Olken, and Pande, 2015). These practices can significantly affect public finances since
local governments generally spend a high share of resources with public sector personnel. 2
         In this paper, we study how democratic elections affect city-government personnel
decisions, the mechanisms behind those decisions, and their ultimate consequences for public
finances. We proceed in three steps: First, we estimate the extent of patronage practices, i.e., the
hiring of public employees politically connected with a mayor, and how patronage can have a
lasting impact on the public sector personnel; Second, we investigate key mechanisms that may
explain different levels of patronage observed in local governments – federal transfers, lack of
accountability, party ideology, and rent seeking; Lastly, we show how different levels of patronage
estimated across Brazilian cities can impact the size and composition of city expenditures.
         Brazilian municipalities are the focus of our empirical work, where both personnel decisions
and public expenditures have had striking patterns since the first presidential election with popular
vote in 1990, after a 26-year military dictatorship. The government share of GDP in Brazil grew
from 29% in the early 1990s to more than 40% in the late 2000s, with cities accounting for
approximately half of the public sector. City expenditures on personnel almost doubled over the
last two decades, increasing from 35% of local budgets in 1995 to almost 50% in the last year of
our sample. The share of local labor force employed by city governments reached almost 10% in

  Hoteling (1929) and Downs (1957) argue that elections should not matter as long as politicians and their parties follow
the wishes of the voters. However, political parties may matter at other levels of government (Besley and Case, 2003;
Lee, Moretti, and Butler, 2004), and their influence could be the result of strategic extremism (Glaeser, Ponzetto, and
Shapiro, 2005) or due to candidates that cannot credibly commit to moderation (Alesina, 1988; Besley and Coate,
1997).
2
  In general, governments responsible for labor-intensive services, such as education, health, safety, and city
maintenance, will have the largest fraction of expenditures assigned to personnel. U.S. school districts, for example,
spend more than 80% of current expenditures on wages and benefits.

2010, representing about 40% of all legally registered employees in the average Brazilian city (a
large fraction of private sector employment are still conducted under informal labor agreements). 3
         In order to identify the political connections of each public worker with the party coalition
in power, we access an annual individual-level dataset with the universe of public employees,
including their names, wages, labor contract, and occupation, for almost all Brazilian municipalities
from 1995 to 2013. 4 We then merge these microdata with the universe of individuals affiliated with
political parties in Brazil, with party histories dating back to 1980. Approximately 10% of the adult
population in Brazil was associated with a political party in 2013, a share that has grown steadily
since re-democratization. With the merged data in hand, we show in Figure 1 that the share of
public employees affiliated with a political party increased from 17% in 1995 to more than 30%
since 2000s. Moreover, Figure 2 presents a map with the distribution of those shares in 1995 and
2013 by city, holding constant the 1995 quintile thresholds. The increase in share of affiliated
workers was widespread across the country, and not just concentrated in a few cities or regions.
         While shocking, this large increase in share of public workers with political affiliation may
not necessarily correspond to an increase in patronage. Political parties in power are generally
stronger electorally, and likely to have more sympathizers and affiliates, including public
employees. In order to deal with this endogeneity, we compare the public employment of political
coalitions that barely won an election with the same outcome of coalitions that barely lost. Using
five four-year municipal electoral cycles, from 1996 to 2012, including data from all party
coalitions formed in each election, we show that this regression discontinuity design (Lee, 2008)
produces levels and pre-trends of political public employment that are similar for winning and
losing coalitions in the years prior to an election.
         Another challenge to identification is the dynamics of several election cycles that may
confound short and long-term outcomes of winning a particular election. For example, winning
(losing) by a narrow margin of victory may also increase (decrease) the probability of re-election,
and therefore affect the probability of “treatment” in the next election. Moreover, coalitions may
change during this period in which we observe five election cycles. We deal with these potential
changes in treatment status by implementing a dynamic regression discontinuity design developed
by Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein (2010). We adapt this approach to our setting in order to estimate
the short and long-term impact of electing a mayor from a given coalition under dynamic treatment

  These data are from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and from the Brazilian National
Treasury Secretariat (STN).
4
  Our data set is based on RAIS (Relação Annual de Informações Sociais), a mandatory database assembled and
managed by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor, and contains information for more than 95% of all cities in Brazil. Details
of the microdata are presented in Section 3.
                                                          3
assignments. These are “treatment-on-the-treated” effects that, in practice, hold constant all past
election-coalition outcomes in a city. We also estimate separate effects for leading and supporting
parties, a critical step given that political coalitions in Brazil have more than three supporting
parties, on average.
        We apply our dynamic estimator using the most comprehensive dataset of local elections,
public employees, party affiliations, and public finances assembled to date. We find that the share
of city wages allocated to a winning political coalition increases by 4.5 percentage points in the first
year of a mayoral term, and then reaches almost 6 percentage points prior to the next election cycle.
Estimates for share of city employees of the winning coalition are usually smaller, by approximately
2 percentage points, indicating that the positions filled by party loyalists offer higher compensation.
Of these total patronage effects, two-thirds of the gains in employment and wages are concentrated
in the party that leads a coalition, while one-third goes to supporting parties.
        The dynamic of public sector occupation varies over the course of a mayoral term. Hiring
party members (already affiliated before the election) and firing opposing parties employees
account for 50 and 30 percent of the first year “winning” effect, respectively. Losing coalitions see
declines in both employment and wage shares, but those effects are concentrated in the first year,
and do not offset the disproportional hiring of the winning parties, especially later in a term. In
fact, by the third year of a mayoral term, two other categories gain relevance in the occupation of
public sector jobs: newly affiliated party members (affiliated after the election) and old public
employees who decide to join the winning parties. These new and old employees affiliated after
elections accounted for 35 percent of the total patronage effect in the third year after of a mayoral
term.
        Winning coalitions occupy both political appointee bureaucratic positions as well as civil
servant jobs in service-oriented occupations. As civil servants are tenured positions, they are more
likely to stay in government for longer than one mayoral term. These dynamics explain why we
find that patronage effects can last longer than a decade, thereby having long-lasting effects on local
public personnel.
        What are the mechanisms behind the increasing capture of the public sector employment by
political parties? We investigate potential channels related to i) Fiscal rules (intergovernmental
transfers), ii) Lack of accountability (audits, media presence, and city size), and iii) Political
economy (ideology and rent-seeking).
        Federal and state transfers are the main source of funding for Brazilian municipalities (85
percent) and local taxes (property and service taxes, building permits fees) only represent 6 percent

                                                   4
of the budget. These soft budget constraints created by excessive transfers may potentially lead to
corruption and misuse of funds (Fisman and Gatti, 2002). We use a research design based on
discontinuous changes in federal transfers (FPM) to municipalities at given population thresholds
to causally estimate how patronage varies with intergovernmental transfers. Municipalities that
belong to a particular population bracket receive the same amount of federal and state transfers in
a given year, whereas municipalities slightly above (below) the upper (lower) bound of each bracket
receive, on average, 20 percent more (less) revenue. We find that FPM transfers do increase the
share of total wages assigned to employees affiliated to elected parties. The patronage effect is
particularly large for small cities (with population around 10,000), for which FPM transfers
correspond to a large fraction of municipal revenues.
       Next, we examine whether accountability and the quality of governance can limit the
occupation of the public sector by winning parties. We find that the capture of the public sector by
political parties is larger in smaller (and less developed) cities that lack accountability. These
results match heterogeneity in low quality of governance and poor personnel practices across
countries (Finan, Olken, and Pande, 2015). In addition, the presence of local media (radio,
newspapers, magazines, TV and internet) limits patronage practices in public sector personnel
decisions. We also find that government audits of public resources in Brazil (in Ferraz and Finan,
2008, 2011; in Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti and Tabellini, 2013; and in Avis, Ferraz and Finan, 2018)
reduce future patronage practices. All these proxies for accountability point in the same direction
and may explain why municipal voters have little hope to punish politicians that adopt such hiring
practices.
       We then analyze the political economy channels by testing if party ideology is responsible
for the expansion of public sector’s political employment. For instance, one might expect left
leaning governments to allocate a larger share of expenditures on personnel given that leftist parties
are known for defending a larger size of government –the most notable example being the
Communist Party of China. There is a fair amount of heterogeneity in the dynamic treatment effect
of winning an election, with some parties gaining almost 6 percent in wage shares during a mayoral
term, while others barely gaining 1 percent. But such variation does not seem correlated with the
ideology index developed by Power and Zucco (2009, 2012, 2018), which classifies Brazilian
parties according to a left-centrist-right leaning scale. Instead, the top three parties in terms of
political patronage are PMDB (center), PP (right), and PT (left), which also happen to be the parties
implicated in the recent corruption scandal involving the largest Brazilian company, Petrobras,
ultimately leading to the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff in 2015. We do,

                                                  5
however, find another important source of heterogeneity: the patronage effect is larger for bigger
parties, i.e., with a larger share of local party members. This indicates that the country’s low quality
governance system is exploited by all parties, in a rent-seeking competition where bigger parties
have more people demanding and being rewarded with jobs in the public sector.
       What are the consequences of these large patronage effects on local public finances? First,
predictions from our model show that patronage explains more than half of the total increase in the
share of affiliated public personnel since the re-democratization of the country, shown in Figure 1.
Second, there is no change in the size of local governments given that local governments have little
control over their revenues – due to the large share of intergovernmental transfers. However, we
do test for changes in the composition of expenditures by first estimating a long-term patronage
effect for each city in the country within our dynamic RD model. With those city specific patronage
indices in hand, we model local shares of total expenditures with affiliated and non-affiliated
personnel as a function of the city specific patronage. We find that patronage not only increases
expenditures with affiliated employees, but also decreases the expenditures with non-affiliated
employees, in practically a one-to-one crowd out. Finally, other local expenditures, such as the
share of local investments, do not vary by the level of patronage in Brazilian cities.


       Related Literature. In addition to the public economics and political science literatures
that study whether political parties matter, our work is also related to the literature on how
democratic institutions shape governments and policy. Aidt and Jensen (2013) show that franchise
extension can increase the size of government, while Fujiwara (2015) shows that improving the
political participation of less educated voters can advance policies that benefit them. Acemoglu,
Naidu, Restrepo, and Robinson (2015) found a dynamic impact of democracy on tax revenues as a
fraction of GDP, potentially leading to fiscal redistribution as well. Our results empirically
corroborate these views, although our mechanisms are related to rent-seeking and lack of
accountability.
       Our paper also relates to the literature on personal benefits of political connections. While
we show that individuals affiliated with a party benefit from winning an election, recent papers
have examined the wealth accumulation of politicians.            Using an RD design, Eggers and
Hainmueller (2009) find that British Conservative Party members of Parliament (MPs) benefit
financially from public office while Labour MPs do not. Querubin and Snyder (2009) examine the
wealth accumulation of US politicians during 1850-80 using a RD design and find that election



                                                   6
winners outearn losers only from 1870 to 1880. Fisman, Schulz and Vig (2014) show a much
higher rate of wealth accumulation of state politicians in India.
       A recent set of papers study the personnel economics of the state. These papers look, among
other things, at how public servants' behavior maps into the performance of public services and how
internal policies may be framed to make the best of the conflicting interests faced by officials
(Finan, Olken and Pande, 2015; Cameron, de Figueiredo and Lewis, 2016). For instance, Akhtari,
Moreira and Trucco (2016) explore how political turnover in Brazil impacts the replacement rate
of headmasters and teachers in schools controlled by the municipality, thereby negatively impacting
the public education provision. Other recent papers study the selection of public servants and how
political connections shape public personnel decisions (Dal Bó et al., 2017; Dal Bó, Finan, and
Rossi, 2013; Deserran, 2018; Weaver, 2018; Fang et al., 2018).
       Two recent papers about patronage in Brazil are closely related to our independently
developed research.      First, Colonnelli, Prem and Teso (2018) conduct a groundbreaking
investigation of the causal effect of becoming a campaign donor and/or running as a candidate for
city councilor, on the probability of obtaining a public-sector job. They find significant political
favoritism in the allocation of public jobs, and show that such patronage practices have a negative
effect on the quality of the public workforce. Second, Brollo, Forquesato and Gozzi (2017)
estimate, as we do in the first part of our paper, the causal effect of being the party in power on the
employment of all party members in the public sector. Different from Brollo, Forquesato and
Gozzi (2017) though, we use longitudinal data on the universe of Brazilian public sector employees
and party affiliates over the 1995-2013 period, and employ a dynamic treatment effects model that
accounts for multiple waves of mayoral elections and party coalitions. More importantly, the
second and third parts of our paper focus on the causes and consequences of patronage in Brazilian
cities, and especially on how patronage dynamically affects personnel decisions and local public
finances.
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: Section 2 describes the Brazilian institutions,
Section 3 discusses our empirical methods, and Section 4 describes our database. In Section 5 we
present our results, in Section 6 the potential mechanisms, and in Section 7 the consequences for
public expenditures. Section 8 concludes.


       2.      Brazilian Institutions
       Brazil is a federal republic with a presidential system organized in three levels: federal, state
and municipal. There are more than 5,500 municipalities as of 2015, and each has an executive and

                                                  7
legislative branch. The mayor is the head of the executive branch of the municipality, and each city
also has a city council. 5 Municipalities are generally responsible for managing and delivering a
large range of public goods and services to their citizens, such as child care, early childhood and
primary education, basic health services, local public transportation, local traffic safety, recreational
facilities, water supply and sanitation. 6
        Each city has its own budget and the freedom to implement its own public policies and to
make spending choices. Funding for the services and goods provided by municipalities comes from
local taxes (e.g., property and service taxes, building permits fees), and from state and federal
transfers (whose main source of revenues are sales taxes and income taxes, respectively). Transfers
are the main source of funding for municipalities, accounting for 85 percent of the municipality
revenue on average. A major role is played by the federal fiscal transfer scheme called Fundo de
Participação dos Municípios (FPM). FPM is the largest program of transfers to municipalities,
accounting for almost 80 percent of all types of federal transfers and for 31 percent of municipal
revenues. 7


        2.1 Public Sector Careers
        Municipalities in Brazil independently create, manage and modify public sector careers.
Each municipality has its own plan for positions, careers and wages, which establishes tasks,
functions and required qualifications for every position in the municipal bureaucracy.
Municipalities are also responsible for the selection and hiring of municipal workers. Those
workers mainly fall into three categories: civil servants, political appointees, and temporary
workers.
        The largest category of public sector jobs is civil service. The Brazilian constitution
establishes that municipalities have to rely on transparent rules and requirements for the selection
of civil servant public works, and that each city is responsible for the details of the implementation
of those rules. In theory, each job applicant is to present academic and professional credentials and
undertake a formal civil service examination, which is job-specific and consists of a combination


5
  The number of seats in each city council depends on the municipality population size. Council members are
responsible for making local laws, overseeing the corresponding executive branch, and proposing and approving the
annual budget.
6
  States, on the other hand, are mainly responsible for secondary education, general safety (police and firefighters),
non-basic health services, and any infrastructure project that involves multiple municipalities.
7
  The ICMS-Parcel, is another important transfer that corresponds to 15 percent of the municipal budget, and is based
on a fraction of the state sponsored value-added tax raised within the municipality. Lastly, the FUNDEF/FUNDEB is
special federal fund for expenditures in education and accounts for 10 percent of municipal revenues. It is a non-
discretionary fund for daily operations of municipal public schools.
                                                          8
of written and oral tests. Civil servants acquire tenure after three years of service, following which
they can be fired only for reasons of misconduct after a judicial decision. Although legislation has
determined that the recruitment and selection process for civil service positions should be based on
candidates’ merits and professional capabilities, the effective criteria for hiring civil servants are
established according to local needs. This affords city mayors a margin of discretion that can
potentially allow them to favor members of their parties when selecting new hires. In fact,
newspaper articles often report scandals of manipulation and fraud in civil service examinations in
Brazilian municipalities that aimed to favor the hiring of a certain group of candidates. 8
         The hiring of political appointees is limited to positions of high-level public officials
(including directors, managers, supervisors, and advisors). Federal legislation gives discretion to
politicians to select people for these leadership roles. 9 Finally, temporary public servants are hired
to meet temporary and exceptional needs of public administrations, defined by politicians or high-
level public officials. In such cases, no civil service exam is required and the selection process can
be based on the analysis of applicants' curriculum, without other formal objective criteria. 10
         There are many advantages of holding a public sector job in Brazil, such as the fact that
government positions are formal and guarantee many benefits such as (at least) 13 monthly wages,
one-month of paid vacation, a special retirement plan, and lower work load among others.


         2.2 Political Parties and Party Affiliation
         Brazil has a multiparty political system, composed of 35 officially registered national parties
as of 2015. According to TSE, 12 million Brazilians were affiliated with political parties in 2015,
which corresponds to 6 percent of the Brazilian population. 11 Parties need affiliates to be legally
recognized and to provide support to their candidates in the elections. For instance, the Brazilian
electoral legislation establishes that a party must have a minimum number of members, which
corresponds to 0.5% of the votes casts in the previous National Election, homogenously distributed
across the 26 Brazilian states.
         Based on shares of total affiliates, the most important parties are the Workers' Party (PT),
the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), the Brazilian Social Democratic Party


8
  For instance, in 2012 UOL, the largest Brazilian news portal, reported a series of frauds involving civil service exam
leaks to individuals politically aligned to the city mayors, and that were under investigation by the Brazilian Public
Prosecution Offices (Ministério Público).
9
  Regular civil servants can be promoted to positions of trust which are high-level public posts with similar status,
earning and power of appointee positions.
10
   The legislation describes the instances that fall under temporary jobs, and the responsible hirers can be prosecuted in
case that they contract temporary workers without accurate justification.

                                                            9
(PSDB), and Democrat Party (DEM). 12 Other medium sized parties, like the Republican Party (PR)
and the Progressive Party (PP), play significant roles in the National Congress; and others, like the
Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and the Democratic Labor Party (PDT), have political power in
strategic states.
         In terms of ideology, political scientists categorize parties in Brazil in a wide range.
Coppedge (1997), based on the perception of experts, classifies PT and PSB as left-wing, the PSBD
and PDT as center-left, PMDB as center, PP as center-right, and PR and DEM as right-wing. Power
and Zucco (2009, 2012, 2018) develop an alternative measure of party ideological position based
on survey responses of federal legislators from 1990 to 2017. By this measure, there is a great
dispersion across Brazilian party ideology.
         All eligible voters can affiliate with a political party at any point in time. 13 As opposed to
the United States, affiliation is not determined during voting registration. Every political party has
its own membership rules. Some impose registration fees and a selection process that may involve
interviews and formal examinations, while others parties, especially more recently, just require an
online registration. The rights and duties of affiliates are described in the statute of the party.
Parties may request financial contribution from their members for internal party maintenance,
provide support to party candidates in electoral campaigns, and physical presence in certain party
activities. Affiliates can also vote to choose the official candidate in the upcoming elections.
However, internal decisions tend to be centralized in the directories, since voting power, in general,
is not the same for all members.


         2.3 Municipal Elections, Candidates, and Coalitions
         Municipal elections for mayors and municipal councilors happens every four years midway
between the national and state level elections. Those elections take place in October, and the winner
candidates takes office in January of the following year to serve a four-year term. In municipalities
with less than 200,000 registered voters, mayors are elected by a simple majority rule in a single-
round election. In the other municipalities, mayors are elected by a simple and popular majority



12
   They are also the parties with the longest tradition in the country, having elected numerous and important legislators,
senators and governors since the Brazilian re-democratization. PSDB won the presidency in 1994 and 1998, in a
coalition in which DEM assigned the vice-president. PT was the leading party of a coalition that governed the country
from 2002 until the recent impeachment of President Rousseff in 2016. PMDB occupied the vice-presidency from
2006 to 2016, and then occupied the presidency after the impeachment.

   The electoral legislation requires all parties to submit twice a year (April and October) an up to date list all of their
members to the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Superior Electoral Court (TSE) actively tracks party affiliation of all
voters, cancelling the oldest membership if a voter is affiliated with more than one party.

vote in a two-round system. Since 1998 mayors can be elected for no more than two consecutive
terms; before that reelection was not allowed.
         Every political candidate must be a member of a legal party in order to run for public office.
The electoral rules establish that a candidate must be affiliated with a political party at least six
months before the election. As municipal elections are the first electoral races for the vast majority
of individuals running for a public office, a new wave of affiliates happens in the municipal
elections years.
         But given that all political parties are relatively small, candidates heavily rely on political
alliances in order to increase their electoral chances.                     Political coalitions are legally and
independently formed a few months before each election in each city. These political coalitions
provide many benefits to a candidate during the electoral campaign, such as the backing of a larger
number of sympathizers and donors, and more public resources for the electoral campaign in the
form of free radio and TV air time. 14 They also may help the elected candidates during the mayoral
term, although at that point political parties are free to change their alliances.


         3.       Empirical Strategy
         Suppose that a political party 𝑝𝑝 runs for the mayoral office in city 𝑐𝑐 and receives vote share
𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 . Let 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 1(𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 > 𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝′𝑐𝑐 ) be an indicator for the party receiving more votes than any of the
other parties running for office, and therefore winning the election. Initially ignoring the dynamics
of multiple election cycles and the possibility of forming coalitions, we can write an outcome 𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
(total wages received by local public employees that belong to a party, for example) as:


                                            𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝜃𝜃 + 𝑢𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ,                                             (1)


         where 𝜃𝜃 is the causal effect of winning an election and 𝑢𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 represents all other determinants
of 𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 . However, winning an election may be correlated with other characteristics that influence
outcomes, so 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ] ≠ 0. The standard regression discontinuity strategy to deal with this issue,
as pointed out by Lee (2008), is that as long as there is some unpredictable random component of

14
   Brazilian electoral legislation establishes that during the 45 days prior of the municipal elections, parties are
authorized to broadcast political agenda of their mayor and municipal councilor candidates on the radio and on the
television. All parties together are entitled to 70 minutes a day in insertions. 90 percent of that time is distributed in
proportion to the number of representatives that the parties have in the Federal Congress. The remaining 10 percent is
distributed equally. In case there is an alliance between parties in the majority elections, it will be considered the sum
of the federal deputies affiliated to the six largest parties of the coalition. In the case of coalitions for proportional
(council) elections, the radio and TV time will be the result of the sum of the number of representatives of all parties.
                                                              11
the vote, a narrowly-decided election approximates a randomized experiment. The causal effect of
winning an election can be identified by comparing personnel outcomes for parties that barely won
an election (the ''treatment group'') with other parties that barely lost (the ''control group''). 15
Assuming that 𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 �, the conditional expectation of the unobserved determinants of 𝑦𝑦 given
the realized vote share, is continuous, we can approximate it by a polynomial function of order 𝑔𝑔
with coefficients 𝛾𝛾𝑢𝑢 , 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , 𝛾𝛾𝑢𝑢 �. Under this assumption we can rewrite (1) as:


                                   𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 𝜃𝜃 + 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 , 𝛾𝛾𝑢𝑢 � + 𝑢𝑢′𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ,                             (2)


         where 𝑢𝑢′𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is asymptotically uncorrelated with 𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 (and therefore with 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ), and a
regression of realized outcomes on the winning indicator, controlling for a flexible polynomial in
the vote share, thus consistently estimates 𝜃𝜃.
         We now extend the setup to allow for multiple elections in the same city, closely following
the dynamic regression discontinuity framework developed in Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein
(2010). Redefine 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 to equal one if party 𝑝𝑝 in city 𝑐𝑐 wins the election and holds the mayoral
office during the calendar years 𝑡𝑡 associated with a mayoral term, and zero otherwise (i.e., if the
party did not run for mayor in that electoral cycle or if the party ran and lost the election). We can
then write outcomes in any year 𝑡𝑡 as a function of the full history of mayoral elections in a city:


                                                   𝜏𝜏=𝜏𝜏�
                                       𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = ∑𝜏𝜏=1   𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 + 𝑢𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 ,                              (3)


         which estimates the causal effect of winning an election in 𝑡𝑡 − 𝜏𝜏 on outcomes in year 𝑡𝑡, with
𝜏𝜏̅ as the maximum number of relative years since an election allowed by the data. The causal
parameter 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 is commonly known as the effect of the ''treatment on the treated'', or TOT, since
equation (3) explicitly controls for all other election outcomes. An OLS estimate of (3) would yield
biased estimates of the TOT effects, so we again appeal to the assumption that winning an election
is as good as randomly assigned conditional on a smooth function of the measured vote share. To
bring the RD methodology to the ''structural'' equation (3), we augment each of the lagged election
outcome indicators 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and a polynomial in the vote share, 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝛾𝛾𝜏𝜏 �.     Both the 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏
coefficient and the polynomial coefficients are allowed to vary freely with 𝜏𝜏, where 𝜏𝜏 is number of

15
  We include all parties in our estimates, as there is a large number of third and fourth place candidates with meaningful
vote shares. See Anagol and Fujiwara (2016) for the importance of the runner-up effect. Our online appendix shows
the histogram for each vote share for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place candidates.
                                                                 12
years after and election (for 𝜏𝜏 > 0). 16 We also add fixed effects for each party, city, and calendar
year, such that we can write (3) as follows:


                                       𝜏𝜏=𝜏𝜏�
                           𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = ∑𝜏𝜏=1   �𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 + 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝛾𝛾𝜏𝜏 �� + 𝜋𝜋𝑝𝑝 + 𝜅𝜅𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 .                      (4)


           With the inclusion of controls for the election and vote share history in (3), the 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏
coefficients are identified from the contrast between parties in cities where an election in 𝑡𝑡 − 𝜏𝜏 was
narrowly won and those where the election was narrowly lost but the sequence of prior and
subsequent elections and votes is similar. This has the advantage, for example, of not confounding
the effects of winning an election with winning or losing other election cycles, which is key to
understanding the long-term impact of party control on city personnel decisions.
           So far, we have ignored the possibility of forming coalitions across parties in order to run
for the mayoral office, which is a common feature of the Brazilian political system. In order to
capture the impact coalitions we first assign vote shares to all parties in a coalition. Precisely, we
                                                             𝑙𝑙               𝑠𝑠
replace 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 in equation (4) for two other dummies 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , which are, respectively,
indicators for whether the party is a leading or supporting party of a winning candidate. Second, we
add two other terms to equation (4), 𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and 𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , which are dummies that represent,
respectively, the parties are leading or supporting parties of mayoral candidate. Our final estimating
equation becomes:


                                𝜏𝜏=𝜏𝜏� 𝑙𝑙                    𝑠𝑠
                    𝑦𝑦𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 = ∑𝜏𝜏=1  [𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 + 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝜑𝜑𝜏𝜏 + 𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝛼𝛼𝜏𝜏 + 𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝛽𝛽𝜏𝜏 + 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝛾𝛾𝜏𝜏 � +

                                                        +𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 𝐹𝐹𝑔𝑔 �𝑣𝑣𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝛿𝛿𝜏𝜏 �] + 𝜋𝜋𝑝𝑝 + 𝜅𝜅𝑐𝑐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 .                   (5)


           We estimate this equation using a conventional panel of outcomes by party and city over
calendar years. Standard errors are clustered by city. We label 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 and 𝜑𝜑𝜏𝜏 the patronage effects
from leading and supporting parties of the winning coalitions.
           A caveat with the model above is that 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 and 𝜑𝜑𝜏𝜏 could be overestimated because of a
mechanical effect in which the losing party leaves office (giving up the leadership of the main
departments, for example) and the new party in power just replaces the main leadership positions.
We first deal with this issue by exploiting our microdata: we know wheter an employee is a political
appointee in a leadership position or if the employee is a civil servant providing a direct service to


16
     We also run some specifications that allow for 𝜏𝜏           ≤ 0 in order to test for pre-trends.
                                                                          13
the population. By estimating outcomes that vary by type of labor contract and occupation we can
focus on positions that suffer less from the mechanical effect. Second, we decompose the total
effect into employees that were employed (or not) by the city in the year prior to the election, as
that allows us to compare how much of the total effect is due to replacement of old positions vs
new hires. Additionally, we interact those dummies with a dummy for belonging to a party in the
year prior to the election. This interaction aims to decompose the effects and to capture other
potential mechanisms, such as employees switching parties or becoming affiliated for the first time
because of an election outcome.
         Equation 5 assumes that all winning parties behave similarly once in power. If there is
heterogeneity in 𝜃𝜃 across parties, our estimator identifies the average of 𝜃𝜃𝑝𝑝 among parties with
                                                                                              𝑙𝑙             𝑠𝑠
close elections (Imbens and Angrist, 1994).                     But we can further interact 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 ,

𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and 𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 with dummies for each of the Brazilian parties, in order to test if parties adopt
                                                                                𝑙𝑙             𝑠𝑠
different personnel decisions while in office. We also interact the variables 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 , 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 ,

𝑙𝑙𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and 𝑠𝑠𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 with measures of federal transfer, city size, accountability, party size, and party
ideology in order to understand some of the mechanisms driving the patronage effects.
         Finally, we also estimate a specific 𝜃𝜃3 for each city in the country, by interacting a complete
                                        𝑙𝑙              𝑠𝑠
set of city indicators with the terms 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−3 and 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−3 . 17 Subsequently we estimate how the
composition of public expenditures is a function of these city-specific patronage effects.


         4.       Data
         4.1 Public Employees
         We use a comprehensive longitudinal matched employer-employee administrative data set
which takes the form of an annual census of all formal workers in Brazil (Menezes-Filho et al.,
2008). RAIS (Relação Annual de Informações Sociais) is a mandatory database assembled and
managed by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor every year since 1976.                             It includes individual
information on earnings, occupations and other aspects of the job (tenure, weekly working hours,
features of the employment contract), current and past employers, along with their identification
numbers, locations and industries. It is widely recognized as a high-quality Census of the Brazilian
formal labor market (Dix-Carneiro, 2014; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak, 2017). 18 Apart from the

17
   The parameter 𝜃𝜃3 refers to the effect of the leading party election on political public employment in the third year
after the election. It accounts for the leading party’s patronage effect in one of the last years of the term and also the
peak effect (as we show in Section 5).
18
   RAIS is the main tool used by the government to enable the payment of the ''abono salarial'' to eligible workers.
''Abono salarial'' is a government program that pays one additional minimum wage at the end of the year to workers
                                                           14
informal sector workers, RAIS covers almost all public and private sector jobs, except for very few
categories of workers (a subset of self-employed individuals and elected politicians) which are not
required to report information to the Ministry of Labor. 19
         The data consist of job entries identified by worker identification number (PIS), worker full
name, and firm-plant taxpayer identification number (CNPJ). These identifiers are unique and do
not change over time. This allows us to track individual over time and across formal employers.
Additionally, RAIS comprises a set of variables which are particularly important for our
investigation: individual specific data on occupation and employment contract details. In RAIS,
every worker is assigned an occupation specific to his/her current performing job, which is
categorized according to the CBO (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações).                               Based on the
performing job of each public employee, we can establish if he/she is working in administrative
tasks, or in the final delivery of public goods/services. Additionally, we can identify which sector
of public administration a public employee was assigned to work for: education, health, public
works, sanitation, security, transportation and others. These occupational categories also allow us
to classify workers according to the hierarchy level of their occupations in public administrations
and firms (for instance, directors/managers vs. other employees). RAIS employment contract detail
data contain for every worker information on reasons for hiring/firing, dates of employment, type
of work contract (regular, temporary, short-term, apprenticeship), and, most importantly,
information on how a worker was hired by the public sector—as a permanent civil servant, an
appointee or a temporary worker. Based on the RAIS employer-employee data, Panel A in Table 1
presents descriptive statistics by city-year from 1995 to 2013 for the 5,412 municipalities used in
our final sample.


         4.2 Party Affiliation
         The party affiliation data contain individual-level information on all party members in
Brazil. It was obtained from the Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE) which actively tracks party
affiliation of all registered voters in the country through an electronic platform named FiliaWeb. 20


whose average monthly wage was below two times the minimum wage, and whose job information was correctly
declared in RAIS - among other minor requirements. For this reason, workers have an incentive to be counted in RAIS
since they want to be eligible to receive the government benefits they are entitled. Given that employers (private and
public organizations) are subject to severe fines if they do not regularly submit to the Ministry of Labor the information
about their workers, employers also have incentives to precisely provide workers information in RAIS.
19
   Because RAIS is a census of the Brazilian formal labor market only, we cannot follow individuals that always have
been working for the informal sector. We also lose track of workers who do not hold a job in the formal sector in a
given year, but we can keep tracking them once they return to a job in the formal sector.
20
   FiliaWeb was launched in 2009 and, in 2010, it became an official electronic platform through which parties submit
information about their members to the Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE). Before 2009, parties used to submit digital
                                                           15
TSE keeps records of all past and current members of every party, and updates FiliaWeb twice a
year (in April and October) based on the information about new and removed party members
provided by every party. For each party, the affiliation data contain the full name of all party
members, voter registration number, the municipality where each member registered, the date when
every member affiliated with a party, and the date when an individual voter cancels its party
affiliation (if applicable). Based on this information, we can identify every party member at any
point in time. Based on the party affiliation data, Panel B in Table 1 shows descriptive statistics by
city-year for the number of parties and party members in our final sample.
         We merged RAIS with the party affiliation data based on each person’s name, year of
employment and affiliation, and location (metropolitan area). The match quality highly benefits
from the fact that Brazilians usually have several surnames, since a common family tradition is for
children to keep all surnames of both father and mother. The matching procedure allowed us to
identify the party affiliation (if any) of every public employee from all Brazilian municipalities.21
The largest share of matches, 80%, are 1 to 1 matches. 22


         4.3 Public Finances
         The ''Finanças do Brasil - Dados Contábeis dos Municípios'' (FINBRA) dataset is our
primary source of information on Brazilian municipal finances. It is organized by the Brazilian
National Treasury Secretariat (STN) and it is produced by each municipal government annually.
FINBRA includes information such as revenues from municipal taxes (property and services taxes),
transfers revenue from state (ICMS) and central (FPM, PAB, FUNDEF/FUNDEB) governments,
and expenditures to personnel or investment. It also presents expenditures disaggregated by
functions like administration, janitorial services, public education and public health. Panel C in
Table 1 presents basic descriptives by city-year for government expenditure, share of government
expenditure devoted to personnel, and population size of the cities in our final sample.




files to TSE containing information about their affiliates. In 2010, TSE integrated the previous party digital files to the
information about affiliates submitted by parties through FiliaWeb to construct a unified dataset containing historical
data of all party members in the country. This is the dataset used in this paper.
21
   We conduct the match in five steps. In Step 1 observations are matched by exact full name. Step 2 matches use a
''soundex'' code of the surnames. Step 3 converts all middle names (not first and not last names) to middle initials. Step
4 all prepositions are eliminated (e.g. Da, De, Dos), and finally in Step 5 all prepositions are eliminated and middle
names are converted to initials.
22
   The rest are split into 1:m, m:1, and m:m matches – see online appendix for details. Robustness tests show that our
main estimates are unaffected by using a subsample that only includes 1:1 matches. Those results are available upon
request.
                                                            16
       4.4 Elections
       Electoral data were obtained from the Superior Electoral Tribunal (TSE), which oversees
national and local elections in Brazil. TSE records information on characteristics of candidates,
political affiliation, and electoral results for all political offices in Brazil. Our dataset contain
information on all municipality elections for mayors in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and 2012,
comprising data on pre-election characteristics of all candidates (gender, education background,
marital status, wealth, and occupation), their respective parties and electoral coalitions, and the
number of votes that each candidate received. We dropped from our data politicians that had their
candidacy withdrawn or canceled. Table 2 presents basic descriptives by city-year for electoral
years used in our final sample.


       4.5 Final Data
       Our final data combine information from all the four separate aforementioned sources:
RAIS employer-employee, party affiliation, public finance and election data.              Because our
estimated model, described in equation (5), specifies the outcome variables by party, city and
calendar-year, we structured our data set at party-city-year to estimate the parameters of interest
(i.e., 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 and 𝜑𝜑𝜏𝜏 ). Table 3 presents summary statistics of the final sample that we use to implement
our empirical strategy.


       5.      Results
       5.1 Validity of the RD design
       Two conceptual concerns may invalidate our RD application. The first is the possibility
that coalition characteristics change at the threshold, including pre-treatment outcome variables.
Figure 3 tests for discontinuous changes around the margin of victory threshold, by plotting
averages for the following variables in the year of the election: number of parties in the coalition,
number of public employees affiliated with the leading parties, and the share of public employees
affiliated with leading and supporting parties. Even though coalitions that win (lose) with large
margins are indeed politically more (less) powerful, coalitions that win or lose by small margins
are very similar to each other, on average.
       The second concern is related to political coalitions having different pre-trends. Figure 4
presents estimates for a version of equation 5 that includes a number of relative years prior to the
election. The year of the election is omitted. These pre-trend estimates show no differences in
outcomes for winners and losers in the years leading up to an election.

                                                  17
        5.2      Winning coalition dynamic treatment effects
        Figure 5 plots the estimated dynamic patronage effects on the total number of employees
affiliated with a party, along with 95% confidence intervals. 23 The effects are split into 𝜃𝜃𝜏𝜏 for the
party leading the winning coalition, and 𝜑𝜑𝜏𝜏 for the other parties supporting it, as defined in equation
(5). In the first year of the term, the winning party adds 17 additional affiliated public employees
relative to the losing coalition. That estimate reaches a peak of 24 by the end of the first term, drops
to 17 in relative year 5, and then stays relatively flat during the remaining years. Estimates for all
winning supporting parties peak at 15 extra affiliated employees in years three and four, and never
get below 8 even twelve years after an election.
        The next outcome we analyze is the share of affiliated public employees. This metric has
several advantages over the number of affiliated workers such as minimizing the importance of the
largest cities and adjusting the estimates for the changing number of total public workers (affiliated
or not) in the city over the years. Figure 6 shows that the leading party’s share of employees
increases almost 1.5 percentage points in the first year of the mayoral term—a very large
proportional increase given that both 1st and 2nd place candidates had a 5.2% share of public
workers in the year of the election (see Figure 3). The gain increases to about 3 percentage points
in relative years 3 and 4. At year 5, we observe the consequence of modelling the impact of other
election cycles, as the benefits of winning an election drop to 1.2 percentage points. Subsequent
magnitudes from the patronage effect wane after that, but never go to zero, with the winning party
still enjoying a 0.4 percentage point gain even twelve years after the election. In Figure 6 we also
show the shares of employees for the other parties in the leading coalition. The supporting parties
increase their shares in the public sector by a little bit more than 1.3 percentage points during the
first term and then drop to half-percent in the long term. 24
        Figure 7 shows that the importance of winning elections is even larger when considering
the share of total wages devoted to party affiliates; not just the share of employees. 25 While the
dynamic patterns are relatively similar, the magnitudes of the effects for wages are almost 80%
larger in the first year of a mayoral term, and 50% larger by relative year 4. After that period, both
effects—for share of wages and employees—become almost identical, indicating that the winning
party loses certain leadership positions that pay more but becomes entrenched in many other sectors

   These estimates are also reported in Columns (5) and (6) of Table 4. Columns (1) and (2) show an unconditional
model, while columns (3) and (4) control for third degree polynomial of vote shares and its interactions.

   The estimated coefficients plotted in Figure 6 are also reported in Columns (5) and (6) of Table 5.

and occupations of the public administration. Overall, about 2/3 of the patronage effect during the
first term is due to the leading party of the coalition, while 1/3 is due to the supporting parties. In
the long run the split becomes 60/40.
         The point estimates above hide some of the dynamics of occupation of the local public sector
in Brazil by the winning coalitions. To understand the process through which winning parties
occupy local governments, we decompose these dynamic effects in four dimensions: (i) new hires
without an affiliation prior to the election (new employees affiliated after elections), (ii) old hires
without an affiliation prior to the election (old employees affiliated after elections), (iii) new hires
affiliated prior to the election (hiring old party members), and (iv) old hires affiliated prior to the
election (firing opposing party employees). 26 Panels A and B in Table 7 present the decomposition
of the estimated effects in those four dimensions for the first four years after an election. The party
occupation process starts with hiring party members affiliated before elections and with firing
opposing party employees, accounting for 58 percent and 28 percent of the first year effect,
respectively.       Later on, party members affiliated after the election are recruited by local
governments, and old public employees join the parties of the wining coalition. These new and old
employees affiliated after elections account for only a small percentage of the first-year effect, while
in the third year they account for 40 percent of the patronage. Note that losing coalitions face a
reduction in the share of employment and wage, but those effects do not offset the disproportional
hiring of winning parties.


         5.3 Dynamics by type of labor contract and occupation
         Given Brazil’s legal context, it is no surprise that a small fraction of the total effect of
winning an election on the share of wages earned by affiliates of the party is due to differential
attrition. As explained above, public workers—especially civil servants—have a number of labor
law protections that prevent them from being fired. We further explore this issue by splitting the
wage share outcome into two components: wages assigned to civil servants and wages assigned to
political appointees. Figure 8 presents the estimated effects for leading parties, while Table 8 shows
all estimates. 27
         Even though political appointees are, on average, a small fraction of the public workforce,
they correspond to about 50% of the total treatment effect on wage shares in relative year 1. Over



26
   A tiny fraction of the total effect is due to affiliates switching parties after the election, so we do not consider them
here.
27
   Similar results were found for the employee share.
                                                             19
time though, the share of the total effect due to political appointees declines as the winning party
starts to fill up a disproportional number of civil servant positions. That trend becomes more
obvious in year 5, when the effect on the share of political appointees becomes quite small. The
remaining differential wage share enjoyed by the winning party becomes entirely attributable to
civil servants by the year 12.
         We also split the wage share point estimates into bureaucratic and service-oriented
occupations. Figure 9 shows that they follow a similar pattern observed in the political appointee
vs civil servant split partly because a large fraction of the bureaucratic jobs are performed by
appointees, while most of the service-oriented occupations, such as teachers and nurses, are
performed by civil servants. The disproportional hiring of party members to service-oriented
occupations is a practice that could lower the quality of services offered to the local population
(Akhtari, Moreira, and Trucco, 2016).


         6.       Mechanisms
         6.1. Intergovernmental Transfers
         A potential explanation for the high levels of patronage observed in Brazilian local
governments relates to the local tax system, which is largely based on federal and state transfers. 28
However, empirically evaluating the casual effect of transfers on municipal employment of party
members is not an easy task. An unbiased estimator of that effect would require a comparison of
the employment of party members in two sets of municipalities with similar characteristics, where
one set randomly receives more intergovernmental transfers than others. We use a research design
that mimics this ideal design by exploiting discontinuous changes in federal transfers (FPM) to
municipalities at given population thresholds. While municipalities belonging to a particular
population bracket receive the same amount of federal and state transfers in a given year,
municipalities slightly above (below) the upper (lower) bound of each bracket receive, on average,
20 percent more (less) revenues. Therefore, small variations in city population around pre-
determined thresholds provide exogenous variation in transfers received by municipalities which
allows us to identify casual effects of transfers on the amount of patronage. 29
         To that end, we augment the econometric model described in equation (5) to account for the
discontinuous changes in federal transfers (FPM) to municipalities at given population thresholds.

28
   Federal transfers are the main source of funding for municipalities (85 percent), while local taxes (property and
service taxes, building permits fees) represent only 6 percent of the budget, on average.
29
   Other examples of research using FPM transfers include Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti and Tabellini (2013), Litschig and
Morrison (2013), Gadenne (2017), and Corbi, Papaioannou and Surico (2018).
                                                          20
In practice we estimate interaction effects with the winning coalitions, comparing patronage effects
on both sides of a population threshold. 30 The results reported in Figure 10 reveal that more FPM
transfers (for cities on the right side of each population threshold) generally increase the share of
wages of winning coalition affiliates. Note the effect is only significant for the cities around the
first threshold with population close to 10,000, where the importance of transfers is much higher
on a per capita basis.
         Those findings are not only interesting per se, but also because they show how the design
of local public finance based on transfers can deliver negative consequences to public expenditures
related to personnel decisions. Local expenditures financed by local revenues may be a more
appropriate way to bind politician’s opportunistic behavior.


         6.2 Accountability Channels
         Many researchers report large discrepancies in the quality of governments across countries,
with corruption and rent-seeking type behavior being more prevalent in the public sectors of less
developed regions. In this sub-section, we test if similar patterns can be detected across cities in
Brazil, by directly estimating heterogeneity in the magnitude of the occupation of the public sector
by winning parties according to different measures of accountability and quality of governance.


         City Size. Our first test splits our final sample in four quartiles by city size, with city size
based on year 2000 population. Smaller towns in Brazil are generally poorer, have less private
sector options, and parties are close-knit clubs where party membership usually coincides with
family and friendship ties. Figure 11.A shows the dynamic treatment effect of winning an election
on party wage share varying by quartile of city size. Estimates for the 1st quartile are about 4 times
larger than the magnitude of estimates for the large cities in the 4th quartile, in the third year of a
mayoral term.


         Media Presence. Recent studies on media have shown that the presence of newspapers and
radio amplifies citizens’ knowledge of public policies and of politics, which affect voters’
perception of politicians and turnout. 31 In Brazil, Ferraz and Finan (2008) find that the release of


30
   A detailed description of the methodology used in those estimations are in the Online Appendix. It also presents tests
that guarantee the validity of regression discontinuity design.
31
   Besley and Burgess (2002), for instance, show that governments in India are more responsive in their relief of shocks
to places with higher newspaper circulation and where voters are more informed. Stromberg (2004) finds that U.S.
counties with more radio listeners received more relief funds from the New Deal program. Gentzkow (2006) discusses
how the introduction of television in the United States resulted in a sharp drop in newspaper and radio consumption,
                                                           21
the audit outcomes has a significant impact on incumbents’ electoral performance, and that these
effects are more pronounced in municipalities where local radio is present to divulge the
information. Thus, empirical evidence suggests presence of media in a municipality is good proxy
for accountability and quality of governance at the local level.
        To obtain information on the presence of media in a municipality, we rely on a survey from
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics IBGE), named as Perfil dos Municípios
Brasileiros, which contains information of key measures of the availability of media in every
Brazilian city.     This city-level survey provides information on the presence of local press
(newspapers, magazines), local radio, existence of TV coverage and availability of internet
connection in a municipality.
        We then estimate equation (5) with the interaction of winning coalitions with the presence
of local radio, local press, TV coverage, and availability of internet in a municipality. Results are
presented in Figure 11.B. The presence of local media significantly reduces the allocation of wages
to party members of the winning coalition. We find the wage share of individual affiliated to the
elected party (in the third year after an election) is about 1.3 percent points smaller in cities with
local press, 2 percent points smaller in cities with radio, 2.3 percent points smaller in cities with TV
coverage, and 1.4 percent points smaller in cities with availability of internet. These results suggest
that the presence of local media limits patronage practices in local Brazilian governments.


        Audits. Government audits of public resources in Brazil affect incumbents’ electoral
performance of corrupt politicians (Ferraz and Finan, 2008, 2011), and reduce corruption (Avis,
Ferraz and Finan, 2018). Following Avis, Ferraz and Finan (2018), we investigate whether
government audits of public resources can affect personnel hiring decisions in Brazilian local
governments, considering that audits increase the perceived non-electoral costs of engaging in
misuse of public funds.
        The anti-corruption program targeted at municipal governments was launched in 2003 by
CGU (Controladora Geral da União), Brazil’s controller’s office. The program, named Programa
de Fiscalização por Sorteios Públicos (Monitoring Program with Public Lotteries), randomly audits
municipalities’ use of federal funds. Its initial audits were performed on 26 randomly selected
municipalities across different states, and then the program grew towards auditing 60 municipalities
per lottery. The lotteries are held publicly in conjunction with the national lottery in Brasília, and

which reduced citizens’ knowledge of politics and consequently led to lower voter turnout. Gentzkow, Glaeser, and
Goldin (2006) demonstrate that changes between 1870 and 1920 in the U.S. newspaper industry are related to the
reduction of corruption in U.S. politics in the same period.
                                                       22
all municipalities with a population of up to 500,000 inhabitants are eligible for selection. As of
February 2015, there have been 2,241 audits across 40 lotteries in 1,949 municipalities. Once a
municipality is chosen, the CGU gathers information on all federal funds transferred to the
municipal government during the previous three to four years and issues a random selection of
inspection orders. Each one of these orders stipulates an audit task for a specific government project
(e.g. school construction, purchase of medicine, etc.) within a specific sector. Once these inspection
orders are determined, 10 to 15 auditors are sent to the municipality for one to two weeks to examine
accounts and documents, inspect for the existence and quality of public work construction, and
verify the delivery of public services. After the inspections are completed, a detailed report
describing all identified irregularities is submitted to the central CGU office in Brasília. The central
unit compiles all information and publishes a report on the internet. 32
         We create an indicator for whether a city had an audit in the previous mayoral term, and
also interact the indicator with the winning coalition terms. As a placebo test, we also estimate
similar models that specifies if a city had an audit in the current term, or if the audit will happen in
the next term. The results presented in Figure 11.C show that having a future audit does not change
the current behavior of all parties and of the winning coalitions. The same conclusion is reached
for audits in the current term, as presumably the winning coalition did not have enough time to
potentially react to the federal audits. However, the last set of estimates shows the existence of
audit in city in the term before an election significantly reduces allocation of public jobs to party
members of the elected coalition. The wage share of individuals affiliated with the elected party is
about 0.8 percent smaller in municipalities that had an audit.


         6.3 Political Economy Channels
         Party ideology. Another potential explanation for the disproportional occupation of the
public sector by winning coalitions is ideology. The political economy literature gives many
examples of left-leaning parties with strong preferences for bigger and more redistributive
governments. These parties may decide to even control lower levels of the bureaucracy with party
members, in order to allegedly better carry out their mission. We test this assumption by first
estimating a version of equation (5) that interacts the winning party terms with dummies for each
of the 33 parties in Brazil. This model produces party-specific estimates of the wage share, all of


32
  These reports are also sent to the Federal Courts of Accounts (TCU), the Federal Prosecutors’ Office (MPF), the local
judiciary, the Federal Police, and to the municipal legislative branch. For more details about the CGU’s government
audits, see Ferraz and Finan (2008, 2011), Brollo, Nannicini, Perotti and Tabellini (2013), and Avis, Ferraz and Finan
(2018).
                                                          23
them shown in Figure 12.A. It is noteworthy that the top 3 parties with respect to patronage of the
leading parties, PP (right leaning), PMDB (center leaning), and PT (left leaning) were also the
parties engulfed in the corruption scandal of Petrobras, that ultimately led to the impeachment of
former president Dilma Rousseff in 2015.
       Next, we assign the ideology index from Power and Zucco (2009, 2012, 2018) to fifteen of
those parties. This index varies from -2.5 to 2.5, with parties closer to -2.5 being more left leaning,
while a score close to 2.5 means right leaning. A score around 0 indicates a centrist party. We then
interact the treatment dummies in equation (5) with party ideology – left, center, and right,
following the 2017 ideology index constructed by Power and Zucco (2018). The results presented
in Figure 12.B reveal little difference on dynamic treatment effects of winning an election by party
ideology.


       Rent-seeking pressure. The allocation of public jobs to party members indicates a quid pro
quo relationship between the party in power and its political supporters, in which public jobs are
used as a reward to supporters for their votes and/or campaign efforts (Calvo and Murillo, 2004;
Stokes 2009, Folke, Hirano and Snyder, 2011). Accordingly, the higher the number of political
supporters of party, the higher should be the effect of a party election on the wage share of public
employees affiliated to the winning party.
       In order to more carefully investigate whether party size determines the dynamics of
government occupation, we further interact treatment dummies in equation (5) with a pre-election
measure of party size that varies by city (i.e., the share of party affiliates in each city in the year
before an election). Figure 12.C shows the interaction effect for quartiles of party size. Our results
reveal that the dynamic patronage effects do increase with the pre-election size of competing
parties, consistent with rent-seeking pressure exerted by political supporters.


       7.      Consequences for Public Expenditures
       Having measured the short and long run effects of government personnel decisions based
on the political affiliation of individuals, we can now estimate the impact of such patronage on the
public finances. As reported above, cities have little discretion with respect to total revenues, so
any potential consequence would be observed on the composition of public expenditures. We use
two methods to estimate the effect of patronage on expenditures with affiliated employees: i) model
predictions, and ii) heterogeneity in patronage by city.



                                                  24
        Model predictions. To estimate the distortion caused by patronage, we first estimate the
share of city employees with party affiliation in absence of patronage effects, and then we compare
that with the estimated share of city employees with party affiliation predicted by our complete
model, which contains political patronage (this prediction is very similar to the descriptives in
Figure 1). The difference between these figures will reveal the consequences of government
personnel decisions based on party affiliation.
        To obtain our estimate of the share of city employees with party affiliation in the presence
of patronage, we proceed as follows. First, we predict the estimated equation (5) for the share of
public employees associated to each party. This procedure generates the share of city employees
affiliated to every Brazilian in every city in all years of our sample. Next, we sum those shares
across all parties for every year from 1995 to 2013 to obtain the share of city employees affiliated
with a party for every city and year of our sample. To estimate the share of city employees with
party affiliation in absence of patronage effects, we repeat the same procedure described above, but
                                                         𝑙𝑙               𝑠𝑠
turn off the coefficients associated to the variables 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 and 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡−𝜏𝜏 (which indicate the leading
and supporting parties of a winning candidate, respectively). This generates the time evolution of
the predicted share of city employees in every city in our sample without a patronage effect.
        Figure 13 plots the predicted share of city employees with party affiliation with and without
patronage. The continuous line in Figure 13 reveals that the predicted share of city employees with
party affiliation in the presence of patronage spans from 20.73 percent in 1996, the year of first
election in our sample, to 30.8 percent in 2013, the last year in our sample. The dashed line in
Figure 13 shows the estimated share of city employees with party affiliation in the absence of
patronage effects. Note that our model predicts an increase of the share of city employees with
party affiliation during our period of analysis, disregarding any patronage effect. The share of city
employees with party affiliation without patronage range from 20.73 percent in 1996 to 24.9 percent
in 2013. Finally, the dashed-dotted line plots the difference between the share of city employees
with party affiliation (predicted in our complete model) and the estimated share of city employees
with party affiliation in the absence of patronage. This figure reveals that over the course of nearly
two decades, patronage is responsible for an increase of 5.85 percent of share of city employees
with party affiliation, corresponding to 56 percent of the increase of the share of city employees
with party affiliation since 1996.


        Patronage by city. We use our model from equation (5) to estimate a specific patronage
effect for each city in the country, by interacting a complete set of city indicators with the terms

                                                      25
  𝑙𝑙              𝑠𝑠
𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−3 and 𝑏𝑏𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝,𝑡𝑡−3 . The patronage effects by city represent the average patronage over the course
of all elections in our sample, accounting for all other factors in equation (5). Figure 14 shows a
map of each city in Brazil, color coded by quintiles of the distribution of this patronage index by
city. 33 From this image, it is clear that high levels of patronage by city are not solely concentrated
in select regions, but rather are dispersed across the country.
        Subsequently, we estimate the composition of public expenditures as a function of these
city-specific patronage indexes. The first variable we analyze is the share of expenditures devoted
to employees affiliated with winning coalitions. 34 Figure 15A plots the relationship between this
share of expenditures and the patronage index by year, using a kernel regression. The slope was
flat in the first year of our sample, and then becomes steeper over the years, especially for patronage
indexes between 0 and 25, which contains the majority of the cities in our sample. Interestingly,
the slope barely changes from 2007 to 2011, perhaps indicating that, on average, city budgets are
reaching a limit with respect to this practice.
        Next, Figure 15B plots a similar relationship for the share of expenditures with non-
affiliated employees. Again, the plot for year 1995 is reasonably flat. Over time though, cities with
less patronage increasingly spend a much larger share of the budget with non-affiliates. By 2011
the slope is clearly negative. Lastly, Figure 15C plots changes in expenditures with affiliates and
non-affiliates during our sample period.           Clearly, cities with increasing levels of patronage
substitute expenditures from non-affiliate workers to affiliated ones.
        Table 9 estimates how the city-specific patronage influenced changes in the composition of
local finances from 1995 to 2012. Columns (1) and (2) show estimates for the total share of
personnel expenses using two different data sources (FINBRA and RAIS, respectively). Both
estimates are small and not statistically different from zero. Column (3) reaffirms that increases in
patronage lead to increases in the share of affiliated employees. A 10-point increase in the
patronage index leads to a 1.5 percent increase in the share of affiliated employees. Column (4)
shows a symmetrically opposite estimate for the share of public employees that are not affiliated to
political parties, indicating a practically one-to-one crowed out effect. Column (5) shows that the
share of expenditures devoted to capital investments does not statistically vary with patronage
practices.



33
  Our final patronage index adds the effects for both leading and supporting parties.
34
  The denominator of this shares comes from the total expenditure data from FINBRA. The numerator is a proxy
based on RAIS. This proxy underestimates total expenditures with personnel because RAIS only reports expenditures
with direct wages, not with other benefits such as pension plans, health plans, bonuses, etc.
                                                       26
       8.      Conclusion
       Our analysis shows that public sector personnel decisions can be heavily influenced by
democratic election outcomes.       Using a comprehensive data set of local elections, public
employees, party affiliations, and public finances from almost all Brazilian cities, we find that
winning parties (leading and supporting) increase their shares of public employees by 4 percentage
points after an election. They seize an even larger share of wages, 6 additional percentage points
compared to pre-election means. These patronage effects can last longer than a decade, with
winning coalitions occupying not only political appointee bureaucratic positions but also civil
servant jobs in service-oriented occupations. The increase in political occupation of governmental
jobs is not correlated with political ideology though. Instead, it is correlated with the level of city
development and party size. Moreover, lack of accountability is a key factor in the process of
governmental occupation.       Finally, the impact of patronage in the composition of public
expenditures is quite large, explaining more than half of the increase in the share of affiliated public
workers since the re-democratization.

Notes: The figure plots the share of city employees with party affiliation for every year between 1995 and 2013. The share is created by combining
public employment records from RAIS with party affiliation data using a matching on person’s name. See Section 4.2 for a detailed description of
the matching procedure.

Notes: Figure plots the estimated coefficients for leading parties of the winning coalitions in cities with or without an audit in the next, current or
last election cycle. Each election cycle begins with the year after an election and ends with the year of another election. If an audit happens in any
year in an election cycle for a given city, then the currently (previously/next) elected party experiences an audit in current (last/next) cycle.

Notes: This table presents descriptive statistics by city-year for all electoral years, with the exception of the variable Average Number of Parties in
Each Coalition, shown at city-year-coalition level. Coalition information is not available in 1996. All parties that participated in the 1996 election
were classified as a coalition with only one party. ''Vote Share'' is defined as (Each candidate's 1st round vote count / Sum of any available 1st round
vote count)*100. Candidates are defined to be a ''mayor-elected'' if their final election status is elected. The 1996 data is not used in calculating re-
elections variables because we don’t have 1992 election data.

Notes: Columns 1 and 2 show estimates for a version of Equation 5 that only includes indicators for leading and supporting parties (of the winning coalitions) by years relative to the election. The model in columns
3 and 4 additionally includes a third degree polynomial of vote shares, leading and supporting party indicators, and the leading indicator interacted with the polynomial. Columns 5 and 6 refer to the complete model
described by Equation 5 which also includes fixed effects for party, city, and calendar year. The coefficients for supporting parties are multiplied by 3.301, which is the average number of supporting parties with
marginal victory/loss < 5%. Standard errors are clustered at city level.
