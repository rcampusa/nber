                 Exchange Rate and Current Account
               Dynamics Under Rational Expectations:
                      An Econometric Analysis


                                ABSTRACT




    An econometric portfolio balance model of an open economy, incorporating

exchange rate, price, and current account dynamics, is derived and estimated.

The usual stability conditions do not guarantee a unique rational expectations

solution, and several proposals for resolving this situation are considered.

Using constrained maximum likelihood methods, the model is estimated for Japan.

The estimation results indicate that the model is quite successful in explaining

the patterns found in the data. The model is estimated using several methods of

resolving the question of non—uniqueness, and the results are compared.

1.    tntroduction


     Continued experience with flexible exchange rates for industrialized

countries has stimulated a considerable amount of research on the relationship

between the exchange rate, price level, and current account. Dornbusch (1976)

and Mussa (1982) highlight the role of rational expectations and the

relationship between the money supply, slow price adjustment, and exchange rate

determination. Kouri (1976), Calvo and Rodriguez (1977), Dornbusch and Fischer

(1980), Rodriguez (1980), and Mussa (1980) extend the rational expectations

approach into a more general portfolio balance framewok to emphasize the effects

of current account imbalances on the exchange rate. Recent work by Branson and

Buiter (1983) considers both types of models while Eaton and Turnovsky (1983)

and Buiter and Miller (1983) combine slow price and slow asset adjustment in a

single model.

     While this research has been motivated by empirical phenomena, there has

been very little explicit econometric work on these models suitable for testing

alternative hypotheses, estimating parameters, or conducting quantitative policy

experiments.    In this paper, an econometric portfolio balance model with

rational expectations is constructed in the spirit of the theoretical research

mentioned above.     The model extends this earlier work by incorporating a

stochastic structure within a framework that includes both portfolio balance and

slow price adjustment, tracing Out how the structure influences the dynamics of

exchange rate expectations, and deriving the constraints between the portfolio

balance, current account, and price level equations. By incorporating Mussa's

(1982) price adjustment formulation into the portfolio balance framework, a
                                        —2—




model is derived which, while encompassing exchange rate, price, and current
account dynamics, can be solved analytically.          The model is    capable   of

accounting   for various patterns of correlation between the exchange rate and the
current account.
     A major focus of the paper is on the uniqueness of the rational
expectations   solution.     Even after the imposition of the usual stability

condition, non—uniqueness emerges in this model, not as an aberration, hut as a

quite plausible outcome. The methods for achieving a unique solution proposed

by Taylor (1977) and McCallum (1983) are considered,       It is shown that they

coincide in this model.

     The model is then estimated for Japan, using quarterly data since the

advent of generalized floating in 1973. The estimation results accord well with

the theory, with most of the structural and policy coefficients of the expected

sign and significant. The estimates, which incorporate the constraints proposed

by Taylor and McCallum to achieve a unique solution, are contrasted with a less

restrictive set of estimates of a type proposed by Chow (1983). These do not

constrain the model to any particular solution, but instead allow the solution

to be determined by the data. We find that the two sets of estimates provide

very similar results.      The effects of various disturbances on the dynamics of

the exchange rate, current account, and domestic price level are illustrated by

the moving average representation.       The model is estimated by constrained

maximum likelihood methods recently used by Sargent (1978) and Taylor (1980) for

closed economy rational expectations models.

     The paper is organized as follows:         Section 2 describes the model.

Section 3 derives the rational expectations solution and considers various
                                      —3—



methods to achieve uniqueness. In Section 4, an estimatable form of the model

is derived, the cross equation restrictions are imposed, and the model is

estimated.    The results from implementing McCallum and Taylor's and Chow's

techniques are compared, and the dynamics of the model are illustrated by the

moving average representation. Conclusions are presented in Section 5.



2.    The Model


      In this section, we construct a portfolio balance model of an open economy

which incorporates a number of simplifying assumptions that enable us to focus

on exchange rate, price, and current account dynamics. The country is small in

world markets and produces a single (traded) good. Purchasing power parity is

assumed to hold in the long run but, since demand for the good is not perfectly

elastic, not instantaneously. Domestic residents hold two assets, domestic and
                                                                       1
foreign currencies, while foreigners hold only the foreign asset.            Assets do
                  2
not pay interest.

      Equilibrium in the asset market is expressed by equating the supply of

money with its demand, which depends on domestic income, domestic wealth, and

the expected rate of depreciation,


(1)       m —     = ai(p +     —     + a2w —
                                               a3(+1
                                                       —
                                                           et) +


where n1 = the stock of domestic assets (money supply),            =   the    domestic

consumer price index, Pt =   the price of the domestic good, y = domestic         real

output, w = domestic real wealth, e = the exchange rate (domestic currency
                                             —4—




price of foreign exchange), and              =   the   expected exchange rate at time t + 1

conditional on information available at time t. All variables are expressed as

logarithmic deviations from their steady state values. Real balances (m —

and real income         + y —        are deflated by the consumer price index. The
                                                 —
expected rate of depreciation is
                                                     e.   The disturbance term (as well as
                                                                                 3
the ri's below) is a random variable, which may be serially correlated.

      The consumer price index is a weighted average of the price of the domestic

good and the price of the foreign good expressed in terms of domestic currency

(e + pt).
              The weight (b1) represents the share of the domestic good in

domestic consumption,


              =         ÷ (1 —
(2)               bip            bi)(e   + p)


Domestic nominal wealth is a weighted average of the stock of domestic assets

and domestic holdings of the stock of foreign assets                  expressed in terms of

domestic currency (e +                   The weight (b2) represents the share of the

domestic asset in domestic wealth.           Real wealth is nominal wealth deflated by
                             4
the consumer price index,


          w = b2m       + (1 —           +
(3)                              b2)(e

      The demand for domestic assets is assumed to increase with income and

wealth and to decrease with the expected rate of depreciation. The asset market

equilibrium equation incorporates current realizations of variables which, as

will be shown below, include current shocks.                    This is a discrete time
                                             —5—



approximation of continuous portfolio balance with variables that change over

the period.

     The rate of increase of domestic holdings of foreign assets                   —   is
equal to the current account surplus because foreigners do not hold domestic

currency.     The current account surplus depends on domestic income, foreign
                                     5
income (y*), and domestic wealth,


               —                         —         +          —          +
                   t—    a4(pt_i +                     a5y1       a6wi       E2t


The effect of an increase in domestic income on the current account is

ambiguous.      The two traditional perspectives are that higher income, by

increasing    imports,   causes a deficit, and that higher income, by raising
absorption less than proportionately, causes a surplus.              Recent work on the

current account in a utility maximizing framework, such as Sachs (1981) and

Obstfeld (1983), does not give us a determinate answer because, as will be seen

below, output will depend on relative prices.             Analogously, the effect of

foreign   income on the current account is also indeterminate. An increase in
domestic wealth is   assumed   to decrease savings and to cause a deficit.
    The specification of the current account equation assumes that export and

import decisions are made at the beginning of the period, based on the values of

domestic income, foreign income, and wealth at the end of the previous period.

Since trade does not take place instantaneously, the current account evolves

during the period.       Thus the stock of foreign assets is pre—determined in the

sense that it is not affected by the current realizations of other variables.

It is affected, however, by the current realization of the disturbance term E2t
       Following Mussa (1982), the domestic rate of inflation is assumed to equal

the expected rate of change of the equilibrium price level plus some proportion
                                                                 6

                                                                     —
                                                                         p)   +



where (,      I)     is the expectation of the (exchange rate, foreign price level)

for period t, conditional on information available at the end of period t — 1.

The equilibrium price level is postulated to be the price level at which

purchasing power parity is satisfied, and thus equals e + p. Domestic prices,

like the stock of foreign assets, are predetermined in the sense that they are

unaffected by current realizations of other variables, although they are

affected by the realization of E3t.

       Domestic output is assumed to depend on the relative price of foreign goods

(et + p —          and the level of foreign output,


(6)         y = a8e + a9p — a10p + a11y + fl5


While an increase in the relative price of foreign goods would normally be

expected to increase output, this effect may depend on whether relative price

changes reflect movements in price levels or in the exchange rate.        Since the

exchange rate is determined in auction markets, changes in relative prices

caused by exchange rate movements may not be a good signal of future relative

prices, and thus output may he unresponsive to such changes.             Changes in

relative prices caused by price level movements should, since prices are
                                          —7--




determined    in contract markets, be a better signal of future relative prices,

and thus output should be responsive to these changes.           For this reason, we

place separate coefficients on the three terms comprising relative prices. The

sign of a8 is ambiguous: a9 and a10 are assumed to be positive. As with the

current account, the effect of an increase in foreign income on domestic output

is ambiguous.      fl4 is a random disturbance.

      The money supply is modeled as a reaction function which responds to the

exchange rate, domestic price level, foreign price level, and stock of foreign

assets,


(7)         mt =   a12e + ai3p + a14p +    ai5f +

This formulation encompasses a number of possibilities. The money supply could

respond    to movements in the real exchange rate (relative prices of foreign
goods).     This would constrain a12 =    a14     —a13.   In Taylor (1984) the money
supply    responds to the consumer price index; this produces a very different set

of constraints. We allow the money supply to respond to the stock of foreign

assets to incorporate the possibility that the monetary authorities will

intervene In the foreign exchange markets in response to the current account

balance. It is assumed that a15 > 0.

      The model is completed by, based on the small country assumption, assuming

that foreign prices and output are determined exogenously,


(8)         p = a16p    1   + 6t


            y = a17y    1
                            +   7t
                                         —8—




The first order autoregressive process is specified for simplicity.            The

disturbance terms, as above, can be serially correlated.      It is assumed that

a16 and a17 < 1.



3.      The Rational Expectations Solution


        We now proceed to solve the model and consider the implications of the

rational expectations assumption.       Most research on exchange rate dynamics,

cited above, incorporates either slow price or slow asset adjustment, but not

both.     This produces models with two first order differential (or difference)

equations, involving one predetermined and one non—predetermined variable, which

can always be solved analytically.       Incorporating slow price and slow asset

adjustment produces a third order system, which in general cannot be solved

analytically. Buiter and Miller (1983) use numerical simulation while Eaton and

Turnovsky (1983) are able to determine the signs of the characteristic roots,

although not their values.         The essential difference between Eaton and

Turnovsky's paper and ours is that, following Dornbusch (1976), they assume that
                                                                                 7
prices adjust in response to the relative price of foreign and domestic goods.

Although Mussa's rule, which we adopt, is seemingly more complicated, it allows

us to determine the characteristic roots exactly. While this is necessary for

estimation, the theoretical implications of the two models are very similar.

     The first step towards a solution is to write the structural equations in

the form of five first order stochastic difference equations. Using (2), (3),

(6), and (7), the portfolio balance equation (1) can be written,
                                                                       —9—

The equations for the exogenous variables (8) are unchanged.

        A rational expectations solution for the model involves finding distri—

bution functions for e, '                   p,   and y thatsatisfy (8)—(11). The solution

technique used is a multivariate version of the method of undetermined

coefficients used by Muth (1961) and described in detail by Taylor (1985). It

involves representing the variables in general infinite moving average form,

substituting these general forms into the structural equations, and then solving

the resultant identities for the coefficients.

        An infinite order moving average representation can be written,



                      =

The representations of all of the variables incorporate current disturbances.

The exchange rate is determined in asset markets and is assumed to reflect all

available information including, under the assumption of perfect current

information, all contemporaneous shocks. The other variables are represented by

end of period values, and thus incorporate current disturbances.

       Solution of the model involves substituting equation (12), as well as

similar expressions for                 and z1, into (8)—(11) and solving the resultant

set of identities for the II's.            For the purpose of exposition, we present the
                                                                                                 8

Performing the substitutions, we obtain,

assumed to be stable (< 1). Unless there is a destabilizing parameter value for

                                                           will also be stable.   If

   > 1, the usual assumption, that the conditionally expected time paths of the

variables be stable, is imposed by setting C1, the coefficient of the unstable

root in (15), equal to zero.       This allows all of the il's to be uniquely
              9
determined.

     There is no reason, however, to presume that A1 > 1 in this model.           If

   < 1, the requirement that the conditionally expected time paths of the

variables be stable does not imply any additional conditions, and thus does not

provide a unique solution. Procedures for achieving a unique solution have been

suggested by Taylor (1977) and McCallum (1983). The first part of McCallum's

procedure is to require that a minimal set of state variables be employed in

agents forecasting rules.   This can be implemented by setting either C1 or C2

equal to zero, and thus does not yield a unique solution. The second part of

his procedure is to require that the solution be valid for all admissable

parameter values.   Consider the case where the determinant of Q1 is equal to

zero. Then x =      so that A1 =    + 3 + 12 while A = 0.        The minimal set of

state variables criterion implies that zero is the appropriate root in this

case, thus it is necessary to set C1    0, and a unique solution can be derived.

Taylor's procedure provides the same answer.     If a solution to the model is

defined as setting either C1 or C2 equal to zero, then Taylor's condition, that

the asymptotic variance of the variables be minimized, is implemented by setting

C1, the coefficient on the largest of the two roots, equal to zero.       It should

be noted that these two procedures do not always coincide. In particular, both

McCallum (1983) and Taylor (1985) discuss how they differ when applied to

Taylor's (1977) model.
                                        —14—




       An alternative method for estimating models of this type has been proposed

by Chow (1983). He suggests that, instead of constraining the model to achieve

a unique solution, the parameter C1 be estimated along with the other parameters

of the model. Thus the "solution" of the model will be based on whatever value

of C1 maximizes the likelihood function.        Evans and Honkapohja (1984) also

discuss estimators of this type.

       We conclude   this section by considering the causes of non—uniqueness in
this   model.   One possible factor is if a depreciation of the exchange rate

reduces output (a8 < 0). Calvo (1983) considers the implications of this for

non—uniqueness. A second factor that operates through its effect on domestic

output is if an increase in the domestic price level reduces domestic output

(a10 > 0), which is the expected case.         Monetary policy which accommodates

either exchange rate and/or domestic price movements (a12 and/or a13 > 0) also

contributes towards non—uniqueness. This is also plausible. It can be produced

by, for example, monetary policy which accommodates the consumer price index.

Thus non—uniqueness of the rational expectations solution can be the result of

reasonable parameter values.



4.     Estimation of the Model


       We now examine the extent to which the model developed above can explain

phenomena in the current flexible exchange rate period.       The cross equation

restrictions imposed by the theory constrain the exchange rate, stock of foreign

assets, and price level to follow a unique path after a shock, Estimation of

the model subject to these constraints provides a joint test of the portfolio

balance approach with slow price adjustment arid the rational expectations

as sunip t ion.


      The model is estimated for Japan, using quarterly data from 1973 (II) to

1983 (IV).        The various configurations of the exchange rate and the current

account experienced by Japan in the 1970's and the 1980's seem to be amenable to

explanation by the portfolio balance approach.         Japan also appears to fit the

model's assumptions (that foreign residents do not hold domestic assets and that

countries with flexible exchange rates.           In addition, the assumption that

assets do not pay interest makes estimation of the model inappropriate for

countries where high capital mobility makes interest rate differentials an

important determinant of exchange rates.

      The exchange rates used are weighted average exchange rates, with the

weights derived from the International Monetary Fund's Multilateral Exchange

Rate Model (MERN).       The weights represent the effect on the country's trade

balance (calculated from the MERN) of a 1 percent change in the value of each

foreign currency in terms of the home currency. The data for stocks of foreign

assets are computed by taking a base figure for the middle of the period and

then adding quarterly current account balances forwards and backwards. To the

extent that current account balances cannot be exactly identified with changes

in domestic holdings of foreign assets, the model will account for the former at

the expense of the latter.        The price level used is the GNP deflator, real

income is real GNP, and the money supply is Ml.                Foreign variables are

constructed by taking weighted averages, with the weights corresponding to the

       Estimation of the model requires deriving the reduced form, which in turn

necessitates making some assumptions about the structure of the error terms. We

moving average model.                     Assuming, as above, that expectations are determined

rationally and solving by the method of undetermined coefficients, the reduced

form of (8)—(11) is derived,


(16)           z =   Azi            + B(L)Vt

A and B are 5x5 matrices. The elements of A and B are non—linear combinations

of the ES's, s, and T's (which in turn are combinations of the a's), and the

a's,    The V's are combinations of the 's, written so as to make the zero lag

coefficient matrix the identity matrix. The constraints on the parameters are

generated by the form of the structural equations, the assumption of rational

expectations, and the imposition of the uniqueness conditions.
                                         —17-



     The model to be estimated consists of equations (6), (7), and (16). These

are estimated jointly in accordance with the Lucas critique. We make the same

assumptions with regard to the structure of the disturbance terms for output

      and the money supply            as we do for the others.     (a6 is the serial

correlation term for output, a7 for the money supply.) There are 98 constrained

parameters in the complete model, 14 autoregressive, 76 moving average, and 8

simultaneous, which are combinations of 24 fundamental parameters, 17 structural

(a's) and 7 serial correlation (a's).

     Using maximum likelihood techniques, we can estimate the structural

coefficients, the serial correlation coefficients, and the covariance matrix of

the shocks. The reduced form (16) is a vector ARMA (1,4) model with nonlinear

constraints on the parameters. Under the assumption that           is a multivariate

normal vector with EVtVt_ = 2, maximum likelihood estimates (conditional on the

initial disturbances being set to zero) under the restrictions imposed by the

model are obtained by maximizing,



          L() = (211)_T -T/2 exp(-1/2
                                          i1

where T is the number of observations.



Maximum likelihood estimates of      with       unknown can be obtained by minimizing

the determinant of Q with respect to the         a's   and the a's, subject to the
                           T
constraints, where                  is a sample covariance matrix of       Nonlinear
                       T
minimization routines can he used to find the minimum even though the

determinant is a highly nonlinear function of the parameters. The technique

used here is the Davidon—Fletcher—Powell algorithm.
                                      —18-



     The maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are given in Table 1

along with their asymptotic "t—ratios', the ratio of these coefficients to their

standard errors computed from the inverse of the second derivative matrix of the

likelihood function. The results of the estimation are very successful. Most

of the structural coefficients have the expected sign, are of reasonable

magnitude, and are significant.       In the portfolio balance equation, the

coefficients on income (a1), wealth (a2), and the expected rate of depreciation

(a3) are all positive, plausible, and significant.     For the current account

equation, the coefficient on domestic income (a4) is positive and insignificant,

while for foreign income (a5) it is negative and insignificant. Both of these

parameters, however, are theoretically ambiguous.    The coefficient on wealth

(a6) is, as expected, positive and significant.       Mussa's price adjustment

equation appears to fit well, with the coefficient on the difference between

equilibrium and actual prices (a7) positive and significant.

     Foreign (a9) and domestic (a10) prices have the expected affects on

domestic output, with both coefficients positive and a10 significant.       The

coefficient on the exchange rate (a8) is negative and significant, while foreign

output (a11) has no affect on domestic output at all.      The money supply is

accommodative with respect to the exchange rate (a12), the domestic price level

(a13), the foreign price level (a14), and the stock of foreign assets (a15),

with all four coefficients being positive and significant. The signs of these

coefficients are not consistent with the hypothesis that the money supply

responds to the real exchange rate.    While the signs are consistent with the

money supply accommodating the consumer price index, the magnitudes are not.
                                            —19—



The response of the money supply to the exchange rate and the stock of foreign

assets indicates that intervention is important.

     The autoregressive parameter on foreign prices (a16) is positive and

significant while the coefficient for foreign output (a17) is positive and

insignificant.    Only the serial correlation coefficient for the exchange rate

(a1) is positive while only the coefficients for domestic (a3) and foreign (ct4)

prices are significant.       In summary, the estimated values of all of the

coefficients for which the theory predicts a determinate sign are of that sign,
                                       15
are significant, and are plausible.

     We now examine the parameter values implied by the estimates, which are

also given in Table 1. Both      and        are stable (<   1),   and C1, the coefficient

of X1, is set to zero by the arguments of McCallum and Taylor described above to

provide a unique solution.       All four possible factors contribute to the

non—uniqueness.    A depreciation of the exchange rate and an increase in the

domestic price level both reduce domestic output, while monetary policy is

accommodative with respect to both the exchange rate and the domestic price

level.

     Estimates of the model using Chow's technique are presented in Table 2.

The value of C1 is —.19 (—1.54) which, while not significant, has a large enough

value and a small enough standard error so that the possibility that C1 does not

equal zero should be taken seriously.         The structural parameters, however, do

not change very much and the parameter values implied by the estimates (the 6's,

l's, i's, and A's) are very similar. In summary, the less restrictive estimates

using Chow's technique indicate that the constraints imposed above to achieve a

unique solution are not seriously at odds with the data.
                                     —20—



     One illustrative method of examining the results of the estimation is to

consider the moving average representations for the constrained model.     These

give the response over time of the exchange rate, stock of foreign assets, and

domestic price level to disturbances of the exchange rate, stock of foreign

assets, domestic price level, foreign price level, and foreign output, and are

presented in Table 3.     The representations for the less constrained model

(Chow's method) are very similar and are not presented. These representations

are conditional on the assumption that the correlations between the disturbances

are zero, so that an innovation in one variable can be considered independently

of movements in the others. While some of the correlations are low, some are
                                                                                 16
high enough to suggest that these representations be interpreted with caution.

Sims (1979), Sargent (1978) and Taylor (1980) have used the moving average

representation in other contexts.

     A disturbance that depreciates the exchange rate causes a deficit.     Over

time, the exchange rate appreciates and the current account is in surplus back

to the steady state.     The maximum depreciation and deficits are attained

quickly, and the adjustment is fairly smooth.        The domestic price level

increases slightly.     A surplus shock to the current account produces

appreciation of the exchange rate and a small decrease in the domestic price

level.   The responses to current account and to exchange rate shocks are of

comparable magnitude. An increase in the domestic price level depreciates the

exchange 'rate and causes cycles of current account surplus and deficits.    An

increase in the foreign price level first causes depreciation and deficits, but

the deficits continue after the depreciation is reversed.     Shocks to foreign
                                       —21—-




 output do not have strong affects.    The correlation between the exchange rate
 and the current account is positive (deficits associated with depreciation and

 vice versa) in response to shocks of the exchange rate and stock of foreign

 assets, and mixed in response to shocks of the domestic and foreign price
levels.



5.   Conclusions


     This paper has shown that, by incorporating rational              expectations
explicitly into the portfolio balance framework, a model of an open economy can

he constructed that is capable of accounting for the dynamics of the exchange

rate and the current account.      By deriving the cross equation constraints

implied by the rational expectations solution and then estimating the model

subject to these constraints, the paper provides a rigorous joint test of the

portfolio balance approach and the rational expectations assumption.

     The estimation results for Japan are quite successful.       They accord well
with the theory and are capable of explaining various patterns of correlation

between the exchange rate and the current account.     One noteworthy result is
that the usual stability condition does not provide a unique solution to the

model. Several methods for resolving this problem are implemented and compared.

The results provide strong econometric evidence of the             importance of
simultaneous determination of the exchange rate, the price level, the current

account, and expectations in open economy macroeconomic models.

1. The assumption that foreigners hold only the foreign asset is common in

     portfolio balance models.    If   relaxed, a two—country model would be needed.

     If, in that context, the assumption were made that each country's residents

     preferred their own asset, the results would be similar to the present

     model.

2. Allowing foreign assets to pay an exogenously determined rate of interest,

     as in Dornbusch and Fischer (1980), does not affect the theoretical

     results.   Since the model contains no interest bearing assets, it can be

     considered a currency substitution model in the sense used by Calvo and

     Rodriguez (1977). We call it a portfolio balance model becuase the term

     "currency substitution" has come to imply trade in currencies in addition

     to other assets.

3.   It is assumed that the n's are not contemporaneously correlated.

4. This log—linear approximation for wealth has been used by Driskill (1980)

     and by Eaton and Turnovsky (1983).

5. An alternative specification would be to have domestic income and wealth

     denominated in terms of foreign currency.        The model with this equation

     cannot be distinguished, either theoretically or empirically, from the

     specification in the text.        It is not possible to have both the current

     account and domestic output (specified below) depend on relative prices and

     still econometrically identify the parameters.        We do not differentiate

     between foreign output and income.
 6. Mussa argues that his formulation has a better microec000mic rationale and

     more sensible steady state properties than Dornbusch's.

 7. Dornbusch assumes that prices adjust in response to excess demand in the

     goods market.   tn his model, although not in Eaton and Turnovsky's nor in

    ours, that is equivalent to having prices adjust in response to the

    relative price of foreign and domestic goods.

 8. If the disturbances were modeled as moving average processes, equation (13)

    would contain terms up to the order of the moving average. Equation (14)

    would begin with the next term and the remainder of the solution, including

    the characteristic roots and the uniqueness criteria, would be unchanged.

 9. This criterion is also known as the "no speculative bubbles" or "finite

    variance" condition.

10. While it is certainly not true that no Japanese currency is held by

    foreigners, the yen is not an international currency in the sense that the

    dollar or sterling is.        Relaxing this assumption is discussed in
    footnote 1.

11. The data is taken from International Financial Statistics.      All data is

    seasonally adjusted except for the exchange rate (which does not exhibit a

    strong seasonal pattern).    The countries used to construct the foreign

    variables (weights in parentheses) are:         Canada (.04), France (10),

    Germany (.16), Italy (.05), United Kingdom (.05), and United States (.60).

12. These weights are averages oier    the   sample period.    Theoretically, b1
    should represent the share of importable goods in domestic consumption,

    rather than imported goods, and should therefore be estimated.        It is
    impossible, however, to econometrically identify the parameters in equation

    (1) if h1 is also estimated.

13. In addition, the constants were removed from the first—differenced data so

    that the variables would have zero means. We also estimated the model with

    the data detrended by regression on a constant, linear time tread, and

    trend squared.                  The results of this estimation indicated that the

    detrending was not sufficient to remove nonstationarity for the exchange

    rate.

14. The disturbances need to be written as finite order moving averages for the

    model to be estimated. We generate these from first order autoregressive

    processes in order to limit the number of parameters to be estimated. The

    moving average representation for u1 is truncated one order lower than the

    others so as not to impose arbitrary zero restrictions on u24, ...,
                                                                                              u54.
    The ARMA (1,4) model was chosen because it eliminated most of the serial

    correlation among the residuals.

15. While it would be desirable to test the cross equation restrictions by

    using a likelihood ratio test, the lack of degrees of freedom in the

    unrestricted system makes this impossible.

16. Let a. be the sample correlation coefficient between variables i and i.
