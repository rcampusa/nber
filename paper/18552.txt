                                              ABSTRACT

We investigate the effect of the vintage (year of FDA approval) of the prescription drugs used by an
individual on his or her survival and medical expenditure. When we only control for age, sex, and
interview year, we estimate that a one-year increase in drug vintage increases life expectancy by 0.52%.
Controlling for other variables including activity limitations, race, education, family income as a percent
of the poverty line, insurance coverage, Census region, BMI, smoking and over 100 medical conditions
has virtually no effect on the estimate of the effect of drug vintage on life expectancy.

Between 1996 and 2003, the mean vintage of prescription drugs increased by 6.6 years. This is estimated
to have increased life expectancy of elderly Americans by 0.41-0.47 years. This suggests that not
less than two-thirds of the 0.6-year increase in the life expectancy of elderly Americans during 1996-2003
was due to the increase in drug vintage. The 1996-2003 increase in drug vintage is also estimated to
have increased annual drug expenditure per elderly American by $207, and annual total medical expenditure
per elderly American by $218. This implies that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per life-year
gained) of pharmaceutical innovation was about $12,900.

         Longevity increase is increasingly recognized by economists to be an important part of
economic growth and development.1 Economists have also recognized for many years that, in
the long run, economic “growth…is driven by technological change that arises from intentional
[research and development (R&D)] investment decisions made by profit-maximizing agents”
(Romer (1990)) and by public organizations such as the National Institutes of Health. In
principle, technological change could be either disembodied or embodied in new goods. Solow
(1960) hypothesized that most technological change is embodied: to benefit from technological
progress, one must use newer, or later vintage,2 goods and services. Bresnahan and Gordon
(1996) argued that “new goods are at the heart of economic progress,” and Hercowitz (1998, p.
223) also reached the “conclusion…that 'embodiment' is the main transmission mechanism of
technological progress to economic growth.”
         In this paper, I will use patient-level data to analyze the effect of technological change
embodied in pharmaceuticals on the longevity of elderly Americans.3 The basic approach will
be to investigate whether patients using newer drugs in a given year remain alive longer than
patients using older drugs, controlling for many important patient characteristics.
         Two previous studies have examined the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on
longevity using patient-level data. Lichtenberg et al (2009) analyzed medical and pharmacy
claims data on elderly patients enrolled in Quebec’s provincial health plan (Régie de l’assurance
maladie du Québec), during the period 1997-2006. Lichtenberg (2010) analyzed medical and
pharmacy claims data from Puerto Rico’s Medicaid program during the period 2000-2002. Both
studies found that the use of newer medications was associated with a statistically significant
mortality risk reduction, relative to older medications.
         While these two studies were useful, they were subject to several limitations. First, they
controlled for some important patient characteristics, such as age, sex, region, and the presence
of various medical conditions, but, since they were based entirely on administrative data, they
were unable to control for other characteristics, such as education, income, and race. Second,
both studies provided estimates of the effect of using newer drugs on the probability of surviving

a piano of 1845 vintage)”. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage

  According to the National Science Foundation, the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries are the most
research intensive industries in the economy.
                                                                                                             3


a certain period of time,4 but neither provided estimates of the effect of using newer drugs on
mean time till death (life expectancy), or of the overall cost-effectiveness of new drugs relative
to old drugs. And third, neither study was based on nationally representative samples of
individuals.
        The present study will overcome these limitations. The data we will use (primarily
derived from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Linked Mortality Public-use Files)
will enable us to control for a larger set of potentially important patient characteristics. We will
show that controlling for these characteristics has virtually no effect on the estimate of the effect
of drug vintage on life expectancy, because drug vintage is not correlated with several important
individual attributes, including insurance coverage, race, and family income as a percent of the
poverty line. We will provide estimates (which we believe to be quite robust and reliable) of the
effect of using newer drugs on life expectancy per se, as well as its effect on pharmaceutical and
overall medical expenditure. Hence, we can estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness (cost per
life-year gained) of using newer drugs. These estimates will be based on a nationally
representative sample of elderly U.S. community residents.5
        Several previous studies (e.g. Lichtenberg and Duflos (2008), Lichtenberg (2011, 2012))
have examined the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity and medical expenditure
using aggregate (longitudinal state-level or disease-level) data from the U.S. and other countries.
We will compare the estimates we obtain from our patient-level sample to estimates obtained
from previous analyses of aggregate data.

General approach

        Figure 1 illustrates the general approach we will use. We will investigate the effect of the
vintage of the prescription drugs used by an individual on his or her survival and medical
expenditure, controlling for a number of demographic characteristics and indicators and
determinants of health status. We will do this by estimating models of the following general
form:

        survivali=  rx_vintagei +  Zi + i                                         (1)
4
  Lichtenberg (2010) examined whether Puerto Rico Medicaid beneficiaries using newer drugs during January– June
2000 were less likely to die by the end of 2002, conditional on the covariates.
5
  Nursing home residents, which account for about 4% of the elderly population
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus09.pdf#105), are not included in our sample.
                                                                                                     4


where
          survivali = a measure based on individual i’s survival time (number of years
                    until death)
           vintagei = a measure of the vintage of prescription drugs used by individual i
                 Zi = a vector of other attributes of individual i
                 i = a disturbance

First, I will discuss the measures of survival and appropriate estimation methods. Then I will
discuss the measurement of drug vintage. Third, I will describe the other individual attributes I
will control for. Fourth, I will consider why there is likely to be substantial variation in drug
vintage, even controlling for all of these attributes. In order for estimates of  to identify the
effect of pharmaceutical innovation on longevity, there must be a large random component in the
assignment of drugs to individuals. A substantial body of literature indicates that this is the case.

   A. Measures of survival and appropriate estimation methods

          Most of the data we will use were obtained from the 1996-2002 waves of the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their
medical providers, and employers across the United States. MEPS is the most complete source of
data on the cost and use of health care and health insurance coverage. The Household
Component (HC) of MEPS provides data from individual households and their members, which
is supplemented by data from their medical providers. It collects data from a sample of families
and individuals in selected communities across the United States, drawn from a nationally
representative subsample of households that participated in the prior year's National Health
Interview Survey (conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics). During the household
interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the
following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services,
charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage,
income, and employment. For example, MEPS provides data about (including the 11-digit
National Drug Codes of) all of the prescription drugs used by a patient during a calendar year.
The MEPS is a panel study, but I will use it as a cross section: each individual will contribute a
single observation to the sample, using data from the first year the person was included in the
survey.
                                                                                                                         5


         I am able to track a patient’s vital status for up to 10 years after he or she was in the
MEPS sample because (1) the set of households selected for each panel of the MEPS HC is a
subsample of households participating in the previous year's National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,6 and (2) the NHIS Linked
Mortality Public-use Files provide mortality follow-up data for the NHIS years 1986-2004 from
the date of interview through December 31, 2006.7 Let
          interview_datei = the date individual i was interviewed
              death_datei = the date individual i died
               surv_timei = death_datei - interview_datei = the number of years individual i survived
                          after being interviewed

If individual i did not die by December 31, 2006, his or her death date is unknown—we only
know that the death date was or will be after December 31, 2006. Hence, the variable surv_time
is right-censored. We will estimate versions of eq. (1), in which the dependent variable is
surv_time, using a statistical procedure (the SAS LIFEREG procedure) that fits parametric
models to failure time data that can be uncensored, right censored, left censored, or interval
censored. I will assume that the number of years the patient lived after being interviewed (or the
number of years till death) has the Weibull distribution, one of the most commonly used
distributions in failure time analysis. The probability density function of a Weibull random
variable X is:




where k > 0 is the shape parameter and λ > 0 is the scale parameter of the distribution.8 The
mean of a Weibull random variable can be expressed as λ (1+(1/k)) where (z) is the Gamma
function:9

  NHIS/MEPS Public Use Person Record Linkage files contain crosswalks that allows data users to merge MEPS
full-year public use data files to NHIS person-level public use data files that contain data collected for MEPS
respondents in the year prior to their initial year of MEPS participation; see

  The shape parameter is what gives the Weibull distribution its flexibility. By changing the value of the shape
parameter, the Weibull distribution can model a wide variety of data. If k = 1, the Weibull distribution is identical to
the exponential distribution; if k = 2, the Weibull distribution is identical to the Rayleigh distribution; if k is between
3 and 4 the Weibull distribution approximates the normal distribution. The Weibull distribution approximates the
lognormal distribution for several values of k.

                                                                                                                   6




        We assume that the scale parameter λ depends on patient characteristics X as follows: λ =
exp( X). Hence ln  =  X, and ln(mean survival time) =  X + ln((1+(1/k))). Therefore the
estimated coefficient on a patient characteristic X1 indicates the percentage change in mean
survival time attributable to a unit increase in X1.
        Our estimation procedure allows us to use right-censored survival data, but the precision
of our estimates will be greater, the larger the fraction of the observations that are not censored.
To increase the precision of the estimates, I will analyze people 65 years and older (“the
elderly”) who were interviewed during 1996-2000. The five-year mortality rate of elderly people
is over nine times as high as the five-year mortality rate of nonelderly people (23.3% vs. 2.6%).
Choosing 2000 as the final sample year ensures that each individual’s vital status can be tracked
for a minimum of six years. The survival times of 38% of the people 65 years and older who
were interviewed during 1996-2000 are not censored.
        Unfortunately, MEPS did not obtain data on two potentially important behavioral risk
factors prior to 2000: data on whether or not the individual currently smokes began in 2000, and
data on body mass index began in 2001.10 Therefore, including these variables in the surv_time
model is not feasible. However, we can assess whether controlling for these variables affects our
estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on survival by using an alternative measure
of survival:
        surv_3_yeari = 1 if surv_timei > 3 years
                     = 0 if surv_timei < 3 years

When the dependent variable of eq. (1) is defined as surv_3_year, the model including the two
behavioral risk factors can be estimated using data on people interviewed in 2001 and 2002.
Since the dependent variable is binary, we will estimate this model as a probit model.

effects of obesity on U.S. mortality.

     B. Measurement of drug vintage

     MEPS Prescribed Medicines files provide data on all outpatient prescription drugs used by
each individual.11 We identified the active ingredients of all of the medications used by each
respondent. We used data provided by the FDA
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079750.htm) to determine the year in
which the FDA first approved a product containing that active ingredient. From the
Drugs@FDA database, we constructed the following variables:
 ingred_yeara = the year in which the FDA first approved a product containing active
              ingredient a (a =1,…,800)
    post1975a = 1 if ingred_yeara > 1975
              = 0 otherwise
    post1985a = 1 if ingred_yeara > 1985
              = 0 otherwise

MEPS provides data on n_rxia: the total number of medications used by individual i that
contained active ingredient a. We combined the MEPS medication data with the FDA ingredient
attribute data to construct the following variables characterizing the distribution of medications
used by each individual:
      rx_yeari = (a n_rxia ingred_yeara) / a n_rxia = the (weighted) mean vintage of
               medications used by individual i
rx_post1975%i = (a n_rxia post1975a) / a n_rxia = the fraction of medications used by
               individual i that contained active ingredients approved after 1975
rx_post1985%i = (a n_rxia post1985a) / a n_rxia = the fraction of medications used by
               individual i that contained active ingredients approved after 1985

     C. Other individual attributes

        The survival models we estimate will include an extensive set of demographic
characteristics and indicators and determinants of health status. The effects of some of these
variables on mortality and survival are well documented. For example, life tables published by
the CDC (Arias et al (2008)) show how life expectancy depends on age, sex, and race. The life
table figures can be used as a benchmark against which we can compare our estimates.



11
  MEPS does not provide information about provider-administered drugs, e.g. chemotherapy. Provider-
administered drugs may account for about 15% of total U.S. drug expenditure.
                                                                                                                     8


        A person’s life expectancy also clearly depends on the medical conditions a person has.
For example, during 2001-2007, the 5-year relative survival rate of a person with breast cancer
was 89.1%, whereas the 5-year relative survival rate of a person with pancreatic cancer was only
5.5%.12 We will control for the presence or absence of over 100 (2-digit ICD9) medical
conditions by including a dummy variable for each condition.13 There are 4 possible reasons
why a person could be defined as having a given medical condition: (1) the person responded
affirmatively when specifically asked whether he or she has ever been diagnosed with the
condition; (2) the condition was reported by the person as the reason for a particular medical
event (hospital stay, outpatient visit, emergency room visit, home health episode, prescribed
medication purchase, or medical provider visit); (3) the condition was reported as the reason for
one or more episodes of disability days; and (4) the condition was reported by the person as a
condition "bothering" the person during the reference period.14
        A person’s life expectancy may depend not just on whether he or she has a medical
condition, but on how long he or she has had the condition. MEPS Medical Conditions files
provide some information on the duration of medical conditions (i.e. the date the condition
began), but this information is very incomplete. However, MEPS Prescribed Medicines files
provide fairly complete information on the date the person started taking each medicine. Mean
duration of medication use (or the mean year the person started taking his or her medications
(began_med_year)) may serve as a reasonable proxy for mean duration of medical condition.
We will include began_med_year as an explanatory variable.
        In addition to data on medical conditions and their treatment, MEPS provides data on the
functional status and activity limitations of individuals. In particular, MEPS respondents are
asked whether or not they experience any limitation in work, housework, or school activities, and
if so, whether they are completely unable to perform those activities. We constructed the
following measure of activity limitations:
act_limi = 2 if person i was completely unable to work at a job, do housework, or go to school
         = 1 if person i was limited in these activities but not completely unable to perform
         them
         = 0 if person i was not limited in these activities

http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2008/results_merged/topic_survival.pdf
13
   The dummy variables were constructed using data in the MEPS Medical Conditions files.
14
   In some previous studies based on claims data, a person would be considered to have a medical condition only if
the diagnosis code for that condition appeared in a medical claim.
                                                                                                                  9


One would expect that people whose activities are more limited have lower life expectancy,
ceteris paribus. However, if pharmaceutical innovation improves health (and reduces activity
limitations), then estimates of  in eq. (1)—the effect of drug vintage on life expectancy—are
likely to be conservative when Z includes act_lim. We will present estimates of eq. (1) both
excluding and including act_lim.
        We also include two measures of socioeconomic status—income and education—in the
survival model. Many studies have found a positive correlation between these variables and life
expectancy. However, cross-sectional correlations between longevity and either income or
education may substantially overestimate the effect of socioeconomic status per se on longevity.
For example, the positive correlation between income and longevity may reflect the effect of
health on income (“reverse causality”) as well as the effect of income on health. Almond and
Mazumder (2006) argue that, “although it is well known that there is a strong association
between education and health, much less is known about how these factors are connected, and
whether the relationship is causal.”15

     D. Why does drug vintage vary, controlling for these individual attributes?


     We believe that heterogeneous pharmaceutical treatment of patients, controlling for their
medical conditions, demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, and other factors, is
primarily due to physician practice variation. Wennberg (2004) argues that “unwarranted
[treatment] variation—variation not explained by illness, patient preference, or the dictates of
evidence-based medicine—is a ubiquitous feature of U.S. health care.” A large number of
studies have documented the importance of unexplained variation in medical care in general and
prescribing behavior in particular. Wennberg and Wennberg examined variation in nine drugs or
classes of drugs among members of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, and argued that
“evidence does not, per se, ensure that pharmaceuticals are always used rationally.” Lee et al

15
   Lleras-Muney (2005) provided perhaps the strongest evidence that education has a causal effect on health. Using
state compulsory school laws as instruments, Lleras-Muney found large effects of education on mortality. Almond
and Mazumder (2006) revisited these results, noting they were not robust to state time trends, even when the sample
was vastly expanded and a coding error rectified. They employed a dataset containing a broad array of health
outcomes and found that when using the same instruments, the pattern of effects for specific health conditions
appeared to depart markedly from prominent theories of how education should affect health. They also found
suggestive evidence that vaccination against smallpox for school age children may account for some of the
improvement in health and its association with education. This raised concerns about using compulsory schooling
laws to identify the causal effects of education on health.
                                                                                                                      10


(2008) showed that “pediatric and adult transplant physicians differed significantly in their
management strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute and chronic graft-versus-host
disease, and choice of graft source for patients with aplastic anemia. Among adult transplant
physicians, there was little agreement on the patient factors favoring reduced intensity
conditioning or myeloablative conditioning.” DeSalvo et al (2000) reported “wide variation…in
assignment of reappointment interval with mean return intervals…ranging from 2.2 to 20.5
weeks. Sex was a significant provider independent variable…Female providers assigned earlier
reappointment intervals for their patients.” Solomon et al (2003) found that “established risk
factors for NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxicity were poor predictors of who was
prescribed a selective COX-2 inhibitor; in contrast, physician prescribing preference was an
important determinant.” De Las Cuevas et al (2002) showed that “there is a remarkable degree
of variation in antidepressant prescribing by psychiatrists and general practitioners; this is due to
economic and social factors as much as to morbidity differences.” Rochon et al (2007) found
that “residents in facilities with high antipsychotic prescribing rates were about 3 times more
likely than those in facilities with low prescribing rates to be dispensed an antipsychotic agent,
irrespective of their clinical indication.”16 Zink et al (2001) found that “trends in the drug
management of [rheumatoid arthritis] are adopted differentially by the members of the
rheumatology community.” Davis and Gribben (1995) found that “data from a survey of general
practice in New Zealand confirm the existence of extensive variability in prescribing.
Controlling for patient, diagnostic, and practitioner variables…does not reduce the extent of
interpractitioner variability in prescribing rates.” Moreover, de Jong et al (2009) found that
decision support systems do not reduce variation in prescribing.
         We will assess the extent of prescribing practice variation in our sample of individuals by
estimating the following equation:

         rx_vintagei =  Zi + i                                                             (2)

  Using clinical and administrative data obtained from all facilities in a Department of Veterans Affairs integrated
service network, Krein et al (2002) showed that there was variation in diabetes practice patterns at the primary care
provider, provider group, and facility levels, and that the greatest amount of variance tended to be attributable to the
facility level.
                                                                                                                11


The R2 of this equation indicates the fraction of the variance in prescription drug vintage that is
explained by variation in medical conditions and other individual attributes. A low R2 would be
indicative of substantial practice variation.


Descriptive statistics


        Now I will present some descriptive statistics. Following the sequence of the previous
section, I will first present statistics about life expectancy. Next, I will present statistics about
the vintage of prescription drugs. Third, I will present statistics about other patient attributes.
Finally, I will present estimates of eq. (2), to assess the extent of prescribing practice variation in
our sample.
Life expectancy. Our sample consists of people age 65 and over interviewed in the MEPS during
1996-2000 who were eligible for mortality follow-up17 and who had at least one prescription drug18
during the interview year. Table 1 shows some sample statistics.
        We estimated survival functions for both sexes combined and separately by sex using the
right-censored surv_time observations, and no explanatory variables (only an intercept). This
provided the estimates of the Weibull shape and scale parameters (k and λ) and of mean survival
time (λ (1+(1/k)) shown in Table 2. Mean survival time computed from the right-censored
surv_time observations is about 15% higher than mean life expectancy based on the 1999-2001
CDC life table. We can think of two possible reasons for this. One is that CDC life-table
estimates of life expectancy are based on nursing-home residents as well as community residents,
whereas our sample only includes community residents, who are certainly healthier. A second,
less important reason is that the CDC life table is a period life table, whereas the parameter
estimates are, in effect, estimates of the cohort life table.19




17
   Less than half of MEPS respondents were eligible for mortality follow-up. See
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/datalinkage/nhis_frequency_of_selected_variables_public_2010.pdf.
18
   In 2000, 88% of elderly MEPS respondents had at least one prescription drug during the year.
19
   The Social Security Administration publishes both period and cohort U.S. life tables
(http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Body.html). The estimate of life expectancy of 70-year-olds in
2000 from the (1930 birth) cohort life table is higher than the estimate of life expectancy of 70-year-olds in 2000
from the period life table, but only about 2% higher.
                                                                                                                   12


         The life-table and parametric estimates of the percentage differential between female and
male life expectancy are quite similar: 13.5% and 11.5%. Overall, our statistical procedure
seems to yield plausible estimates of the survival distribution.
Drug vintage. Statistics describing the vintage of prescription drugs used by elderly MEPS
respondents during the period 1996-2008 are shown in Table3.20 Not surprisingly, drug vintage
increased over time. rx_post1975% (the fraction of medications that contained active ingredients
approved after 1975) increased from 57% in 1996 to 75% in 2008, and rx_post1985% increased
from 26% in 1996 to 57% in 2008. rx_year (the weighted mean FDA approval year) increased
by 8 years during this period.21 However, the average annual rate of increase was three times as
high from 1996 to 2003 as it was from 2003 to 2008 (0.9 vs. 0.3 years/year). The post-1995
decline in the number of new drugs approved by the FDA, illustrated in Figure 2, probably
contributed to the decline in the rate of increase of drug vintage.
         As shown in Table 4, there is considerable variation in drug vintage across individuals.
The difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile of the vintage distribution is
12.3 years (1983.0 vs. 1970.7); the difference between the 90th percentile and the 10th percentile
of the vintage distribution is 24.8 years (1988.4 vs. 1963.6).
Other variables. Frequency distributions of many of the individual attributes shown in Figure 1
are presented in Table 5.
Prescribing practice variation. To assess the degree of unexplained variability in prescription
drug use, we estimated eq. (2): a regression of rx_year on a large set of individual attributes:
dummy variables for interview year, age, sex, race, marital status, Census region, insurance
coverage, education, income (poverty group category), and presence of 100+ medical conditions.
Table 6 shows the Type III (marginal) sums of squares for all factors except the medical
conditions. Several factors (interview year, region, sex, and education) are statistically
significant. The significance of interview year is not surprising, since we already saw in Table 3
that drug vintage tends to increase over time. The estimates in Table 6 indicate that drugs used
in the western U.S. are about 2 years older than drugs used in the rest of the country; drugs used
by women are about a year older than drugs used by men; and that highly educated people tend


20
   These statistics describe the vintage of prescription drugs used by all elderly MEPS respondents, including those
not eligible for mortality follow-up.
21
   In 1996, the mean age (number of years since FDA approval) of drugs consumed was 20.1 years; in 2008, it was
24.1 years.
                                                                                                                13


to use newer drugs than less educated people. Drug vintage is not significantly related to several
important individual attributes, including insurance coverage, race, and family income as a
percent of the poverty line. The R2 of this regression is only 12%, which indicates that only 1/8
of the variation in drug vintage is explained by the presence of 100+ medical conditions and key
demographic and socioeconomic variables. This is consistent with the literature documenting
substantial variation in prescribing and drug use.


Empirical results


        Estimates of three versions of eq. (1) are shown in Table 7. In all three versions, the
dependent variable is the right-censored variable surv_time (the number of years individual i
survived after being interviewed), and the measure of drug vintage is rx_year (the (weighted)
mean vintage of medications used by individual i). The three models differ in terms of the other
attributes (Z) that are included. In model 1, the only other attributes included are dummy
variables for age, sex, and interview year. Estimates of the coefficients on these variables seem
reasonable: life expectancy declines with age, is higher for women than for men, and was lower
in 1996-1997 than it was in 1998-2000. In this model, the rx_year coefficient () is positive and
highly significant (p-value = .001); the point estimate (.0056) indicates that a one-year increase
in drug vintage increases life expectancy by 0.56%.22
        Model 2 includes a much more extensive set of other attributes: began_med_year (the
mean year the person started taking his or her medications, which may serve as a proxy for mean
duration of medical conditions); race; education; family income as a percent of the poverty line;
insurance coverage; Census region; marital status; and over 100 medical condition dummy
variables.23 The coefficient on began_med_year is not statistically significant. Also, the
difference in life expectancy between people with and without private health insurance is not
significant. Regional differences are also insignificant. The race coefficients indicate that the


22
   The absolute increase in life expectancy (LE) due to a one-year increase in drug vintage depends on mean life
expectancy: since  = d ln LE / d rx_year = (1 / LE) * (d LE / d rx_year), d LE / d rx_year, d LE / d rx_year =  *
LE. As discussed above, we have two estimates of sample mean life expectancy: mean life expectancy based on the
1999-2001 CDC life table (11.9 years), and mean life expectancy (survival time) computed from the right-censored
surv_time observations: (13.7 years). Below we will calculate the absolute increase in life expectancy and
incremental cost effectiveness using each of these estimates of mean life expectancy.
23
   Coefficients on marital status and medical condition dummies are not shown to conserve space.
                                                                                                                        14


life expectancy of blacks is 9% lower than that of whites (p-value = .078), and that the life
expectancy of Asians is 39% higher than that of whites (p-value = .022, despite the fact that only
1.4% of sample members are Asians). The income and education group variables indicate that,
overall, people in higher income categories and with more education have longer life expectancy.
However, controlling for this much more extensive set of other attributes has virtually no effect
on the point estimate of . The difference between the estimates of  in models 1 and 2 is not
statistically significant.24
         Model 3 includes one additional individual attribute: act_lim, the index of activity
limitations. We argued above that estimates of the effect of drug vintage on life expectancy are
likely to be conservative when we control for act_lim. As one would expect, the life expectancy
of people with activity limitations is lower than that of people without activity limitations.
Controlling for activity limitations reduces the estimate of , but only slightly ( = .0052, p-
value = .003).
         We also estimated two models (models 4 and 5) similar to model 3 in which we replaced
the drug vintage measure rx_year by one of the alternative measures (rx_post1975% or
rx_post1985%). The estimates of the drug vintage coefficients models 3, 4, and 5 are shown in
Table 8. The coefficients in all three models are statistically significant (p-value < .05). Each of
the models provides an estimate of how much the increase in drug vintage during a given period
(e.g. 1996-2003) increased the life expectancy of elderly Americans. As shown in Table 3,
during the period 1996-2003, rx_year increased by 6.6 years, rx_post1975% increased by 14
percentage points, and rx_post1985% increased by 26 percentage points. Therefore, model 3
implies that the increase in drug vintage during 1996-2003 increased the life expectancy of
elderly Americans by 3.4% (= .0052 * 6.6), model 4 implies that the increase in drug vintage
increased their life expectancy by 2.5% (= .177 * 0.14), and model 3 implies that the increase in
drug vintage increased their life expectancy by 2.9% (= .112 * 0.26). Since the choice of new-
drug/old-drug threshold year (e.g. 1975 or 1985) is arbitrary, and rx_year (based on the
continuous ingredient vintage measure rx_year) presumably conveys more information than the


24
   We performed a Hausman test of the difference between the estimates of  in models 1 and 2. The Hausman test
statistic is H = (2 – 1)2 / (var(2) – var(1)), where i is the estimate of  in model i (i = 1, 2). (See, for example,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausman_test) H follows a χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom. H = (.0058 -
.0056)2 / ((.0018)2 – (.0016)2) = 0.059. The 0.95 critical value of the χ2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom is
3.841.

other two measures (based on the discrete ingredient vintage measures rx_post1975% and
rx_post1985%), the remainder of our analysis will be based on the rx_year measure of drug
vintage.
         The models of survival time shown in Tables 7 and 8 did not include two potentially
important behavioral risk factors—BMI and smoking—as covariates because, as discussed
earlier, data on whether or not the individual currently smokes began in 2000, and data on body
mass index began in 2001. However, we can assess whether controlling for these variables
affects our estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on survival by estimating a
model of an alternative measure of survival—the 3-year survival rate—using data on people
interviewed in 2001 and 2002. Table 9 shows estimates of four probit models of the 3-year
survival rate. The first 3 models (models 6, 7, and 8) in Table 9 are analogous to models 1-3 in
Table 7: model 6 includes the same explanatory variables as model 1, model 7 includes the same
explanatory variables as model 2, and model 8 includes the same explanatory variables as model
3. The coefficient on rx_year is positive and significant in all three models of the 3-year survival
rate, indicating that drug vintage had a positive effect on the 3-year survival rate. Controlling for
medical conditions, income, education, and other factors reduces the rx_year coefficient by less
than 15%, and the difference between the estimates of the rx_year coefficient in models 6 and 8
is not significant.25 Model 9 includes controls for smoking and BMI.26 The coefficient on
current_smoker is negative but not significant. The BMI dummy variables are jointly significant
(p-value = 0.0003), but, contrary to expectations, they indicate that overweight and obese people
had higher survival rates than people with healthy weight. However, controlling for the two
behavioral risk factors has virtually no effect on the drug vintage coefficient.27
         To summarize, when we only controlled for age, sex, and interview year, we estimated
that a one-year increase in drug vintage increases life expectancy by 0.56%. Controlling for a
much more extensive set of other attributes (the mean year the person started taking his or her


25
   The value of the Hausman H statistic is H = (.0082 - .0095)2 / ((.0040)2 – (.0032)2) = 0.29.
26
   11.1% of respondents were current smokers. The BMI distribution is: underweight (BMI < 19) 4.1%; healthy
weight (19 < BMI < 25) 34.9%; overweight (25 < BMI < 30) 36.4%; obese (30 < BMI) 24.7%.
27
   We also estimated models of the probability of surviving at least 6 years using the sample of people 65 years and
older who were interviewed during 1996-2000. In a specification including the same covariates as model 6, the
estimate of the rx_year coefficient () was .0059 (s.e. = .0019, p-value = .0017). In a specification including the
same covariates as model 7, the estimate of  was .0074 (s.e. = .0021, p-value = .0005). In a specification including
the same covariates as model 8, the estimate of  was .0067 (s.e. = .0021, p-value = .0018). The differences
between these estimates of werenot statistically significant.
                                                                                                     16


medications, and dummy variables for activity limitations, race, education, family income as a
percent of the poverty line, insurance coverage, marital status, Census region, BMI, smoking and
over 100 medical condition dummy variables) reduced the estimate of by a small amount, to
0.52%.
         As shown in Table 3, between 1996 and 2003, the mean value of rx_year increased by
6.6 years, from 1975.9 to 1982.5. The estimate of  (.0052) from model 3 in Table 7 implies that
the 1996-2003 increase in mean vintage increased life expectancy of elderly community
residents by 3.4% (= .0052 * 6.6). Sample mean life expectancy (survival time) computed from
the right-censored surv_time observations is 13.7 years, so this implies that the 1996-2003
increase in mean vintage increased life expectancy of elderly community residents by 0.47 years
(= 3.4% * 13.7 years). However sample mean life expectancy based on the 1999-2001 CDC life
table is about 15% lower (11.9 years); this estimate of mean life expectancy implies that the
1996-2003 increase in mean vintage increased life expectancy of elderly community residents by
0.41 years (= 3.4% * 11.9 years). According to CDC life tables, life expectancy at age 75
(approximately the mean age of our sample) increased from 11.1 years in 1996 to 11.7 years in
2003, so so the more conservative estimate implies that 68% of the 0.6-year increase in the life
expectancy of elderly Americans during 1996-2003 was due to the increase in drug vintage.
         Since new drugs tend to be more expensive than old drugs, the increase in drug vintage is
likely to have increased pharmaceutical expenditure, and may have increased total medical
expenditure as well. As indicated in Figure 1, we can assess the impact of pharmaceutical
innovation on medical expenditure by estimating models similar to eq. (1), in which the
dependent variable is a measure of medical expenditure rather than a survival measure. We
estimated models similar to models 1-3 in Table 7, in which the dependent variable was either
ln(rx_expendi) or ln(tot_expendi), where
   rx_expendi = prescription drug expenditure by (or on behalf of) individual i
  tot_expendi = total medical expenditure by (or on behalf of) individual i

         The estimated coefficients on rx_year in these models are shown in Table 10.
In models 10-12, the dependent variable is ln(rx_expendi). When we only control for age, sex,
and year (in model 10), the coefficient on rx_year is .034 (p-value < .0001), indicating that a 1-
year increase in mean drug vintage is associated with a 3.4% increase in prescription drug
expenditure. The rx_year coefficient is about 10% smaller in models 11 and 12, where we
                                                                                                                    17


control for other covariates. In models 13-15, the dependent variable is ln(tot_expendi). When
we only control for age, sex, and year (in model 13), the coefficient on rx_year is .0075 (p-value
< .0001), indicating that a 1-year increase in mean drug vintage is associated with a 0.8%
increase in total medical expenditure. The rx_year coefficient is about 40% smaller when we
control (in model 14) for all of the covariates except for activity limitations, and 30% smaller (in
model 15) when we also control for activity limitations. The estimates of models 12 and 15
imply that a 1-year increase in drug vintage increases pharmaceutical expenditure by 3.1%, and
total medical expenditure by 0.53%. The sample mean values of rx_expend and tot_expend were
$1014 and $6291, respectively. Therefore, the 6.6-year increase in drug vintage that occurred
between 1996 and 2003 is estimated to have increased annual drug expenditure per elderly
American by $207 (= 6.6 * 3.1% * $1014), and annual total medical expenditure per elderly
American by $218 (= 6.6 * 0.53% * $6291).
         We can use these estimates to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of
pharmaceutical innovation, defined as follows:28
ICER =  lifetime medical expenditure =  lifetime medical expenditure /  rx_year                            (3)
              life expectancy                  life expectancy /  rx_year

The effect of the 1996-2003 increase in drug vintage on (undiscounted) lifetime medical
expenditure is calculated in the Table 11. The ICER calculation in panel A of Table 11 is based
on the mean survival time computed from the right-censored surv_time observations (13.7
years). The use of newer drugs is estimated to have increased lifetime medical expenditure by
$6046, and life expectancy by 0.47 years. Therefore the ICER (cost per life-year gained) is
estimated to be $12,863 (= $6046/ 0.47).29 The ICER calculation in panel B of Table 11 is based
on sample mean life expectancy computed using the 1999-2001 CDC life table (11.9 years). In
this case, the use of newer drugs is estimated to have increased lifetime medical expenditure by



28
   This method of calculating the ICER of new drugs is similar to (albeit simpler than) the method used by Duggan
and Evans (2008) to simulate the impact of a specific drug (Epivir/PI) on long-term health care spending in the
Medicaid program. They recognized that there are two factors that diverge when calculating these costs. First, their
results indicated that average annual spending declined when these treatments were introduced. In contrast, the large
reduction in mortality generated by Epivir/PI use increased life expectancy, and hence the amount of time that
individuals were eligible for Medicaid. They built an illustrative model that allowed them to capture these two
opposing factors in a simple calculation.
29
   If we simulate the effect of a 1-year increase in drug vintage, rather than a 6.6-year increase in drug vintage, the
calculated ICER is slightly lower: $12,679.
                                                                                                               18


$5263, and life expectancy by 0.41 years. Therefore the ICER (cost per life-year gained) is
estimated to be $12,836 (= $5263/ 0.41).
        Several previous studies have provided estimates of the longevity impact and cost
effectiveness of pharmaceutical innovation. The methodologies used in these studies were very
different from the methodology used in this paper: previous studies were all based on aggregate
data rather than patient-level data, and were based on the entire populations of several countries,
not just elderly Americans. Estimates from this and previous studies of the marginal longevity
effect (d LE / d rx_year) and the ICER of pharmaceutical innovation are compared in Table 12.
In this paper we have estimated that the marginal longevity effect of pharmaceutical innovation
is in the 0.062-0.071 range (i.e., a one-year increase in drug vintage increases life expectancy by
0.062-0.071 years), and that the ICER is in the $12,836-$12,863 range. Lichtenberg and Duflos
(2008) estimated the effect of drug vintage on the mean age at death of Australians using
longitudinal disease-level data during the period 1995-2003. Their estimate of the marginal
longevity effect was 0.182, and their estimate of the ICER was $10,585. Lichtenberg (2011)
estimated the effect of drug vintage on life expectancy at birth using longitudinal U.S. state-level
data during the period 1991-2004. In that study, the estimate of the marginal longevity effect
was 0.135, and the implied estimate of the ICER was $3645.30 Lichtenberg (2012) estimated the
effect of drug vintage on life expectancy at birth using longitudinal German state-level data
during the period 2001-2007. In that study, the estimate of the marginal longevity effect was
0.208, and the implied estimate of the ICER was $16,173.31
        The mean of the estimates of the marginal longevity effect of pharmaceutical innovation
from the three previous studies is about 2.6 times as large as the estimate from this study.
However, the longevity measures used in those studies (life expectancy at birth32 or mean age at
death) were quite different from the one used here (time till death of a population whose mean
age is about 75). The mean of the estimates of the ICER of pharmaceutical innovation from the
three previous studies is fairly similar to (23% lower than) the estimate from this study.

30
   The growth in per capita medical expenditure was uncorrelated across states with the growth in drug vintage.
Therefore, eq. (3) implies that the ICER of pharmaceutical innovation is equal to per capita medical expenditure,
which was about $3645 in the population studied in Lichtenberg (2011).
31
   Lichtenberg and Duflos (2008) and Lichtenberg (2012) did not actually examine the correlation between drug
vintage and medical expenditure. Instead, they simply assumed that observed growth in per capita drug expenditure
was entirely due to pharmaceutical innovation, and that pharmaceutical innovation had no impact on non-drug
medical expenditure.
32
   Life expectancy at birth is based on the survival rates of all age groups.
                                                                                                                   19


         The four estimates of the ICER of pharmaceutical innovation are reasonably consistent
with evidence from clinical trials as reported in the CEA Registry33, a comprehensive database of
cost-utility analyses on a wide variety of diseases and treatments. A search of the registry found
(1) 545 pharmaceutical interventions that decreased cost and improved health (in which case the
ICER is negative); (2) 771 pharmaceutical interventions that increased cost and improved health
at a cost of less than $16,173 per QALY; and (3) 1481 pharmaceutical interventions that
increased cost and improved health at a cost of more than $16,173 per QALY. Therefore, our
estimate of the ICER is not very far from the median of the estimates reported in the CEA
Registry.


Summary


         This study used patient-level data to analyze the effect of technological change embodied
in pharmaceuticals on the longevity of elderly Americans. Previous patient-level studies could
not control for important patient attributes such as education, income, and race; they did not
provide estimates of the effect of using newer drugs on life expectancy, or of the overall cost-
effectiveness of new drugs relative to old drugs; and they were not based on nationally
representative samples of individuals. Our data, primarily derived from the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey and the Linked Mortality Public-use Files, enabled us to overcome those
limitations.
         We investigated the effect of the vintage (year of FDA approval) of the prescription drugs
used by an individual on his or her survival and medical expenditure, controlling for a number of
demographic characteristics and indicators and determinants of health status. When we only
controlled for age, sex, and interview year, we estimated that a one-year increase in drug vintage
increases life expectancy by 0.52%. Controlling for a much more extensive set of other
attributes (the mean year the person started taking his or her medications, and dummy variables
for activity limitations, race, education, family income as a percent of the poverty line, insurance
coverage, Census region, BMI, smoking and over 100 medical conditions) had virtually no effect
on the estimate of the effect of drug vintage on life expectancy

                                                                                                   20


        Between 1996 and 2003, the mean vintage of prescription drugs increased by 6.6 years.
This is estimated to have increased life expectancy by 0.41-0.47 years. This suggests that not
less than two-thirds of the 0.6-year increase in the life expectancy of elderly Americans during
1996-2003 was due to the increase in drug vintage. The 1996-2003 increase in drug vintage is
also estimated to have increased annual drug expenditure per elderly American by $207, and
annual total medical expenditure per elderly American by $218. This implies that the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per life-year gained) of pharmaceutical innovation was
about $12,900. This estimate of the cost per life-year gained from the use of newer drugs is a
small fraction of leading economists’ estimates of the value of (willingness to pay for) an
additional year of life. It is also consistent with estimates from clinical trials.
