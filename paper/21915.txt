Guns, Latrines, and Land Reform: Private Expectations and Public Policy

                                              ABSTRACT

Dynamically and statically optimal Pigouvian subsidies on durables will differ in a growing economy.
For durables with positive externalities, such as sanitation, statically optimal subsidies will typically
grow. However, in a dynamic game, governments can most cheaply induce optimal purchasing time
by committing to eventually reduce subsidies. If governments cannot commit, there may be multiple,
Pareto-ranked equilibria. The presence of multiple subsidizing bodies, including foreign donors, makes
commitment more difficult. As a result, consumers may actually delay purchase, rationally anticipating
growing subsidies. In the extreme, the benefits of foreign subsidies for durables that create positive
externalities may be more than fully offset by such delays in private investment. For durables with
negative externalities, such as guns, delays between the announcement and implementation of taxes
or regulation may bring forward purchase, potentially causing policymakers who would otherwise
prefer such policies to abandon them. Political actors may also be able to shape others’ policy preferences
by changing private expectations. For example, a political party that announces an intent to redistribute
land may reduce current owners' investment incentives, thus reducing the benefits of maintaining existing
property rights and making land reform more attractive to the median voter.

1    Introduction
    Standard theory suggests that governments may wish to impose Pigouvian subsidies or
taxes on goods which create externalities, such as latrines or cars. We argue that dynamically
optimal Pigouvian policies for durable goods will di¤er from statically optimal policies, since
expectations over future government subsidies, taxes, and regulatory policy on durables a¤ect
consumers’current purchase decisions.
    Consider for example, a government of a growing developing country with widespread open
defecation choosing subsidies for latrines to reduce disease transmission. Statically optimal
Pigouvian subsidies will grow over time as the economy develops, but if the government raises
subsidies over time, consumers will have incentives to delay purchases, reducing the bene…t
of the subsidy. In the extreme, delays in private investment caused by anticipated subsidy
growth may dissipate up to 100% of the private bene…ts of the transfers to the consumer, and
if the durable generates positive externalities, these delays could potentially lower welfare in
the economy relative to a counterfactual without subsidies.
    We consider the dynamic game when not only do consumer decisions depend on antici-
pated future government policy, but optimal government policy is in‡uenced by consumers’
purchase decisions for durables. We show that if the government does not have the ability
to commit, there will be multiple Pareto-rankable Markov Perfect Nash Equilibria. If the
government can commit to a future subsidy path, it can eliminate inferior equilibria. Ide-
ally it would commit to …rst instituting and then withdrawing subsidies, so as to incentivize
consumers to adopt the durable good at the socially, rather than privately, optimal date. A
government that can commit to a constant subsidy, but not a temporary subsidy, will need
to spend more to induce consumers to adopt at the socially optimal date. The problem could
potentially be addressed by subsidies on the ‡ow value of durable services or …nes for not
possessing the durable, but these policies may be di¢ cult to implement.
    Government commitment to subsidy paths may be di¢ cult in the presence of multiple
subsidy providers, such as NGOs. As outlined above, anticipation of foreign subsidies could
reduce welfare by delaying private investment. This provides a potential justi…cation for
governments wishing to regulate NGO subsidies for durables, as well a new potential rationale
for the view of many aid sceptics view that aid is not only partially dissipated in waste, but
could potentially harm the recipient population (although we are not arguing that there is
empirical evidence for this theoretical possibility.) The problem could be addressed if NGOs
subsidize non-durables rather than durables.
    The model can be extended to the case in which durables create negative externalities,
and to introduce political-economy considerations. For example, from a static perspective,
a political party that believes guns create negative externalities would want to introduce
Pigouvian taxes or regulations. However, consumers may stockpile guns between the time
the party begins campaigning for such a policy and its eventual implementation. In extreme
cases, this dynamic force may make the gun control policy counterproductive, leading the
government to abandon it altogether. To take another example, a political party that an-
nounces an intent to redistribute land as part of a land reform may reduce current owners’
incentive to invest in the land, thus reducing the bene…ts of maintaining existing property

voter.


2     Setting
2.1    Agents and structure of the game
    We consider a game with two types of agent, the individuals who purchase the durable,
e.g. a latrine, and the organisations which provide the subsidies or taxes, typically the
government. We consider two types of game: one in which the government is able to commit
at time 0 to the future path of subsidies or taxes and one in which they are not. When
the government is able to commit, at time 0 they decide their path of subsidies s(t) and
then the individual decides each period whether to buy the durable. The game is solved by
…rst solving the individuals’ decisions of whether and when to buy the durable, given the
subsidy path, and then solving the government’s decision on the optimal subsidy level, given
the individuals’ reaction functions. In reality government might be restricted to a class of
functions for s(t), so we also consider two special cases: when governments can only commit
to a constant subsidy path, and when they can commit to a path of static Pigouvian subsidies.
When the government is not able to commit, the timing of the game is that in each period
the government sets a subsidy s(t) and then individuals decide whether to buy the durable
at price p(t). We only consider Markov Perfect Nash Equilibria (MPNE) in pure strategies.
Full derivations of the results below can be found in the work paper version.

2.2    Technology, preferences and the equilibrium path of non-durable
       consumption
    We consider a closed-economy continuous time Ramsey model with exogenous technolog-
ical progress at rate g > 0, discount rate and homogeneous agents. We assume a standard
Cobb-Douglas production function in capital and labor with exogenous rate of technology
change g. Utility is quasilinear in services from the durable uIt and total spillovers from
other’s durables, uSt , which are proportional to the number of other people using the durable.
Consumption in the other goods Rhas constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution , so
                                       1
that discounted lifetime utility is 0 e t (c1t =(1        ) + uIt + uSt )dt. All prices in the paper
are in units of consumption of other goods. We are assuming that the value of the services
the durable provides, in that unit, grows with consumption growth, which we think is the
relevant case for latrines and many other examples of durables which the government might
subsidize.0 Since we assume perfect credit markets with interest rate rt , the Euler equation
tells us uu_ 0 (c
               (ct )
                  t)
                     =  rt . Being in the steady state of the Ramsey model, we have that rt is
constant and r         = g. Thus:

                                       u0 (ct ) = u0 (c0 )e   gt
                                                                                                (1)



                                                  3
   The initial consumption level will be tied down by the transversality condition so that
the NPV of total consumption (durable and not durable) equals the NPV of wealth minus
the NPV of net transfers to the government (taxes).
   We assume that the government has lexicographic preferences over social welfare and
the cost of subsidies, with social welfare being dominant. This is a simpli…cation and an
approximation to the case where government can raise funds at low cost. We initially assume
that the government can only subsidize or tax the purchase of the durable, for instance
because other types of taxes or subsidies may be too costly to implement. In a later section
we consider the case when the government has access to a wider variety of tools.

2.3    Durable good
    We assume that the durable, once installed, provides constantR ‡ow utility uL and doesn’t
                                                                    1
depreciate. Thus the present discounted utility of the durable is 0 e t uL dt = uL : Durables
also provide a total social externality uS , so that uSt = (t)uS , where (t) is the proportion
of the population who have the durable at time t. We treat the utility fron non-durables,
own durables and others’durables as separable, abstracting from potential complementarity
or substitutability. The durable is always available on the private market, assumed perfectly
competitive. It has constant price p, assumed small relative to lifetime wealth and to the
capital stock at purchase time, and assuming implicitly that the production technology grows
at the same rate, g, as technology in the rest of the economy. Due to growing consumption,
eventually everyone will buy the durable. We assume that the government o¤ers a potentially
time-varying subsidy s(t) to this price, positive or negative, where s(t) = 0 if the government
is not o¤ering subsidies at time t. The subsidy is paid for through lump-sun taxation. De…ne
p(t) = p s(t) as the price at which the agent can buy the durable at time t.


3     Consumer’s problem
    In the game with commitment, the individual knows the price path p(t) from the start. In
the general game without commitment, the individual only has beliefs over the future prices.
However in equilibrium, as we consider pure strategy MPNE, these beliefs are correct, and
hence we can also treat the consumer’s problem as if they know the price path from the start
in this case. The individual’s optimization problem, where w0 represents the net present
value of his lifetime wealth at time 0, and others purchase the durable at time t0 , is:

                                      Z    1
                                                   s                uL         t
          v(w0 ) = max(cs )s   0 ;t
                                               e       u(cs )ds +        e
                                       0
                       s:t:           w(s)
                                      _    = rw(s)             c(s)          p(t) [s = t]   s(t0 ) [s = t0 ]

     Now suppose, at t, the individual will make a …nancial outlay p(t). How much does this
cost the individual in terms of time 0 utility? It reduces net wealth to w0 e rt p(t). Now
v 0 (w0 ) = u0 (c0 ), by the envelope theorem. Thus the loss in value, assuming that e rt p(t)

                                                          4
is small enough so that the curvature of v can be ignored, is e rt p(t)u0 (c0 ). Getting the
infrastructure at time t is worth, in terms of time 0 utility, e t uL . Therefore, given price
path p(t) = p s(t), individual demand for infrastructure satis…es:

                                                              e t uL                   rt
                     t (p(t)t 0 ) = argmaxt                                      e          (p    s(t)):
                                                             u0 (c0 )

   Consider …rst the unsubsidized case, where the price is constant at p. In this case the
…rst order condition gives:

                                             uL e t
                                                      + rert p = 0:
                                             u0 (c0 )
                                                                             uL
                                        ) u0 (c0 )e          (r     )t
                                                                         =      :
                                                                             pr
                                                                      uL
                                                u0 (ct    (p) )   =      :                                                   (2)
                                                                      pr
   Implying the individually optimal purchase time, denoted t :

                                            1                     u0 (c0 )pr
                                        t := ln                                  :                                           (3)
                                             g                        uL
    Suppose the durable is o¤ered at a one-time di¤erent price at time t. Purchasing at that
time gives a change in lifetime utility from infrastructure, at time t, of uL (1 e (t t (p)) ).
Not purchasing the unsubsidized infrastructure at time t (p) also leads to a savings, in units
of time t consumption, of per(t t (p)) . Thus, denoting by wc (t) the willingness to pay for the
durable at time t rather than at price p at time t , wc (t) is as follows:

                                                         uL
           wc (t) = maxfper(t          t (p))
                                                +                (1      e    (t t (p))
                                                                                            ); 0g:
                                                        u0 (ct )
                                                                   uL
                   = maxfper(t         t (p))
                                                +                                           (1     e    (t t (p))
                                                                                                                    ); 0g:
                                                        u0 (ct (p) )e        g(t t (p))


                                             pr         g(t t (p))       p g
                       wc (t) := maxf               e                           er(t    t (p))
                                                                                                 ; 0g:                       (4)

   Now consider the case of a general subsidy. If s(t) is continuously di¤erentiable, the
equation for individual demand gives the following …rst order condition:

                             gt (p)                                                          uL
                         e            (r(p      s(t (p))) + s0 (p))) =                       0
                                                                                                    :
                                                                                            u (c0 )
   Thus s(t) has two e¤ects: t (p) decreases with its level, but increases with its slope.

4     Government’s problem
    In this section we assume that the externality is positive. Everything follows, with in-
equalities reversed, for negative externalities. The social planner’s problem is the same as
the individual’s problem, except with a utility ‡ow from infrastructure of uL + uS rather than
just uL . Hence the socially optimal time for purchase of the durable, ts , is given by:

                                                 1          u0 (c0 )pr
                                          tS =     ln                       :                              (5)
                                                 g          uL + uS

4.1    Government can commit
     Suppose …rst that the government can commit. We consider how the government can
o¤er the subsidies to get people to purchase the good at this time tS , with decreasing levels
of commitment. If the government has full control over the subsidy path, clearly the cheapest
way for them to achieve the …rst best time is to o¤er a subsidy at the socially optimal time
tS , which makes the individual indi¤erent between taking the subsidized price at tS and the
private price p at t , and to remove the subsidy immediately afterwards. Such a subsidy
satis…es p s = wc (ts ), giving:

                             pr       g(tS t (p))       p g
                 s   = p          e                            er(tS     t (p))
                                                                                  :
                                                                                  r= g

                     = p                                    :
                                uL + uS        uL + uS
                               uS       g uL             uL                                    = g

   If the government isn’t able to commit to a whole price schedule, but only to a constant
subsidy, then this subsidy sc is greater than the subsidy with full commitment s :

                                                 t (sc ) = ts :

                                                    uL + uS

4.2    Government cannot commit
    If the government isn’t able to commit upfront, they face a classic commitment problem:
individuals know that if they don’t buy at time tS then the government will wish to raise its
subsidy in the next period, since the monetary value of the externality will have increased.
In our model this results in multiple equilibria.

                                                        6
    Proposition
    The Markov Perfect Nash Equilibria in this case are all subsidy paths s(t) such that:
 0         uL
s (t)     u0 (ct )
                   r(p s(t)) 8t tS ; p s(t) wc (t) 8t 2 [tS ; t ); individuals prefer waiting
for p s(tS ) rather than buying at p s(t) 8t < tS . Such paths have subsidies which are
bounded below at tS by the outside option, and …rst best timing is achieved, but subsidies
are not bounded above at tS .
    Proof
    Strategies comprise a subsidy path s(t) for the government, and a minimal acceptance
price pmin (t) for the agents. Before tS , the government doesn’t want the individual to take
up. In the subgame after tS , the government wants the individual to take up immediately,
whatever the cost. The individual will take up immediately if the p s(t) falls at rate no
faster than g both locally and globally, and if the buying subsidized is better than waiting
to buy unsubsidized. Consider a price path such that p s(t) is falling at the maximal rate,
starting at any given s(tS ). The best response of an individual facing this path is to wait
until ts , and then buy at minimal price p s(t) in future periods. The subgame perfect best
response of the government, to this best response of an individual facing the path, is the path
itself.

4.3    Static Pigouvian subsidies
   Suppose instead the government follows static Pigouvian subsidies sp (t), whose value rises
over time: sp (t) = uu0 (c
                        S
                           t)
                              . The individual demand equation then gives:

                                            e t uL                       uS
              t ((p   sp (t))t 0 ) = argmaxt         e rt (p                     ):
                                           u0 (c0 )                     u0 (ct )
                                            e t uL                       uS
                                  = argmaxt 0        e rt (p                     e gt )
                                           u (c0 )                      u0 (c0 )
                                            e t uL + uS            rt
                                  = argmaxt 0               e           p
                                           u (c0 )
   This, unsurprisingly giving the aim of Pigouvian subsidies, is the same as the individual
optimization problem without subsidies but with private utility ‡ow uL + uS . Thus:

                                    t ((p   sp (t))t 0 ) = ts :
   This again gives the optimal time, but results in signi…cantly larger subsidy payments
than if the government could commit to a …xed subsidy level:

                                                     uS
                                   sp (ts ) =
                                                    u0 (ctS )
                                                       pruS
                                            =
                                                    (uL + uS )
                                                r
                                            =       sc > sc :                              (8)

                                                7
4.4    NGOs and durables
    The previous section assumed a single utility function for the government and a single
provider of subsidies. Without commitment the game resulted in the …rst best timing, al-
though at a higher cost. Now consider a case where either government preferences over
subsidies or their ability to provide them over time may change, for example with the elec-
tion of a new party, or a new provider of subsidies may arrive at a later date. Then agents
may expect the subsidy to rise considerably in the future, causing them to delay purchase of
the durable beyond the optimal time ts , with associated loss of welfare.
    NGOs often have preferences for subsidizing certain types of good which may di¤er from
those of the government. For example, some NGOs may consider latrines as merit goods
and wish to subsidize them heavily. NGOs’preferences may also change over time, as may
their presence in a region. However, when NGO preferences over subsidies are mis-aligned
with those of the government, their subsidizing durables may distort the purchase time of
durables, undermining the ability of the government to commit to a subsidy path.
    For a simple model of this, suppose that government is not subsidizing a durable, and
that the NGO arrives at time tN and then o¤ers constant subsidy sN . Suppose also that
the individually optimal time to buy at the subsidized price t (p sN ) < tN , so that if
the individual has waited for the subsidy then they will purchase the durable as soon as it
starts. As p sN ! wc (tN ), the willingness to pay for the durable at time tN given that
it is always available at price p, either through sN decreasing or tN increasing, all of the
individual bene…t from the subsidy is dissipated. Further, if tN > t , the optimal time to buy
the unsubsidized durable, we see that the subsidy actually delays investment in the durable,
because of expectations of future rises in the subsidy, and hence worsens externalities and
thus overall national welfare, even if the subsidy is …nanced from abroad.
    For a model which introduces uncertainty on when the NGO will arrive, assume that
starting from time tN < t , the NGO may arrive at hazard rate . If it arrives it provides
the durable for free. This modi…es the individual demand function by e¤ectively adding
to the interest rate (it also modi…es the formula for cls ). Thus, if the individual hasn’t yet
received the durable for free, the optimal time to purchase the durable is given by

                                  1        u0 (c0 )p(r + )
                              tN = ln                        >t                            (9)
                                   g               uL

   Clearly when both tN t , i.e. there is no possibility of the NGO arriving before when the
individual would have bought the unsubsidized durable without the NGO, and the externality
uS becomes large relative to the private bene…t uL , the existence of the NGO decreases social
welfare, again without even accounting for the cost of the subsidy. While delays can dissipate
up to 100% of the private value of the subsidy, they can more than fully o¤set the social
bene…t of the subsidy.
   If the government wants to ensure the …rst best time tS , it still can do so for those who
haven’t already received the durable for free before then, but since the outside option is
improved for the individual the subsidy will need to be higher. If tN tS total government
expenditure on subsidies will de…nitely be higher than in the case without NGOs.

                                              8
   The problem could be solved by NGOs …nancing non-durables, but NGOs often prefer
subsidizing durables to non-durables, believing the former to be more “sustainable”.

4.5    Tools available to government
    In the above we assumed that governments could only purchase or tax goods through the
purchase price. This is a reasonable assumption in many cases, for example such subsidies
or taxes can often be added at the factory gate or point of sale, rather than going house to
house which could be prohibitively expensive. In practice alternative tools for funding may be
available and may be more attractive Ashraf, Glaeser and Ponzetto (2016). One alternative
approach would be to tax or subsidize respectively not owning the good. Often such dual
policies are equivalent. However, when the government is able to commit to either a future
subsidy or …ne in the future, if the policy is correctly designed one will require money to pass
through governments hands whereas the other will not, particularly appealing in places of
high corruption. Namely, the subsidy o¤ered once at the …rst best time will result in take-up
then. The …ne, imposed once just after the …rst best time, will result in take-up just before
with no …nes needing to be collected. In practice such …nes might be costly to run, and hence
not credible.
    The government might also have access to a ‡ow subsidy or tax on ownership. While this
is equivalent to a stock subsidy or tax at purchase when the stock value is the net present
value of future ‡ow values, there are di¤erent implications for the ability to commit. O¤ering
the cash value of the social utility ‡ow at all periods results in …rst best timing and may
be simple to commit to. However, in many examples these ‡ows will be small relative to
collection costs, in which case such policies are unlikely to be used.
    Another policy which may help with commitment, in the case of varying subsidies, is for
the government to agree to pay the subsidies retroactively. However, such policies must be
credible, since ex-post the government would want to renege on the retroactive payment.

4.6    Decentralized government spending
    While we have so far focused on the a¤ect of expectations on private behavior, the same
mechanism can impact the public investment decisions. Namely, if local public infrastructure
investments can be made at any time by local government, but may be subsidized in the
future by national governments, then local government may forgo investment at the optimal
time in order to wait for investment from the national government. As above these delays
can dissipate all the local surplus from the national government spending, and in the case
of negative externalities, e.g. with poorly maintained highways, the national funding may
actually reduce welfare. Again this suggests a role for early commitment by the national
government to the future subsidies they will provide and under what conditions.

5     Extensions to other settings
5.1    Guns
    We now consider a case in which there is a durable with a negative externality which the
government would like to tax, but there is a delay between the announcement of the policy,
or intention to implement it, and the actual implementation of the policy. Such delays are
likely in practice, since changes to law take time, and political parties layout their policies in
manifestos before coming to power.
    The announcement of the policy will increases sales in the short term, contrary to the
aims of the government and worsening the social externality. If the time gap is su¢ ciently
long, then just as in the …rst example given above in the section on NGOs, introducing
the policy may actually reduce welfare. If the government is to introduce tax T at time
t, announcing this at time 0, the policy would reduce social welfare if the optimal time to
buy a gun is later than T, t > T , and the gain from buying a gun just before the tax
is introduced is greater than that from buying a gun at the optimal time once the gun is
introduced, uu0 (c
                L
                  t)
                      p ( u0 (ctuL(p+T ) ) (p + T ))e r(t (p+T ) t) .
    The Obama administration appears to be facing this problem. Gun sales spiked to their
highest level in two decades after the Sandy Hook shootings. The Washington Post, following
a similar spike after the San Bernadino shootings, wrote “This matches a pattern we’ve seen
plenty of times in the past: tragedy, followed by calls for gun control, followed by surging
…rearm sales.” (Ingraham (2016)). While in this case depreciation of guns, constraints in
the short term supply of guns, and credit constraints are likely to be much more important
factors than consumption growth, space constraints mean we do not develop a new model
for this setting. If a per-period tax on ownership of guns is available, as seems potentially
realistic in this case, then the problem goes away. Similarly, the problem also goes away
if the government is able to announce a tax which will be applied retroactively from the
announcement date.

5.2    Land reform
    Until now we have considered cases where expectations over future changes in optimal
government policy act against the government’s wishes. However, it is possible that the
announcement of a future policy change could be self-ful…lling, by making the status quo
less attractive. Take the example of land reform and consider a basic model of electoral
competition. The main economic justi…cation for private land holdings is that they encourage
optimal investment in the land. However, these investments are conditional on beliefs of
future ownership. Suppose a pro land reform party announces that, if elected, they will
enact extensive land reform. If they have a chance of being elected, this reduces the expected
returns to investments in land by land owners, and hence in turn reduces such investments.
However, these investments were the justi…cation for not having land reform, and so the
marginal voter shifts towards being positive towards land reform and hence so too does the
other party, if it is marginal. This makes both land reform and potentially also the election

                                               10
of the pro land reform party more likely.


6    Conclusion
    Expectations over the government’s future subsidies, taxes, and regulatory policy on
durables, such as latrines or guns, a¤ect consumers’ current purchase decisions. In turn,
consumers’ purchase decisions a¤ect optimal policy for future government. We study the
resulting dynamic game in a growing economy, arguing that dynamically optimal Pigouvian
subsidies and taxes on durables will in general di¤er from their statically optimal levels.
Governments seeking to encourage purchase of a particular durable may wish to commit to
eventually reducing subsidies so as to advance consumers’optimal purchase time. If that is
impossible, they may wish to commit to a constant level of subsidies. If governments have no
commitment power, there may be multiple equilibria, including equilibria in which consumers
delay purchase, anticipating greater government subsidies in the future, and the government
indeed raises subsidies over time as the optimal subsidy grows over time along with the
general economy. In their original paper on the bene…t of governments committing to rules,
Kydland and Prescott (1977), Kydland and Prescott give a somewhat related example in
which, without a rule prohibiting it, individuals build on ‡oodplains in the anticipation that
ex-post the government will build costly ‡ood defenses.
    The existence of multiple sources of subsidy, such as multiple layers of government, and
especially in developing country settings, foreign donors and NGOs, may make commitment
more di¢ cult. We show that in the extreme case, delays in private investment due to antici-
pated foreign NGO support may dissipate up to 100% of the private bene…ts of the transfers,
and that if the durable generates positive externalities (e.g., latrines in a setting in which
open defecation is common), anticipation of future foreign aid could potentially lower welfare
in the home economy. This implies that it may be better for NGOs to subsidize non-durables
rather than durables, and provides a potential justi…cation for governments wishing to reg-
ulate NGO subsidies for durables.
    Anticipated future taxes or regulation, for example, on guns, may encourage current
consumption, and if there are delays between announcement and implementation, this e¤ect
may be great enough to cause a government which would otherwise prefer taxes or regulation
to abandon such a policy. Finally, we discuss political economy implications, noting, for
example, that if a political party announces an intent to redistribute land, this may weaken
private investment incentives, strengthening the case for land reform.
    In a related paper, Kremer and Willis (2016), we consider the case in which infrastructure
services can be provided either through a technology with di¤erent degrees of scale economies.
For example, in developing country settings, electricity can be supplied either through the
grid or through o¤-grid solar, water can be supplied through municipal systems or wells,
and waste can be disposed of through a sewage system or through latrines. We consider a
context in which private consumers have heterogeneous wealth which lead to di¤erences in
individual optimal times to invest in infrastructure. In the absence of commitment, there may
be multiple equilibria, including equilibria in which the rich expect that the government will


                                             11
not provide infrastructure that relies on scale economies, and therefore invest early in private
infrastructure, in turn reducing incentives for the government to invest in the technology with
scale economies, and thus leading the poor to also adopt private infrastructure. To eliminate
such potentially welfare-reducing equilibria, the government may wish to commit to install
the technology with scale economies at a speci…ed future time, and if it lacks the ability
to do so, it may wish to tax private infrastructure or subsidize the technology with scale
economies. We show that greater inequality and slower growth both reduce the desirability
of the technology with scale economies, and identify the circumstances in which segregation
by wealth is more or less likely to emerge. Optimal policy also depends on the …nancing
options available to the government: imperfect price discrimination may result in a hold-up
problem and the use of other second best policies to raise revenue for the investment. We also
consider the case when public and private investments are complements (e.g., government
investments in roads in a particular area may complement private investments in constructing
apartment blocks or o¢ ce buildings.)

Appendix: Consumer problem and production side
    The consumer faces interest rate r, has initial wealth plus net present value of future
income w0 , and chooses both consumption path (cs )s 0 and when to purchase infrastructure,
t. Their problem is thus:

                                                   Z    1
                                                                 s                  uL         t
                  v(w0 ) = max(cs )s      0 ;t
                                                            e        u(cs )ds +          e
                                                    0
                               s:t:                w(s)
                                                   _    = rw(s) c(s) p(t) [s = t]
                                                        Z 1
                                                   w0 =     e rs cs ds + p(t)e rt
                                                                 0

   We can also add in the production side. Firms maximize pro…ts:

                            (t) = F (K; A(t)L)                   W (t)L         r(t)K(t)
   Where F is a constant returns to scale production function, A(t) = A(0)egt is technology,
W (t) is the wage, L is the population, and K(t) is capital. De…ne k(t) = K(t)=A(t)L
and f (k) = F (k; 1), then …rms rent capital until f 0 (k(t)) = r(t). Ignoring infrastructure
investment for the moment, this results in the dynamic system:

                             c(t)
                             _      f 0 (k(t))
                                  =
                             c(t)
                             _
                             k(t) = f (k(t)) c(t)=A(t)                              gk(t)

    We assume we are in the steady state of this system, in which c(t)  c(t)
                                                                        _            _
                                                                             = g and k(t) = 0. We
assume that capital can be freely transformed into the durable. Strictly the durable purchase
means that we are not in the steady state of the Ramsey model, since there will be a negative
shock to capital at the time of investment in the durable. This shock will result in variation
of the interest rate around it, and an anticipatory build-up of capital. However, we make
the simplifying assumption that p is su¢ ciently small compared to K(t) that we can assume
that FK (K(t); A(t)L) FK (K(t) p(t); A(t)L), and so that we can ignore variation in the
interest rate and assume that we are in the steady state of the Ramsey model.
    Returning to the consumption problem, we know, because of the constant interest rate,
that cs = c0 egs . Suppose the individual faces price path p(s) and decides to buy at time t,
while others buy at time t0 and the subsidy is paid for by lump-sum taxation. Then, we have:

   In a symmetric equilibrium, this will result in:

                                                                                      rt
                                        c0 = (r            g)(w0            pe             )
   Thus, assuming the individual follows the optimal consumption path, they face the fol-
lowing maximization problem:
                    Z

                                           ((1            )g    )(1   )
                                                                             rt0

   This gives the …rst order condition:

                                 rt               rt0

   Which is the same FOC arrived at in the main text using the envelope condition.
