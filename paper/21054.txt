Do Foreign Firm Betas Change During Cross-listing?

                                              ABSTRACT

The reaction of foreign stocks to cross-listing events has been documented in an extensive literature,
finding that the betas of these stocks change over time. In this paper, I use stock return data for foreign
companies listed on U.S. exchanges to ask whether the betas changed at all and, if so, on what date.
While betas for most of these companies indeed change over their sample, the evidence shows that
these changes arise from greater integration between their home markets and the U.S. Moreover, of
the remaining companies, the betas change significantly after, not during, the cross-listing event.

       The betas of foreign company stock returns change after the company cross-lists its stock

in the U.S. market. This nding has been documented in an extensive literature.1 Moreover,

these betas generally increase towards one, suggesting greater co-movement with the U.S.

market. Since the purpose of this literature has been to examine the e¤ects of cross-listing

events, these studies naturally condition potential changes in betas on the cross-listing date,

or in some cases, its announcement. However, the timing of any changes in betas on the U.S

market is interesting in its own right. If the betas of these rms move closer to one against

the U.S. market, then these foreign stock returns exhibit risk that is closer to the systematic

risk of the U.S. market. Moreover, the date of a change in beta indicates when the investors

come to view the risk of these companies di¤erently, a date that may be earlier or later than

the cross-listing date. For example, if the beta of a foreign rms stock against the U.S.

market increases before cross-listing, the market may already view the foreign company as

more closely aligned with a typical U.S. company even before the event.2 Alternatively, if

the beta changes after cross-listing, the market initially prices the company with less risk in

common with the U.S. market, and only changes this perspective at a later date.

       In this paper, I directly address the question: When do the foreign cross-listed company

betas change? For this purpuse, I use the history of stock return data for foreign companies

listed on U.S. exchanges at a point in time and ask whether the betas changed and, if so,

on what date. For three di¤erent company examples, Figure 1 illustrates some potential

outcomes using the empirical approach I describe below. The gures depict the estimated

     Examples include Foerster and Karolyi (1999) and Sarkissian and Schill (2009). Karolyi (2006) sur-
veys this literature. Furthermore, while this paper focuses on cross-listed stocks in the U.S. market, this
phenomenon tends to hold in other countries as well.
   2
     Baruch and Saar (2009) make a similar point about domestic rms within the U.S. They posit that these
 ms choose to list on exchanges with companies that share their risk characteristics. Sarkissian and Schill
(2004) consider a similar argument for the countries where companies choose to list.

betas over time with starred triangles to indicate con dence intervals around the break dates

and boxes to mark the cross-listing date on the exchange. Figure 1a shows the evolution of

beta for a foreign company with a cross-listing date that falls within the estimated break

date interval. By contrast, Figures 1b and 1c graph the estimated betas for a company with

break dates after and before cross-listing, respectively. Moreover, Figure 1c shows that the

estimated betas of some companies may decrease, rather than increase, over time. As such,

I also examine the evolution of beta movements.

   To investigate these break dates in the data, I study the home market weekly returns of

a set of foreign companies with stocks listed on NYSE and NASDAQ. I begin by testing for

breaks in their betas against the U.S. market using a variety of statistics. Consistent with

the literature, for most companies I reject the hypothesis that their betas against the U.S.

market have been constant over time. Using Bai and Perron (1998) break date analysis, I

then estimate the dates when these betas appear to change, leading to a striking result: the

break dates for most companies occur after cross-listing.

   A potential problem with these ndings is that the analysis presumes a stable relationship

between the returns on the U.S. market and those of the markets of the cross-listed stocks. On

the other hand, growing evidence indicates that stock markets have become more integrated

over time. Therefore, the covariances between the U.S. market and foreign markets may

have changed themselves. If so, these changes may generate apparent shifts in the betas

of foreign companies that is simply explained by their home markets. To examine this

possibility, I test for breaks between the U.S. market and the home markets of foreign cross-

listed companies, indeed revealing evidence of instability in the covariances with the US for

the majority of countries. I then evaluate the hypothesis that breaks on the company level

                                              2
are simply explained by breaks on the home country market level. This analysis leads to two

main results. (1) For roughly half of the companies that show evidence of breaks in betas,

I cannot reject the hypothesis that these breaks arise because of changes in the relationship

between their home markets and the U.S. market. (2) For the remaining companies with

betas that change independently of their home markets, these changes occur signi cantly

after the cross-listing event, as in the original analysis. Taken together, these two main

results suggest that foreign company betas appear to change either because their home

market has become more correlated with the U.S market or because U.S. investors learn

about the company over time after the cross-listing.

   I next examine characteristics of the companies that experience changes in their betas

independent of any integration between their home markets and the U.S. market. For this

purpose, I study their cross-sectional relationships using logistical regressions to explain the

di¤erent timing of break behavior. This analysis shows that older companies tend to have

breaks at di¤erent times than their home markets. Moreover, breaks are more likely to occur

signi cantly after the cross-listing date, rather than during or after. Also those companies

with breaks signi cantly after their cross-listing dates are more likely to have home markets

in North America. Inspecting some examples suggests that these companies coming from

North America and, Canada in particular, have a longer history with the U.S. market. As a

result, they mirror the pattern of integration with the U.S.

   These results are based upon the timing of the changes in betas and not the direction of

the changes themselves. However, much of the literature nds that the betas against the U.S.

market have tended to increase over time. As a robustness check on the analysis, therefore,

I examine the estimated behavior of the cross-section of betas against the U.S. I nd that

                                               3
these betas typically increase over time, consistent with the literature.

       This paper is directly related to the literature on cross-listed companies, as noted above.

The results in this paper are also related to those from studies of break-dates in market-

level stock returns. For example, Bekaert, Harvey, and Lumsdaine (2002) use the Bai-Perron

estimator to test for breaks in asset pricing relationships to date the implicit liberalization

events for some emerging market economies. However, the analysis in this paper considers all

foreign countries that have U.S. listed stocks, and as such, emerging market countries in my

sample are a minority.3 Furthermore, Bekaert, Harvey, and Lumsdaine (2002) study breaks

in market index returns while I do so at the individual company level. To my knowledge,

this paper is the rst to analyze the potential for asset pricing breaks for a large number of

individual stocks.

       The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 describes the empirical framework and re-

ports the initial break-date results. Section 2 considers the impact on these results due

to shifts in the relationship between home country returns and U.S. returns. It also de-

scribes characteristics of companies according to the timing of their listing versus break

dates. Section 3 provides evidence on the estimated betas over time and other robustness

checks. Section 4 provides concluding remarks. Details of the data, the analysis and further

robustness checks can be found in the on-line appendices.
   3
    As a robustness check, I show in the appendix that my estimated break dates are comparable with those
of Bekaert, Harvey and Lumbdaine (2002) for the subset of emerging markets and sample periods that we
have in common.

1       Cross-listing Firm Break Dates

This section provides the groundwork for the analysis on foreign rm break dates. It begins

by describing the data and the basic empirical framework used to evaluate the returns of

cross-listed companies. I then report the estimated dates for changes in betas.



1.1     Data

Determining the date when foreign stock return betas change requires a set of foreign com-

pany returns with a su¢cient history after U.S. cross-listing to analyze any potential changes.

For this purpose, I choose weekly returns on foreign companies that are listed on the NYSE

and NASDAQ in July 2004. Exchange-traded foreign companies are targeted because these

stocks are the most liquid and comprise most of the trading volume of cross-listed stocks.4

In addition, July 2004 is picked as the inclusion date since it implies at least ve years of

data before the nancial crisis.5 Overall then, the time period begins either at January 1970

or at the earliest date of availability and ends in October 2009. Notably, the set of stocks

after 2004 is relatively stable since less than 1% of companies in this sample were delisted

by the end of the sample. All return series are measured in US dollars to represent the value

from the point of view of a US investor. Companies without a return series history in their

home markets or with insu¢cient numbers of observations were excluded.6 The number of
    4
      In 2004, the market value of foreign stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ together comprised 98% of
the total market value across public exchanges. At the 2000 peak of NASDAQ, the foreign companies hit a
maximum of 27% of this total. Thus, the companies listed on NYSE comprise most of the foreign market cap
in the US. In 2004, only 10 foreign companies were traded on the AMEX and I exclude them for expositional
clarity.
    5
      Similarly, Sarkissian and Schill (2009) choose 1999 because they focus upon long run returns after cross-
listing up to ten years. Sarkissian and Schill (forthcoming) also consider foreign listings in all world stock
exchanges in 2003 and 2006.
    6
      Companies that did not have a return series prior to listing in the U.S. generally had China as their
home country.


                                                      5
companies after applying these lters is 576. I use the Data Stream Total Return indices and

Total Market Return indices to calculate the company returns and the market index returns,

respectively. All returns are transformed into excess returns by subtracting the weekly T-bill

rate. Finally, cross-listing dates are measured by the date when the company was listed on

the current exchange, either the NYSE or NASDAQ.7

       Table 1 provides summary information about this data set. Panel A reports on the break-

down of rms across exchanges. NYSE has 380 foreign companies with home markets in 39

di¤erent countries. By contrast, 196 foreign companies that are domiciled in 28 countries

list on NASDAQ. The total number of foreign countries represented on the two exchanges is

42.8 Finally, Panel A shows that the foreign companies listed on NYSE are generally older

than those on NASDAQ. The average number of observations across rms on the NYSE is

1092, or about 21 years, while that same average across rms on NASDAQ is 862, or about

17 years.

       Panel B of Table 1 breaks down the information by the home country of the company.

The rst column gives the date at which the market index data begin for each country,

ranging from January 2, 1970 for Switzerland to June 24, 1994 for Portugal. The columns to

the right provide more information about the composition of the foreign company presence

on each exchange. The home country with the largest number of cross-listed companies is

Canada, followed by the United Kingdom. Emerging markets generally have the fewest for-

eign companies on the exchanges. Moreover, the average number of observations from these
   7
    Note that this identifying assumption potentially biases the listing date to be late since some companies
may have set up an ADR program in the U.S. earlier on another exchange. Therefore, this assumption biases
my results against the nding below that cross-listing tends to occur before the break date.
  8
    There are three foreign countries represented on NASDAQ but not NYSE: Malaysia, Singapore, and
Sweden.



                                                     6
foreign companies is generally lower. For example, the Phillipines has only two companies

on the NYSE and one company on NASDAQ, and across these three companies the average

number of weekly observations is 411 or about 8 years.



1.2       Asset Pricing Framework

Standard factor pricing models used in the literature on international stock returns typically

relate excess company returns to a set of factors. The cross-listing literature often uses a

one or two factor version of this model as the benchmark for conducting event studies as

described by Karolyi (2006). For example, Sarkissian and Schill (2009) examine the e¤ects

of cross-listings by rms around the world using market models of the following two forms.9

The rst form is the standard closed economy CAPM given by:


                                                                i` `
                                              rti` =   i`
                                                            +     rt   + ei`
                                                                          t                          (1)



where rti` is the return on the equity of company i with home market in country ` at date t in

                                     i`
excess of the risk free rate,             is a constant parameter, rt` is the home market return of the
                                i`
cross-listed company and             is a factor loading on that market return. Since all the analysis

below requires excess returns, these variables are simply called "returns" throughout the rest

of the paper.

       The second form is a two factor model that depends upon both the companys home

market and the cross-listed market, in this case, the U.S. This version can then be written
   9
    Sarkissian and Schill (2009) also consider a third model that substitutes the world market return for
the foreign market. Preliminary estimates based upon the world market instead of the US market implied
similar results to those reported below.




                                                            7
as:
                                                     i` `       iu u
                                   rti` =   i`
                                                 +     rt   +     rt   + ei`
                                                                          t                          (2)


where now the company i stock return is also a¤ected by the U.S. market return, rtu , according
                                  iu 10
to its beta against the U.S.,       .



1.3       Parameter and Break-date Estimator

As noted in the introduction, studies of cross-listing events have considered shifts in pricing

parameters at the time of cross-listing, typically nding signi cant changes. Therefore, I

require an empirical strategy that allows the factor loading parameters to shift discretely on

given dates. But I also need a framework that does not force the shift to occur at a point

in time or even at all. For this purpose, the analysis below uses the break date estimator

developed by Bai and Perron (BP) (1998), an estimator designed to detect points in the time

series when the parameters are most likely to have changed.11

       The BP estimator requires specifying a maximum number of breaks in the parameters. I

assume for expositional purposes that the number of breaks is simply given as m, although

this number will be estimated in the empirical analysis below. Also, to economize on notation

for this description, I subsume the rm superscripts and rewrite the asset pricing relationship
  10
      While the cross-listing literature has focused upon the parsimonious two factor model, there may be
more factors that are important for explaining international stock returns. For example, Karolyi and Wu
(2012) examine a multi-factor model of international returns but nd the importance of a hybrid model
that depends upon "global" and "local" factors. Similarly, Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang (2009) show that
a factor model that includes additional global and local Fama-French factors best explains the returns of
companies that comprise the MSCI World Index. The appendix describes the e¤ects of industry factors on
some of the analysis in this paper.
   11
      The estimator can also be interpreted as a more gradual change in parameters that cumulates into a
signi cant change at a given time. See Bai and Perron (2003a).




                                                      8
generally as:

                                                  rt =  0 ft + et                                          (3)


where rt is the asset return series, et is the residual,  is the parameter vector and ft is a

vector of factors rewritten to include a constant as the rst factor. Clearly, the speci cations

in equations (1) and (2) can be written within this general framework.

    Consider now m potential shifts in the parameter vector , so that the model in equation

(3) can be rewritten as:

                                                rt =   ft + et;                                         (4)


where   is a xed parameter vector for each period  ,  = 1; :::; m + 1 on the intervals

implied by: t = f1; :::; T1 ; T1 + 1; :::; T2 ; T2 + 1; :::; T3 ; :::; Tm ; :::; T g for T0 = 0 and Tm+1 = T .

For instance,  = 1 corresponds to the subperiod t = 1; :::; T1 ,  = 2 corresponds to the

subperiod t = T1 + 1; ::; T2 , etc. Similarly, et; is the residual vector corresponding to these

subperiods. Note that the constant parameter model in equation (3) is a special case of

equation (4) where m = 0 and thereby  = 1 corresponds to the full sample t = 1; :::; T .

    Bai and Perron (1998) show that unknown breakpoints can be estimated consistently by

minimizing over the sum of squared residuals for all possible partitions of the data into m + 1

di¤erent intervals. In other words, T1 ; T2 ; :::; Tm can be consistently estimated by solving the

following minimization:

                                                2    0                                              13
                n                    o           m+1
                                                  X                    P
                 Tb1 ; Tb2 ; :::; Tbm = arg min 4    @                                [rt     ft ]2 A5   (5)
                                       T1 ;T2 ;:::;Tm          t2fT( 1) ;:::;T g
                                                         =1



Bai and Perron (1998) also derive the limiting distribution of these break point estimates


                                                          9
including con dence intervals on the breakpoint estimates.

    While the estimation of the break dates requires minimizing the sum of squared residuals

for all possible m partitions of the data, Bai and Perron (2003b) show that the estimator can

have poor properties when the minimal length of the partition becomes too small. The reason

is intuitively clear  ner partitions of the intervals imply fewer observations and, therefore,

less precise estimates. Bai and Perron (2003b) propose constraining the minimal length

of any partition segment used to calculate the sum of squares in the argmin calculation

in equation (5). They de ne this minimal length as h  min(Tb(                     1)   + 1; ; ; Tb ) 8 and

specify the parameter as proportional to the total sample size.                  That is, they de ne a

percentage trimming constraint " to construct the minimal interval length: " = h=T .

Moreover, Bai and Perron (2003a) describe the properties of various break tests against

di¤erent alternatives. The limiting distribution of these tests depends upon the proportion

of the minimal subinterval, measured by ".                Further, as the Monte Carlo studies of Bai

and Perron (2003a,b) suggest, assuming partitions that are too small can over-estimate the

number of breaks. Therefore, to be conservative, I report the estimates assuming " is 15%

of the sample.12
   12
      In Monte Carlo simulations, Bai and Perron (2003a,b) nd that the maximal value of m for  = 0:15
is 5. Since m is 4 or less in all the analysis in this paper, my choice of " appears relatively conservative.
Nevertheless, the appendix describes some sensitivity analysis with " as low as 5%.

1.4     Parameter and Break Date Implementation

To implement this estimator for cross-listed stock returns, I rst rewrite the two-factor model

in equation (2) in the form of equation (4) yielding:


                                                   i` `              iu u

for each subperiod  is given by:  i =          i`
                                                  ;
                                                       i`
                                                       ;

    Based upon equation (6), I conduct the following analysis for each company stock return

i. I rst test for the number of breaks, mi . I then search over all possible combinations

of the break dates in order to minimize the sum of squares as given by equation (5). This
                                                n                  o

minimization generates estimates of break dates: T1 ; T2 ; :::; Tm and the corresponding set

of parameter vectors,  i .

    Note that since I conduct analysis on each stock return series separately, the number of

parameter shifts, mi , di¤er by company. This analysis also includes as a possibility that

mi = 0; that is, no breaks. Moreover, the variance of the residual is not restricted to be

the same over subperiods. Indeed, the variance will generally change over subperiods and

across countries. In the empirical estimates below, the standard errors are also corrected as

in White (1980) and Andrews (1991) for general conditional heteroskedasticity.



1.5     Initial Results: Number of Breaks

I   rst estimate the number of breaks in equation (6) for each company. Although the

number of estimated breaks di¤er across companies, I subsume the dependence on the rm

                                                       11
i for parsimony and simply refer to the number of breaks as m below. Using this estimated

number of breaks, I then estimate the asset pricing equation by company. Table 2 reports

the results of break-date tests for each of the company return regressions.

   The results in Table 2, Panel A demonstrate that breaks in the relationship between the

company returns and the market returns are important. The rst three columns report the

proportions of the companies rejecting the hypothesis of no breaks versus m breaks using the

so-called sup F test. This tests nds the highest F test for m breaks by considering all the

di¤erent partitions of subsamples as given in equation (5), subject to the minimum length

restriction, h. The rst column of Table 2A shows that the hypothesis of no break against

the alternative of at least one break is rejected for 77.1% of the companies at a 5% marginal

signi cance level (MSL) and even 67.6% at a 1% marginal signi cance level. As the second

and third columns show, these proportions generally become higher when allowing for even

more breaks

   While Bai and Perron (2003a,b) advocate using the supF test with given numbers of

breaks, they acknowledge that there are circumstances in which the results might be decep-

tive. For example, for a regime switching model in which the parameters switch back to

an initial regime, the test will underestimate the number of breaks. For this reason, they

also suggest testing the hypothesis of no breaks against an unknown number of breaks. The

last two columns of Panels A report the proportion of companies with stock returns that

reject this hypothesis using two versions of the double maximum test. The WD Max

test weights the tests of individual breaks such that the marginal p-values are equal across

values of m. By contrast, the UD Max test weights all values of m equally. Again, the

table shows the proportion of companies with returns that reject the hypothesis of no break

                                             12
is signi cantly higher than the 5% or 1% MSL used in the test.

       Panel B of Table 2 provides summary evidence for the sequential supF test given by

MSLs of 5% and 1%. In this test, a sequential procedure estimates each break one at a

time, and estimation stops when the sup F ( + 1j ) test is no longer signi cant at the given

marginal signi cance level. To identify m, I conduct sequential SupF tests for each company,

allowing up to four subperiods.13 The rst column of Panel B reports the proportion of the

companies that reject the hypothesis of zero breaks. The last three columns of Panel B report

the proportion of companies that show evidence of one break, two breaks and three breaks,

respectively, in their stock returns. Companies with one break make up the majority of the

cases ranging from about 55% at 5% MSL to 63% at 1% MSL. The number of companies

with evidence of 3 breaks is smaller at only 11% or 6%.

       Table 2, Panel C shows how the number of breaks evolve over ve year subsamples of the

time series, using the results based upon the MSL of 5% alone for parsimony. The fewest

number of breaks are before 1980 at only 21 estimated breaks while the ve year interval with

the largest number of breaks is during 2000-2005 at 277. However, there are more foreign

companies in existence as time increases. Therefore, in the row "Share of Companies," Panel

C also reports the share of total companies exhibiting breaks. As the table shows, the largest

percentage of companies with estimated breaks is also the 2000-2005 period although the

lowest share is during 1990-1995 at 14%.

       Table 2, Panel D reports some summary information about the companies that reject the

hypothesis of No Breaks at the 5% MSL. I call these companies "Breakers" and those that
  13
   As will be shown below, the company returns show little evidence of more than three breaks anyway, so
imposing this maximum number of breaks seems fairly unrestrictive.




                                                  13
do not reject the hypothesis "Non-Breakers." The rst column shows that the proportion of

"Breakers" among the Developed countries at 76.2% are about the same as the proportion

among the Emerging countries at 79.4%. On the other hand, Breakers tend to be somewhat

older at 1,063 weeks and have a larger market cap at about 8.3 billion dollars.



1.6    Initial Results: Break Dates Versus Cross-listing Dates

I next compare the break date estimates to each companys U.S. exchange listing date. These

companies are then sorted according to whether their cross-listing date was before the rst

Break ("< Break 1"), within the con dence interval of the rst break ("=Break 1"), after the

 rst Break (">Break 1"), within the con dence interval of the second break, if any ("=Break

2"), after the second break, if any ("> Break 2"), and after or during the third break, if

any ("  Break 3.") Table 2 Panel C reports information about the sorted rms under these

headings, respectively.

   Several patterns emerge. First, the initial line labeled "Total Share" shows that 66% of

the "Breakers" have a cross-listing date that occurs before the rst break con dence interval.

Second, the proportion of companies with cross-listing dates before the rst break date is

similar for companies domiciled in Developed and Emerging countries at 49% and 56%,

respectively. Third, the rms with cross-listing dates before the rst break date tend to be

younger with an average age of 886 weeks.

   Figure 2 summarizes these relationships by combining the proportion of rms into three

groups: (a) those with cross-listing dates before the rst break, (b) those with cross-listings

within a con dence band of any of the three breaks, and (c) those with cross-listing after any



                                             14
of the three breaks. Figure 2a depicts the proportion for companies with home markets in

Developed countries as well as those from Emerging countries. Figure 2b provides the same

information but for the proportion of companies with home markets sorted by continents.

The highest proportion of companies with cross-listing dates before the rst break come from

South America, while the lowest proportion are domiciled in Oceania. By contrast, over 20%

of cross-listed companies from Oceania show evidence of breaks during cross-listing.

      Overall, the initial evidence suggests that the majority of the foreign companies with

cross-listed stocks had return betas against the United States market that changed during

their history. Of these companies, roughly two-thirds cross-listed their stocks in the U.S.

before the rst estimated break date. However, this analysis presumes that the relationship

between the U.S. market and the companies respective home markets are stable over time.

I consider the potential impact of this assumption in the next section.




2       The Impact of Changing Country Market Betas

Understanding the company beta estimates is complicated by the relationship between re-

turns at the aggregate level between the U.S. and the foreign company stock markets.

Clearly, the two factor model presumes a stable relationship between the U.S. and foreign

markets. By contrast, a number of studies have found that the relationships between market

indices have changed over time. For example, time-variation in betas of emerging market

indices relative to the world has been used to understand liberalization.14 Even among de-

veloped countries, there is growing evidence of changing patterns of co-movement in market
 14
      For example, see Bonser-Neal, et al (1990), Bekaert and Harvey (1997,2000), and Henry (2000).

returns, suggesting greater integration.15

       These changing patterns of betas across country-level market returns can potentially gen-

erate instability between foreign company returns and the U.S. market, even if the company

returns are stable relative to each market. To see why, recall that the equation for foreign com-
                                                                                                        i` `     iu u

approach often used to capture the joint behavior of markets is a standard world CAPM.16

This approach relates country market returns to a world market similar to the CAPM rela-

tionship in equation (1) between company returns and their respective home market. Thus,

according to this world CAPM, country market returns are related according to:


                                                                       ` u

where here the world market return has been substituted out using the world CAPM for the

U.S. market return.17 Further substituting the country relationship in equation (7) into the

company return framework in equation (2) implies:

     This equation obtains by specifying each countrys return as a CAPM against the world market and
then substituting out the world return using the US market return equation.

the foreign markets and the US market change over time,                                          will vary. In this case, the
                                                                                                                   i`          iu
dependence of company returns on the U.S. will appear to be unstable even if                                            and

are constant over time.

      Therefore, in this section, I begin by testing for parameter stability between the returns

of foreign markets and the US given by equation (7). I then estimate any breaks in this

relationship, allowing for possible parameter shifts as above. This modi cation gives:


                                                             ` u

where the subscript & denotes subperiods with stable parameters between the country market

returns. Note that these subperiods may di¤er from the company level subperiods indexed by

 . As a result, I also test for whether the break dates in the country market return relation-

ships correspond to those of the company return relationships. That is, I test for the stability

including any potential changes in                               . Finally, this section studies the characteristics of any

remaining companies with unstable company betas.



2.1       Country Market Results: Break Date Estimates

Table 3 reports the results of break tests based upon the country regressions in equation

(9). The results in Panel A indeed suggest that breaks in the relationship between the US

and foreign markets are important. The rst three columns report the proportions of the

                                                                           17
42 country index returns that reject the hypothesis of no breaks versus the hypothesis of m

breaks using the sup F test. The rst column of Table 3A shows that the hypothesis of

no break against the alternative of at least one break is rejected for 85:7% of the country

indices at a 5% marginal signi cance level and for 81% of the countries at a 1% marginal

signi cance level. These proportions generally become higher when allowing for m = 2 and

m = 3, respectively. The last two columns of Panels A report the proportion of countries

that rejected this hypothesis using the WD Max and the UD Max test. Overall, the

proportion of countries that reject the hypothesis of no break ranges from 78:6% to 90:5%.

       Panel B of Table 3 summarizes the distribution of the number of breaks estimated for

each country using sequential SupF test at the 5%, and 1% MSLs. The rst column of Panel

B reports the proportion of the countries that rejected the hypothesis of zero breaks while

the last three columns of Panel B report the proportion of countries that show evidence of

one break, two breaks and three breaks. Countries with one break make up the majority of

the cases ranging from 75% at 5% MSL to 85% at 1% MSL. By contrast, only 8% and 3%

of the countries show evidence of having three breaks at a 5% and 1% MSL, respectively.

       I next estimate the break date equations for each country return series. Figure 3a plots

the break-point estimates for each year by country along with its con dence intervals for

the 5% marginal signi cance case. The con dence interval for each country excludes the

upper and lower 5% of the estimated break date distribution. The gure shows two main

relationships. First, except for a few notable exceptions, the con dence intervals around

the breaks are contained within two to three years.19 Second, most of the breaks occur in
  19
    Exceptions are the breaks in the late 1970s to early 1980s of Denmark and Ireland and the single break
for Taiwan in the 2000s. For countries with more than one break, subsequent break dates are generally more
tightly estimated.

the early 2000s. Indeed, the peak of the frequency distribution occurs around 2004. The

high proportion of breaks in the latter period is consistent with the view that changes in

integration have been more recent for most countries. I show in Section 3 that the direction

of the parameter changes correspond to greater co-movement across countries.



2.2       Are Company Returns Explained by Country Market Changes?

I now return to the company-level asset pricing relationship to determine whether the insta-

bility in the country-level market returns can explain the apparent shifts in company stock

return betas found above. Substituting the shifting country return process rt` from (9) into

the company return in (2) implies:

                                                                                                   t and where, as above, &


indexes the subinterval in which foreign market indices are stable against the US market

return. This equation shows that even if the betas of the foreign stocks on the local market,
 i`                                   iu
      , and the U.S. market,               , are not time-varying, an estimate of the parameters in a

regression of foreign stocks on the US market, bi` , would be. This time-variation results

                                                                                                   `         `
from the shifting factor loadings of the local market on the US,                                   &   and   &.


      To consider whether there are shifts in the relationship between cross-listed stocks and

the US market beyond those induced by market level changes, I implement the following

two steps. First, I constrain the parameters in the company return equations (10) using the

                                                                        19
estimated parameters of the home country in equation (9), and test whether there are any

additional breaks using the sequential sup(F) tests.20 If rejected, I next ask whether the

rejection arises from instability in local betas or US betas.

       Table 4 reports summary statistics of foreign market breaks and company tests con-

ditioned on these breaks. Panel A of the table provides a summary of the number and

proportion of rms that are domiciled in countries with One Break (m = 1), Two Breaks

(m = 2), and Three Breaks (m = 3). The nal column labeled "All" shows the proportion

of rms with home markets that reject stable parameters for m  1. Since this proportion

is about 95%, only about 5% of the rms come from countries with no evidence of structual

instability against the US. Another 62% come from countries with one break, while only

9% of the rms come from countries that show evidence of two breaks. On the other hand,

24% of the rms come from countries with three breaks. This latter result is largely due to

Canada which has the largest number of foreign companies in the US, but also has three

breaks, potentially arising from its longer process of integration with the US.

       Panel B of Table 4 shows the results of the test for breaks in the company stock returns

after conditioning on any country breaks. In particular, the table reports the proportion of

 rms that reject the sequential sup(F) test for breaks after conditioning on the estimated

                                   `         `
market return parameters,          &   and   &.   Strikingly, the column labeled No Breaks indicates

that 277 rms or about 49% of the rms did not show evidence of breaks beyond the country

level. This number only includes the rms that previously rejected constancy out of the total.

As such, it represents a lower bound on the number of rms with no break.
  20
    By conditioning the estimation on the rst stage country regression parameter estimates, this second
stage may su¤er from a generated regressions problem that will understate the true standard errors thereby
potentially biasing the Wald tests toward rejection. To mitigate this possibility, I allow for general conditional
heteroskedasticity in the Wald tests.


                                                       20
   The remaining three columns of Table 4 B show that the returns from those rms that did

reject the hypothesis of no additional breaks appeared to have only one break. In particular,

data from 231 rms could not reject the hypothesis of more than one break while 55 rms

appeared to have two breaks. The returns from only about 1% of the rms indicated three

breaks beyond the country level.

   For the rms rejecting no parameter instability beyond the country level, Panel C exam-

ines the source of instability. Using the de nition for the estimated parameters in equation
                                                                             i`    iu
(10), I identify the rm level parameters over the country subintervals as:    & ;   &    and then

test a series of Wald tests for each rm. The rst two columns report the number of rejec-

tions of the hypotheses that each of the two betas are zero for each stock. If the beta on
                                            i`
the companys home market is zero, i.e.,    &    = 0, then there is no local e¤ect on the stock
                                                                                          iu
return during the period. Alternatively, when the beta on the US market is zero,          &    = 0,

the stock depends only on the home market e¤ects. In this case, the return from company i

depends upon the US market return only indirectly through its beta with the home market,
 i` `
    &,   since its home stock market in turn depends upon the US stock market.

   As the rst two columns of Panel C show, the zero beta restriction is rejected for both

the local and US betas for most of the rms. However, the proportion of those rejections

di¤er markedly.     About 85% of the rms reject the zero local beta e¤ect while only 58%

of the rms reject the zero US beta e¤ect. The same pattern carries over to the next two

columns that report tests for the hypothesis that local and US e¤ects are constant over the

sub-periods. Sixty-three percent of the rms reject the hypothesis that the local e¤ects are

constant over time while 44% of the rms reject the test that US e¤ects are stable.



                                                 21
2.3    Company Break Dates After Conditioning on Country Breaks

Since about half of the companies exhibit additional parameter instability after conditioning

on changes in the home market, I estimate the independent break dates for these companies

using equation (10) while constraining the market level process to follow equation (9) The

appendix provides details of this estimation.

   These break date estimates and their con dence intervals are plotted in Figure 3b, where

the rms are arrayed according to the rm with the earliest rst break through the rm with

the latest rst break date. Generally, the dates are tightly estimated within one to three

years as with the country estimates. However, there are some outliers when these intervals

exceed eight years.

   The rst column of Panel D of Table 4 summarizes information about the companies

that show evidence of independent breaks, "Breakers," compared to those that did not,

"Non-Breakers." Strikingly, the pattern observed in Table 2 for the unconditional results is

essentially reversed. "Breakers" now account for only about 28% while "Non-Breakers" are

in the majority at about 72%. This new pattern arises because the roughly half of rms that

now show no evidence of breaks beyond their home market become "Non-Breakers" and are

added to the initial "Non-Breaker" companies from Table 2.

   On the other hand, the relationships between cross-listing dates remain or become even

more pronounced. Now over 70% of the companies that do show evidence of breaks cross-list

before the breakdate. Furthermore, these patterns are extremely similar for Developed and

Emerging markets. Also, the tendency for the "Breakers" to be older and have higher market

cap remains. As in Table 2, most of the companies cross-listed before the rst break and are



                                                22
younger than companies that cross-listed during or after the rst break date.



2.4    Characteristics of Companies: Breaks and Cross-listing Dates

These results naturally raise important questions: What features characterize the new

"Breaker" companies that exhibit instability beyond their country market breaks? Moreover,

what are the features of those that have breaks signi cantly after their cross-listing events?

To answer these questions, I estimate logistic regressions across companies.

   Table 5 reports the results of binomial logistic regressions of Breaker versus non-Breaker

companies. For explanatory variables, these regressions use the logarithms of rm age and

of the average market cap over time as well as dummies for whether the home country is an

emerging market or North America.

   Panel A shows the results treating the dependent variable as a dummy if the company

had a break after conditioning on country breaks. The columns show versions of the logit

regression excluding various dummies. In all cases, the constant is signi cantly negative,

demonstrating the tendency for rms to show no evidence of breaks beyond those at the

country level. Moreover, in all cases, the coe¢cient is positive on age and signi cantly so for

some speci cations. This nding suggests that older rms generally come from developed

markets and also have a longer history so that they are less likely to have breaks that corre-

spond to their home markets. Therefore, to consider the e¤ects of developed versus emerging

markets, Column 2 shows results for a speci cation with a dummy for emerging markets.

The negative coe¢cient for emerging markets indeed indicates that companies from these

markets are less likely to exhibit breaks other than those of their home countries. However,



                                              23
this coe¢cient is insigni cantly di¤erent from zero. Similarly, Column 3 demonstrates that

North American rms are signi cantly less likely to have breaks. To investigate this rela-

tionship further, the following columns report estimates for Canada and Mexico separately.

As the evidence shows, companies from both countries are less likely to show changing betas

beyond the country level. However, this e¤ect is only signi cant for Mexican companies.

   Why are North American companies less likely to have beta that shift independently from

their home markets? The answer appears to di¤er depending upon the country. For Mexico,

Figure 2b shows that the estimated break in its relationship with the US market occurred

relatively late, at around 2004. Leading up to this year, there were several commercial

and nancial deregulation policy changes as well as increased privatization. As a result,

the Mexican stock market capitalization incrased by 23% in 2005 and 44% were held by

foreign investors. At around the same time, many Mexican companies that were cross-listed

also began to co-move more closely with the U.S. market. Since both the general Mexican

market and the Mexican cross-listed stocks became more integrated at the same time, these

companies were less likely to show evidence of breaking at di¤erent times.

   In contrast to Mexico, Canadian companies have had a longer history of integration

with the United States. As Figure 2b shows, there are three estimated break dates be-

tween Canada and the U.S., the rst one as early as the 1970s. It is therefore more likely

that changes in Canadian company asset pricing relationships materialize during the overall

changes in the Canadian market.

   These results do not explain characteristics of rms that break after cross-listing, however.

To address this issue, I next omit the rms that show no evidence of breaks and condition

on the new "Breakers." Panel B reports the results of multinomial logit regressions for the

                                              24
likelihood that the "Breaker" companies cross-listed before the rst break, during one of the

breaks, or after the rst break. The omitted case is the latter so that the coe¢cients reect

the odds relative to cross-listing after the rst break. In all cases, Panel B shows that the

constant coe¢cient for the odds that a rm will cross-list before the rst break is positive

and signi cant at the 95% level, reecting the earlier nding that rms tend to have breaks

in beta signi cantly after cross-listing. Moreover, in all the regressions, age is signi cantly

negative for the odds that cross-listing is before the breaks. That is, younger "Breaker" rms

are more likely to have breaks after cross-listing.

   Column 2 of Table 5B shows that companies from emerging markets are less likely to

cross-list before the break and more likely to cross-list during the break with negative and

positive coe¢cients, respectively. However, in neither case are the coe¢cients signi cant.

   Previously in Panel A, I found that North American rms are less likely to have breaks

beyond those at the country level and therefore become "Breakers." For those North Amer-

ican companies that do become "Breakers," however, I include a dummy in the multinomial

logit regressions. The results are reported in Column 3 in Table 5B. Notably, the coe¢cients

are signi cantly positive indicating that these North American rms are signi cantly more

likely to cross-list before the rst company beta break. To see if the results are sensitive

to the Mexican rms, the nal columns report results including only the Canadian rms.

In this case, the coe¢cients are very similar to the overall North American results. Since

only ve companies from Mexico indicate changing betas beyond the country level and all of

these cross-list before their break-dates, the Mexican companies only reinforce the Canadian

company ndings.

   Overall, the results in Table 5 indicate that companies that are younger or are from North

                                              25
American tend to have breaks in their relationship with the US that coincide with those of

their home markets. North American company breaks appear to move more closely with the

general integration patterns of their home markets, consistent with the general proximity

to the US, both geographically and through trade patterns. On the other hand, for those

minority of companies that do exhibit breaks that di¤er from their home markets, on-average

these individual breaks occur signi cantly after the cross-listing date. For these companies,

it appears that investors take some time to recognize them. Interestingly, the characteristics

of companies with these delayed beta responses tend to be opposite of the characteristics

of companies that are "Breakers" to begin with. That is, younger companies are less likely

to have breaks that do not coincide with country breaks (Panel A), but of those that do,

they are more likely to cross-list before their breaks (Panel B). Similarly, North American

companies are less likely to have breaks not explained by the general relationship between

the US and Canadian or Mexican markets (Panel A). However, of those companies that do

show individual breaks, they are more likely to have cross-listed before the individual breaks.

In the next subsection, I consider some examples of this behavior.



2.5    Company Examples

To get a sense of the range of results by company described above, I show some more

detailed information for some company examples. For these examples, Table 6 reports their

cross-listing dates, estimated break dates and those of their home countries. The top panel

highlights some companies with breaks that are explained by the country breaks. Canada

has had a long history of cross-listing in the US along with the most number of breaks. So



                                              26
even though Canadian companies tend to have breaks against the U.S. market, they tend to

correspond to the same timing as general Canadian market movements. This relationship is

true for companies like Northgate with a very early cross-listing date in 1970 and break in

U.S. market betas in the 1980s, as well as companies like Shaw Communications with a more

recent history in the US market. This panel also illustrates this relationship for a Mexican

company, Televisa. The estimated breakdates for Televisa are insigni cantly di¤erent from

the Mexican market breakdate of November 2004.

   The lower Panel B of Table 6 provides similar results for selected companies that have

estimated break dates signi cantly di¤erent from their home market. These examples in-

clude companies ranging from early cross-listing dates such as Fuji Photos to more recent

crosslistings such as Brazil Telecom. As the table shows, the betas for Fuji changes in 1995

while the betas for the Japanese market as a whole change in 1981, coinciding with the

Japanese market liberalization. By contrast, the betas of the Dutch company Buhrmann

changes in the mid 1980s, well before the changes in the market as a whole.

   Some companies cross-list during periods that are quite close to the general market

changes. For example, Brazil Telecom cross-listed in November of 2001 while the general

market shifted in October of 2002. Nevertheless, both of these events took place signi cantly

before the change in Brazil Telecoms betas in 2004 to 2006.

   Overall, these results highlight the importance of conditioning on the changes at the

market level when considering the e¤ects of betas. In the next section, I examine the changes

in betas more directly to verify that these beta changes correspond to the general trend

toward integration that has been found in the existing literature.



                                             27
3       The Impact of Changing Company Betas

In the analysis so far, I have focused upon potential breaks in stock return betas and charac-

teristics of their associated companies without considering the direction of changing betas.

At the same time, the literature suggests that these betas against the U.S. market are likely

to have increased over time. As noted earlier, the event studies of cross-listing events have

typically pooled all stock returns together and found that the betas against the U.S. market

tend to increase toward one after the event. Similarly, research on market level returns tend

to nd that these returns have become more correlated over time, implying that international

diversi cation bene ts are likely diminishing.

      To check the reasonableness of the breakdates above, therefore, I next examine the di-

rection of changes in estimated betas. In this section, I nd that betas against the U.S.

market have indeed increased toward one after cross-listing and over time. Moreover, the

implied market returns have become more correlated. As a further robustness check, I con-

duct a Monte Carlo experiment and show that the international diversi cation bene ts have

declined over time, consistent with the literature.21 All of these cases continue to demon-

strate that the estimated shifts in parameters are plausible and support the break date

estimates above.



3.1       Changing Beta Estimates over Breaks

Table 7 summarizes parameter estimates across individual country level return equations (9),

reported in Panel A, and across individual company level return equations (10), reported in
 21
      In the appendix, I also report on other sensitivity analysis.




                                                       28
Panels B and C. To provide measures of these distributions, I aggregate the estimates into

portfolios across country returns and across company returns using two di¤erent weighting

methods: (a) Market-Weighted and (b) Equally-Weighted.22 For each portfolio, I sort the

country and company parameters into bins during which parameters are stable at the 5%

MSL.23 For example, in Panel A, the column labeled "Period 1" corresponds to country level
                                         `       `                                   `       `
statistics over the intervals when           =   1,   "Period 2" corresponds to          =   2,   and so forth

through "Period 4." Note that these intervals will di¤er across countries and companies and

therefore do not necessarily incorporate common points in time.24 Also, for return series that

do not show instability, parameters are reported under "Period 1" throughout the sample,

implying more observations in that bin. Similarly, fewer countries and companies show

evidence of three breaks. As such "Period 4" has fewer observations.

       For each portfolio in Panel A of Table 7, the table reports the cross sectional mean of

the beta estimates using equation (9), their standard errors and their correlations with the
                         `
US market, labeled           Mean, Std Err Mean, and Corr(r` ; ru ), respectively. It also gives the
                                                                                                         `
cross-sectional standard deviation of the beta estimates given in the row referenced by                      Std

Dev, and the number of countries in the bin. Three main features can be seen across these

columns. First, the mean betas generally increase over the periods toward one. The market

weighted portfolio beta mean is only about 0.35 in Period 1, but is about 0.80 for Period 2.

While there are fewer countries with two and three breaks, the means over these later periods

increase as well. A similar pattern holds for the Equally Weighted Portfolio. Second, the
  22
     The appendix also reports the same summary statistics for portfolios disaggregated into emerging versus
developed markets and into di¤erent world regions, with similar results.
  23
     For the MSLs of 1% and 10% the estimates are virtually identical.
  24
     To illustrate time-dependence in this relationship, I construct a yearly measure of the aggregated betas
below.



                                                       29
correlations of these country returns with the US also increase over the periods beginning at

about 0.20 for period 1 to 0.36 in period 2 and 0.44 in period 3. Third, the standard error

means have stayed relatively low, generally not exceeding 0.06 so that the hypothesis of beta

equal to zero can typically be rejected. Taken together, these parameters are consistent with

the general view that markets have become more correlated and integrated over time.

   Panels B and C of Table 7 report the same information for the rm return local market
       i`                            iu
beta        and the US market beta        , respectively. The local market betas in Panel B show

little change over time. In particular, the market weighted betas increase from subperiod

one to two from 0.66 to 0.75 while the equally weighted portfolio betas are essentially at

at around 0.7. These estimates do show some tendency to increase in subperiod three and

four, although there are fewer companies in these bins.

   Panel C of Table 6 reports the same summary statistics for the company US market

betas. For these portfolio parameters, the means increase more sharply. For the market-

weighted portfolio, the US market betas in Period 1 are only 0.455 but increases to 0.792 in

Period 2. These mean betas increase even more over the following two periods, peaking at

0.995 by Period 4, although for a small number of companies. A similar but more attenuated

pattern appears to hold for the Equally Weighted portfolio. Interestingly, the correlation

between cross-listed company returns and the US market increases over sub-periods. Across

all countries, the mean correlation increases from 0.16 in period 1 to 0.32 in period 4.

   Taken together, the parameter results in Table 6 suggest that, even after controlling for

the apparent shift toward integration of market indices, the set of cross-listed companies as

well as their home markets have become more correlated with the US. First, the indirect

relationship with the US market has increased. That is, Panels A and B show that both the

                                                 30
local market indices and the local market betas have increased toward one. As a results,
                                  i` `
the product of these betas               has increased. Second, the direct relationship with the

US market has increased as well. Panel C demonstrates that US market betas have moved

toward one and the mean correlations with the US have also risen. The parameter results are

therfore consistent with the literature, further corroborating the break date analysis above.



3.2       Changing Beta Estimates Before and After Cross-listing

The results suggest that the correlations among cross-listed company returns in the U.S.

have increased over time, and are therefore consistent with the empirical literature that

 nds diminishing diversi cation potentials. However, as shown above, the breaks in these

relationships do not generally occur at the same time as cross-listing. As such, they are silent

about whether the evidence is consistent with the cross-listing literature that nds higher

betas against the U.S. market after cross-listing.

       To address how betas change before and after cross-listing, I sort the parameters into

periods before and after cross-listing. For companies, these cross-listing dates are simply the

same cross-listing dates as above. For countries, I use an approach common in the emerging

market liberalization literature. This approach analyzes changes based upon the timing of

the rst cross-listed stock from that market.25 For this reason, I use the listing date of the

company that was the earliest to cross-list from that home market.26

       Table 8 reports summary statistics before, after, and during cross-listing for all three
  25
      For example, Henry (2000) uses the earliest date at which a company cross-lists in the economy as a
measure of openness. And Bekaert, Harvey and Lumsdaine (2002) examine these events to corroborate their
liberalization dating estimates.
   26
      Note that this measure is biased to be later than the earliest listing date of the company since some
companies may have listed on another exchange before 2004. As such, my results are conservative as they
are biased against the general nding that cross-listings occur before changes in betas.


                                                    31
betas estimates. Panel A gives the statistics for the country level regressions. To calculate
                                                                                 `
these statistics, I rst array the beta coe¢cients on the US market,                  , by year and then

sort the parameters into bins depending upon whether these estimates are Before Listing

( rst column) or After Listing (second column). I also report the averages including the

listing period, given under the column labeled After and During Listing.

   A basic pattern is clear from these estimates. For both the Market-Weighted and Equally-

Weighted portfolios, the average betas increase dramatically after listing. When the During

Listing period is included in the last column, this increase is attenuated, but is still sig-

ni cantly higher than the Before Listing period. Moreover, the pattern in the betas is

mirrored in the correlations. The mean correlations increase from around 0.2 before listing

to almost 0.4 in the later period excluding listing and is about 0.3 if the listing period is

included.

   Panel B of Table 8 shows the corresponding breakdown by company betas for the local
            i`                          iu
market,          , and the US market,        . While the local market betas show some slight tendency

to increase, the di¤erence is not pronounced and is in fact rather at at around 0.7 for the

Equally Weighted portfolio. Furthermore, the correlation of the cross-listed companies with

their home markets does not show any real trend, hovering at around 0.2

   By contrast, the statistics for company returns relative to the US market show a more

pronounced relationship. The mean of company betas against the US increases from about

0.49 before cross-listing to 0.97 for rms that show evidence of parameter breaks after cross-

listing. Although this mean drops to 0.74 when the listing period is included, it remains

considerably higher than the mean before cross-listing. The correlation with the US also

follows this pattern.

                                                      32
   Taken together, these parameter estimates are consistent with the pattern found in the

cross-listing literature using pooled samples of cross-listed stock returns. In particular, the

betas of these stock returns on the U.S. market increase after cross-listing while the betas

on the home market are relatively at. Moreover, the betas and correlations of market

returns tend to increase toward one after cross-listing, similar to ndings in the liberalization

lterature. Overall, the pattern of the parameter estimates demonstrates that the break date

analysis above generates results consistent with the cross-listing literature.



3.3    Changing Beta Estimates Over Time

The summary of the parameter estimate distributions describe how the individual countries

and company returns shift over time. However, they do not indicate how the parameters

change in calendar time. Therefore, I next sort the country and company estimates by year

and form annual market-weighted portfolios to determine whether they are consistent with

the literature on market integration.

   For this purpose, I recalculate the factor loadings of foreign companies on US returns.

As noted above, changes in the US returns a¤ect foreign companies both directly through

their own betas and indirectly through the home market beta on the US. These individual

company parameters are then market-weighted annually to provide an aggregate measure of

portfolio parameters.

   Figure 4a plots the parameter estimates over time. As the gure shows, the portfolio
                           i`
beta on the local market        is relatively unchanged over time at around 0.8. However, there

is a signi cant increase over time in both the betas of the country returns and the foreign

                            `         iu
companies on the US,            and        , respectively. As a result, the combined e¤ect is a strong

increase in betas against the US.

       This increase is betas against the US suggests a decrease in international diversi cation

potential. To determine whether this conjecture is valid, I consider the following thought

experiment. Using the estimated parameters and residual variance-covariance matrix, I

construct the minimum-variance portfolio of a US investor who has a choice between three

di¤erent portfolios: (a) the US market portfolio, (b) a market-weighted portfolio of foreign

companies listed on the US exchanges, and (c) a market-weighted portfolio of foreign market

indices that have companies listed on the US exchanges.27

       Figure 4b shows the impact of these parameters and variances on the minimum variance

portfolio allocations. Through the 1980s, investment in foreign securities provides a useful

hedge for the US market. The combined betas of the foreign market indices are less than one

and even a sharp increase in the residuals after 1987 does not diminish the attractiveness

of foreign investment. However, beginning in the 1990s, the increasing betas of foreign

market indices and foreign companies both push down the desired allocation in foreign assets.

Interestingly, the pattern of desired allocation into foreign companies in the US tends to

mirror that of foreign markets. The reduced diversi cation potentil implied by the paramter

estimates is consistent with research nding diminishing international diversi cation, and,

as such, provides another robustness check.
  27
    Details are provided in the appendix. There I also describe analysis for an alternative when US investors
cannot hold the foreign market indices, also nding evidence for diminishing diversi cation potential.

4     Conclusions

An important literature has studied the stock return behavior of rms around their cross-

listing dates. Studies in this literature generally nd that the betas on the U.S. market

of these companies tend to increase after cross-listing. In this paper, I have used stock

returns of a set of foreign companies to independently test whether their betas change and,

if so, on what date. The results of this study are striking. While most companies show

evidence of changes in their betas, these changes can largely be attributed to variation in

betas at the market level, not the company level. Moreover, for those companies that do

appear to have shifts in US beta not attributable to their home market, these changes occur

signi cantly later than the cross-listing date. Logistical regressions suggest that companies

that tend to cross-list earlier than any changes in their betas tend to be younger or else

have home markets that are in North America with a longer history of U.S. integration.

Furthermore, the changes in betas appear to be consistent with evidence that markets are

becoming integrated.

    Nevertheless, taken together the evidence suggests that much of the observed increases

in company betas over time may be due to integration of markets, not just rm behavior. In

addition, since companies tend to cross-list before any independent increases in correlations

with the US market, it appears to take time for stock returns to take on more systematic US

risk. This transition period may result either because US investors are learning about the

company or else foreign managers are changing their management practices to better align

with US shareholders. As such, the results in this paper point to interesting questions for

future research.

Panel A reports the coefficient estimates and standard errors for a logit regression where the dependent variable
is one if a firm’s beta changes over the sample period. Panel B reports the coefficient estimates and standard
errors for a multinomial logit regression where the dependent variable is the timing of the beta break date relative
to the cross-listing date for the firms that break. This dependent variable is: (a) cross-listing is before first break;
(b) cross-listing is during one of the breaks; or (c) cross-listing is after the first break.The omitted event is (c).

Panel A reports the means, standard error means, and cross-sectional standard deviations
of β ℓ in the regression: rtℓ = αℓ + β ℓ rtu + uℓt where rtℓ is the excess return of country ℓ’s
equity return, rtu is the excess return of the US market. Panels B and C report the means,
standard error means, and cross-sectional standard deviations of β iℓ and β iu , respectively,
in the joint regressions: (i) rtℓ = αℓ + β ℓ rtu + uℓt ; and (ii) rtiℓ = αiℓ + β iℓ rtℓ + β iu rtu + eiℓ

Parameter estimate means, standard error means, and cross-sectional
standard deviations before and after cross-listing. Panel A gives results for
the country market return regressions aggregated into portfolios before,
during and after cross-listing: rtℓ = αℓ + β ℓ rtu + uℓt ; Panel B gives results
for the company return regressions: rtiℓ = αiℓ + β iℓ rtℓ + β iu rtu + eiℓ

columns headed “Before Listing,” “Only After Listing,” and “After/During
Listing” give, respectively, statistics performed on parameter averages across
subperiods before cross-listing, across subperiods that break after cross-listing,
and across the subperiod during cross-listing and the subperiods after
cross-listing.

Figures provide bar charts of the proportion of firms in the sample that had a
cross-listing date before the first break date confidence interval lower bound ,
during one of the break date confidence intervals, or after one of the break
date confidence interval upper bound. All bounds estimated at the 95%
confidence level using 5% marginal significance thresholds for breaks.

Figure 3a reports the break date intervals and confidence intervals for betas estimated from country market returns regressed on US market
returns. Figure 3b reports the break date intervals and confidence intervals for betas estimated from firm returns regressed on US market
returns after conditioning on home market return beta breaks. Boxes and triangles plot the point estimates while the cross-bars indicate the
confidence intervals.

Figure 4a plots the value-weighted average of the estimated betas for
firms on their local market (ȕi,l), on the US market (ȕi,u) and for country
markets on the US market (ȕl ) and of the combined loading of firms on
the US market ((ȕl ȕi,l + ȕi,u). Figure 4b plots the implied minimum
variance portfolio allocation shares for a three asset portfolio of the US
market, a market-weighted portfolio of cross-listed stocks, and a market-
weighted portfolio of foreign market indices. (Construction details
provided in the appendix.)
