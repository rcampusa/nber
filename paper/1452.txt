                     Unionism Comes to the Public Sector

                                       ABSTRACT

         This paper argues that public sector labor relations is best understood in

a framework that focuses on unions' ability to shift demand curves rather than

to raise wages, as is the case in the private sector. It reviews the public

sector labor relations literature and finds that: (i) public sector unionism has

flourished as a result of changes in laws; (2) the effects of public sector

unions on wages are likely to have been underestimated; (3) public sector unions

have a somewhat different effect on wage structures than do private sector

unions; () compulsory arbitration reduces strikes with no clearcut impact on

the level of wage settlements; (5) public sector unions have diverse effects

on non—wage outcomes as do private sector unions.

      In terms of evaluating public sector unionism, the paper argues that by

raising both the cost of'   public   services (taxes) and the amount of services

public   sector unionism involves a different welfare calculus than private sector
unionism.

 I. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

          In   the 1950s only a small minority of public sector workers were

 organized and even AFL—CIO President George Meany believed "It is impossible to

 bargain collectively with the government."1vjrtually no states had laws per-

 mitting collective bargaining for public employees. Strikes were prohibited.

Analysts of unionism regarded most public sector employees as unorganizable.

       In 1980 about 13 per cent of government employees were represented by

labor organizations and 32 per cent were covered by contractual agreements.'

Over three—quarters of the states had legislation authorizing collective

bargaining by public employees. Eight states permitted strikes by some public

workers. According to the Current Population Survey (oPs) 3% of government

employees compared to 22 %      of   private sector employees were "represented by

labor organizations" in May 198O.

      What caused the sudden surge in public sector unionism in the United

States? What are its economic consequences? How have various states and loca-

lities dealt with the organization of their employees? Which laws and proce-

dures have proven more/less successful in coping with the unionism of public

employees? In what ways does labor relations in the public sector parallel

labor relations in the private sector? In what ways has the public sector been

unique?

      To answer these questions, I review the results of the past two or so

decades of research on public sector labor relations. The research represents a

significant and expanding effort by labor specialists. In 1960 relatively few

labor relations articles in the leading journals dealt with the public sector;

in 1983 not only were there numerous public sector articles in the labor jour—
                                           2



nals but the field had grown sufficiently to produce two specialized journals,

as well as numerous books and research treatises.5

      The review shows that while we have amassed considerable knowledge about

the nature of public sector labor relations, there are noticeable gaps in our

understanding of what public sector unions actually do. The following seven

propositions provide a general overview of the major findings and issues in

public sector labor relations:

       1. A fundamental difference between public sector and private sector

collective bargaining is that public sector unions can affect the demand for

labor through the political process, as well as affect wages and work conditions

through collective bargaining. However, the intrinsic political aspect of

public sector bargaining does not necessarily make the demand for public sector

workers more inelastic than the demand for private sector workers, and thus does

not necessarily give public sector unions great economic power. While it is

true that public employers do not face competition in their locality, they are

subject to the discipline of a budget and, in the long run, to exit and entry of

residents and businesses (the Tiebout adjustment). Similarly, while public sec-

tor unions may   have   an advantage in bargaining because they can help elect the

political leaders against whom they negotiate, "legislative vetoes" of neo—

tiated settlements and taxpayers' referenda which limit taxes create potential

weaknesses for unions. Finally, in contrast to private sector unions which are

free to wield the strike threat as a weapon, union power in most public sector

jurisdictions is limited by restrictions on striking.

      2. The growth of public sector unionism in the past two decades can be

traced, in large part, to the passage of laws (executive orders) which have
                                        3




 sought to bring the private sector industrial relations model to the public eec—

 tor. In states with laws favorable to unionism, public sector unionism has

 flourished; in states without such laws, it has not. General lack of management

opposition to public sector unionism, possibly due to the political power of

unions, has been important for union victories in representation elections in

the public sector. There is some indication that the spurt in public sector

unionism has ended, leaving the U.S. with about a 30—140% union coverage of

public sector labor.

      3. Much of the literature concludes that public sector unions have had

relatively modest effects on wages compared to the effects of private sector

unions on wages. This result, if true, would resolve the debate over the rela-

tive strength of unions in public and private employment. A careful reading of

the evidence, however, shows the finding to be questionable on several grounds:

First, many public sector union wage studies looked at unions when they were

Just establishing themselves during a period of public sector expansion. If, as

seems reasonable, the wage effects in first contracts are smaller than in later

contracts and if union wage effects are smaller in booming than in declining

markets, much of the early literature has understated the long term

"equilibrium" impact of public sector unions on compensation. A second problem

with the generalization is that few studies have distinguished between the

effects of public employment     se versus effects from the type of occupations

organized in the public sector. Public sector unions include a relatively large

number of white collar workers, whose wages appear to be only moderately

affected by unionism in the private sector. They include protective service

workers, for whom it is difficult to find comparable occupational groups in the
                                         4


private sector. The limited studies of union effects on blue collar workers in
the public sector show wage effects similar to those in the private sector. A
third   reason for questioning the conclusion that public sector unions have weak

wage effects is the likelihood that, because of "comparability" of wages across

cities, there are greater "spillovers" of wage settlements in the public sector

than in the private sector, biasing downward standard cross—section estimates of

the union effect. Finally, for some groups, public sector compensation packages

differ greatly in dimensions not captured in standard data sets. While these

considerations do not necessarily prove the conventional generalization to be

wrong, they suggest it should not be accepted without further investigation.

        1. With respect to wage structure, public sector unions have quite dif-

ferent effects on some aspects of wage structure than private sector unions do,

and quite similar effects on other aspects. The teachers' unions appears to

widen educational wage differentials, while policemen and firefighters' unions

appear to have little effect on the range of salaries for their members. This

contrasts with the general equalizing effect of unionism on such differentials

in the private sector. On the other hand, nest studies find that in both the

public sector and the private sector the union impact on fringe benefits is

greater than the union effect on wages, and our analysis of overall inequality

of earnings shows less inequality among union than among nonunion public sector

workers.

        5. Despite being illegal in all but eight states, strikes are part of

public sector labor relations. From the 1960s to the l980s, the number of stri-

kes increased drastically until 1 of every 8 strikes occurred in the public sec-

tor.    Public sector strikes are generally of short duration. While injunctions
                                         5




often fail to halt strikes, there is evidence that the nature of strike laws

affects their frequency. Public sector alternatives to the strike, in the form

of various types of compulsory arbitration, have been successful in reducing

strikes with no clearcut impact on the level of wage settlements. Arbitrators'

decisions show no apparent bias toward one side or the other, despite frequent

claims to the contrary. Final offer arbitration appears to have worked reaso-

nably well, with less of a 'chilling effect' on negotiations than conventional

arbitration, consistent with theory.

      6. The limited evidence available on the effects of public sector unions

on productivity shows that unionism is not inimical to productivity. Some stu-

dies find positive union effects, some find essentially nO effects, but few find

negative effects. However, problems of measuring output of public services

make any firm generalization difficult. With respect to public budgets, stu-

dies suggest that unionization does, indeed, increase the share of a

municipality's budget going to the workers in an organized function.

      7. Several aspects of market performance have not, as yet, been exten-

sively explored by public sector researchers. These include: the effect of

public sector unions on turnover, which is known to be lower, in general, in

public employment; the net effect of unions on the dispersion of earnings;

the effect of unions on employment and wage responses to cyclical and other eco-

nomic swings; and, most important of all, the effect of unions on the "price"

of output, taxes, property values, and municipal finances in total.

      Succeeding sections of this essay provide detailed evaluation of the

research that underlies these seven propositions.

II.     THE NEW UNIONISM

        Unions   typically grow in sudden spurts after years of stagnation. As can
be seen in Figure 1, this is true of public sector unions in the United States.
During the mid     1960's —     early 1970's,   public sector union membership   sore than
             6
uadrup1ed.       The   sudden   growth of public sector   unions was remarkable   in that it

occurred during a period of noticeable decline in the organization of the private

sector. It came as a surprise to most observers, who had cited such factors as

the security of public sector work, the high proportion of female, black, and

white collar workers, adverse public attitudes, civil service laws and prohibi—
                                                             7
tions   on strikes as factors inhibiting organization. Indeed, as late as

February 1959, the AFL—CIO executive council stated that 'in terms of accepted

collective bargaining procedures, government workers have no right beyond the

authority to petition Congress——a right available to every citizen.'8

        Table 1 shows that, while some of the newly organized public sector

workers are in unions that are predominantly in the private sector, the majority

of workers are in newly emergent public sector unions. These unions have cer-

tain distinct characteristics. First, in jurisdictional terms, many are more

like craft than like industrial unions, being organized along occupational

lines (i.e., the postal workers' unions, the teachers' unions, the police, the

firefighters, the sanitation workers, and the transit workers). Second, the new

unions have organized an exceptionally large number of "white collar" workers,

even if one excludes the teachers. As Table 2 shows, less than one third of

public sector organized workers are in units covering only blue collar

employees. The     comparable     figure for private sector workers is a bare 12%.9

Third, in addition to the unions which can and do negotiate and sign collective

agreements over wages and fringes and working conditions, there are the sizeable

federal employee unions which do not sign agreements over wages and fringes.

       What caused the spurt of public sector unionism in the late 1960's —

1970's?
      What changes led to the sudden organization of traditionally non—

unionizable public sector workers?

      First and foremost were changes in the laws regulating public sector

unions. In the federal sector, Executive Order 10988 which President Kennedy

announced in 1962, and which was later strengthened by ensuing presidents, was

the principle cause of the rapid organization of federal employees. It provided

for the recognition of federal worker unions but limited the scope of bargaining.

Before 1962 unionization of federal employees was going nowhere; then suddenly,

it shot upward. At the state and local level there were a variety of changes in

the law occurring mostly in the l960's and 1970's (see Table 3), which were

followed by a rapid growth of unionization.   The laws favorable to collective

bargaining ranged from weak "meet and confer" laws, to requirements for

bargaining, to compulsory arbitration when resolving disputes.   While the

various laws differ among types of employees (i.e. police and firefighters have

different regulations than the teachers), states that have favorable collective

bargaining laws in one area also have them in others, permitting the broad

classification of states in Table 3.

      As an example of the rapid change in state laws, consider Massachusetts.

In 1958 it passed a law allowing public employees to join unions but not to

bargain over economic matters. In 196)4, it passed a law requiring bargaining

over work conditions, which was extended in 1965 to include wages, but did not

contain any terminal mechanism for settling unresolved issues. In 1974 the

state legislature ordered final offer arbitration to settle impasses. Then,

responding to niinicipalities unhappy with final offer arbitration, the legisla-

ture developed a labor—management committee to resolve impasses through a

variety of mechanisms. In the span of a decade, the state moved from no legal

bargaining to bargaining with a dispute resolution mechanism guaranteeing a
            10
contract.

      In addition to passing laws which encouraged collective bargaining,

the majority of states instituted public employee relations boards (PERB's) to

hold representation elections among workers and to resolve charges of unfair labor
             11
practices.

      Studies of the spurt in public sector unionism (see Table 4) uniformly

show that these laws were a major factor in the growth of public sector unioni-

zation. States that enacted laws had rapid increases in unionization in ensuing

years. States that did not had no such growth. The more favorable the laws

were to unions the greater the growth of unionization. For instance, in states

where laws permit strong union security clauses, teachers unions appear to have

done better than in other states. This is not to say that public sector

bargaining does not exist in the absence of a law. Indeed, Ohio is a good

counter example. But one counter example does not disprove a social science

generalization. For the most part, the spurt in public sector unionism was

associated with changes in state laws regulating collective bargaining.

      Finally, it should be noted that there is some indication in the growth

curves for public sector union organization that this spurt has come to an end.

organization    representation was   virtually unchanged   at almost 50 per cent.12

Why Did the New Laws Induce the Spurt      in Public   Sector Unionism?

         The various state public employee labor laws of the mid 1960's —       1970's
established    mechanisms for workers to vote for/against collective representation
and required public sector employees to bargain with them. Both of           these   legal
innovations   were already part of the National Labor Relations Act governing

private sector unionism. They can be viewed as making public employees more

like private employees. Yet unionism in the private sector declined during the

period. One possible reason for the different results is that there was

"pent—up" demand for unionization in the public sector, but not in the private

sector. Another reason, which I believe to be more important, is that public

sector employers have not fought union organization of their workers to the

extent that private sector employers have. As public officials, they cannot

break the spirit or letter of the law, as management can in the private sector.

Hence, the same nominal election procedures produce different results in the two

settings.

     Finally, an important issue which must be addressed in any           analysis of the

impact   of laws on society   is whether the legal changes have a true independent

effect on social outcomes or whether they are simply an intervening or mediating

factor for more fundamental forces. Studies of the variables associated with

passage of laws favorable to public sector collective bargaining show that the

laws have come first in states with high income per capita and a history of

innovations in governmental activity. Some show that these laws are more likely

in states that are highly unionized in the private sector, but others do not.

While detailed analysis of' legislative votes and of the history of key legisla—
                                         15



tion is required to determine full causal routes the available evidence suggests

that the laws had an independent effect. Without legislation favorable to

collective bargaining we would not have observed the extensive unionization of

the public sector in United States, at least not to the extent which actually

occurred.

III. THE NEW SETTING

      The public sector differs in several important ways from the private sec-

tor (see Figure 2). Public employers have the sovereign powers of the state;

they generally are monopolies in their local area; they are ultimately respon-

sible to the voting public, including public sector workers; and some produce

essential services (police, fire, and defense).

      Do these differences make the private sector industrial relations system

essentially inapplicable to the public sector, or are these differences substan-

tially no greater than the differences between various private industries such as

steel and construction, for example? Do the unique features of the public sec-

tor give unions of governmental employees particularly strong economic power, as

some have alleged?

The Sovereign Power Issue

      Among the first objections to public sector unionism was the claim that such

unionism infringes on the sovereign power of the state in determining levels

of services and rules for the behavior of public employees. Surely, it was

argued, one cannot allow public employees, particularly the military, the

police, or fire fighters to have power independently of the elected government.1-3

The counter argument   is   that there is nothing special about employee—employer

relations for most public sector workers. Why     should    a worker employed in a

private firm under city contract operate under a drastically different labor law

than the equivalent worker in a city owned service?

     The sovereignty issue has, for the most part, been resolved by allowing

public sector workers to organize, but    by forbidding    most,   particularly   those in

"essential services," from striking. For workers in "nonessential services,"

how-ever, actual penalties for strikes are often uxderate, effectively allowing short

strikes (see section v).

      The federal government stands in a unique position with respect to

sovereignty. While federal employees are allowed to form unions and negotiate

over working conditions, they do not negotiate over wages and are not allowed to

strike. The high unionization in the federal sector thus provides evidence for

worker desire for representation in a large bureaucratic organization, exclusive

of the "monopoly" power of unions to raise wages through collective bargaining.

The Monopoly! Inelastic Demand Issue

      The argument that the nnopoly power which governments have in their juris-

diction   creates such inelastic demand for public sector employees as to give
public employee unions great economic power was stressed by Wellington and
Winter   in their 19T1 book:

           • .to the extent union power is delimited by market or other
         forces in the public sector, these constraints do not come into
         play nearly as quickly as in the private.
         "...soine of these services are such that any prolonged disrup-
         tion would entail an actual danger to health and safety.
         the demand for numerous governmental services is relatively
         Inelastic, that is relatively insensitive to changes In price.
         Indeed, the lack of close substitutes is typical of many
         governmental endeavors."

          I reject this claim for three reasons:

      1) In the short run governments face tax and budget constraints that

create a potentially nre rather than less elastic demand for labor. This is

because an employer operating under a budget constraint has no profit "residual"

from which to pay higher wages or in which to put savings from lower wages.

All of the adjustment to changes in wages take the form of an adjustment in

quantities. More broadly, the budget serves as a 'disciplinary' device in the
                                          19




public sector as does market demand in the private sector, forcing a quantity

price   tradeoff on the employer.
      2) In the long run, cities and states are not really monopolies, since
residents and businesses can move from one jurisdiction to another. Indeed, by
analogy    with the factor equalization theorem of trade theory, mobility should

compensate fully for the monopoly power governments have in their jurisdiction.

Citizens unhappy with level of public services can move elsewhere, reducing the

taxable population and thus the ability to pay public sector wages. Mobility

places great constraints on public sector union bargaining power as has been

stressed by Courant, Gram.lich, and Rubinfeld. Moreover, in jurisdictions where

taxation of property raises funds for operation of governments, the capitaliza-

tion of taxes in property values is an additional constraint on public sector

budgets and thus on union ability to raise wages.

        3) Where public sector workers are "essential" they are almost a1wars

forbidden to strike which greatly reduces their economic power, as noted

earlier.

The Political Context

        The political dimension clearly creates a distinct environment for labor

relations which leads collective bargaining down different paths than in the

private sector. While private sector unions can occasionally alter the demand

for labor curve (through union label campaigns, or by bargaining over employment

as well as wages) the usual assumption is that they alter the cost of labor,

with firms responding by changing the level of employment (see Figure 3A).

Indeed, the standard model of private sector unionism evaluates the monopoly

loss due to unionism in terms of the lower national output because of the reduc—

tion   in employment and increased marginal product in the union sector. By

contrast, public sector unions can    be viewed   as using their political power   to
raise demand for public services, as well as using their bargaining power to

fight for higher wages (Figure 3B and 3C). A possible criticism of public sector

unions    is that they increase public goods production beyond the social optimum,
raising rather than lowering employment.
       Politics,   however, is a two—edged sword, and it is by no means clear

whether collective bargaining in a political context increases or reduces union

power. On the one hand, public sector workers are an identifiable voting bloc

and potential activist group in local election campaigns.       But so too are tax-

payers. In    the private market consumers affect wages of workers only indirectly
through shifts in purchases when increased wages     lead firms to raise prices.    In
the public sector 'consumers' can affect wages directly by electing officials,
passing   referendum and the like which restrict settlements. In virtually every

state, so-called "legislative vetos" can vitiate bargains, as legislatures!

councils refuse to raise the iney to fund signed contracts. For example, in

the l9TOs, despite signed contracts college professors in the University of

Massachusetts system did not receive salary increases for several years because

the legislature did not allocate the funds)5Taxpayer revolts, as evidenced in

proposition 13 (California) or 2J. (Massachusetts), have also been used by oppo-

nents of public spending to limit potential union wage gains by capping tax

revenues or budgets.

       In other circumstances unions have effectively used legislature or voter

support to win terms they could not gain at the negotiating table, as the

following case cited by the Labor Management Relations Service indicates:
                                        22


         A prime example of union use of the referendum to bypass a
         municipal employer unreceptive to union demands Is that of the
         St. Louis Fire Fighters Local 73, who sought by special elec-
         tion to obtain equal pay with policemen. They rang doorbells
         and conducted an intensive campaign for votes in homes and
         taverns and at barbecues and labor and political meetings. The
         firemen also appealed for votes in newspaper, television, and
         radio advertisements. It was estimated that the entire cam-
         paign, financed by assessments on members of Local 73, cost
         between $35,000 and $50,000. This compared to the $6,000 spent
         by the firemen's principal opponent, Mayor Alfonso J.
         Cervantes, who campaigned against the raise claiming it would
         cost the city $1.7 million for a full year and probably cause a
         reduction in the number of fire companies. The firemen,
         claiming that these were "scare tactics," prevailed, as the
         voters gave the proposal a 61.7 percent majority; it needed
         sixty percent to pass.]-6


         The term 'multilateral bargaining' is commonly used to refer to the

situation in which public sector unions bargain not simply with those across the

table from them but with other interested public parties as well. In such

bargaining, need for public services, public expenditures, quality of services,

as well as wage packages are often at stake. Neither in theory nor in practice

does multilateral bargaining necessarily improve the union's ability to win wage

gains.

         In sum, the unique features of the public sector do, indeed, make it dif-

ferent from the private sector, producing a different industrial relations

system. Careful examination of how these features affect the bargaining power of

the two sides suggests, however, that the relative strength of unions in the

public versus the private sector cannot be resolved by a priori logic. The

issue requires empirical analysis, to which we turn next.

IV. UNION COMPENSATION EFFECTS

         The general tone of studies dealing with the effect of public sector

unionism on compensation is that the effects tend to be small. Indeed, most

survey articles have concluded that "The 'average' wage effect of unionism in

government.., is roughly on the order of five per cent...sinaller than the

average union wages impact in private industry."17"The general effects (of
                                                                    18
public sector unions) which have been measured are not huge."

        This generalization rests on extensive analysis of teachers unions, police

and firefighters organizations, and on studies of the Current Population

Surveys.

        The studies vary substantially. Some analyze wages of public

sector   workers by state, city, or district at a moment in time, using the frac-

tion in a collective organization or having contracts as the "union variable."

Others analyze rates of change in wages over time, looking for an acceleration

in the rate of change after unionization. Some look at wages of individuals on

large data tapes. Others perform before/after comparisons of wage rates.

For the most part, the studies relate to the period from the mid 1960s to the

early or mid 1970s. In this section I review briefly the relevant studies and

examine the evidence and arguments that I believe question the existing

generalization.

The Studies of Teachers

       Table 5   reports the results of diverse estimates of the effect of school
teachers unionization on wages, organized by     time   period, unit of   analysis,   and
the   approach taken.   The results for 1965—1968, which cover the beginnings of

teacher unionism, support the view that at that time teachers unionism

did not greatly affect compensation levels. Averaging across all the studies,
the union effect for the early period is a bare 3 per cent. The studies for
l969—l9T', by contrast, show larger positive union effects, of about 6 per cent
on average. The most recent Baugh and Stone analysis of individuals for 19TT
finds very large effects, of 21 per cent in a cross section and 12 per cent in a

before/after framework. Comparing 19Th—19T5 CPS results with 19T8—1979 results

they find a tripling in the union wage effect over time. As a check on this

finding, I estimated their cross—sectional model for 19T3 and 1981 and obtained

a similar result. As a further check, I have also examined the pay of teachers

across states by degree of unionization and also find evidence of a rising union

impact.

      There are several possible causes for the increased wage effect of the

teachers union. One likely cause is changed economic conditions. In the

early period the market for teachers was strong, with consequent good wages for

non—union as well as union teachers; in the latter period the market was weak

with the teachers union using its power to offset some downward pressure on

wages. Another hypothesis is that modestly higher differentials in rates of

change of pay per settlement cumulated over time to a sizeable union effect. A

third possibility is that, in fact, the power of the teachers union has risen

because of increased willingness to strike and changes in state laws regulating

teachers collective bargaining. Which, if any, of these possibilities is

correct requires not only a careful analysis of the teachers union wage effect

using comparable data over time (along lines of Baugh-Stone) but also better

measures of union economic power than has been common in studies. Because of

differences in the legal treatment of teachers unions across states and over
                                            26


time,   simple dichotomous or percentage organized variables are potentially

misleading: two areas with the same     "unionization"   may have different economic

outcomes because in one area the law    gives    the union of teachers greater power

than in the other, for instance, by requiring final offer arbitration or

allowing strikes.

Protective Service Workers

        The second   most extensively studied group of   public   sector unions are the
police and firefighters, for whom the standard study has found moderate effects
in   the area of 5—10 percent (see Table 6). For both occupations, there is a

general finding that effects are larger on total compensation than on wages;

that effects are larger for larger cities; and that effects may vary over time.

The Feuille, Hendricks and Delaney estimates of police union effects over time

show a definite rise from the early 1970s to the rnid—l9TOs, followed by a

decline at the turn of the decade.

        There are two possible problems with the studies of union effects among

protective service workers which suggest the 5—10 percent wage effects may

underestimate the actual impact of unionism. The first problem is the not—so

simple matter of measures for pay. All of the studies use reported salary rates

or average salary compensation from the Census of Governments or the

International City Management Association (ICMA) or comparable sources. These

sources value one of the components of compensation which unions appear to

raise——retirement pay—— at current employer cost rather than at the actuarial

value to workers. If, as some claim, the public sector has a bias toward

deferred compensation because politicians have a short time horizon this is

likely to understate the effect of public sector unions. In addition, standard

data   sets ignore other "extra compensation" (days worked at overtime) which are

important in the protective services.

        Table '1   provides   a rough notion of the possible error in analysis due to

this   data problem. It compares the reported compensation from the Urban
Institute "Twelve City Studies" with the reported compensation from the ICMA in
the same year. The differences are large and suggestive of a sizeable problem
in empirical analysis.
     The second potential problem with estimates of the effects of protective
service worker unionism is the possibility of sizeable "spillovers" from union
to   nonunion cities. Such spillovers are more likely for these occupations than

for others because of the lack of equivalent occupations in the private sector

and the consequent tendency for police and fire fighters to stress pay com-

parability across cities. One admittedly crude way to examine this idea is to

relate wages to unionism in a greater geographic area. Studies which have done

this suggest union wage effects are roughly twice as       large   as the 5—10 percent

the    standard cross—section analysis. 19
Additional Groups
        In   addition to the studies of teachers and protective service unions,

there have been a few studies of union wage effects in particular blue—collar

occupations which are directly comparable to those in the private sector. As

Table S shows, these studies present a very different picture of the relative

economic impact of unionism in the public and private sectors than is indicated

in the earlier literature: even in the early 60s and TOs these studies show no

noticable difference in the wage impact of unions in the two sectors. For some

groups of workers (bus drivers, sanitation workers) the union effects have been

larger in the public sector; in others (construction) they are about the

same in the two sectors; while in others (hospital workers), they are slightly

less in the public sector. Moore and Raisian found in the Michigan Panel Survey

that unionism raised blue collar wages significantly in the public sector and

raised white collar wages more in the public sector. Overall, the evidence in

Table 8 provides an important antidote to the claim that public sector unions

have smaller wage effects than private sector unions because the government is

the employer. If public sector unions have smaller wage effects, it could be

because of the occupations covered.

The Total Work Force

      An alternative to the analysis of detailed occupations which occupies much

of public sector labor relations research is to examine the pay of all govern-

ment employees on large data sets. The most important such study, by Sharon

Smith, found that in 1975 government employees in general were paid more than

private sector employees, but that unionism raised wages less for public sector

than for private sector workers, controlling for a wide variety of additional

wage determinants. Using a slightly different model, with fewer controls, I

report in Table 9 similar union results for 1973 and 1981 with, however, evi-

dence of increases in the union impact in some government sectors and decreases

in others. Moore and Raisian's analysis of the Michigan Panel Survey of Income

Dynamics shows greater variation in the public sector union effect over time,

with a drop from the late 1960s (when few were organized) to the early 1970s and

a rising effect thereafter.   In the absence of a comprehensive study of various

data sets, definitions of government employees, and different models, the safest

conclusions are that the union effects differ significantly over time and are

generally    smaller than those in the private sector (for any of the reasons given

earlier but are far from negligible.

Composition    of Compensation
         Private sector unions raise "fringe benefits," especially deferred compen-
sation, more than they raise wages, and have sizeable impacts on the        structure of

wages,    reducing personal differentials and the overall inequality of      earnings

within   the union sector. Do public sector unions have the same effects?
        With   respect to deferred compensation there is   good reason to   believe that

they should have larger effects. First, on the union side, the same arguments

that have been advanced to predict higher fringe spending under unionism in the

private sector should also hold for the public sector. Second, as noted on the
employer side, it is argued that politicians with short time horizons should be

especially willing to pay fringes.
     In fact, as Table 10 shows, all studies find that public sector unions

raise    fringe benefits by considerably more than they raise wages, except for

hospital workers. One important consequence of the increased pensions due to

public sector unions Is that public sector retirement funds had assets of 355
                        20
billion dollars in 1982. It is the size of these funds that underlies the

Rifkin—Barber argument that public sector assets should be invested in the sta-

tes in which the workers live, "to make the north rise again."

        What public sector unions do to the structure of wages is less clear. On

the one hand, there is Holmes' evidence that teacher unionism raises the pre-

miums for education and for experience, which runs counter to the private sector

union effect in reducing these differentials. On the other hand, Gustman and

Segal have found that teacher unionism reduces the number of steps in the

5.   Hospital    Workers
     a. Becker                                Unionization has moderately greater

     b. Feldman & Scheffler                   Unionization increased fringes about 6%

salary structure, which reduces inequality, and Moore reports a reduction in the

secondary teacher—elementary teacher differential in Nebraska. The various stu-

dies of the effect of firefighters and police give a mixed picture of the union

impact on minimum versus maximum salaries. Some studies find larger effects on

minimums than on maximums but not by very much, while others find

smaller effects.

        To get an overall picture of how public sector unions affect the structure

of personal differentials and inequality, I bave made a preliminary analysis of

Current Population Survey data in 1973 and 1981. Taking non—federal government

workers as a whole, I find a lower standard deviation of log wages among those

who are union members:

                                    1973          1981
                         Union       .39           .1l
                      NonUnion       .55           •51


        In   addition, I find that separate regressions for the wages of the two

groups show:

             1. Smaller effects of education in the union setting, particularly in

1973;

             2.   Smaller effects for sex in the union setting, especially in 1981,

implying a greater union impact on female than male wages; this result is

consistent with Sharon Smith's analysis, which showed larger union effects on

female than on male wages;

             3. Slightly positive effects of being black in the union setting, com-

pared to slightly negative effects of being black in the nonunion setting,

implying a larger union Impact for blacks than for whites;

             14 A mixed pattern of age effects on wages, different from that found
                                              36



in   the private sector.

       The finding that public sector unionism reduced sex differentials is but

one indication of union efforts to equalize pay between the sexes. In what is

perhaps the nst important development in public sector wage determination in

decades, AFSCME has won, in federal court, increases in the wages of female

workers in the state of Washington of 31 per cent and upwards, to bring about

"comparable   worth."   According to the   ruling in District Court, from 1983 to
1985, the state nust bring wages for workers in predominantly female Job classi-
fications   up to levels paid to workers in predominantly male occupations that

require comparable skill, responsibility and working conditions. AFSCME brought

the original suit after ten years of trying to get the state to comply with the

findings of the states' own comparable worth studies. It has been estimated

that the raises will bring about $200 million to affected employees over the two
                                                                              22
years arid $500 million in back pay to about 15,000 workers, mostly women.

Unless the decision is reversed on appeal the landmark pay equity ruling may

revolutionize pay practices in the public sector.

Wages and Employment in a Macro Context

       With about 15% of the work force employed in the public sector, the extent

to which public sector wages and employment vary over business cycles and in

response to secular changes has important macro—economic implications. At one

point many analysts believed public sector labor markets to be less responsive
                                                 23
to economic conditions than private sector markets. The sharp increase in

relative wages and employment of public workers in 1960s and decreases in pay

(and incomes, employment) in the 1970s calls into question this generalization.

During the l9TOs—1980s the federal government broke from its stated corn—
                                         37




para'bility policy to grant smaller pay increases than those in the private sec-

tor, raising the possibility that in times of stagflation public sector wages

are more responsive to conditions. I know of no significant study of the macro-

economics of public sector wage and employment responsiveness to inflation, nor-

mal business cycle swings, and abnOrmal changes. Such an investigation should

be clearly tied to public finance studies of cyclical/secular/abnormal changes

in federal, state and rarnicipal finances and to variations in sales/income and

property tax legislation across state rainiclpalities.

V. NON—WAGE EFFECTS

      Analysis of the non—wage effects of private sector unions have followed

two lines of research. The classic Slichter, Healy & Livernash book, The

Impact of Collective Bargaining in Management presented the results of 100 or

so case studies concerned with changes in personnel practices, management and

productivity.   More recently, labor economists have used ndern quantitative

tools to estimate the effects of unions on turnover, job satisfaction, pro-.

ductivity, capital/labor ratios, and profits. 24

      Is it reasonable to expect public sector unions to have as significant

effects on non wage outcomes as private sector unions have?

      Because of the unique features of the public sector environment, the

answer varies depending on the outcome. Since turnover is often low in the

public sector in the absence of unions, one would expect only marginal

effects on quits and   layoffs.   As productivity is often said to be lower in

the public sector than in the private sector in the absence of unions, there may

be more room for positive union productivity effects. Because of civil service

rules, there may be less union impact on personal policies, but because of mana-

gerial inefficiency, there may be more. Finally, the effect of unions on the

public sector equivalents of profit and prices——taxes, bond ratings, and pro-

perty values——will be large or small, depending on the power of the unions to

raise budgets, which can be determined only empirically.

     Research on the effects of public sector unions on non—wage outcomes is

limited, but the topic is important and deserves as much     attention   as   the more
heavily researched topics of   compensation   and arbitration—strike issues    which

respectively precede and succeed   this section.
                                               39



         In this section I review the relevant findings on non—wage outcomes arid

what they suggest may result from a more complete analysis.

Etiployment and Budgets

         In the private sector it is universally accepted that one of'      the   substan-

tial responses to union wage effects is a reduction of employment. As noted in

section 2, this is questionable for the public sector, as lobbying for higher

budgets could raise employment as well as wages. The empirical evidence sup-.

collective   bargaining. In the most       comprehensive   study of ICMA data for 1400

cities   over a decade, Zax has estimated that public sector unionism raises

employment by about io% Victor found essentially no change in employment for

police and increases in firefighters employment under unionism. Benecki found

increases in employment in small cities but reductions in very large cities, for

reasons that are not clear. In a highly sophisticated analysis, Iriman reports

higher employment for both police and firefighters under unionism, but a negative

union wage effect for police. As his model is a complex multi—equation system

with endogeneous unionism, it      is   unclear whether these results come from the

data   or from the particular structure imposed on the data.
       If unions have a positive or non—negative effect on employment without
controlling for wages, and if      they   raise wages, then budgets in organized Juris-
dictions should be higher than in unorganized jurisdictions. Indeed, four stu—
                                                                            26
dies of the impact of unionism on size of budgets show such effects. Moreover,

the evidence by Ebert for the impact of specific contract items on the alloca-

tion of dollars to use categories among New York school districts shows that the

effect of collective contracts on expenditures can be studied in terms of the
                                                       40


cost   of specific contractual points.

         The analyses of the relation between unionism and employment and budgets,

while consistent with our general theme of public sector unions' raising demand

for labor, should not be viewed as complete. With the exception of Inman, who

estimates a complete structural model           with   endogenous unionism, and Zax, who

estimates     a demand curve for labor, uzich of the analysis of union impacts on
employment and budgets is unconnected to the analysis               of union   wage effects.

taxes,      inter—governmental grants, or debt financing. In contrast to the studies

of compensation, none of the studies provides a before/after test of findings.

What   is   lacking, and needed, is a consistent analysis of the full effects of

public sector unionism on labor costs, employment and finances.

Product     ivit
       Despite     the difficulty of measuring the output of many-        public    goods, there

have been a surprisingly large number of studies on the relation between

unionization in the public sector and           productivity.   Some of the studies have

followed the Brown—Medoff production function methodolor for analyzing union

impacts on productivity. Others have used quite different methods, ranging

from case studies to analyses of manager (worker) perceptions of productivity

effects to simple comparisions (correlations) of productivity indices with

measures of unionism.

       Table 11 presents a brief summary          of   the studies. It gives the group

covered, method of analysis, and finding. Rabid opponents of public sector

unionism will be surprised to find that there is little evidence that public

sector unions adversely affect productivity. Of the 11 studies in the table,

strength while three report negative effects. Each study has   sizeable   problems.

with   output measures; for example, the Ehrenberg-Schwarz study, which concluded
that unionism had essentially no effect on productivity, found a positive effect
on output for one measure, interlibrary loans; and the Feullie et.al study,

which I categorize as showing positive productivity effects, found no effect on

crime clearance rates. Also, there were problems with the structure of the

models, especially concerning the control variables and the routes by which

unionism affects output. These results are therefore hardly strong enough to

warrant a firm generalization. They do, however, reject the presumption that

public sector unionism necessarily has adverse effects on productivity, and

suggests that, if there is a general effect, it n.y very well be positive. At

the least, the evidence backs the weak generalization offered by Methe and Perry

in the Public Administration Review that "collective bargaining has had no

(negative) impact on the effectiveness of local services."27

Personnel Practices

       Perhaps the most important way unionism affects the operation of enterpri-

ses is to force firms to alter their personnel practices. Rules replace n.na—

gerial discretion in a wide variety of decision areas. Grievance and

arbitration procedures give workers "due process" at the work place.

       A priori it is difficult to predict whether public sector unions would

have a larger or smaller effect on personnel practices than private sector

unions. On the one hand, civil service regulations, tenure laws for teachers,

and the like provide some protection for the majority of public sector workers,

thus limiting the scope for unionism. On the other hand, public sector manage—
                                         44



ment is allegedly inefficient and full of political decision—making which

increases the need for explicit personnel practices and grievance machinery.

While there has been no definitive summary    of   personnel practices before/after

unionism or practices between union/nonunion areas, the available literature

suggests that unions have had a sizeable impact on personnel practices, with

contractual protection generally superceding civil service or other legal pro-

tection. The Carpenter and Ashworth study of personnel practices in Mississippi

found that many non—union cities diverged noticeably from the Civil Service

model, even to the extent of failing to have explicit job definitions. The

Beyer, Trice and Hunt study of supervisory policies in the federal government

found that unions have positively affected supervisors' use of management—

initiated policies regarding alcoholism. In his 19T2 study, Stanley found that

"most department heads interviewed——said that this union pressure is good for

both employees and management,"2 result consistent with Slichter, Healy and

Livernash's work on the private sector. In the federal government, where

contracts deal solely with work conditions, Levitari and Noden rejected "the myth

that worker rights and collective bargaining are contrary to efficiency."2n

his analysis of hospitals in Canada, Gallagher found that both management and

union agreed that unionization forced regular and professional personnel prac-

tices onto the institutions.

      In terms of econometric research, several analysts have sought to evaluate

the effects of unionism on personnel practices by coding collective bargaining

contracts according to whether or not specific provisions favor the union or the

management. Kochan, Gerhart and Feullle et al. found that in states where

public sector labor laws are most favorable to unionism, contracts have been
                                            45



titled    in favor of workers, as one would      expect.   Eberts   has analyzed the   cost

impact of personnel practices embodied in contracts in New York City schools,

and found that those relating to labor jurisprudence and grievance categories

were costly to management.

         Each of the various public sector occupations have different personnel

practice issues. In teaching, one issue relates to the extent to which state

law on tenure can be overriden y collective bargaining contracts. Courts have

decided  the issue differently in different states. Another important issue
relates to the power of principals to assign/layoff teachers. If and when
school   administrations push for merit pay, that will certainly become a major

issue in bargaining. Among police and firefighters, key personnel issues have

included: parity, pay, and manning issues. For sanitation and various blue

collar   public sector workers, the issue      of subcontracting to private sector

organizations   has been important and   the   evidence suggests that     unions   have
managed to reduce contracting out.
      No good estimates   exist of the extent to which contracts trade—off per-

sonnel practices and related non compensation conditions for compensation.

Revenue4 Ta xes, and Welfare

      If unions raise public sector budgets, then they necessarily raise the

need for revenue and thus taxes, inter—governmental transfers, or debt. A con-

sistent ndel of union impacts on the public sector requires investigation of

these effects as well as those on wages, employment and budgets. Unfortunately,

until recently, there has been little investigation of the effect of public sec-

tor unions on budgets and taxes (one exception is Benecki's 19T8 study, another

is Levy's 19814 bachelor's degree thesis work) and none on the consistency bet—
                                         46




veen the various estimates of union effects on compensation, budgets,

employment, and productivity.3This is a major   short   coming in the research for

both substantive and nthodological reasons. Substantively, failure to

demonstrate a union impact on "bottom line" issues like taxes and

municipal/state debt seriously hampers any   social   evaluation of public sector

unionism. Methodologically, failure to analyze union impacts on all of the

diverse outcome variables results in a loss of information and less efficient as

well as possibly biased estimates of key parameters.

      Still, on the basis of the existing estimates of the effect of unions on

employment, wages and budgets described earlier, it is likely that public sector

unions raise both taxes and public services above what they would be in the

absence of the unions.

      Does this mean that there is a social welfare loss due to excessive

public goods resulting from unionism?

      In the absence of a generally accepted theory or empirical results on

whether a democratic government over—or under——produces public goods, no answer

can be given to the question.   In analysis of private sector unionism, second—

best considerations may weaken our belief in the standard welfare evaluation of

the output loss due to union wage effects, but does not lead us to reject it.

For the public sector, the problem of evaluating whether the average citizen

would be better/worse off in the absence of public sector union lobbying for

public goods is sufficiently complex to leave one agnostic. If, as Gaibraith

argued in The Affluent Society, there is a tendency to under produce public

goods, the union pressures may be socially beneficial. If, by contrast, the

conservative fear that there are inherent tendencies to over—produce public
                                            47



goods are correct, public sector unions are on the wrong side of the social

welfare ledger. Perhaps theories of actual output decisions in the public sec-

tor, as opposed to the normative theory of public goods production, can help us

determine whether or not the potential expansion of output in the public sector

due   to public sector unionism is socially good or bad.
       To sum up, just as private sector unions have significant non—wage
effects,   so too do public sector unions. In the private sector some of these

effects — — lower turnover, more professional management——help raise produc—

tivity to counter—balance union wage effects, at least in part. In the public

sector some of the effects of political lobbying seems to operate in the direc-

tion of increasing expenditures on output of public goods. Analysis of the non—

wage effect of public sector unions, particularly on taxes and overall municipal

finances has been relatively sparse, but offers some suggestions for evaluating

public sector labor relations and for future research.

VI. IMPASSE RESOLU'rION

      A major policy and   research   issue in public sector labor relations con-

cerns which rules and institutions should be used to resolve disagreements about

terms of contracts, and concurrently how to treat strikes. The various state

legislatures and municipalities have experimented with a wide variety of mecha—

nisms for impasse resolution. Eight states have legalized strikes for some

public sector workers, thereby letting the traditional private sector battle of

economic strength or threat thereof serve as the ultimate pressure for

agreements. Many states make public sector strikes illegal, some with rather

severe penalties for strikers. In recent years a sizeable number of states have

opted for conventional or final offer binding arbitration as a means for

achieving settlements in the absence of strikes.

      In this section I examine what we have learned about public sector strikes

and arbitration substitutes for the strike.

Public Sector Strikes

      Strikes have a bad press. No one really likes them. But in a system of

free collective bargaining they serve an important function. Without the

strike, or some substitute form of economic weapon, labor might never be able to

force management to take its demands seriously, and management might never be

able to force workers to withdraw demands/give concessions.

      Despite being outlawed in most jurisdictions, strikes in the public sector

are far from rare. As Table 12 shows, the country has experienced a sizeable

number of public sector strikes. Indeed, between 196O—64 and 1976—80, the

number of stoppages in the public sector rose from 32 per year to 500 per year.31

      Public sector strikes differ in their basic dimensions from private sector

strikes. They are of much shorter duration but tend to involve re workers per

strike. According to Nelson, Stone and   Swint   they follow a different cyclical

pattern than private sector strikes, falling rather than rising in business

expansions.

       Just as the various states have adopted different laws regulating collec-

tive bargaining in the public sector, so too have they developed different laws

regulating strikes. Eight states permit strikes (see Table 13). Some have no

explicit regulations but outlaw strikes under Judicial interpretation. Others

outlaw strikes with varying penalties for strike breakers—-penalties which are

sometimes not enforced.

       Which of these legal treatments is most successful in limiting strikes?

Is it better to make strikes legal, to have harsh penalties, or to have moderate

penalties? What is the effect on states of a collective bargaining statute

which compels unresolved issues to be settled by conventional or last offer

arbitration?

       There have been a sizeable number of studies of these questions (see Table

i1).   The most notable and consistent finding is that compulsory arbitration
does, indeed, serve as an effective deterrent to strikes. Several studies have

found a curvilinear relation between public sector labor laws and strike

incidence, with states having weak "meet and confer" laws being more strike

prone than states with no comprehensive public sector labor relations law and
                                                                         32
those with compulsory arbitration having the fewest number of strikes.

Whatever good or ill effects compulsory arbitration has on bargaining and

settlements, it does, nevertheless, limit strikes.

       By contrast, studies which fail to distinguish between types of public

sector bargaining laws yield mixed results, possibly because of the existence

of cases where bargaining laws without compulsory arbitration increase strikes

and partly because of cases where compulsory arbitration laws reduce them

(for example, Colton versus Weintraub and Thornton among teachers).

      The findings with respect to strike laws           se are also less clear.

Balfour and Holmes found strikes most frequent in states with very harsh

penalties and in those with no penalties, and least in those with moderate

penalties. Fallon found strikes less frequent in those with no penalties.

Klauser    cited the HawaIi     experience as showIng that legalizatIon of strIkes

reduces   them,   presumably because of the greater pressure on management to reach

agreement with workers.

     Douglas' study of New York's Taylor law shows that public officials are

loathe    in many   instances   to impose the penalties of the law, which includes a
two—for—one pay penalty for each day on strike, loss of checkoff of dues,          and

which requires workers to go back to their jobs immediately. From 196T—78           2T2

illegal work stoppages produced only 1T3 charges of illegal activity, and 136

injunctions.      In several instances the disputes produced exceedingly bitter

labor—management relations which might have been avoided under a different

collective bargaining law. In this regard the Zimmer—Jacobs study of New York

prison guard strikes suggests that the greatest problem of a punitive strike law

is the danger that it exacerbates disputes, rather than helps resolve them.

     Finally, in light of the longstanding sovereignty issue in public sector

labor relations, one mist not forget that in a number of cases, governors and

the President have used the National Guard or the arrr to break illegal public

sector strikes. The most notable such recent case was President Reagan's use of
                                               57




Air Force traffic controllers to defeat PATCO and ultimately crush that union.

In the l970s, the National Guard was used to temporarily replace striking public

sector workers by both liberal and conservative governors. The likelihood of

such force being used may be an important deterrent to protective service stri-

kes, which may be rendered largely ineffective as a result.

Binding Arbitration

         A major research effort has been devoted to the consequences of compulsory

arbitration,     either conventional or final offer, on public sector labor rela-
tions.    The   theory of conventional arbitration has focused on the "chilling"

effect that such third party resolution can have on negotiations. In the most

often argued analysis, if two parties operating under a conventional arbitration

statute believe the arbitrator will "split—the—difference," negotiations will be

chilled, as each side will refuse to make concessions for fear they will lower

its award in arbitration. By contrast, final offer arbitration——under which the

arbitrator must pick one of the two offers——is claimed to have less of a

chilling effect. In a rigorous model Crawford has shown that in fact in a world

without uncertainty, but with multiple issues in which parties expect

arbitrators to split the difference, the two forms of arbitration may yield the

same result, and are unlikely to be Pareto efficient.

      The major criticism leveled against final offer arbitration is that it

provides identifiable winners and losers which Is bad for labor relations. In

New Jersey and Massachusetts——two extensively studied states——unions have tended

to win approximately 2/3rds of the arbitration awards, leading to considerable

complaint by cities. 331f employers and unions had equally realistic final

offers, and arbitrators make decisions close to union offers most of the time,
                                           58



the cities would   have   a legitimate gripe. In fact, however, Ashenfelter and

Bloom have found that the reason unions win more in New Jersey is that union

offers are more realistic perhaps because union leaders are more risk—averse

than municipal officials, they even find that final offer arbitration produces

smaller settlement than conventional arbitration.

      Finally, as noted in our previous discussion of strikes, there has been

considerable concern about the extent to which compulsory arbitration laws

reduce   strikes, particularly compared to laws that make collective bargaining
illegal or that simply penalize public sector strikes.
      When the issue of binding arbitration initially surfaced in the public

sector literature, there was a notable lack of empirical evidence on its

effects. As Table 15 shows, by- 1981, 18 states had some form of     binding
arbitration, 8 of whom relied exclusively on conventional arbitration, and 10

of whom experimented with some form of final offer arbitration. While binding

arbitration has been invoked for nearly all workers, it has been most widely

used to deal with the problems of protective    service employees.
      Analysis   of the effects of the laws on negotiations and wages has taken

various forms: before/after studies within states; cross—section comparisons

between groups that are covered by the arbitration provision with those that are

not; comparisons of arbitration awards with negotiated settlements; and labora-

tory experiments designed to evaluate how various dispute resolution mechanisms

affect negotiations.

     Because the presence of compulsory arbitration dispute resolution

may affect negotiations, the most problematic of the approaches is to compare

the wages deterained by arbitration with those set in negotiations. This is

because, as Farber and Katz point out, the presence of a binding arbitration

provision n.y change negotiations as well, depending on the nature of the

arbitrator's preference function. In addition, the selection of jurisdictions

into arbitration creates potential "selectivity bias" problems.

      Table 16 summarizes current findings of the effects of compulsory- arbitra-

tion on economic outcomes. First, as noted earlier, binding arbitration defini-

tely- reduces strikes. With respect to bargaining, the issue is unresolved.

Some analysts conclude that conventional arbitration has harmed bargaining.

Others claim that it does not. Some have argued that once two parties get

involved with arbitration, there is a "narcotic effect," in which they- keep

coming back for more arbitration rather that proceeding to bargain. Others have

argued that the effect is illusory rather than real. As the Butler and

Ehrenberg and Kochan—Baderschneider debate in the ILRR makes clear, it is dif-

ficult to isolate "true" state dependence from unobserved characteristics that

cause this behavior. While the overall impact of arbitration on bargaining is

unclear, the general expectation that "final offer" arbitration will be less

chilling than conventional arbitration seems, for the most part, to be supported

in the data.

      There is no clear conclusion in the literature regarding the impact of

compulsory arbitration on wages. Several studies of varying quality- conclude

that compulsory arbitration raises ges while others, also of varying quality,

conclude it does not. The most sophisticated study, by Ashenfelter and Bloom

finds final offer arbitration does not produce higher wage settlements than does

conventional arbitration, despite rainicipal complaints to the contrary (ir

any-thing,   the data show slightly lower settlements in New Jersey.

                 Table 16: Effects of Compulsory Arbitration
                             on Economic Outcomes

A. Effects on Bargaining

    Compulsory Arbitration Reduces Bargaining

    1. Wheeler — Conventional, firefighters. Management bargainers are less
          likely- to change positions on starting wages when compulsory arbitration
          laws exist. Also, there is a greater gap between party and impasse
          positions.

    2. Kochan and Baderschneider — Conventional, New York firefighters and
        Police. Parties have a high and increasing rate of dependence on 3rd
          party- arbitration.

    3. Lipsky- and Barocci — Final Offer, Massachusetts firefighters, police and
        teachers. Measured as proportion of negotiations that resulted in
        impasses.

    14•   Somers — Final offer, Massachusetts firefighters and police. Final
          offer arbitration led to increased reliance on 3rd party arbitration.
          Didn't lead to increase of pre—impasse bargaining.

    Compulsory Arbitration Does Not Reduce Bargaining

    1. Grodin — conventional, Nevada

    2. Loewenberg — Conventional, Pennsylvania police and firefighters. Two—
          thirds of municipalities that negotiated arrived at negotiated
          settlement.

   3. Gallagher and Pegnetter —     Final   offer, Iowa. Final offer arbitration
       encourages negotiations.

   liP.   Long and Feuille — Final offer, Eugene Oregon. Case study of 7
          negotiation—arbitration experiences since 1911. Moderate encouragement
          of bargaining.

   5. Lipsky and Barocci — Final offer, Massachusetts firefighters, police and
       teachers. Measured by number of cases settled by arbitration.

B. Effects on Wages

   Compulsory Arbitration Raises Wages
   1. Loewenberg — Conventional, Pennsylvania police arbitration resulted in
       larger increases than in negotiations or employer determinations.

   2. Stern, Rehrnus, et. al. — Final offer, Wisconsin and Michigan.
       Regression analysis shows weak evidence of a positive relation for
       firefighters and police inOboth states from 1 — 5%.

                          Table 16 (continued)



3. Olson — Conventional, firefighters for population of 100,00 and over.

14 Kochan and Jick — Police and firefighters in New York state. The
    nature   of the impasse procedure — factfinding or arbitration — had a
    positive impact for management salary but no movement for union
    salaries.


Compulsory Arbitration Does Not Raise Wages

1. Somers —  Final offer, Massachusetts. Final offer arbitration leads to
    excessive percentage wage increases.

2. Bloom — New Jersey. None of coefficients for arbitration was signifi-
   cantly different from zero in regression analysis with salary changes as
   dependent variable.

3. Ashenfelter and Bloom — New Jersey, Final offer arbitration has less effect
    than conventional.

4. Loewenberg — Firefighters median increase in salary is similar to that
   for negotiated settlements or for decisions determined by an arbitration
   award.
                                         64



      Finally, in addition to the statistical analysis of the effects of actual

arbitration and other dispute resolution ichanisms, there have been several

laboratory experiments of how the various mechanisms affect behavior (see Table

17). These studies, while by no means conclusive, have tended to support the

claim that final offer arbitration has less of a chilling effect on negotiations

than does conventional arbitration and gives some evidence that both have some

similar effects.

           Study                         Finding


1. Johnson and Tullar                    Expected third—party resolution leads
                                         to bargaining when "Need to save face" is
                                         high.

2. Bigoness                              Expected compulsory arbitration impedes
                                         bargaining if high conflict between
                                         sides.

3. Urban                                 Expected conventional arbitration leads
                                         to nre time to reach agreement.

4.   Johnson and Pruitt                  Less time to reach agreement.

5. DeNisi and Dworkin                    More information about final offer pro-
                                         cedures leads to closer agreements.

6. Notz and Starke                       Final offer reduces difference in
                                         negotiations. Conventional
                                         arbitration increases differences.

7. Subbarao                              Final offer leads to smaller dif-
                                         ferences in negotiating than
                                         conventional arbitration does.

8. Magenau                              Allowing strikes is more effective than
                                        arbitration in producing voluntary
                                        agreements. Final offer leads to
                                        greater narrowing of differences than
                                        conventional arbitration.

VII. CONCLUSION:     UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

      As the preceding review and summary of findings shows, much has been
learned   about public sector labor relations. Much also remains to be learned.

Wage studies covering nre recent periods of time are likely to produce dif-

ferent estimates than those covering earlier periods, leading to different

overall conclusions about the power of public sector unions. Additional analy-

sis of the legal and political environment under which unionism operates should

illuminate the unique aspects of public sector labor relations.

      Perhaps what is most sorely needed in this area of research is a general

analytic framework around which the diverse research studies can be organized to

answer questions regarding the unique aspects of public sector labor relations.

For the most part, researchers have applied the same basic analytic framework

used in the private sector, concentrating on wage and other compensation effects

of collective bargaining. If the analysis in this review essay is correct, this

misses much that is unique about the public sector in terms of both positive and

normative economics. Whereas in the private sector one can infer employment

declines from union—induced wage increases, this does not appear to be valid in

the public sector because of union potential to shift demand outward through the

political process.

      As a general guide, models in which public sector unions affect demand for

labor rather than just wages, and influence the entire budget and tax position

of cities and states appear to offer the best hope for understanding what public

sector unions do and of allowing a social evaluation of what the advent of

unionism to the public sector nans for the United States econony.

Appendix A: The Measurement of the Extent of Collective Bargaining

       Because public sector unions operate under different state laws, the

definition of "unionism" is by- no ians clear. Existing data provide several

widely used sets of figures, which are described below:

(i)    Membership in a Bargaining Organization

       The term "bargaining organization" was coined by Burton (in Aaron, Grodin,

and Stern) to include unions and bargaining associations (or what BLS calls

employee associations). Burton divides public sector organizations into three

classes: unions, bargaining associations, and nonbargaining organizations.

Unions are characterized by strike endorsement, emphasis on collective

bargaining, exclusion of supervisors from membership, and AFL—CIO affiliation.

Bargaining associations also rely on collective bargaining, but are generally

averse to strikes, are more likely to emphasize political action instead,

usually include supervisors, and are affiliated with AFL—CIO. The National

Education Association (NEA) is an example. Finally, non—bargaining organiza-

tions don't bargain as a group, don't strike, are not affiliated with AFL—CIO,

but generally include supervisors as members. An example is the American Bar

Association (ABA). Bureau of Labor Statistics data was used by Burton to esti—

mate this figure. According to Burton, a shortcoming of the BLS data is that it

underestimates coverage by excluding municipal public employee associations.

Other problems are that BLS includes msmbership outside the US as well as

retired and unemployed workers. Post 19T9 the Bureau of National Affairs has

kept this series.

(2) Membership in an Employee Organization

      The Bureau of the Census, Department of Labor (BCDL) defines an employee
                                         68




organization as "an organization (e.g., union, association, federation, or coun-

cil) that exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with the

employer concerning personnel policies and practices, employee grievaces, labor

disputes, wages, rates of pay, hours of employment, and other conditions of

work." The data is available only as the percent of full—time employees and

exists from l9T1 to the present.

(3) Employees Represented by Bargaining Units

      The BCDL defines a bargaining unit as a group recognized as appropriate for

representation by an employee organization for the purpose of collective and/or

meet and confer discussions. Units commonly include both member and nonmembers

of the organization.

(1) Employees Covered by Contractual Agreement

      The BCDL defines a contractual agreement as "a written document developed

by collective negotiations between representatives of the employer and employee

organizations that describes the conditions of employment (e.g., wages, hours,

fringe benefits, etc.) and the methods by which disputes or grievances arising

during the term of the contract shall be resolved.

(5)   Employees Represented by Labor Organizations (CPS)
      CPS includes both members of unions and employer associations engaged in

collective bargaining as well as those covered by a union or employee association

contract. No retirees, unemployed union members, or persons in the armed forces

are included. Moreover, it includes members only in the United States. A njor

problem, however, is that while the CPS reports "government" workers as part of

its "Class of Worker" question, it breaks up the government into state, federal,

and local only for those workers in public administration.

        The   following figures provide some notion of the range of figures one gets
from different surveys:

      union effects might be expected to show greater revenue per capita, higher pro-
      perty taxes, higher sales taxes, but lower user charge revenue in unionized
      municipalities and lower debt. Because Benecki finds different patterns for
      large cities than for other, does not obtain internally consistent results in
      all cases and includes "three institutional bargaining variables"
      likely to have affected his estimates of union impacts, I regard his findings as
      only suggestive. They are, however, valuable in raising         the possibility that a
      major research payoff could come from the proper analysis of union impacts on
      broadly defined municipal finances.
