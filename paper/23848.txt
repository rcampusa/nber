                                          ABSTRACT

In this paper we evaluate the incidence of a large cut in value-added taxes (VAT) for French sit-
down restaurants. In contrast to previous studies that focus on prices only, we estimate its effect
on four groups: workers, firm owners, consumers and suppliers of material goods. Using a
difference-in-differences strategy on firm-level data we find that: (1) the effect on consumers was
limited, (2) employees and sellers of material goods shared 25 and 16 percent of the total benefit,
and (3) the reform mostly benefited owners of sit-down restaurants, who pocketed 41 percent of
the tax cut.

       The Value-Added Tax (VAT) is one of the most important taxes in the world. All developed
economies – with the exception of the United States (US) – have adopted a form of VAT.1 VATs
often represent the largest source of Government revenue, for example in the European Union (EU),
they raise 30% of total tax revenue, or 12% of GDP. Some US politicians have proposed adopting a
VAT, either as a replacement for other taxes or to fund specific Government programs.2 However,
relatively little attention has been dedicated to this tax compared to other taxes.3 In this paper,
we help fill this gap by analyzing the incidence of a large VAT cut for French sit-down restaurants.
       Member States of the European Union have increasingly relied on sector-specific and general
VAT cuts to stimulate the economy. Through these tax breaks, Governments generate windfalls for
firms hoping they would use them to increase demand through price reductions, increase employee
wages and firm investments. However, little is known about the efficacy of such fiscal policies.
But these policies are often very expensive, for example it is estimated that the French sit-down
restaurant VAT cut cost 3 billion euros in 2010, making it the fourth largest firm subsidies in
France.4 Another large VAT cut, the one year temporary VAT reduction in the UK cost 12.4
billion pounds in 2009.5 This paper sheds light on the effect of VAT cuts and finds that they
mostly benefit firm owners through increased profits.
       Empirical studies on tax incidence have provided limited evidence on the effects of VAT changes
on outcomes other than prices. Primarily because of data limitations, previous research has been
unable to disentangle the effects of VATs on employees, suppliers of non-labor intermediate inputs
and capital owners.6 One notable exception is Kosonen (2015) who estimates the incidence of a
large VAT cut on hairdressers in Finland. While the dataset he uses would in principle allow him
to estimate the full incidence of the VAT cut, the hairdressing sector relies substantially less on
employees (most firm owners are the sole employees) and material goods (hairdressers require very
little input costs) making the analysis on these two groups limited. Our paper helps fill this gap
by being the first to provide a full incidence analysis of a large reduction in the VAT rate. In July

2009, the VAT rate for meals consumed in sit-down restaurants was reduced from 19.6 percent to
5.5 percent, while the VAT rates applied to the rest of the economy were unaffected. To study the
effects of the reform we combine information on national prices from the French National Institute
of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) and Eurostat with firm level data from AMADEUS
(Bureau van Dijk). Our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps.
       First, we use a difference-in-differences strategy and compare sit-down restaurants (our treat-
ment group) to non-restaurant market services (our control group). We find that prices charged
by sit-down restaurants decreased slightly after the tax cut. The reform also led to a moderate
increase in the costs of both labor and non-labor intermediate inputs, and large increases in owners’
profits. These findings imply that sit-down restaurant owners were the main beneficiaries of the
tax cut, while the remaining windfall was shared between employees, consumers and suppliers of
material goods.
       Second, we build on the theoretical framework of Auerbach and Hines (2002) and use the
reduced-form coefficients to develop a welfare analysis, in which we estimate the incidence of the
VAT cut on consumers, employees, sellers of material goods and firm owners. Our estimates suggest
that in the long-run (30 months after the reform) firm owners pocketed around 41 percent of the
VAT cut, employees and sellers of material goods received around 25 and 16 percent respectively,
while consumers received the remaining 18 percent.
       Our study faces two main limitations. First, although we do have information on restaurants’
employment, we do not have information on wages or other characteristics of employees.7 We use
survey data on hours worked to provide evidence consistent with higher wages – rather than hours
worked – driving the observed increase in labor costs. We also rule out the possibility that the cost
of employees increases because firm owners are paying themselves as employees for tax purposes.8
       The second limitation relates to the estimated effect on consumers. First, our measure focuses
exclusively on prices paid and ignores changes in the quality of goods purchased. Second, our
incidence analysis relies on national rather than firm-level price indexes. Therefore, we are unable
to observe the price charged by each individual firm in our sample, but can only provide an estimate
of the aggregate effect of the reform on prices. Given that balance sheet data is missing for very
small firms, which are also less likely to react to the reform, it is probable that our estimate of the
   7
     Firms’ balance sheet data report the total cost of employees, which includes wages and the employer’s share of
payroll taxes.
   8
     Payroll taxes are so high in France that payments in profits are almost always more tax advantageous than wages.

incidence on consumers is biased upward.9


1        Institutional Background

1.1       The 2009 VAT Reform

Before the reform was implemented in 2009, the French restaurant industry had two different VAT
regimes: a standard rate of 19.6 percent applied to sit-down meals, and a reduced rate of 5.5 per-
cent for take-away meals. Following a campaign promise by then French President Jacques Chirac,
France applied for an authorization to re-classify sit-down restaurants from the standard to the
reduced VAT rate in 2002. The application was first turned down by the European Commission
because of strong opposition by then German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. After some negotia-
tions between France and Germany, an agreement was reached on January 20, 2009 allowing all
Member States to re-classify sit-down restaurants to the reduced rate. The reclassification was
implemented in France on July 1st 2009.
        The reform’s main goals were to (a) decrease the price of meals consumed in sit-down restau-
rants, (b) stimulate employment and investment in the sit-down restaurant industry, where total
turnover had declined by around 10 percent in the period 1995-2009, and (c) equalize the VAT rate
between sit-down meals and take-away meals. Importantly, the French government gathered the
representatives of the business associations of the restaurant sector (Etats généraux de la restaura-
tion) and asked them to commit to a non-binding agreement called Contrat d’Avenir three months
before the reform was implemented. This agreement, which was signed on April 28th 2009, offered
precise directives on how the tax cut should be used to benefit consumers, and to increase both
employment and investment.10 However, the limited decrease in prices we observe in the 30 months
following the reform signals that the Contrat d’Avenir played a limited role.
        At the same time the French government removed a payroll subsidy to which all restaurants
and hotels had been eligible since August 2004, and which had been introduced as a temporary
measure to stimulate employment in restaurants and hotels. The monthly amount of the subsidy
received for each employee hired depended on whether the worker was paid close to minimum wage,
and on the tenure of the firm, and reached a maximum of 1,368 euros per year.11 While the timing
    9
      Harju et al. (2017) focus on a VAT cut for sit-down restaurants in Finland and show that small firms are less
likely to cut their prices than larger firms.
   10
      See section A.1 in the appendix of the paper for details on the Contrat d’Avenir.
   11
      See the appendix of the paper for more information on the subsidy program.



                                                        3
of the subsidy removal overlapped with the VAT reform, previous studies have shown that the
employment effects of the subsidy were limited.12 We discuss and address these concerns in more
details in section 5 and conclude that the increase in wages we find is unlikely to be due to the
effects of the removal of the payroll subsidy.


1.2     Employment and Wages in the Restaurant Sector

Restaurants are an important part of the economy in France. According to the INSEE, the share
of consumer spending on restaurants has increased from 5.1 percent to 5.9 percent between 1960
and 2007, while the share on food expenditures has decreased from 31.4 percent to 21.9 percent.13
Around two thirds of consumer spending on food services outside the home goes to sit-down and
fast-food restaurants, with the remaining third spent on caterers, canteens, bars and cafeterias.
      While the industry has been growing over the years, the traditional structure of sit-down restau-
rants has not changed over time. According to FAFIH (2011), which reports employment charac-
teristics for French restaurants and hotels, around 47 percent of workers were employed in estab-
lishments with less than 10 workers in 2010, while 14 percent were in restaurants or hotels with
more than 50 workers. In addition, sit-down restaurants are highly labor-intensive: labor costs are
a major cost in restaurants, and wage setting dynamics can be summarized as follows.
      First, labor is not very flexible. Indeed, around 78 percent of individuals working in restaurants
and hotels were hired with open-ended contracts (Contrat à Durée Indeterminée – CDI) in 2013,
while around 16 percent had fixed-term contracts (Contrat à Durée Determinée – CDD). CDI
are contracts that are very hard to revoke: if a worker is fired, employers can incur substantial
penalties. It is also costly to fire a worker under a CDD contract, but employers are not required
to extend expired contracts.14 The remaining share of workers is composed of apprentices, workers
whose employment is subsidized by the government (Contrats Aidés), and owners, who account for
1.8 percent of the industry workforce.
      Secondly, a considerable fraction of workers are minimum wage employees. The French minimum
wage (SMIC, Salaire Minimum Interprofessionel de Croissance) is set at the national level and
applies to all employees and types of firms. It is indexed to both inflation and past wage growth
and is raised every year in July. The wage varies depending on the employee’s tenure and job
 12
    See for example Houel (2010) for a description of the effects of the subsidy program.
 13
    See Consales et al. (2009) for a more detailed analysis.
 14
    Details on these contractual forms can be found in appendix section A.3.

category, and in 2015 started at 9.61 euros per hour. Seguin (2011) estimated that in restaurants
and hotels, around 40 percent of employees were paid the minimum wage in 2003, compared to
12-15 percent nation-wide.
    Lastly, wage setting is unaffected by collective bargaining because the industry is dominated by
very small firms and collective agreements are very scarce (Fougère et al. (2010)). This feature dif-
ferentiates the restaurant sector from other sectors of the economy, where annual wage negotiations
between employer associations and union or employee representatives occurs at both the industry
and company level.


2     Data

Our analysis combines firm-level balance sheet information with aggregate national price indexes
in the period 2004-2012. Annual data on French firms’ balance sheets come from the Bureau van
Dijk (BvD) AMADEUS dataset, which covers all private firms reporting to local tax authorities
and/or data collection agencies.15 The data include standard income statement and balance sheet
information such as total turnover, cost of employees, profits, material costs, and firms’ assets
and liabilities. The data also contain detailed information on the industry in which the firm
operates, which allows us to distinguish between sit-down restaurants and other firms operating in
the restaurant industry, such as take-away restaurants. Industries are classified according to the
NAF Rev.2 classification, the French national statistical classification of activities introduced in
2008. Each firm in the dataset is associated with a unique industry code, corresponding to its main
activity. For instance, if a restaurant offers both sit-down and take-away services, it only receives
one industry code. Although this could be a potential source of bias in our analysis, the data do not
allow us to control for it. VAT rates do not specifically apply to restaurants but rather to goods.
Therefore if a restaurant is classified as sit-down but offers take-out food, the VAT rate applied to
this transaction should be the take-out rate. In practice, prices are VAT-inclusive and restaurants
rarely charge different prices for sit-down and take-out meals.
    We only consider unconsolidated balance sheets to avoid biasing our estimates with any report-
ing manipulation that could occur between a subsidiary and its parent company. Unconsolidated
data constitute around 70 percent of observations in the AMADEUS data.16
  15
     Access to AMADEUS was obtained through the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) license. The dataset
includes around 1/3 of French sit-down restaurants, and the universe comprises around 100,000 establishments per
year.
  16
     Most of the remaining share of firm level observations is constituted by firms with limited financial information.


                                                          5
    In addition, our analysis focuses on firms providing information on their number of employees.
While only half of unconsolidated balance sheets contained in AMADEUS has information on the
average number of employees, this information allows us to distinguish between the employment
and wage effects of the reform.17
    As shown in Table 1, which displays summary statistics for our treatment and control groups,
this selection leaves us with 147,958 sit-down restaurants, 1,482,447 firms operating in non-restaurant
market services, and 1,737,234 non-restaurant small firms in the period 2004-2012.
    We are primarily interested in estimating the effect of the reform on the number of employees,
the cost per employee (which includes wages, salaries and taxes on salaries), the return to owners
of sit-down restaurants (which we call return to capital) and the cost of materials purchased by sit-
down restaurants. While the number of employees, the cost per employee and cost of materials are
measured directly in AMADEUS, the return to capital is a measure we compute by subtracting the
cost of employees, the cost of materials and other expenses from a firm’s total sales. The return to
capital is therefore a residual measure which includes firm profits, depreciation, interest payments
and expenses that are neither labor nor material goods expenses.18 Throughout the analysis, return
to capital represents gross income received by firm owners, either in the current period (in the form
of profits), or in the future (through investment in the current period):


                  Return to Capitalj = Salesj − Material Costsj − Cost of Employeesj


Monthly price data for sit-down meals consumed in France are from the French National Institute of
Statistics (INSEE), while prices for our control groups are computed using Eurostat monthly price
data.19 Eurostat provides information on the price of goods by 4-digit Classification of Individual
Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP) as well as weights used to compute aggregate
indexes. While we cannot distinguish between the price charged by small firms versus large firms,
we use this information to compute the average price of goods sold in the economy in non-restaurant
market services and non-restaurant firms.
Consolidated data account for only 0.2 percent of observations in the period 2004-2012.
  17
     At the end of the paper we show that our evidence on aggregate outcomes is robust to including the full sample
of firms, which includes those without employment information.
  18
     For example, operating expenses (purchase of capital goods and supplies, repair and improvements, advertising
and promotion, etc.), occupancy and utilities expenses (rent, real estate taxes, utilities, property insurance), as well
as general and administrative expenses.
  19
     The INSEE surveys around 200,000 commodities across 27,000 firms every month, from which it constructs its
price indexes by consumption category. See Lafféter and Sillard (2014) for a detailed description of the INSEE survey
methodology.


                                                           6
         Finally, we use information on hours and days worked per week from the labor force survey
Enquete Emploi en Continu (EEC), which contains detailed information on employment (as well
as unemployment and training activities) over the twelve months prior to the date of the interview.
The survey samples around 400,000 individuals per year and interviews them for six quarters. It
contains self-reported information on the industry of employment, the total number of hours worked
during a reference week, and the number of hours worked above the legal limit set by French law.


3         Empirical Strategy

3.1        Mean Impact Estimation

In order to effectively model the mean impact of the VAT change, we use a difference-in-differences
(DD) framework, in which T denotes the treatment group affected by the tax reform, and C is the
control group. In the mean impact estimation we consider the pre-reform period 2004-2008 and
limit the post-reform period to 2009-2011, given that an additional VAT reform was implemented
in the restaurant sector on January 1, 2012, when the VAT rate was raised from 5.5 to 7 percent.
The mean effect of the VAT reform on the outcomes of interest is estimated with the following
unweighted regression:20


                               log Yidt = η · 1{i ∈ T } × Af ter + λt + ωi + idt                                  (1)


where i indexes the individual firm, d indicates the département in which the firm is located, t
indexes the year in which the outcome is measured, Af ter is a dummy variable equal to one in the
post-reform period 2009-2011 and Y represents each balance sheet item of interest (profits, cost
of employees, cost of material goods etc.).21 In addition, the estimation model includes year fixed
effects λt , which controls for differences across years shared by the treatment and control groups,
and firm fixed effects ωi , which controls for firm characteristics that do not change over time. As a
    20
     While weighting does change the magnitude of the estimated coefficients slightly, reducing the incidence of the
tax on employees and firm owners, we believe that un-weighted estimates are preferable for our analysis. First they
are more likely to reflect the average response of a firm in the economy. Given that 90 percent of sit-down restaurants
have less than ten employees (and a within group average of 4 employees per firm) while the remaining 10 percent
hires around 19 employees per firm, weighting by number of employees would increase the weight on the medium-sized
and large firms. Second, very small firms are under-represented in AMADEUS, meaning that our estimates already
assign higher weight to firms that are larger than the population average. Weighting by number of employees would
exacerbate this problem.
  21
     France is divided into 96 départements, which are administrative divisions whose land area covers around 2300
square miles on average, and median population around 500,000 in 2001, which is around 21 times the median
population of a U.S. county.


                                                          7
result, our identification strategy uses within firm variation across time once aggregate differences
over time are controlled for.22
       The error term idt is clustered by département to control for the possibility of within group
correlation among firms located in the same geographical area. idt captures unobserved individual
× département × year shocks to the outcome of interest. It is also assumed to be uncorrelated
with the regressor of interest, so that


                                     E[idt × (1{i ∈ T } × Af ter)|λt , ωi ] = 0


is satisfied. While this identifying assumption is not directly testable in the data, it would be
violated only if there were omitted factors that are not controlled by firm characteristics and that
affect the treatment and control groups differentially over time.
       Our preferred control group includes all non-restaurant firms operating in market services. The
definition of market services follows the INSEE definition and includes services that are compara-
ble to the restaurant industry because of their similar nature, but not directly substitutable with
restaurants.23 It includes wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles;
accommodation service activities; information and communication; financial and insurance activ-
ities; real estate activities; professional, scientific and technical activities; and administrative and
support service activities. It excludes sectors that are not traded on the market such as transporta-
tion, public administration activities, education, human health and social work activities as well as
entertainment and recreation activities.24


3.2      Estimates of Dynamic Effects

The mean impact estimation defined above does not provide evidence on the dynamics of the
adjustment in the outcomes we are interested in. We extend the previous analysis by assessing
how quickly the variables we are interested in react to the change in the VAT, and how the impact
evolves over time. This allows us to assess whether changes are long-lasting, and informs our
  22
      In principle we could also include observable firm characteristics that change over time and across individual
firms: legal status, the amount of fixed assets (tangible, intangible and other), the amount of current assets (stocks,
debt and other), the amount of non-current assets (long-term debt and other) and current liabilities (loans, creditors
and other) and the amount of shareholder funds (capital and other). In practice however they do not change the
results substantially and may be mechanically correlated with the outcomes of interest.
   23
      In principle one could restrict the set of services considered even further by only including services that are offered
to consumers and not to corporations. This would for example exclude services like financial and insurance activities.
Results do not change substantially if we narrow the control to only include consumer services.
   24
      See data appendix for a detailed description of services included in the analysis.


                                                             8
incidence analysis, which distinguishes between short-run, medium-run and long-run effects of the
reform. In order to explore the dynamics, we augment our main model with leads and lags indicator
variables and consider the period 2004-2012:

                                    q
                                           ην · 1{i ∈ T } × 1{t = ν} + λt + ωi + idt
                                    X
                       log Yidt =                                                                     (2)
                                    ν=−k


where λt capture shocks across years that are common to both the treatment and the control group.
Given that we are controlling for time-invariant characteristics of the treatment group, not all the
difference-in-difference coefficients are identified. For this reason, we normalize the coefficient on the
event dummy in 2008 to be zero. The coefficients of interest ην deliver event-study like coefficients,
and allow us to quantify the effect of the reform every year before and after it is implemented. It
can be interpreted as the percent change in the outcome of interest in each given year relative to
the pre-reform year assuming that, absent the tax change, the difference between treatment and
control groups would have been the same as in 2008.


4     Results

In this section we show evidence on aggregate prices around the time of the reform and discuss
the evidence on both the average and dynamic effects of the VAT cut on the number of employees
per firm, the cost of employees, the cost of material goods purchased and the return to sit-down
restaurant owners.
    Overall, our estimates suggest that the VAT reform caused a decrease in prices, as well as
an increase in the cost of employees, the cost of materials purchased and the return to sit-down
restaurant owners. We show that the reform had a small effect on the quantity of goods sold.
In addition, as described below, the reform did not produce a statistically significant increase in
employment: neither the number of employees hired by each firm nor the number of sit-down
restaurants increased significantly around the time of the reform.


4.1   Effect on Prices

Our price analysis compares the price of sit-down meals to the price of non-restaurant market
services. We observe a discontinuous drop in the price of sit-down meals at the time of the reform
in July 2009. Panel a. of Figure 1 shows that it was small relative to the VAT cut. Prices dropped



                                                       9
by around 1.3 percent in the first month after the reform, while the VAT cut amounted to 14.1
percent, implying a pass-through of 9.7 percent.25
       Panel b. of Figure 1 shows the log-difference between the seasonally adjusted price of sit-down
meals and the price of market services relative to June 2009.26 The Figure shows that, relative to
the control group, the price of sit-down meals dropped by around 2.1 percent in the month after
the reform, that the log-difference increased until the beginning of 2010, and that it started to
decrease from then on to reach around 1.9 percent in December 2011. This evidence suggests that
while the VAT cut had an immediate effect on prices using market services as a comparison, it was
both small and temporary.27
       We also use an alternative control group which, though not as desirable as non-restaurant
market services, serves as a robustness check to our findings. Given that most sit-down restaurants
are small firms with less than 10 employees, we consider all non-restaurant small firms as a second
control group. In our sample, around 90 percent of sit-down restaurants are small firms, which is
close to the aggregate data reported by the INSEE, according to which 86 percent of restaurants
employ less than 10 workers. This second control group is not as close to sit-down restaurants as
market services in terms of the nature of the activity, but is more comparable in terms of firm
size.28
       While the pass-through of the VAT cut was low, the true effect on prices could have been even
  25
      The small drop in prices following a VAT cut is consistent with the more general findings of Benzarti et al. (2017):
the authors consider a large set of commodities across European countries over 20 years, and show that prices respond
less to VAT decreases relative to VAT increases. The authors also show that the pass-through of the tax is especially
small if one compares the 2009 reform to the 2012 and 2014 reforms, when the VAT rate on restaurants was raised
from 5.5 to 7 percent and from 7 to 10 percent respectively. The pass-through to prices amounted to 49% for the
2012 reform, and 38 percent for the 2014 reform.
   26
      We seasonally adjust the price series estimating monthly fixed effects for the period January 2004 to December
2011, and subtracting them to the non-seasonally adjusted series provided by both the INSEE and EUROSTAT. In
the price data, market services include COICOP commodities that EUROSTAT classifies as services and that are
produced in sectors that the INSEE classifies as non-restaurant market services. See the data appendix for more
details on the list of services considered.
   27
      A direct implication is that the before-tax producer price charged by restaurants increased considerably after
the reform. If prices dropped by 2.1 percent, and the cost of materials had remained unchanged, both sales and
value-added would have increased by 12 percent. In practice value-added increased by less than that because the cost
of materials purchased by restaurants also went up in 2009.
   28
      While other restaurants (which includes both cafes and other self-service catering (56.10B) and take-away restau-
rants (56.10C)) would also seem at first glance to be an appealing control group because it has similar characteristics
to the sit-down restaurants sector and was not affected by the VAT reform, we do not consider it in our analysis.
First, from a consumer perspective, it is likely that sit-down restaurants and other restaurant services are highly
substitutable. Therefore, when sales increase in one sector, they probably decrease in the other sector as consumers
move from one to the other. Secondly, from a producer perspective, other restaurants might react to price changes
in sit-down restaurants by adjusting their own prices in the same direction. This is consistent for example with
the evidence in panel c. of Figure 1 and is likely to bias our difference-in-differences estimation downward. Finally,
there is a large pre-trend in the difference between prices of sit-down restaurant meals and goods consumed in other
restaurants.


                                                           10
lower if sit-down restaurants had increased their prices in anticipation of the reform. This concern
is shared by the study of Lafféter and Sillard (2014), which points out that prices increased at an
unusually high rate in the months preceding the reform. Though this is a possibility, the increase
in price observed for restaurants and hotels in the period January 2008-July 2009 was not specific
to France but was also observed in other European countries, as reported in Lafféter and Sillard
(2014). It is possible that this increase had been partly driven by the increase in the international
price of food materials, which peaked in the middle of 2008.
       Furthermore, the change in VAT rate applied to sit-down restaurants was approved by the
European Commission in January 2009, while the increasing price trend started at the beginning
of 2008. It is therefore unlikely that the observed price increase was due to restaurant owners
anticipating the reform. As shown in panel d. of Figure 1, a counterfactual price distribution
which incorporated anticipatory effects in the months prior to the reform would lead to an even
lower benefit of the VAT cut to consumers.


4.2      Effect on Balance Sheet Items

Table 2 shows the mean effect of the reform on balance sheet variables, estimated by specification
(1). Column (1) of Table 2 shows that there was no effect on firm employment while column (2)
of Table 2 shows that the cost per employee increased by 3.9 percent after the reform.29 Figure 3
uses equation (2) to estimate the dynamic effects of the reform and shows that there was no effect
on number of employees (panel a.) and an increase in the cost of employees that lasts until 2012
(panel b.). The estimated coefficients displayed in Figure 3 confirm that the number of workers
employed by each sit-down restaurant did not change significantly after the reform. Although the
average number of employees in each given firm also did not change, a possible concern is that
firms entered the market at the time of the reform, thereby increasing total employment: we do
not find evidence of this pattern in our sample.30 We therefore conclude that the reform did not
have a significant effect on employment, which is consistent with the fact that the output produced
  29
      While the increase could have been due to either an increase in wages and salaries or an increase in the employer’s
share of payroll taxes on wages, we later show evidence supporting the conclusion that wages and salaries increased
slightly after the reform. In addition, panel b. of Figure 3 shows that the effect on the average cost per employee is
long-lasting. The Figure, which plots event-time coefficients for the period 2004-2012, shows that in the pre-reform
period 2004-2008 the difference in the average cost per employee between sit-down restaurants and market services
is zero relative to 2008, while it is positive and strongly significant in the years following the reform.
   30
      See appendix Figure A.2. A limitation is that AMADEUS only records information on firms that are required to
report to local tax authorities and misses information on small firms. Our results are therefore missing the potential
positive effect on employment driven by unrecorded small sit-down restaurants increasing employment more than
small firms offering non-restaurant market services.


                                                           11
by sit-down restaurants also did not change significantly, as shown in Figure 2.
    The reform had a positive effect on both profits and return to capital. Column (3) of Table 2
shows that the return to capital increased by around 10 percent in the post-reform period, while
column (4) indicates that profits (which are one component of the return to capital) increased by
18 percent.31 The dynamic effects of the reform on the return to capital and profits are shown
respectively in panel a. of Figure 4 and panel c. of Figure 3.32 Panel a. of Figure 4 shows that
the return to capital increased by around 10 percent from 2008 to 2009, that it kept increasing in
2010, and that it started decreasing in 2011, perhaps because of increasing competitive pressures
in the industry. Given the downward trend in the log-difference between the return to capital of
sit-down restaurants and non-restaurant market services, we also show in panel c. of Figure 4 that
taking into account this downward trend would lead to an even higher benefit of the VAT cut to
restaurant owners.
    Lastly, panel d. of Figure 3 shows that the VAT reform had an effect on the cost of material
goods. This increase could be due to either an increase in the price of material goods: suppliers
try to extract the rent generated by the VAT cut by increasing their prices. It could also be due
to an increase in the “quantity” of material goods: while we find no effects on the volume of goods
sold, it could be that restaurants are providing better quality meals or investing in improving their
restaurant.33
    Overall, the reduced-form evidence is consistent with sit-down restaurant owners being the
main beneficiaries of the VAT cut. This finding is in contrast with the goals set by the Government
directives contained in the Contrat d’Avenir, which demanded the VAT cut to be equally split
between consumers, employees and restaurant owners. The results therefore raise questions on the
effectiveness of non-binding government directives in significantly affecting firm price setting and
hiring decisions.
  31
     Given that the average profit-per-employee in 2008 was 2,500 euros, our findings suggest that total profits
increased by about 2,250 euros for an average sit-down restaurants hiring 5 employees.
  32
     Alternative measures of return to capital can be used. For example, one could exclude depreciation and interest
payments from our measure of return to capital. In practice this does not substantially change our results. Panel b.
of Figure 4 shows how our results change when using alternative measures of return to capital.
  33
     In addition, an increase in the per-unit cost of inputs purchased might be due to reasons that are unrelated to the
reform, such as an increase in the international price of the commodities used by restaurants. While this is unlikely
to be the case for food commodities, which did not change dramatically throughout 2009, we cannot completely rule
out this mechanism as we do not observe the exact composition of the inputs purchased.




                                                          12
5         Are Wages Really Higher?

5.1        No Increase In Hours Worked

We show that the observed change in the cost per employee reflects an increase in the hourly wage
rather than an increase in the number of hours worked. While hours worked per week are highly
regulated in France, employees are allowed to work supplementary hours in an amount that varies
with firm size, the nature of the business and the period of the year. The national legal limit on
hours worked is 39 hours per week for restaurant employees, which is higher than the 35 hours
per week in most of the other sectors of the economy. Supplementary hours are allowed with
the condition that total hours do not exceed 48 per week.34 It is therefore possible that employees
adjusted their hours worked after the reform, and that the increase in the average cost per employee
observed is due to increased working hours rather than increased wages.
         In order to test for this, we use survey data from the Enquete Emploi en Continu (EEC) and
estimate dynamic effect coefficients for changes in hours worked using within region and across
time variation in hours worked:35

                                            q
               log hirt = γ · 1{i ∈ T } +          δν · 1{i ∈ T } × 1{t = ν} + Xirt + λt + ωr + irt

                                                                                                                 (3)
                                            ν=−k


where hirt is a measure of the labor intensity of individual i employed in region r in year t,
the treatment group T includes all employees of sit-down restaurants, Xirt includes individual
characteristics, λt are year fixed effects, ωr are region fixed effects, and standard errors are clustered
by region.36 The outcome variables we focus on are self-reported measures of the number of hours
worked during a reference week (both base and supplementary), as well as the average number of
days worked in a given week.37 Table 3 and Figure 5 use specification (3) to show that there was
no statistically significant response in the number of hours and days worked.
    34
     60 hours per week are allowed under very specific circumstances.
    35
     France is divided into 27 administrative regions, which are larger than départements, and are the most detailed
geographic information contained in the EEC data.
  36
     We include age, gender, education, tenure, occupation, marital status, number of employed workers, number of
unmarried children living in the household, establishment size, firm size, birth region, and quarter in which worker
was surveyed.
  37
     Considering alternative definitions of hours worked such as the number of hours normally worked in a given week
or the number of hours corresponding to the salary declared in the survey does not change the results.

5.2      The Effect of the Payroll Subsidy Cut

So far, we have interpreted the post-reform increase in the cost per employee as an increase in
wages and salaries rather than an increase in payroll taxes. In this section we substantiate this
claim by showing that the payroll subsidy cut that took place in July 2009, at the same time the
VAT cut was implemented, had limited effect on the cost per employee. All restaurants and hotels
had been eligible for a monthly payroll subsidy for each employee hired since 2004, and the amount
varied based on the employee’s wage and the tenure of the firm.38 This payroll subsidy expired in
July 2009, raising the cost of employees hired by restaurants and hotels.
      The effect of the removal of the payroll subsidy is likely to be limited compared to the VAT cut
because the payroll subsidy granted to hotels and restaurants was substantially smaller than the
2009 VAT cut. Payroll subsidies were at most 1,368 euros per employee per year, while the VAT cut
was a 14.1 percent reduction in the tax on total value-added. Given that the average value-added in
our sample is around 300,000 euros, and that each sit-down restaurants hires around 5.5 employees,
it follows that on average the VAT cut resulted in savings of around 7,500 euros per employee per
year.
      In order to take into account this additional effect on the cost of employees we compare the
evolution of the cost of employees in the hotel industry, which was affected by the subsidy cut but
not the VAT cut, to that of the same outcome in non-restaurant market services, which was not
affected by the subsidy cut nor the VAT cut.
      Our treatment group includes three sub-sectors of the hotel industry: (a) hotels and similar
accommodation, (b) holiday and other short-stay accommodation and (c) camping grounds and
recreational vehicle parks. We denote the treatment group by SC and compare it to firms in market
services by estimating:


                               log Yidt = α · 1{i ∈ SC} × Af ter + λt + ωi + idt                  (4)


where λt are year fixed effects, ωi are firm fixed effects and α measures the change in the outcome
variable Y in the period 2009-2011 when one compares the hotel industry to non-restaurant market
services. Table 4 shows that removing the hiring subsidy had a negative effect on employment, while
having a positive effect on the remaining variables. We use the estimated α for each of the outcome
variables and subtract them from the coefficients in our main estimates, which includes both the
 38
      See appendix section 3 for details on the payroll subsidy program.



                                                          14
effect of the VAT cut and the effect of the payroll subsidy cut. We report these deflated event-
type coefficients in Figure 6. We find that – holding constant the payroll subsidy – the effect of
the VAT cut on cost per employee, return to capital and cost of materials are similar to the ones
reported using our main specification. However, had the payroll subsidy been in place, we would
have observed an increase in the number of employees caused by the VAT cut. Therefore, the
reason why we observe no increase in hiring following the VAT cut is due to the removal of the
payroll subsidy.


5.3   Restaurant Owners Have No Tax Incentive to Reclassify Profits as Wages

It is also unlikely that the cost per employee increased as a result of sit-down restaurant owners
paying higher wages to themselves. This is unlikely because restaurant owners in France are pri-
marily self-employed, and it is more beneficial for self-employed individuals to declare income in the
form of profits, an incentive that the VAT cut did not change. Restaurants in France are considered
part of the artisants, commercants et industriels (craftsmen and traders) sector and are subject
to a specific tax regime, under which the tax on firm owners is lower than the tax on employees.
Profits in this sector, from which firm owners pay themselves, are called revenue mixte by the fiscal
authority and are treated as a mix of wage and profit income. The revenue mixte is subject to a
sum of income tax and an artisants, commercants et industriels specific payroll tax rate, which is
lower than the regular payroll tax rate paid by employees because firm owners do not contribute
to (and are therefore not eligible for) unemployment insurance. Hence reducing firm profits to
increase wages and salaries would not be beneficial from a tax perspective. We therefore conclude
that, even if small restaurants were managed by several individuals – some of whom could be family
members hired as employees – it is unlikely that firm owners reclassified value-added from profits
to wages.


6     Welfare Analysis

6.1   Theory

In this section we build on the theoretical framework of Auerbach and Hines (2002) and develop a
formula that allows us to empirically estimate the share of the consumption tax falling on consumers,
employees, firm owners and sellers of material goods. The framework defined in Auerbach and Hines
(2002) shows that while the marginal excess burden created by an increase in consumption taxes can


                                                 15
be of first order significance if a tax is already in place, the first order welfare effect of the tax is given
by the change in the revenue collected keeping quantities fixed and is a reasonable approximation
for the total welfare effect of the tax.39 This framework offers a reasonable approximation of the
incidence of the reform we consider in this paper given that, as documented above, the reform did
not have large effect on output and employment in the restaurant industry.
       Figure 7 illustrates the effect of a VAT cut on consumers. In order to build intuition, we consider
the scenario in which prices faced by consumers decrease by exactly the amount of the tax change,
that is p1 = p0 + ∆τ . The change in total revenue produced by the tax equals A-D, with A being
the loss in revenue on the quantity sold before the reform, and D being the revenue collected on
the additional units sold as the tax is lowered. Given that the deadweight loss decreases by C+D
with the tax cut, the overall welfare effect of the tax equals A+C, where A is first-order and C
is second-order. In our analysis, we are assigning shares of the first order welfare effect of the
tax A to consumers, employees, firm owners, and sellers of material goods. If, as it is the case in
Figure 7, the price cut observed after the reform equals the pre-reform price plus the tax change
(p1 = p0 + ∆τ ), then consumers are the only beneficiaries of the tax cut, because the change in
tax revenue (holding quantities fixed) corresponds to the first order effect of the tax on consumers.
If instead p1 > p0 + ∆τ (p1 < p0 + ∆τ ), then the effect on consumers is smaller (larger) than
the change in tax revenue, and some of the tax cut is distributed to (paid by) employees, sellers of
material goods and firm owners through changes in wages (wx ), per-unit cost of material goods (cx )
and the return to capital (rx ). In a perfectly competitive market, the value of output is distributed
between capital, labor and sellers of material goods. Using the envelope theorem we have that:


                              (1 − τ )px dX = wx dLx + (1 − τ )cx dMx + rx dKx


and therefore ignore changes in quantities produced by the tax cut. The first order welfare effect of
the tax is thus given by the sum of the extra revenue collected on the pre-reform value-added and
the extra revenue collected from the increase in value-added produced by the change in the price
  39
     While the framework defined in Auerbach and Hines (2002) is mostly suited to studying differential changes in
taxes and prices, the change in revenue keeping quantities fixed is a better approximation of the total welfare effect
of the tax than the change in the total revenue collected after the tax change, which would include the extra revenue
raised on the units sold previous to the tax change and the revenue loss from the decrease in quantity sold.




                                                         16
of output and material goods:


       dτ [Xpx − cx Mx ] + τ [Xdpx − Mx dcx ] = Xdpx + Lx (−dwx ) + Kx (−drx ) + Mx (−dcx )


It follows that the burden of the tax on consumers, employees, capital owners and sellers of material
goods can be decomposed as:

                    d ln px                                 d ln wx
                                            −γ
       dτ (1 − δ) + τ (d ln px − δd ln cx )    dτ (1 − δ) + τ (d ln px − δd ln cx )
       |               {z                 } |                  {z                 }
               Share on Consumers                      Share on Employees
                                  d ln rx                                 d ln cx
       − (1 − γ − δ)                                      −δ                                      =1   (5)
                     dτ (1 − δ) + τ (d ln px − δd ln cx )    dτ (1 − δ) + τ (d ln px − δd ln cx )
         |                     {z                       } |                  {z                 }
                      Share on Capital Owners                   Share on Sellers of Material Goods


In this formula, each term is divided by the first order welfare effect of the tax on value-added, and
the sum of the incidence shares is guaranteed to sum to one. While for example firm owners might
also be consumers of the taxed good, this simple framework is useful to separate the incidence of
the tax on the different groups, keeping everything else equal. If a firm owner is also a consumer,
then the overall incidence on that individual takes into account both the incidence on consumers
and the incidence on firm owners.


6.2   Results

In this section we use the reduced form estimates and the formula derived above to compute the
incidence of the VAT reform on consumers, employees, sellers of material goods and firm owners.
Figure 8 shows our incidence estimates, and focus on three time horizons, which correspond to the
normal firms’ balance sheet closing dates (December of 2009, 2010 and 2011). These three time
horizons help create an overlap between firm balance sheet information, which is recorded only
once a year, and the monthly price data. We denote the short-run as 6 months after the reform
(December 2009), the medium-run as 18 months after the reform (December 2010), and the long-
run as 30 months after the reform (December 2011). December 2011 is a reasonable choice for our
longest time horizon because a new VAT reform was implemented on January 1st 2012, when the
VAT rate on all restaurants was raised from 5.5 to 7 percent.
   To implement equation (5) empirically we need information on the percent changes in px , wx ,
cx and rx , as well as the sales share going to consumers, employees, sellers of material goods and



                                                     17
firm owners. Therefore we use the ην ’s from Table 2 estimated in the reduced form analysis to
approximate d ln wx , d ln rx and d ln cx , and the log-differences in prices shown in panel b. of Figure
1 as an estimate for d ln px .40
       We divide each firm’s cost of employees, cost of material goods and return to capital by its total
sales, and compute the average share of sales revenue going to workers (b
                                                                        γ ), sellers of material goods
 b and capital owners (1 −
(δ)                      \ γ − δ) in the pre-reform year 2008. For instance, the share of income
going to employed workers is estimated as:

                                         J          J
                                         X          X Cost of Employeesj
                                   γ
                                   b=          γj =
                                                            Salesj
                                         j=1       j=1


Given that return to capital is total sales minus the cost of employees and materials, this guar-
antees that a firm’s sales are split between firm owners, employees and sellers of material goods.
Empirically, we find that γ                          \
                          b = 0.39, δb = 0.32 and (1 − γ − δ) = 0.29.
       Finally, we approximate the denominator of equation (5) with the sum of the numerators, so
that the shares sum to one. In general, this approximation is reasonable if the reform does not
produce large changes in quantities but mainly affect output and input prices. We show in Table
6 that in the case of the particular reform we analyze the approximation error is not very large.
Besides changes in quantities, in our case the error might also reflects the fact that (1) we are
combining national prices with firm-level balance-sheet information and (2) equation (5) is better
suited for small changes in taxes, while in our scenario we consider a large VAT cut.


Short-Run Incidence           The short-run incidence of the reform is measured in December 2009, six
months after the reform. Panel a. of Table 5 shows that the VAT cut increased the return to capital
by 9.8 percent between June and December 2009. While the number of employees did not change
significantly with the reform, Table 5 shows that the cost of employees and the cost of materials
both increased 6 months after the VAT reform, but less than the return to capital. On average, the
cost of employees went up by 1.5 percent and the cost of materials increased by 3.8 percent. These
estimates, which are weighted by the 2008 sales share as explained in the previous subsection, imply
that the VAT cut largely benefited sit-down restaurant owners. Panel a. of Table 5 shows that
41.4 percent of the incidence was on restaurant owners, as opposed to 8.6 on employees and 17.1
  40
    In the appendix of the paper we also show incidence estimates under two alternative scenarios. First, the first
three columns of Table 7 shows the incidence under the counterfactual price series displayed in panel d. of Figure
1. Second, the last three columns of Table 7 shows the incidence using the counterfactual change in the return to
capital displayed in panel c. of Figure 4 using a linear fit of the pre-reform years 2004-2008.

on sellers of material goods.
    Surprisingly our estimates also suggest that 32.9 percent of the short-run incidence of the tax
fell on consumers, as displayed by the green area in Figure 8. There is one main reason why this
result is likely an upper bound of the incidence on consumers. Our analysis combines national price
data with balance sheet information from a subset of firms sampled in the AMADEUS data: if the
price reaction of the firms not sampled in AMADEUS is smaller than that of the firms we consider,
then our estimated incidence on consumers is larger than it is in the population. While we would
need firm-level price data to address this point fully, smaller firms being less likely to cut prices is
consistent with the evidence provided by Harju et al. (2017).


Medium-Run Incidence The medium-run impact of the reform reflects the effect of the tax 18
months after the reform, in December 2010. Panel b. of Table 5 shows that the cost of employees
increased by 4.7 percent relative to 2008, a larger increase if compared to the short-run effect
reported in panel a. of the same Table. On the other hand, the percent change in the cost of
materials in the medium-run is comparable to the one estimated in the short-run. In addition,
panel b. of Table 5 shows that firm owners are again the main beneficiaries of the tax cut while the
benefit to consumers is smaller in the medium-run than it was in the short-run. The lower incidence
on consumers relates to the medium-run increase in the price of sit-down meals, as shown in Figure
1. Our results for the medium-run incidence on consumers are comparable to what Lafféter and
Sillard (2014) find 18 months after the same reform.41
    On the whole, sit-down restaurant owners share 47 of the benefit from the VAT cut in the
medium-run, as shown by the red area in Figure 8. The share of the VAT cut going to employees
(17.7 percent) is higher 18 months after the reform than it was 6 months after the reform, likely
because wages take some time to adjust, while the share of the VAT cut going to sellers of material
goods (11.8 percent) and consumers (23.5 percent) decreases in the medium-run relative to the
short-run.


Long-Run Incidence            Panel c. of Table 5 shows that in the long-run, which we define as De-
cember 2011 (two and a half years after the VAT cut), the share of the burden on employees and
sellers of material goods increased to 24.5 percent and 15.7 percent respectively. This is consistent
  41
     In their study they compare the price of sit-down meals and other goods to the price of control groups that
are different from ours. Their control groups are the price of goods in other sub-sectors of the restaurant industry,
the price of sit-down restaurants in Italy, and a composite price index. In addition, they assume that with full
                                                        dt
pass-through, prices would decrease by 11.8 percent ( (1+t) = 0.141
                                                              1.196
                                                                    = 11.8%) rather than 14.1 percent.


                                                         19
with lower wage rigidities and with sit-down restaurants purchasing larger amounts of intermediate
goods (or higher quality inputs) in response to changes in demand. On the other hand, and as a
result of the price of sit-down restaurant meals increasing relative to the price of other services in
the economy, the benefit to consumers further decreases (to 18.6 percent) in the long-run. Finally,
as was the case for both our short- and medium-run estimates, sit-down restaurant owners are still
the main beneficiaries of the VAT cut 18 months after the reform. This is shown in both Figure 8
and Table 5: we estimate that 41.2 percent of the incidence of the VAT cut in the long-run is on
sit-down restaurant owners.


Incidence using Counterfactual Distributions             As mentioned in a previous section of the
paper, prices of sit-down restaurant meals increased in the months preceding the reform, likely
because of an increase in the price of international price of food materials. If one interpreted this
increase as an anticipatory effect, a counterfactual price series could be constructed, as shown in
panel d. of Figure 1. If this counterfactual price series was used, the benefit of the VAT cut on
consumers would be even lower and the benefit to restaurant owners would be larger. Our incidence
estimates are shown in the first three columns of Table 7. We show that in this case only 17 percent
of the VAT cut would go to consumers in the medium-run and 11.7 percent in the long-run.
    In addition, the log-difference in the return to capital between sit-down restaurants and non-
restaurant market services had a downward trend in the years preceding the reform. If we used a
line to fit this downward trend, as shown in in panel c. of Figure 4, the benefit on restaurant owners
would be even larger. Our incidence results using this counterfactual log-difference are reported in
the last three columns of Table 7. In this case 52.6 percent of the VAT cut would go to restaurant
owners in the medium-run and 50 percent in the long-run.


7    Robustness Checks

Changes in Local Economic Conditions             In principle the effects we identify could be driven
by changes in local economic conditions that are different for the treatment and control groups.
We therefore add a control for the département unemployment rate:


                   log Yidt = η · 1{i ∈ T } × Af ter + γ · URatedt + λt + ωi + idt




                                                 20
For this purpose we use INSEE data on quarterly unemployment rates by département and compute
the average unemployment rate by département in each given year. Table 8 shows that the results of
our main analysis are robust to controlling for local unemployment rate. The estimated coefficients
are comparable to the ones we get in our main specification, which are reported in Table 2.


Alternative Control Group               The results of the main analysis are also robust to using an alter-
native control group. Table 9 considers non-restaurant small firms as a control group and shows
that the estimated mean impact of the reform is comparable to what we found in our main analysis,
with the exception of the effect on the number of employees.
       Column (1) of Table 9 shows that the effect on the number of employees is positive and sta-
tistically significant. Though this result would seem to undermine the accuracy of the coefficients
estimated in our main analysis, the positive coefficient is unlikely to be driven by the reform. Im-
portantly, panel a. of Figure 9 shows a positive trend even in years preceding the reform, which
suggests that the average size of sit-down restaurants has increased over time.
       The remaining coefficients reported in Table 9 are very similar to the ones found in the main
analysis. Column (2) shows that the cost per employee increased by 3.8 percent, whereas column
(3) and (4) show that the coefficients for return to capital and profits increased by 11 and 20 percent
respectively. Finally, the cost of material goods purchased also increased, though by a slightly lower
amount than estimated in the main analysis.
       The causal effect on prices (shown in Figure A.3) is hard to interpret in this case, given the
positive trend in the pre-reform years, but the log-difference in prices between the treatment and
control group in the post-reform years is similar to what we found when using our main control
group.42 Figure 9 shows dynamic effect coefficients when using non-restaurant small firms as a
control group: the evidence is comparable to the findings of our main analysis, suggesting that our
main estimates are robust.


Full Sample        The main analysis of this paper uses a sample of firms with information on the
number of employees. The main advantage of restricting the sample this way is that we can
  42
      Non-restaurant prices are computed from Eurostat data, taking the national price index excluding energy prices
pall , the restaurant prices prest and weights wrest , and computing:
                                                         pall 100 − prest wrest
                                           pnon−rest =
                                                               100 − wrest
The limitation of this measure is that it reflects the price charged by all rather than just small non-restaurant firms,
for which we do not have specific information.



                                                           21
separate the effect of the reform on wages and salaries from changes in employment. While this
helps the interpretation of our results, it comes at the cost of reducing the sample size by half.
    Figure A.4 shows event-time Figures estimated using the whole sample, when non-restaurant
market services are used as a control group. The Figure shows that the reform had a positive and
statistically significant effect on all the outcomes considered, as in our main analysis.


8    Conclusion

In this paper, we consider a large VAT cut in France and estimate the share of incidence that falls
on consumers, employees, sellers of material goods and sit-down restaurant owners. Differently
from previous papers in the literature, our results provide important insights on the distributional
effects of consumption tax cuts, taking into account the effect on employees and sellers of material
goods.
    Our results show that prices had only decreased by 2 percent thirty months after the VAT
cut, that the cost of employees and material goods increased by 3.9 and 4.4 percent respectively,
and that the return to sit-down restaurants owners increased by around 10 percent. Using these
reduced-form estimates we conduct a welfare analysis and find that : (1) the effect on consumers
was limited, (2) employees and sellers of material goods shared 25 and 16 percent of the total
benefit, and (3) the reform mostly benefited owners of sit-down restaurants.

                                            Source: In panel a. the price with full pass-through is computed assuming that its percent
                                            change is equal to the level difference in the VAT rate, which decreased from 19.6 to 5.5 percent.

                                            restaurant market services uses Eurostat price data and is computed as a weighted average
                                            (using EUROSTAT weights) of seasonally adjusted prices by four digits COICOP. Price series
                                            are seasonally adjusted using monthly dummies. The Figure in panel c. is constructed using
                                            Eurostat and INSEE data. Panel d. shows the same price series as panel b and computes a
                                            counterfactual price difference, constructed from fitting the price change in the period January

Notes: p0 is the pre-reform price of the good, corresponding to a VAT tax rate of 19.6. p0 +∆τ
is the pre-reform price plus the change in the tax rate. If there is full pass-through to prices,
then the welfare effect of the VAT decrease on consumers corresponds to the change in tax
revenue (keeping quantities fixed), implying a 100 percent incidence on consumers.

A       Appendix
A.1       Contrat D’Avenir Details
The Sarkozy government signed the Contrat D’Avenir in April 2009, at the time of the restau-
rant VAT reform we are analyzing. The contract was not binding and only involved unionized
restaurants, which represent approximately 50 percent of the restaurant industry.
    The goal of the contract was to give directives on how to allocate the surplus created by the
reduction in the VAT rate. These directives involved four broad categories: employment; prices;
investments and modernization of the restaurant sector; and work conditions and social dialogue.
    The price directives depended on the type of restaurant:

      • Sit-down restaurants were encouraged to reduce prices by 11.8% for 7 out of the 10 following
        items: appetizer, entree (meat or fish), daily special, dessert, appetizer-entree menu, entree-
        dessert menu, kid’s menu, soda or fruit juice, mineral water, coffee, tea or herbal tea. In case
        a restaurant did not sell at least seven of these products, it could also reduce prices by 11.8%
        for products that represent more than one third of total turnover, excluding alcoholic drinks.

      • Although no tax reduction was enacted in take-out restaurants, the government instructed
        them to reduce price for their reference menus by 5%.

      • Cafes and juice bars: a full incidence of the VAT reduction on the price.

    The employment directives aimed to create 40,000 jobs over two years in addition to the 15,000
jobs that are created in the restaurant industry every year on average.
    The work conditions and social dialogue directives aimed to broadly improve remuneration (for
example, faster salary increases over the years), health coverage and training, and to reduce the
use of illegal workers.
    Finally, the modernization directive aimed at improving employee and customers’ safety (in-
cluding better hygiene), increasing customers’ comfort (for example through the purchase of better
tables and chairs), the acquisition of environmentally friendly equipment, the renewal of electronic
equipment, and increasing the size of the restaurants.
    A report by the Ministere de l’Artisanat, du Commerce et du Tourisme43 attempts to analyze
whether these directives were achieved. A significant issue they struggle with is that no clear
measures were established ex-ante. For example, the price drops the directives suggest are not
given a time frame making it hard to assess.
    It is worth re-emphasizing that these measures were not binding and were not enforced by the
government.

A.2       2004-2009 Payroll Tax Reductions
This government subsidy program, targeting the Hotels Cafés et Réstaurants (HCR) industry, was
implemented in 2004 as a temporary measure to help restaurants before the introduction of the
VAT cut in 2009. The 2004-804 Law established that firms operating in the HCR sector are eligible
for an employment subsidy, initially available for one year and a half. In addition, the 2004-1239
Decree approved on November 22, 2004 defined the criteria for the implementation of the subsidy.

  (a) Different amounts apply to the sub-category Hôtels touristiques avec restaurant. In this case a new firm hir-
  ing an employee earning more than the reference salary gets up to 90 euros.
  (b) Both existing and new bowling alleys and casinos receive 28.6 euros for each worker earning more than the
  reference salary, while both existing and new discos receive 71.5 euros for each worker earning more than the
  reference salary.


The subsidy was subsequently extended to the period 2006-2008 by the 2005-1719 Law (December
30, 2005), the 2006-1666 Law (December 21, 2006) and the 2007-1822 Law (December 24, 2007),
with small changes relative to the original measures. In July 2009, the 2009-888 Law abolished the
subsidy, as the VAT cut from 19.6 to 5.5 percent became effective.
    Subsidies under this program could not be claimed for the following categories of workers:

   • All young workers below 18 years old, who already receive a subsidy of 10-20 percent.

   • Employees hired under one of these contracts: (a) contrat jeune en entreprise, (b) contrat
     initiative emploi, (c) contrat d’apprentissage, (d) contrat d’insertion RMA, (e) contrat de
     l’aide dégressive a l’employeur (ADE), (f) contrat d’accès a l’emploi dans les DOM.

   • Employees for which the employer claims the minimum wage (SMIC) in the hotel industry.

   • Employees working in the following sub-industries: hébergements non touristiques (NAF 55.2
     F), cantines et restaurants d’entreprise (code NAF 55.5A) and restauration collective sous
     contrat (NAF 55.5 C)

   Notice that though these subsidies were industry-specific, restaurants also received government
subsidies that applied to all industries, and that were not abolished in 2009. These included
subsidies on contributions paid (allègements de cotisations sociales) established by the January
2003 Fillon law, which could be received on top of the industry specific subsidies, and subsidies for



                                                         38
firms operating in economically depressed geographic areas,44 which a firm could not receive if it
claimed the industry specific subsidies. Finally, subsidies received by each firm could not be larger
than 200,000 euros over three years, as established by European rules on government subsidies.

A.3     Employment Contract types
Indeterminate Length Contract Indeterminate Length Contracts (Contrats a Duree Indert-
erminee) do not have a specific expiry date. Workers are employed for an undetermined length of
time. Termination occurs if workers decide to quit, if they are fired or if they retire. If workers
are fired, employers are expected to pay them a severance pay. This type of contract usually starts
with a 4-month trial period during which the contract can be terminated at no cost.

Determinate Length Contract Determinate Length Contracts (Contrats a Duree Dertermi-
nee) have a specific expiry date after which the contract is terminated unless it is renewed for an
additional period of time or if the contract is transformed into an Indeterminate Length Contract.
It is estimated that there were 2,250,002 such contracts in 2009.

C      Technical Appendix
In equilibrium, total after-tax firm revenue equals total income, that is:

                                      (1 − τ )(px X − cx Mx ) = wx Lx + rx Kx

By the envelope theorem, we have:

                                (1 − τ )px dX = wx dLx + (1 − τ )cx dMx + rx dKx

In this case the first order effect of the tax is given by:

             Xd(τ px ) − cx Mx dτ − τ Mx dcx = Xdpx + Lx (−dwx ) + Kx (−drx ) + Mx (−dcx )

from which:

                                          are expressed in 2012 euros. The treatment group includes French sit-down restaurants, while
                                          the control group includes all firms in non-restaurant market service sectors (see the data
                                          appendix for details). Information is taken from restaurants’ unconsolidated balance sheets.
                                          The top 1 percent and the bottom 1 percent of the profit-loss distribution are excluded from
                                          both the treatment and the control group.

                                               Notes: The Figures show the dynamic effects of the reform estimated using equation (2),
                                               which includes year and firm fixed effects. The treatment group includes all sit-down restau-
                                               rants, while the control group includes firms in non-restaurant market service sectors. The
                                               Figures consider the full sample of firms with unconsolidated balance sheets. The dashed lines
                                               represent 95 percent confidence intervals.
