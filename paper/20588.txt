                                              ABSTRACT

This paper studies the welfare consequence of increasing trading speed in financial markets. We build
and solve a dynamic trading model, in which traders receive private information of asset value over
time and trade strategically with demand schedules in a sequence of double auctions. A stationary
linear equilibrium and its efficiency properties are characterized explicitly in closed form. Infrequent
trading (few double auctions per unit of time) leads to a larger market depth in each trading period,
but frequent trading allows more immediate asset re-allocation after new information arrives. Under
natural conditions, the socially optimal trading frequency coincides with information arrival frequency
for scheduled information releases, but can (far) exceed information arrival frequency for stochastic
information arrivals. If traders have heterogeneous trading speeds, fast traders prefer the highest feasible
trading frequency, whereas slow traders tend to prefer a strictly lower frequency.

1       Introduction
Trading in financial markets has become significantly faster over the last decade. Today, elec-
tronic transactions for equities, futures, and foreign exchange are typically conducted within
millisecond or microseconds. Electronic markets, which typically have a higher speed than
manual markets, are also increasingly adapted in the over-the-counter markets for debt secu-
rities and derivatives, such as corporate bonds, interest rates swaps, and credit default swaps.
Exchange traded funds, which trade at a high frequency like stocks, have gained significant
market shares over index mutual funds, which only allow buying and selling at the end of day.
    The remarkable speedup in financial markets raises important economic questions. For
example, does a higher speed of trading necessarily lead to a higher social welfare, in terms
of more efficient allocations of assets? What is the socially optimal frequency (if one exists)
at which financial markets should operate? Moreover, given that certain investors trade at a
higher speed than others, does a higher trading frequency affect fast investors and slow ones
equally or differentially? Answers to these questions would provide valuable insights for the
ongoing academic and policy debate on market structure, especially in the context of high-speed
trading (see, for example, Securities and Exchange Commission (2010)).
    In this paper, we set out to investigate the welfare consequence of speeding up trading
in financial markets. We build and solve a dynamic model with strategic trading, adverse
selection, and imperfect competition. Specifically, in our model, a finite number (n ≥ 3) of
traders trade a divisible asset in an infinite sequence of uniform-price double auctions, held
at discrete time intervals. The shorter is the time interval between auctions, the higher is
the speed of the market. At an exponentially-distributed time in the future, the asset pays
a liquidating dividend, which, until that payment time, evolves according to a jump process.
Over time, traders receive private, informative signals of common dividend shocks, as well as
idiosyncratic shocks to their private values for owning the asset. Traders’ values for the assets
are therefore interdependent, creating adverse selection in the trading process.1 Traders also
incur quadratic costs for holding inventories, which is equivalent to linearly decreasing marginal
values. A trader’s dividend signals, shocks to his private values, and his inventories are all his
private information. In each double auction, traders submit demand schedules (i.e., a set of limit
orders) and pay for their allocations at the market-clearing price. All traders take into account
the price impact of their trades and are forward-looking about future trading opportunities.
    Our model incorporates many salient features of dynamic markets in practice. For example,
asymmetric and dispersed information about the common dividend creates adverse selection,
    1
     Throughout this paper, “adverse selection” covers situations in which different traders have different pieces
of information regarding the same asset. In our context “adverse selection” may also be read as “interdependent
values.”


                                                        1
whereas private-value information and convex inventory costs introduce gains from trade. These
trading motives are also time-varying as news arrives over time. Moreover, the number of
double auctions per unit of clock time is a simple yet realistic way to model trading frequency
in dynamic markets.

A dynamic equilibrium and efficiency. Our first main result is the characterization of
a linear stationary equilibrium in this dynamic market, as well as its efficiency properties.
In equilibrium, a trader’s optimal demand in each double auction is a linear function of the
price, his signal of the dividend, his most recent private value, and his private inventory. Each
coefficient is solved explicitly in closed form. Naturally, the equilibrium price in each auction
is a weighted sum of the average signal of the common dividend and the average private value,
adjusted for the marginal holding cost of the average inventory. Prices are martingales since
the innovations in common dividend and private values have zero mean.
    Because there are a finite number of traders, demand schedules in this dynamic equilibrium
are not competitive. Consequently, the equilibrium allocations of assets across traders after
each auction are not fully efficient, but they converge gradually and exponentially over time to
the efficient allocation. This convergence remains slow and gradual even in the continuous-time
limit. (In reality, slow trading of this sort means splitting a large order into many smaller
pieces and executing them over time.) We show that the convergence rate per unit of clock
time increases with the number of traders, the arrival intensity of the dividend, the variance
of the private-value shocks, and the trading frequency of the market; but the convergence rate
decreases with the variance of the common-value shocks, which is a measure of adverse selection.

Welfare and optimal trading frequency. Our modeling framework proves to be an effec-
tive tool in answering welfare questions. Characterizing welfare and optimal trading frequency
in this dynamic market is the second primary contribution of our paper.
    We ask two related questions regarding trading frequency. First, what is the socially optimal
trading frequency if all traders have equal speed? Second, if certain traders are faster than
others, what are the trading frequencies that are optimal for fast and slow traders respectively?
    Homogeneous speed. The first question on homogenous speed can be readily analyzed in our
benchmark model, in which all traders participate in all double auctions. We emphasize that
a change of trading frequency in our model does not change the fundamental properties of the
asset, such as the timing and magnitude of the dividend shocks.
    Increasing trading frequency involves the following important tradeoff. On the one hand, a
higher trading frequency allows traders to react more quickly to new information and to trade
sooner toward the efficient allocation. This effect favors a faster market. On the other hand, a


                                               2
lower trading frequency serves as a commitment device that induces more aggressive demand
schedules (i.e., buy and sell orders are less sensitive to prices), which leads to more efficient
allocations in early rounds of trading. This effect favors a slower market. Analytically, the
allocative inefficiency in this dynamic market relative to the first best can be decomposed into
two components: one part due to strategic behavior and the other due to the delayed responses
to new information. The optimal trading frequency should strike the best balance between
maximizing the aggressiveness of demand schedules and minimizing delays in reacting to new
information.
    We show that depending on the nature of information arrivals, this tradeoff leads to differ-
ent optimal trading frequencies. If new information of dividend and private values arrives at
scheduled time intervals, the optimal trading frequency cannot be higher than the frequency
of new information. In the natural case that all traders are ex-ante identical, the optimal
trading frequency coincides with the information arrival frequency. Intuitively, if information
arrival times are known in advance, aligning trading times with information arrival times would
reap all the benefit of immediate response to new information, while maximizing the average
aggressiveness of demand schedules.
    By contrast, if new information arrives at Poisson times, which are unpredictable, it is
important to keep the market open more often to prevent excessive delays in responding to new
information. Indeed, we show that with ex-ante identical traders and under Poisson information
arrivals, the optimal trading frequency is always higher than two thirds of the information arrival
frequency. Moreover, we show explicit conditions under which the optimal trading frequency is
bounded below by a constant multiple of the information arrival frequency. This lower-bound
multiple is larger if adverse selection is less of a concern. In the special case without adverse
selection, the optimal trading frequency is at least n/2 times the information arrival frequency.
In the limit, as the number of traders n becomes large or as the arrival rate of information
goes to infinity, continuous trading becomes optimal.2 These results suggest that the optimal
trading frequency for a particular asset should roughly increase in the “liquidity” of the asset.
    Heterogeneous speeds. To answer the second question of welfare, we extend the model to
allow heterogeneous trading speeds. In this extension, fast traders access the market whenever
it is open, but slow traders only access the market periodically with a delay. This implies
that fast traders participate in all double auctions, but each slow trader only participates in
a fraction of the auctions. Different from recent studies of high-frequency trading (see the
literature section), fast traders have no information advantage over slow ones.
    We find that fast and slow traders generally prefer different frequencies at which the market
   2
   To clarify, continuous trading in our model means continuous double auctions, not a continuous limit order
book. The latter is effectively a discriminatory-price auction, not a uniform-price auction.



                                                     3
operates. By staying in the market all the time, fast traders in our model play the endoge-
nous role of market-makers: intermediating trades among slow traders who arrive sequentially.
Through intermediation fast traders extract rents. A higher trading frequency reduces the
number of slow traders in each double auction, making the market “thinner” and fast traders’
rents higher. We show that fast traders prefer the highest trading frequency (i.e. the thinnest
market) that is feasible. By contrast, slow traders typically prefer a strictly lower trading fre-
quency (and a thicker market) because they benefit from pooling trading interests over time
and providing liquidity to each other, even though a lower trading frequency implies a higher
average delay cost for them. A broad implication from this analysis is that who designs the
market matters a great deal for everyone.
    Another direct observation from the heterogeneous-speed model is that, due to imperfect
competition and market power, a higher trading frequency creates larger and more abrupt price
reactions to supply and demand shocks (i.e. “price overshooting”), as well as subsequent rever-
sals. These price paths exhibit high short-term volatility and resemble (mini) “flash crashes”
and “flash rallies” observed in electronic markets.

Relation to the literature. The paper closest to ours is Vayanos (1999), who studies a
dynamic market in which the asset fundamental value (dividend) is public information, but
agents receive periodic private inventory shocks. Traders in his model also face imperfect
competition and strategically avoid price impact. Vayanos (1999) shows that, if inventory
shocks are small, then a lower trading frequency is better for welfare by encouraging traders
to submit more aggressive demand schedules.3 We make two main contributions relative to
Vayanos (1999). First, our model allows interdependent values and adverse selection. Adverse
selection makes trading less aggressive and reduces the optimal trading frequency. Second,
our model identifies two channels of welfare losses: One channel, strategic behavior, agrees
with Vayanos (1999), whereas the other, delayed responses to news, complements Vayanos
(1999). The latter channel is absent in Vayanos (1999) because inventory shocks and trading
times always coincide in his model. We show that the latter channel can lead to an optimal
trading frequency that is much faster than information arrival frequency if information arrival
is stochastic. Our result also generates useful predictions regarding how the optimal trading
frequency varies with asset characteristics.
    In another related paper, Rostek and Weretka (2015) study dynamic trading with multi-
ple dividend payments. In their model, traders have symmetric information about the asset’s
   3
    Vayanos (1999) also shows that if inventory information is common knowledge, there is a continuum of
equilibria. Under one of these equilibria, selected by a trembling hand refinement, welfare is increasing in
trading frequency. Because our model has private information of inventories, the private-information equilibrium
of Vayanos (1999) is a more appropriate benchmark for comparison.


                                                       4
fundamental value, and between consecutive dividend payments there is no news and no dis-
counting. In this setting, they show that a higher trading frequency is better for welfare. Our
contribution relative to Rostek and Weretka (2015) is similar to that relative to Vayanos (1999).
First, our model applies to markets with adverse selection. Second, we show that the optimal
trading frequency can be slow or fast, depending on the tradeoff between strategic behaviors
and delayed responses to news.
    Among recent models that study dynamic trading with adverse selection, the closest one
to ours is Kyle, Obizhaeva, and Wang (2014). They study a continuous-time trading model in
which agents have pure common values but “agree to disagree” on the precision of their signals.
Although the disagreement component in their model and the private-value component in ours
appear equivalent, they are in fact very different. As highlighted by Kyle, Obizhaeva, and Wang
(2014), in a disagreement model the traders disagree not only about their values today, but
also about how the values evolve over time; this behavior does not show up in a private-value
model. Therefore, their model and ours answer very different economic questions: Their model
generates “beauty contest” and non-martingale price dynamics, whereas our model is useful for
characterizing the optimal trading frequency.
    The last part of our paper on heterogeneous trading speed is most related to the model
by Duffie (2010), who proposes an inattention-based model to explain asset price behaviors
around large supply or demand shocks. The inattentive and attentive investors in his model
correspond to the slow and fast traders in our model. Going beyond Duffie (2010), our model
has imperfect competition, so price reactions to supply and demand shocks reflect market power
and are hence more volatile. Moreover, from a welfare viewpoint, we find that fast traders in
fact prefer the most volatile, highest-frequency market, because that is where they make the
highest intermediation profits.
    Our heterogeneous-speed results are complementary to existing studies on the welfare con-
sequences of high-frequency trading (HFT). First, the existing theoretical literature on HFT
typically assumes that fast traders also possess superior information about the value of the
asset at the time of trading (see Biais, Foucault, and Moinas (2015), Budish, Cramton, and
Shim (2015), Hoffmann (2014), Jovanovic and Menkveld (2012), and Cespa and Vives (2013)).
By contrast, the fast trader in our model are not more informed speculators but act as rent-
extracting intermediaries. Second, the most commonly raised welfare question in the existing
HFT literature is whether investment in high-speed trading technology is socially wasteful (see
Biais, Foucault, and Moinas (2015), Pagnotta and Philippon (2013), Budish, Cramton, and
Shim (2015), and Hoffmann (2014)). By contrast, our welfare question focuses on how trading
frequency interacts with imperfect competition and the efficient allocations of assets, which is
orthogonal to investments in speed technology.

2     Dynamic Trading in Sequential Double Auctions
This section presents the dynamic trading model and characterizes the equilibrium and its
properties. Main model parameters are tabulated in Appendix A for ease of reference.


2.1    Model
Timing and the double auctions mechanism. Time is continuous, τ ∈ [0, ∞). There
are n ≥ 3 risk-neutral traders in the market trading a divisible asset. Trading is organized as
a sequence of uniform-price divisible double auctions, held at clock times {0, ∆, 2∆, 3∆, . . .},
where ∆ > 0 is the length of clock time between consecutive auctions. The trading frequency
of this market is therefore the number of double auctions per unit of clock time, i.e., 1/∆. The
smaller is ∆, the higher is the trading frequency. We will refer to the time interval [t∆, (t+1)∆)
as “period t,” for t ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Thus, the period-t double auction occurs at the clock time
t∆. The top plot of Figure 1 illustrates the timing of the double auctions.

Figure 1: Model time lines. The top plot shows times of double auctions, and the bottom plot
shows the news times (dividend shocks, signals of dividend shocks, and private value shocks).

    We denote by zi,t∆ the inventory held by trader i immediately before the period-t double
auction. The ex-ante inventories zi,0 are given exogenously. The total ex-ante inventory, Z ≡
P
  i zi,0 , is common knowledge, and we assume that Z does not change over time. (In securities
markets, Z can be interpreted as the total asset supply. In derivatives markets, Z is by definition
zero.) As shown later, while the equilibrium characterization works for any ex-ante inventory
profile {zi,0 }ni=1 , in the analysis of trading frequency we will pay particular attention to the
special case in which all traders are ex-ante identical (i.e. zi,0 = Z/n).
    A double auction is essentially a demand-schedule-submission game. In period t each trader
submits a demand schedule xi,t∆ (p) : R → R. The market-clearing price in period t, p∗t∆ ,
satisfies                                    n

                                                  i=1


                                                           6
In the eventual equilibrium we characterize, the demand schedules are strictly downward-sloping
in p and hence the solution p∗t∆ exists and is unique. The evolution of inventory is given by

                                    zi,(t+1)∆ = zi,t∆ + xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ).                              (2)

After the period-t double auction, each trader i receives xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ) units of the assets at the
price of p∗t∆ per unit. Of course, a negative xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ) is a sale.

The asset. Each unit of the asset pays a single liquidating dividend D at a random future
time T , where T follows an exponential distribution with parameter r > 0, or mean 1/r. The
random dividend time T is independent of all else in the model.
     Before being paid, the dividend D is unobservable and evolves as follows. At time T0 = 0,
                                                              2
D = D0 is drawn from the normal distribution N (0, σD           ). Strictly after time 0 but conditional
on the dividend time T having not arrived, the dividend D is shocked at each of the clock times
T1 , T2 , T3 , . . . . The shock times {Tk }k≥1 can be deterministic or stochastic. The dividend shocks
                                                                                 2
at each Tk , for k ≥ 1, are also i.i.d. normal with mean 0 and variance σD         :

                                                           2
                                      DTk − DTk−1 ∼ N (0, σD ).                                     (3)

We will also refer to {Tk }k≥0 as “news times.” Thus, before the dividend is paid, the unobserv-
able dividend {Dτ }τ ≥0 follows a jump process:

                                    Dτ = DTk , if Tk ≤ τ < Tk+1 .                                   (4)

Therefore, at the dividend payment time T , the realized dividend is DT .
    Since the expected dividend payment time is finite (1/r), for simplicity we normalize the
discount rate to be zero (i.e., there is no time discounting). Allowing a positive time discounting
does not change our qualitative results. Moreover, in the supplemental material to this paper,
we provide an extension in which infinitely many dividends are paid sequentially and there is
a time discount. The main results of this paper are robust to this extension.

Information and preference. At news time Tk , k ∈ {0, 1, 2, · · · }, each trader i receives a
private signal Si,Tk about the dividend shock:

                  Si,Tk = DTk − DTk−1 + i,Tk , where i,Tk ∼ N (0, σ2 ) are i.i.d.,               (5)

and where DT−1 ≡ 0. The private signals of trader i are never disclosed to anyone else. If
signals about dividend shocks were perfect, i.e. σ2 = 0, the information structure of our model

                                                    7
would be similar to that of Vayanos (1999).
    In addition, each trader i has a private value wi,T for receiving the dividend, which can
reflect tax or risk-management considerations. Formally, upon receiving the dividend DT ,
trader i derives an additional benefit wi,T per unit of the asset beyond the common dividend
DT . The private values are also shocked at the news times {Tk }k≥0 , and each private-value
shock is i.i.d. normal random variables with mean zero and variance σw2 :

                                       wi,Tk − wi,Tk−1 ∼ N (0, σw2 ),                                      (6)

where wi,T−1 ≡ 0. Written in continuous time, trader i’s private-value process wi,τ is a jump
process:
                              wi,τ = wi,Tk , if Tk ≤ τ < Tk+1 .                            (7)

The private values to trader i are observed by himself and are never disclosed to anyone else.
  Therefore, if the dividend is paid at time τ , trader i receives

                                              vi,τ ≡ Dτ + wi,τ                                             (8)

per unit of asset held.4
    The bottom plot of Figure 1 illustrates the news times {Tk }k≥0 , when dividend shocks, the
signals of dividend shocks, and the private-value shocks all arrive. The two plots of Figure 1
make it clear that, in our model, the fundamental properties of the asset are separate from the
trading frequency of the market.
    Moreover, in an interval [t∆, (t + 1)∆) but before the dividend D is paid, trader i incurs a
                                  2
“flow cost” that is equal to 0.5λzi,(t+1)∆ per unit of clock time, where λ > 0 is a commonly known
constant. The quadratic flow cost is essentially a dynamic version of the quadratic cost used
in the static models of Vives (2011) and Rostek and Weretka (2012). We can also interpret
this flow cost as an inventory cost, which can come from regulatory capital requirements,
collateral requirement, or risk-management considerations. (This inventory cost is not strictly
risk aversion, however.) Once the dividend is paid, the flow cost no longer applies. Thus,
conditional on the dividend having not been paid by time t∆, each trader suffers the flow cost
for a duration of min(∆, T − t∆) within period t, with the expectation

    As in Wang (1994), the unconditional mean of the dividend here is zero, but one could add a positive
constant to D so that the probability of D < 0 or v < 0 is arbitrarily small. Moreover, in the markets for many
financial and commodity derivatives—including forwards, futures and swaps—cash flows can become arbitrarily
negative as market conditions change over time.

T − t∆ is exponentially distributed with mean 1/r conditional on T > t∆.

Value function and equilibrium definition. For conciseness of expressions, we let Hi,τ be
the “history” (information set) of trader i at time τ :
                              n                                                                    o

That is, Hi,τ contains trader i’s asset value-relevant information received up to time τ , trader
i’s path of inventories up to time τ , and trader i’s demand schedules in double auctions before
time τ . Notice that by the identity zi,(t0 +1)∆ − zi,t0 ∆ = xi,t0 ∆ (p∗t0 ∆ ), a trader can infer from Hi,τ
the price in any past period t0 . Notice also that Hi,t∆ does not include the outcome of the
period-t double auction.
    Let Vi,t∆ be trader i’s period-t continuation value immediately before the double auction at
time t∆. By the definition of Hi,τ , trader i’s information set right before the period-t double
auction is Hi,t∆ . We can write Vi,t∆ recursively as:
                          "
               Vi,t∆ = E − x∗i,t∆ p∗t∆ + (1 − e−r∆ )(zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ )vi,t∆ + e−r∆ Vi,(t+1)∆
                                                                  #

where x∗i,t∆ is a shorthand for xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ). The first term −x∗i,t∆ p∗t∆ is trader i’s net cash flow
for buying x∗i,t∆ units at p∗t∆ each. The second term (1 − e−r∆ )(zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ )vi,t∆ says that if
the dividend is paid during period t, which happens with probability 1 − e−r∆ , then trader i
receives (zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ )vi,t∆ in expectation. (Since shocks to the common dividend and private
values have mean zero, trader i’s expected value is still vi,t∆ even if more news arrives during
period t.) The third term e−r∆ Vi,(t+1)∆ says that if the dividend is not paid during period
t, which happens with probability e−r∆ , trader i receives the next-period continuation value
                                          −r∆
Vi,(t+1)∆ . Finally, the last term − 1−er · λ2 (zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ )2 is the expected quadratic inventory
cost incurred during period t for holding zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ units of the asset (see Equation (9)).

     While trader i’s continuation value Vi,t∆ in principle can depend on anything in his informa-
tion set Hi,t∆ , in the eventual equilibrium we characterize, it will depend on trader i’s current
pre-auction inventory zi,t∆ , his current private value wi,t∆ , and the sum of his private signals

Definition 1 (Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium). A perfect Bayesian equilibrium is a strategy
profile {xj,t∆ }1≤j≤n,t≥0 , where each xi,t∆ depends only on Hi,t∆ , such that for every trader i and
at every path of his information set Hi,t∆ , trader i has no incentive to deviate from {xi,t0 ∆ }t0 ≥t .
That is, for every alternative strategy {x̃i,t0 ∆ }t0 ≥t , we have:

               Vi,t∆ ({xi,t0 ∆ }t0 ≥t , {xj,t0 ∆ }j6=i,t0 ≥t ) ≥ Vi,t∆ ({x̃i,t0 ∆ }t0 ≥t , {xj,t0 ∆ }j6=i,t0 ≥t ).                (13)


2.2     The competitive benchmark equilibrium
Before solving this model with imperfect competition and strategic trading, we first solve a
competitive benchmark in which all traders take prices as given. In doing so, we will also solve
the traders’ inference of the dividend D from equilibrium prices. The solution to this inference
problem in the competitive equilibrium will be used directly in solving the strategic equilibrium
later.
    For clarity, we use the superscript “c” to label the strategies, allocations, and prices in the
competitive equilibrium. In each period t each trader i maximizes his continuation value Vi,t∆ ,
defined in Equation (12), by choosing the optimal demand schedule xci,t∆ (pct∆ ), taking as given
the period-t price and the strategies of his own and other traders in subsequent periods.
    We start by conjecturing that the competitive demand schedule xci,t∆ (pct∆ ) in period t is such
                                                            c
that trader i’s expected marginal value for holding zi,t∆       + xci,t∆ (pct∆ ) units of the asset for the
indefinite future is equal to the price pct∆ , for each pct∆ . That is, we conjecture that

                                                         λ c
                              E [vi,t∆ | Hi,t∆ , pct∆ ] − (zi,t∆ + xci,t∆ (pct∆ )) = pct∆ .                                       (14)

duration of time 1/r. This conjecture can be rewritten as:

                                                         r
                                          c
                      xci,t∆ (pct∆ ) = − zi,t∆ +           (E [vi,t∆ | Hi,t∆ , pct∆ ] − pct∆ ) .             (15)
                                                         λ

    The bulk of the remaining derivation involves finding an explicit expression for E[vi,t∆ |
Hi,t∆ , pct∆ ]. After that the optimal strategy is derived and verified.
    Without loss of generality, let us focus on the period-t double auction and suppose that the
latest dividend shock is the k-th. Conditional on the unbiased signals {Sj,Tl }0≤l≤k of dividend
shocks, trader j’s expected value of the dividend Dt∆ is a multiple of kl=0 Sj,Tl . Moreover, his
                                                                         P

private value, wj,Tk , is perfectly observable to him. We thus conjecture that each trader j uses
the following symmetric linear strategy:

                                             X                         r

                                                     Sj,Tl + A2 wj,Tk − p − zj,t∆ + f Z,                     (16)

                                                                       λ

where A1 , A2 , and f are constants and where we have plugged in the coefficients of p and
zj,t∆ from Equation (15). In particular, trader j puts a weight of A1 on his common-value
information and a weight of A2 on his private value.
                                         P
    By market clearing and the fact that j zj,t∆ = Z is common knowledge, each trader i is
able to infer                                                 !

   Because trader i’s competitive strategy xci,t∆ is linear in E[vi,Tk | p∗t∆ , Hi,Tk ], trader i’s weight
on his common-value information and his weight on the private value have a ratio of B1 . But
by symmetric strategies, this ratio must be consistent with the conjectured strategy to start
with, i.e., B1 = A1 /A2 . In Appendix C.1, we explicitly calculate that this symmetry pins down
the ratio to be B1 = A1 /A2 ≡ χ, where χ ∈ (0, 1) is the unique solution to5

    On the left-hand side of Equation (19), we apply the projection theorem to Equation (18) to
derive the weight B1 as a function of A1 /A2 ≡ χ. The projection theorem weighs the precision

Trader i’s total signal incorporates the two-dimensional information ( kl=0 Si,Tl , wi,Tk ) in a linear

Equation (22) says that conditional on his own information and j6=i sj,Tk (inferred from the

satisfies χ ∈ (0, 1).

on each of the other traders’ total signal sj,Tk . The weights differ because other traders’ total
signals include both common dividend information and their private values, and others’ private
values are essentially “noise” to trader i (hence under-weighting).
    Substituting Equation (22) into Equation (15), we have
                                                                                   !

The first term of pct∆ is the average total signal, and the second term is the marginal cost of
holding the average inventory Z/n for an expected duration of time 1/r.
   Substituting Equation (24) back to the expressions of xci,t∆ (pct∆ ) in Equation (23), we obtain
explicitly the competitive demand schedule:
                                                                                   

               xci,t∆ (p)   =                 si,t∆ − p −          z    +          Z .                    (25)

Appendix C.2 verifies that under this strategy the first-order condition of trader i’s value
function (12) can indeed be written in the form of Equation (15). The second-order condition
is satisfied as nα > 1 by the definition of α.
    The post-trading allocation in the competitive equilibrium in period t is:

                                                                               n
                                                                                           !
              c             c                       r(nα − 1)               1X                     1
             zi,(t+1)∆   = zi,t∆ + xci,t∆ (pct∆ ) =                 si,t∆ −       sj,t∆        +     Z.   (26)

That is, after each double auction, each trader is allocated the average inventory plus a constant
multiple of how far his total signal deviates from the average total signal. We also see that
the competitive inventories are martingales since total signals are martingales. We refer to this
allocation as the “competitive allocation.”
    The following proposition summarizes the competitive equilibrium.

Proposition 1. In the competitive equilibrium, the strategies are given by Equation (25), the
price by Equation (24), and the allocations by Equation (26).

2.3     Characterizing the strategic equilibrium
Having solved a competitive benchmark, we now turn to the equilibrium with imperfect com-
petition and strategic behavior, i.e., traders take into account the impact of their trades on
prices. The equilibrium is stated in the following proposition.

Proposition 2. Suppose that nα > 2, which is equivalent to

    The derivation of the strategic equilibrium follows similar steps to that of the competitive
equilibrium derived in Section 2.2. The details of equilibrium construction are delegated to
Appendix C.3. Below, we discuss key intuition of the strategic equilibrium by comparing it
with the competitive one.
    Let us start with common properties shared between the strategic equilibrium and the
competitive one. For example, the equilibrium prices are equal under competitive and strategic
bidding. Equal price implies equal information inference from the price in both equilibria,
hence equal construction of the total signal {si,t∆ } that consolidates traders’ information about
the common dividend and private values. The price aggregates the most recent total signals
{si,t∆ }, which has a flavor of rational expectations equilibrium. Since the total signals are
martingales, the price is also a martingale. The second term −λZ/(nr) in p∗t∆ and pct∆ is the
expected marginal cost of holding the average inventory Z/n until the dividend is paid, i.e., for
an expected duration of time 1/r. Although each trader learns from p∗t∆ the average total signal
P
  i si,t∆ /n in period t, he does not learn the total signal or inventory of any other individual


                                                    14
trader. Nor does a trader perfectly distinguish the common-value component and the private-
value component of the price. Thus, private information is not fully revealed after each round
of trading. Finally, the equilibrium strategies in Equations (28) and (25) are stationary: a
trader’s strategy only depends on his most recent total signal si,t∆ and his current inventory
zi,t∆ , but does not depend explicitly on t.6
     There are two important differences between the strategic equilibrium of Proposition 2 and
the competitive benchmark in Section 2.2. First, in the strategic equilibrium, rather than
take the price as given, each trader in each period effectively selects a price-quantity pair from
the residual demand schedule of all other traders. To mitigate price impact, they trade less
aggressively in the strategic equilibrium than in the competitive equilibrium. Formally, the
endogenous coefficient b in Equation (28) is strictly smaller than r(nα−1)
                                                                     λ(n−1)
                                                                             in Equation (25):
                                                         p
                b             (nα − 1)(1 − e−r∆ ) −          (nα − 1)2 (1 − e−r∆ )2 + 4e−r∆
                       =1+                                                                  < 1.              (31)
             r(nα−1)                                         2e−r∆
              λ(n−1)


This feature is the familiar “bid shading” or “demand reduction” in models of divisible auctions
(see Ausubel, Cramton, Pycia, Rostek, and Weretka 2014). The coefficient b captures how much
additional quantity of the asset a trader is willing to buy if the price drops by one unit per
period. Thus, a smaller b corresponds to a less aggressive demand schedule. As the number n
of traders tends to infinity, the ratio in Equation (31) tends to 1, so the strategic equilibrium
converges to the competitive equilibrium.
    Intimately related to the aggressiveness of demand schedules is the extent to which a trader
“liquidates” his inventory in each trading round. In the competitive equilibrium strategy xci,t∆ ,
                             c
the coefficient in front of zi,t∆ is −1, meaning that each trader liquidates his inventory entirely.
By contrast, under the strategy xi,t∆ of Proposition 2, the coefficient in front of zi,t∆ is
                                     p
               λ(n − 1)                 (nα − 1)2 (1 − e−r∆ )2 + 4e−r∆ − (nα − 1)(1 − e−r∆ )
       d ≡ −b           = −1 +                                                               ,                (32)
              r(nα − 1)                                        2e−r∆

which, under the condition nα > 2, is strictly between −1 and 0. Thus, each trader only

    Some readers may wonder why our model does not have the infinite-regress problem of beliefs about beliefs,
beliefs about beliefs about beliefs, etc. The reason is that the equilibrium price reveals the average total signal
in each period; thus, a trader’s belief about the common dividend, as well as his potential high-order beliefs, is
actually spanned by this trader’s own private information and the equilibrium price. This logic was previously
used by He and Wang (1995) and Foster and Viswanathan (1996) to show that the potential infinite-regress
problem is resolved in their dynamic models with heterogenous information. Our assumption that the common
dividend and private values evolve as random walks implies that only the current price has the most updated
information and hence allows us to characterize a stationary equilibrium. Without the random walk assumption,
traders may potentially need to use all past prices to form inference, and the analysis will become much more
complicated.

liquidates a fraction |d| < 1 of his inventory, leaving a fraction 1 + d ∈ (0, 1). Partial liquidation
of inventory implies that the strategy in period t has an impact on strategies in all future periods,
and that an inefficient allocation in one period affects the inefficiency in all future periods. The
next subsection investigates in details how the quantity 1 + d determines allocative inefficiency,
which is ultimately related to the optimal trading frequency that we study in Section 3.
    Relative to the competitive benchmark, the second important difference of the strategic
equilibrium is that its existence requires nα > 2, which, as we show in the proof, is equivalent to
the condition (27). If and only if nα > 2 is the coefficient b positive, i.e. demand is decreasing in
price. Condition (27) essentially requires that adverse selection regarding the common dividend
is not “too large” relative to the gains from trade over private values. All else equal, condition
(27) holds if n is sufficiently large, if signals of dividend shocks are sufficiently precise (i.e. σ2 is
                                                                                             2
small enough), if new information on the common dividend is not too volatile (i.e. σD           is small
enough), or if shocks to private values are sufficiently volatile (i.e. σw is large enough).7 All
                                                                              2

these conditions reduce adverse selection. The intuition is that if a trader observes a higher
equilibrium price, he infers that other traders have either higher private values or more favorable
information about the common dividend. If the trader attributes too much of the higher price
to a higher dividend, he may end up buying more conditional on a higher price, which leads
to a negative b and violates the second order condition. Learning from prices does not cause
such a problem in the competitive equilibrium because a higher price there also reflects traders’
disregard of price impact. Thus, conditional on the same price, traders do not learn as much
about the dividend in the competitive equilibrium as in the strategic one.
    The condition nα > 2 means that a trader’s expected asset value has a weight of at least
2/n on his own total signal and a weight of at most (1 − 2/n)/(n − 1) = (n − 2)/[n(n − 1)] < 1/n
on each of other traders’ total signals.8 The condition nα > 2 is trivially satisfied if α = 1,
which applies if dividend information is public (σ2 = 0 and σw2 > 0) or if traders have pure
                   2
private values (σD   = 0 and σw2 > 0).
    We close this subsection with a brief discussion of equilibrium uniqueness. Since news times
and trading times are separate in our model, it could happen that no new information arrives
during one or more periods. For example, if no new information arrives in the time interval
((t − 1)∆, t∆], then the period-t double auction will have the same price as the period-(t − 1)
double auction, i.e., the period-t double auction looks like a public-information game. Vayanos

     As a special case, if σ2 = 0 and σw
                                        2
                                           > 0, we have public information about the dividends, which implies
                                            2           2
χ = 1 and α = 1 from Equation (19). If σD     = 0 and σw  > 0, we have the pure private value case, which implies
χ = 0 and α = 1. Each trader i’s equilibrium strategy in the pure private value case and in the public dividend
information case have the same coefficients on si,t∆ , p, zi,t∆ , and Z.
   8
     The existence condition for our equilibrium is analogous to Kyle, Obizhaeva, and Wang (2014)’s equilibrium
existence condition that each trader believes that his signal about the asset value is roughly twice as precise as
others traders believe it to be.

(1999) shows that public-information games admit a continuum of equilibria, and he uses a
trembling-hand argument to select one of them.
    Our approach to equilibrium selection is to impose stationarity, i.e., the coefficients in the
linear strategy are the same across all periods. Going back to the example, if no new information
arrives in ((t − 1)∆, t∆], the stationarity-selected equilibrium in the period-t double auction
will be identical to one in which fresh news does arrive in ((t − 1)∆, t∆] but the realizations
of the dividend shock, the n signals of dividend shocks, and the n private-value shocks all turn
out to be zero. The following proposition shows that the equilibrium of Proposition 2 is unique
if strategies are restricted to be linear and stationary.

Proposition 3. The equilibrium from Proposition 2 is the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium
in the following class of strategies:
                                        X
                          xi,t∆ (p) =            al Si,Tl + aw wi,t∆ − bp + dzi,t∆ + f,      (33)
                                        Tl ≤t∆


where {al }l≥0 , aw , b, d and f are constants.

    As the proof of Proposition 2 makes clear, each trader’s optimal strategy belongs to class
(33) if other traders also use strategies of the class (33). Therefore, Equation (33) is not a
restriction on the traders’ strategy space, but rather a restriction on the domain of equilibrium
uniqueness. (We have not ruled out the existence of non-linear equilibrium.)


2.4    Efficiency and comparative statics
We now study the allocative efficiency (or inefficiency) in the equilibrium of Proposition 2. The
results of this section lay the foundation for the study of optimal trading frequency in the next
section.
                          ∗
    Let us denote by {zi,t∆  } the path of inventories obtained by the equilibrium strategy xi,t∆
                                                              ∗
of Proposition 2. By the definition of d in Equation (32), zi,t∆  evolves according to:

                  ∗           ∗
                 zi,(t+1)∆ = zi,t∆ + xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ; si,t∆ , zi,t∆
                                                            ∗
                                                                 )
                                                                              !
                                     ∗                1 X          λ(n − 1) Z
                           = (1 + d)zi,t∆ + b si,t∆ −     sj,t∆ +
                                                      n j         r(nα − 1) n
                                                   !                          
                                         1X            1              ∗     1
                           = b si,t∆ −        sj,t∆ + Z + (1 + d) zi,t∆ − Z                  (34)
                                         n j           n                    n
                                     ∗        c
                           = (1 + d)zi,t∆ − dzi,(t+1)∆ ,


                                                         17
where in the second line we have substituted in the equilibrium strategy x∗i,t∆ and the equilibrium
price p∗t∆ , and in the last line we have substituted in Equation (26).
    Comparing Equation (34) to Equation (26), we can see two differences. First, the post-
                                                                                 ∗
trading allocation in the strategic equilibrium has an extra term (1 + d)(zi,t∆       − Z/n). Since
1+d ∈ (0, 1), any inventory imbalance at the beginning of period t partly carries over to the next
period. As discussed in the previous subsection, this is a direct consequence of demand reduction
caused by strategic bidding. Second, because inventories cannot be liquidated quickly due to
strategic bidding, traders are more reluctant to acquire inventory. Therefore, the coefficient in
                 P
front of si,t∆ − j sj,t∆ /n in the strategic allocation (34) is smaller than that in the competitive
allocation (26). That is, strategic bidding makes post-trading asset allocations less sensitive to
the dispersion of information (as measured by the total signals).
    The above derivation directly leads to the exponential convergence to the competitive allo-
cation over time, shown in the next proposition.

Proposition 4. Given any 0 ≤ t ≤ t, if si,t∆ = si,t∆ for every i and every t ∈ {t, t + 1, . . . , t},
                                  ∗
then the equilibrium inventories zi,t∆ satisfy: for every i,

            ∗           c                         ∗
           zi,(t+1)∆ − zi,(t+1)∆ = (1 + d)t+1−t (zi,t∆    c
                                                       − zi,(t+1)∆ ), ∀t ∈ {t, t + 1, . . . , t},   (35)

where d ∈ (−1, 0) is given by Equation (32).
   Moreover, 1 + d is decreasing in n, r, σw2 , and ∆ but increasing in σD
                                                                         2
                                                                           . And (1 + d)1/∆ is
increasing in ∆.

    The convergence result of Proposition 4 is intuitive. If no new information arrives between
period t and t, then the competitive allocation remains unchanged, and Equation (35) follows
from Equation (34) by induction.
    Proposition 4 reveals that the strategic equilibrium is inefficient in allocating assets, al-
though the allocative inefficiency converges to zero exponentially over time (as long as no
new information arrives). After new dividend shocks and private-value shocks, the competi-
tive allocation changes accordingly, and the strategic allocation starts to converge toward the
new competitive allocation exponentially. Exponential convergence of this kind is previously
obtained in the dynamic model of Vayanos (1999) under the assumption that common-value
information is public.
    The comparative statics of Proposition 4 are also intuitive, as illustrated by Figure 2. A
smaller 1+d means faster convergence to efficiency. A larger n makes traders more competitive,
and a larger r makes them more impatient. Both effects encourage aggressive bidding and speed
                          2
up convergence. A large σD  implies a large uncertainty of a trader about the common asset value
and a severe adverse selection; hence, in equilibrium the trader reduces his demand or supply

relative to the fully competitive market. Therefore, a higher σD   implies less aggressive bidding
and slower convergence to the competitive allocation. The effect of σw2 is the opposite: a higher
σw2 implies a larger gain from trade, and hence more aggressive bidding and faster convergence
                                                  2
to the competitive allocation. The effects of n, σD  and σw2 on bidding aggressiveness are present
                                                                                              2
in earlier static models of Vives (2011) and Rostek and Weretka (2012). The effect of σD        in
reducing the convergence speed to efficiency is also confirmed by Sannikov and Skrzypacz (2014)
in a continuous-time trading model.
    More novelly, 1 + d is smaller if ∆ is larger, that is, convergence per period is faster if
trading frequency is lower. Intuitively, if traders have to wait for a long time before the next
opportunity to trade, they have a strong incentive to trade aggressively in the current period.
In this sense, a low-frequency market is a commitment device that counterbalances the strategic

                                                                         19
demand reduction. However, a higher trading frequency increases the convergence speed per
unit of clock time (a lower (1 + d)1/∆ ). This is because a higher number of trading opportunities
more than offsets the lower aggressiveness per period. We caution that convergence speed is
not the same as welfare, and the welfare implication of trading frequency is much subtler and
richer, as we show in Section 3.
     Finally, the comparative static of the speed of convergence with respect to σ2 is ambiguous.
It can be shown that the endogenous parameters α and χ, and hence the speed of convergence,
                                             2
depend on the “normalized variances” σD                                               2
                                               /σ2 and σw2 /σ2 . As σ2 increases, σD /σ2 and σw2 /σ2
                                   2
both decrease. A decrease in σD      /σ2 increases the speed of convergence, while a decrease in
σw2 /σ2 decreases the speed of convergence. The net effect is ambiguous.


3     Welfare and Optimal Trading Frequency under Homo-
      geneous Trading Speed
In this section and the next, we use the model framework developed in Section 2 to analyze
the welfare implications of trading frequency. In this section we study the effect of trading
frequency on welfare and characterize the optimal trading frequency if all traders participate
in all double auctions, i.e., if traders have homogeneous trading speed. In the next section we
study the case of heterogeneous trading speeds in the sense that fast traders participate in all
double auctions but slow traders only participate periodically.
    Throughout this section we conduct the analysis based on the perfect Bayesian equilibrium
                                                                                   ∗
of Proposition 2, which requires the parameter condition nα > 2. Recall that {zi,t∆   }, defined
by Equation (34), is the inventory path in the equilibrium of Proposition 2. We define the
equilibrium welfare as the sum of the ex-ante expected utilities over all traders:
                          "   n                   ∞                                          #
                              X                   X                            λ
             W (∆) = E              (1 − e−r∆ )         e−rt∆ vi,t∆ zi,(t+1)∆
                                                                     ∗            ∗
                                                                              − (zi,(t+1)∆ )2    .   (36)
                              i=1                 t=0
                                                                               2r

We denote the ∆ that maximizes W (∆) as ∆∗ . As usual, the price terms are canceled out as
they are transfers. Note also that if all traders are ex-ante identical, with zi,0 = Z/n, then
each trader’s ex-ante expected utility is simply W (∆)/n. Thus, the welfare criterion based on
W (∆) is equivalent to Parento dominance: If W (∆1 ) > W (∆2 ) for ∆1 6= ∆2 , then each trader
i’s ex-ante expected utility is higher under ∆1 than that under ∆2 .

    Analogously, we can define the welfare in the competitive equilibrium of Section 2.2 as:

    Although the competitive equilibrium is more efficient than the strategic one, it is still not
fully efficient because new information may arrive between two double auctions. To explicitly
take into account possible information arrivals, we define the continuous-time efficient allocation
to be:                                                !
                                               n

                   zi,τ =            si,τ −       sj,τ + Z, for every τ ≥ 0.                   (38)

The allocation zi,τ  is obtained in an idealized world in which a competitive double auction is
held immediately after each news arrival. In constrast, at time τ ∈ (t∆, (t + 1)∆], the strategic
                                                                    ∗    ∗             c      c

ular, we have zi,t∆  = zi,(t+1)∆ ), the difference is that {zi,τ } changes at news time, whereas {zi,τ       }
changes at trading time. Figure 3 provides an illustration. In this example information arrives
                                                                                        ∗          c

which is independent of ∆.
   With these primitives, the allocative inefficiency of the competitive equilibrium of Section 2.2
can be written as:

   X(∆) ≡ W e − W (∆) =              [W c (∆) − W (∆)]                    +          [W e − W c (∆)].                 (40)
                                     |       {z      }                               |     {z      }
                             X1 (∆), welfare cost of strategic behavior       X2 (∆), welfare cost of trading delay


The above equation decomposes the allocative inefficiency of the strategic equilibrium into two
parts. The first part, call it X1 (∆), is due to strategic behavior and demand reduction. The
second part, call it X2 (∆), is due to the potential misalignment between trading times and
news times.
   This decomposition highlights the important tradeoff in increasing trading frequency:

   • A smaller ∆ allows investors to react quickly to new information, reducing X2 (∆).

   • A smaller ∆ also reduces the aggressiveness of demand schedules in each double auction,
     increasing X1 (∆). This channel is a consequence of the fact that (1 + d) decreases in ∆
     (see Proposition 4).

    We show in the two subsections that this tradeoff, and hence the optimal trading frequency,
depend critically on the nature of new information (i.e., the shocks to dividends and private
values). If new information arrives at deterministic and scheduled intervals, then trading times
can be arranged such that X2 (∆) = 0, and we show that the optimal trading frequency cannot
be higher than the information arrival frequency. In the most natural case where all traders are
ex-ante identical, the optimal trading frequency is equal to the information arrival frequency.
By contrast, if new information arrives stochastically according to a Poisson process, then
both X1 (∆) and X2 (∆) are generally positive, and this tradeoff leads to an interior optimal
∆∗ . We show that the optimal trading frequency 1/∆∗ is always higher than two-thirds of
the information arrival frequency, and we provide conditions on nα under which 1/∆∗ can
be arbitrarily larger than the information arrival frequency. We further provide comparative
statics of ∆∗ with respect to the asset characteristics.

3.1     Scheduled Arrivals of New Information
We first consider scheduled information arrivals. In particular, we suppose that shocks to the
common dividend and shocks to private values occur at regularly spaced clock times Tk = kγ
for a positive constant γ, where k ≥ 0 are integers. Examples of scheduled information arrivals
include macroeconomic data releases and corporate earnings announcements.

Proposition 5. Suppose Tk = kγ for a positive constant γ. Then W (∆) < W (γ) for any
∆ < γ. That is, ∆∗ ≥ γ.

   Proposition 5 shows that if new information repeatedly arrives at scheduled times, then the
optimal trading frequency cannot be higher than the frequency of information arrivals.
   For ease of exposition, we discuss here the intuition and the proof for the special case
that γ/∆ is a positive integer. In this case, whenever scheduled information arrives, there is
a double auction immediately following it. Since news times are entirely covered by trading
times, the X2 (∆) term in the decomposition (40) is zero. Thus, allocative inefficiency is entirely
determined by welfare loss caused by strategic behavior, i.e. X1 (∆). Below, we outline the
main steps of proving that X1 (∆) is decreasing in ∆ if γ/∆ is a positive integer. Lemma 1 and
Lemma 2 that we use below, however, hold for any information arrival process.
   The following lemma relates the welfare loss of an allocation to the square distance between
that allocation and the competitive allocation.

competitive allocation zi,(t+1)∆ is exactly the competitive equilibrium price pct∆ (see Appendix
C.6 for details). Applied to the equilibrium allocations x∗i,t∆ , Lemma 1 implies that:

    An inspection of Equation (42) reveals that the effect of ∆ on X1 (∆) is not obvious. Propo-
sition 4 shows that 1+d is decreasing in ∆, but (1+d)1/∆ is increasing in ∆. Thus, for each news
                                                                                   ∗       c
arrival time kγ and each trading time t∆ ∈ [kγ, (k+1)γ), as ∆ increases, E[(zi,(t+1)∆   −zi,(t+1)∆ )2 ]
becomes smaller for a small t∆ − kγ but larger for a large t∆ − kγ. This means that a higher
trading frequency (a smaller ∆) makes allocations less efficient in the early periods after a news
arrival but more efficient in the later periods. Intuitively, a large ∆ commits traders to submit-
ting aggressive demand schedules whenever they can trade, leading to an immediate inventory
reallocation early on. But a smaller ∆ allows more “smoothing” of trades that eventually makes
allocation more efficient if trading continues for a sufficiently long time. Adding to this tradeoff
is the “discount factor” e−rt∆ , which gives more weight to relative allocative efficiency in early
periods than in later periods in the assessment of welfare. Overall, the effect of ∆ on X1 (∆)
seems ambiguous ex-ante. Showing the economic intuition of Proposition 5, therefore, boils
down to showing why the (weighted) allocative efficiency in early periods dominates that in
late periods.
    This intricate tradeoff is illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 4, where we consider the
special case of γ = ∞ (i.e., information arrives only once, at time 0) and plot the distance to
                        ∗           c
efficient allocation, |zi,(t+1)∆ − zi,(t+1)∆ |, for two extreme trading frequencies: ∆ = ∞ (trading
only once, at time 0) and ∆ = 0 (continuous trading). We can see that slower trading (∆ = ∞)
leads to more efficient allocations in early periods, but faster trading (∆ = 0) leads to more
efficient allocations in late periods.
    To proceed with the proof, we further simplify the square difference between the strategic
and competitive equilibrium allocation, for t ≥ 1:

The above equation says that after auction t, allocative inefficiency is a linear combination of
the inefficiency in initial allocations and the time variations in the competitive allocation up to
time t∆. Substituting Equation (44) into the expression of X1 in Equation (42), we get (see

    The expression of X1 (∆) in Equation (45) has an intuitive explanation. The first term in the

                                                                P
                                                                                   − zi,t∆
how much the competitive allocation changes at each trading time, weighted by the probability
that the dividend is not yet paid. Together, the terms in the big bracket represent the amount
of allocative inefficiency measured at trading times that can potentially be eliminated. The
                      λ(1+d)
leading multiplier, 2r(nα−1) , says that because of strategic behavior, a fraction of the allocative
inefficiency remains in the market. This fraction is lower if per-round convergence is faster, i.e.,
if 1 + d is smaller.
    To be even more explicit, let us now return to the special case that γ/∆ is a positive integer.
In this case, news times are entirely covered by trading times, and

where we have used the fact that the competitive allocations do not change without news
arrivals. Dropping the zero terms, we can thus write the second term on the right-hand side of
Equation (45) in terms of news time {kγ}:

                                                                  − zi,kγ )2 ],

                                c         c
where we have substituted in zi,kγ+∆  = zi,(k+1)γ . Thus, the second term on the right-hand side
of Equation (45) is purely a function of the news arrival process, and not a function of ∆. The
first term on the right-hand side of Equation (45) is purely a function of the news arriving at
time 0, again not a function of ∆. Because 1 + d is decreasing with ∆ (Proposition 4), X1 (∆)
is decreasing in ∆, which proves Proposition 5 for the cases that γ/∆ is a positive integer.
    The right-hand panel of Figure 4 illustrates this net effect by plotting W (∆) against ∆, for
the special case that γ = ∞. We can see that in this case W (∆) increases in ∆.
    The same logic above applies to a general ∆ ≤ γ, with some adjustment to the details. The
proof of the general case of Proposition 5 is delegated to Appendix C.6.1.

    Proposition 5 establishes that the optimal trading frequency cannot be strictly higher than
information frequency. Next, we ask if ∆∗ can be strictly higher than γ. As ∆ increases
beyond γ, X2 (∆) is generally positive. Thus, traders face the basic tradeoff we discussed at the
beginning of this section: a large ∆ > γ induces more aggressive trading per period, but incurs
the cost that traders cannot react quickly to new information.
    To further evaluate this tradeoff, we must first define some parameters that quantify the
magnitude of the new information given by the dividend shocks. We define:

    The first variance σz2 describes the extent to which each arrival of new information changes
the efficient inventories among traders. The second variance σ02 describes the distance between
the ex-ante inventory and the efficient inventory given the new information that arrives at time
0. If zi,0 = Z/n for every trader i (all traders are ex-ante identical), then σ02 = σz2 .9 One may
naturally view “time 0” as a reduced-form representation of a steady state, in which case σ02 and
σz2 should be equal. In the results below we will keep σ02 as a generic parameter but highlight
results for the most natural case of σ02 = σz2 .
   9
     To see this, note that Z/n is the efficient allocation to each trader if the initial total signals of all traders
are zero. For each trader i, the total signal si,0 received at time 0 has the same distribution as the innovation
                         e                                         e       e
si,Tk − si,Tk−1 . Thus, zi,0 − Z/n has the same distribution as zi,T  k
                                                                        − zi,Tk−1
                                                                                  for any k ≥ 1. Thus, σ02 = σz2 if
zi,0 = Z/n for all i.


                                                                         26
   The welfare W (∆) is hard to analyze if ∆/γ is not an integer. For analytical tractability
but at no cost of economic intuition, for the case of ∆ > γ we restrict attention to ∆ = lγ for
a positive integer l. Let l∗ ∈ argmaxl∈Z+ W (lγ).

Proposition 6. Suppose that Tk = kγ for a positive constant γ. The following results hold.

  1. If zi,0 = Z/n for every trader i (i.e., σ02 = σz2 ), then l∗ = 1.

  2. If σ02 /σz2 remains bounded as n → ∞, then l∗ = 1 as n → ∞.

    Part 1 of Proposition 6 states a sharp result: for the steady-state specification σ02 = σz2 , the
optimal trading frequency is equal to the information frequency. To see the intuition, consider,
for instance, slowing down trading from ∆ = γ to ∆ = 2γ. Reducing the trading frequency by
a half will make demand schedules more aggressive at time 0, 2γ, 4γ, . . . , at the cost of entirely
disabling reaction to new information at times γ, 3γ, 5γ, . . . . But because new information
at each arrival time is equally informative and in expectation shocks the efficient allocation by
the same magnitude, there is no reason to let traders trade very aggressively over half of the
news but shut down trading for the other half. Instead, it is better to allow equal opportunities
respond to all information arrivals. That is, l∗ = 1. This intuition applies to any generic ∆ = lγ
for an integer l > 1. The proof of Proposition 6 makes this intuitive argument formal.
    Part 2 of Proposition 6 allows the time-0 information to be different from information
arriving later. A sufficient condition for σ02 /σz2 remaining bounded as n → ∞ is E[ ni=1 (zi,0 −
                                                                                           P

Z/n)2 ] = O(n). If σ02 > σz2 , for instance, it is possible that the optimal l∗ > 1 so that eliminating
the time-0 allocative inefficiency is more important than allowing immediate reaction to less
important news later. That said, in a large market it is still asymptotically optimal to align
trading times with information arrival time. The intuition is that as n increases sufficiently,
the market becomes almost competitive, and the inefficiency associated with strategic demand
reduction diminishes. In the limit n → ∞, X1 (∆) → 0, and the allocation efficiency is entirely
determined by how fast traders can react to new information. Thus, the optimal l∗ = 1.


3.2    Stochastic Arrivals of New Information
We now turn to stochastic arrivals of information. Examples of stochastic news include un-
expected corporate announcements (e.g. mergers and acquisitions), regulatory actions, and
geopolitical events. There are many possible specifications for stochastic information arrivals,
and it is technically hard to calculate the optimal trading frequency for all of them. Instead,
we analyze the simple yet natural case of a Poisson process for news arrivals. We expect the
economic intuition of the results to apply to more general signal structures.


                                                  27
   Suppose that the timing of the news shocks {Tk }k≥1 follows a homogeneous Poisson process
with intensity µ > 0. (The first shock still arrives at time T0 = 0.) Since the time interval
between two consecutive news shocks has the expectation 1/µ, µ is analogous to 1/γ from
Section 3.1. There are in expectation ∆µ arrivals of new information during an interval of
length ∆, and each arrival of information shocks the squared difference in efficient allocation
by σz2 (see Equation (46)). Thus,

   To gain further intuition, we now focus on the natural case that all traders are ex-ante
identical (i.e. σ02 = σz2 ) and explicitly spell out X1 (∆) and X2 (∆) from the decomposition (40):

Lemma 2 (which applies to any information arrival process). We have also applied Lemma 1 to

                                  Misalignment of information arrival times and trading times


The first term λ/2 is the multiplier of quadratic holding cost. The middle term in the bracket
represents the misalignment of information arrival times and trading times, for it is the difference
between an integral and its ∆-discrete counterpart, a summation. The third term is the expected
variance of the change in the efficient allocations per unit of time, µσz2 , multiplied by the
expected waiting time until the dividend is paid, 1/r. Note that the misalignment term only
involves the Poisson information arrivals after time 0, since the first information arrival time
coincides with the first trading time, time 0. The misalignment term and hence X2 (∆) vanish
as ∆ → 0, i.e., there is zero welfare cost from trading delay if trading is continuous.

   We see that under Poisson news arrivals both terms X1 (∆) and X2 (∆) are generally positive.
We thus expect an interior optimal ∆∗ .
   The following proposition, also the main result of this subsection, characterizes the optimal
trading frequency in the case of ex-ante identical traders.

Proposition 7. Suppose that {Tk }k≥1 is a Poisson process with intensity µ, and zi,0 = Z/n for
every trader i (i.e., σ02 = σz2 ). Then the following hold.

    1. For any l ≥ 2/3, we have ∆∗ < 1/(lµ) if nα > 2l + 2/3. In particular, we always have
       ∆∗ < 1.5/µ since nα > 2 by assumption.

    2. ∆∗ strictly decreases in µ, n and σw2 , and strictly increases in σD
                                                                          2
                                                                            .

    Part 1 of Proposition 7 establishes a sufficient condition under which the optimal trading
frequency 1/∆∗ is more than l times as high as the information frequency µ. For reasonable l,
the condition nα > 2l+2/3 is not stringent. For “liquid” assets, namely those with wide investor
                                                              2
participation (large n), low information asymmetry (low σD      ), and high liquidity-driven trading
motives (high σw2 ), we expect α to be much closer to 1 than to 2/n. As extreme examples,
           2
α = 1 if σD  = 0 (pure private value) or if σ2 = 0 (public information of common value). These
liquid assets include major equity indices, government securities, and foreign currencies, as well
as the corresponding futures contracts. As a concrete example, Joint Staff Report (2015) finds
that about 80 bank-dealers and principal trading firms actively participate in the cash U.S.
Treasury markets. An nα of 80 means that the optimal trading frequency in U.S. Treasury
market should be at least 40 times as high as the information arrival frequency.
    To get an intuitive sense of how the lower bound in Proposition 7 is derived, we provide a
heuristic proof when nα is close to 2. As nα → 2, bid shading is the most severe, and traders
benefit the most from a large ∆ to increase the market depth in each period. We now show
that even in this case the optimal ∆∗ < 1.5/µ, corresponding to l = 2/3.
    From Equation (52), we see that minimizing X(∆) over ∆ is equivalent to maximizing

                                   x     3 3

it is straightforward to show that f (1.5/µ) < 0. Thus, the ∆∗ that maximizes Equation (54) is
strictly less than 1.5/µ for any µ > 0 and r > 0.
     A comparison between Part 1 of Proposition 7 and Proposition 5 reveals the major differ-
ence between scheduled and stochastic information arrivals. Take the case of ex-ante identical
traders. Under scheduled information arrivals, the optimal trading frequency is equal to the
information arrival frequency. Under stochastic information arrival, the optimal trading fre-
quency can be much higher than the information arrival frequency.
     Part 2 of Proposition 7 can be proven by applying the monotone comparative statics of
Milgrom and Shannon (1994) and Zandt (2002). For example, by direct calculation one can
show that
                        ∂ 2 X(∆)                           ∆e−r∆
                                                               
                                       ∂          1+d
                                 =−          1−                     > 0.                 (57)
                          ∂∆∂µ        ∂∆         nα − 1 1 − e−r∆
Thus, ∆∗ is strictly decreasing in µ. Intuitively, if information arrives more frequently, the
optimal trading frequency should also increase in order to allow traders faster response to new
information.
    By the same method, we can show that the optimal ∆∗ is strictly decreasing in nα. Since α
is the weight on one’s own total signal, α is strictly increasing in the variance of private-value
shocks, σw2 , and is strictly decreasing in the variance of common-value shocks, σD     2
                                                                                          . Hence, ∆∗
is also strictly decreasing in σw2 and is strictly increasing in σD
                                                                  2
                                                                    . The intuition is that if trading
is motivated less by informed speculation and more by private values, then traders will submit
more aggressive demand schedules anyway; in those situations a higher-frequency market is
better because it reduces delays in responding to new information. Moreover, we can show that
nα is strictly increasing in n (even though α itself decreases with n), so ∆∗ is strictly decreasing
in n.

    Figure 5 plots the optimal ∆∗ for a variety of model parameters and illustrates the com-
parative statics. From the top-right subplot we also see that the bound ∆∗ < 1.5/µ is actually
fairly tight: while µ is kept at one, ∆∗ is just below 1.5 when n = 6. In general, ∆∗ can be
substantially lower than 1/µ.
    Overall, Proposition 7 predicts that the optimal trading frequency of an asset should in-
creases in its “liquidity,” measured as a higher participation of investors, a higher private-value
(e.g. hedging) motive for trades, and a lower adverse selection. For relatively liquid assets like
stock indices, large stocks, government securities, foreign exchange, and futures contracts, the
optimal trading frequency could be substantially higher than the arrival frequency of informa-
tion that affects these assets. For relatively illiquid assets like small stocks, corporate bonds,
municipal bonds, and nonstandard over-the-counter derivatives, the optimal trading frequency
can be lower, but only moderately lower, than the arrival frequency of relevant information.
    We close this section with the following proposition on comparative statics when σ02 and σz2
are potentially different.

Proposition 8. Suppose that {Tk }k≥1 is a Poisson process with intensity µ. The following
comparative statics hold:

    1. If σ02 > 0, then ∆∗ strictly decreases in µ from ∞ (as µ → 0) to 0 (as µ → ∞).

    2. If σ02 /σz2 remains bounded as n → ∞, then ∆∗ → 0 as n → ∞.

    The intuition for Proposition 8 is similar to that of Proposition 7. In particular, continuous
trading becomes optimal in the limit as the market becomes large or as the arrival rate of new
information increases without bound.


4      Heterogeneous Trading Speeds
In this section we extend the model to study trading strategies and welfare if traders have
heterogeneous speeds. In this extension, speed is defined by how frequently a trader participates
in the market. The main result of this section is that traders who can access the market all
the time, such as high-frequency traders or financial intermediaries, prefer the highest trading
frequency, but traders who access the market infrequently, such as retail and institutional
investors, typically prefer a strictly lower trading frequency. These results reveal that a market
speed-up has differential effects on heterogeneous groups of market participants. To highlight
this new insight and for tractability, we shall simplify other aspects of the model to its minimum.


4.1     Model setup
As before, trading happens in the form of double auctions at times {0, ∆, 2∆, . . .}. There are
nF ≥ 1 ex-ante identical fast traders who trade in every period t ≥ 0. There are M ex-ante
identical slow traders who can also trade in the market repeatedly, but each access to market
comes with a deterministic delay of clock time Γ > 0. We interpret Γ as the fundamental
delay of slow investors that is not affected by the market frequency 1/∆. For simplicity, at
time 0, the arrival sequence of the M slow traders are drawn at random, and their first arrival
times are Γ/M , 2Γ/M , 3Γ/M , . . . , Γ. By the deterministic nature of delays between market
accesses,10 the j-th slow trader comes to the market at clock times Mj Γ, Mj Γ + Γ, Mj Γ + 2Γ, ...,
where j ∈ {1, 2, ..., M }. For instance, many retail and institutional investors rebalance their
portfolios infrequently, and their rebalancing delay Γ is insensitive to the trading delay ∆ in
the market.
   We assume that the slow traders cannot coordinate their trading times,11 so each slow
  10
     We could also use a random delay, but this alternative arrangement would not change our results.
  11
     In many markets, this assumption is not restrictive. For example, in the U.S. equity markets, when retail or
institutional investors send orders to their brokers, the brokers’ best-execution responsibility is to get the best
price in the market. Delays could be beneficial, but the executing brokers would incur the risk that the stock
prices move in the adverse direction while waiting. The resulting adverse price movement, or “implementation
shortfall,” would count against the brokers. Therefore, if a broker receives a marketable order that creates little

trader trades in the immediate next double auction after his arrival or return to the market.
Let K = Γ/∆, that is, it takes K double auctions to make sure that each slow trader has one
chance to trade. For simplicity, we will consider values of ∆ such that K is a positive integer.
The M slow traders are naturally separated into K “cohorts,” and each cohort has nS ≡ M/K
slow traders. The k-th cohort of nS slow traders trade with the nF fast traders at times k∆,
(K + k)∆, (2K + k)∆, etc. Because each slow traders participates only in 1/K of all double
auctions and fast traders participate in all auctions, we can say that a fast trader is K times
as fast as a slow trader. When K = 1, we get the homogeneous speed model in Section 2.
    Figure 6 illustrates the time line of the heterogeneous-speed market with two fast traders
(red diamonds) and two slow traders per period (blue circles).
    In this market, a higher trading frequency, or a lower ∆, creates the following tradeoff for
the slow traders. On the one hand, a lower ∆ reduces the average waiting time of each cohort
of slow traders. Specifically, within each cohort, the first trader’s waiting time before trading
is nSn−1
      S
         ∆, and the last trader’s waiting time is zero. The average waiting time per slow trader
          S −1
is thus n2n S
               ∆. If ∆ is reduced by, say, a half, then the average waiting time is also reduced to
nS /2−1 ∆     nS /2−1
2×nS /2 2
          = 2nS ∆. A shorter waiting time is therefore a benefit of a higher trading frequency.
On the other hand, a higher trading frequency also reduces the number of slow traders nS
in each double auction, since nS = M ∆/Γ. (This claim relies on the assumption that slow
price impact, sending it immediately to the market minimizes such risk. The qualitative nature of our results
still applies as long as slow traders cannot perfectly coordinate their trading times. If the slow traders were
able to coordinate their trading times perfectly, they effectively dictate the trading frequency of the market and
implement their preferred frequency 1/∆∗S that we characterize shortly.

traders cannot perfectly coordinate their trading times.) This implies that slow traders and
fast traders in each auction tend to be less aggressive, resulting in slower convergence to the
efficient allocation. We see that this fundamental tradeoff is very similar to that in Section 3.
    As before, a divisible asset pays a liquidating dividend D at an exponentially-distributed
future time with mean 1/r. To isolate the main insight of this section about heterogeneous
speeds, we use a much simpler information structure. Specifically, fast and slow traders receive
no signals about the dividend D; thus, they all value the dividend at E[D], which is normalized
to zero. Besides tractability, symmetric information regarding the asset fundamental value sets
our model of this section orthogonal to recent models of high-frequency trading in which fast
traders also have information advantage (see, for example, Biais, Foucault, and Moinas (2015),
Jovanovic and Menkveld (2012), and Hoffmann (2014)).
     We now describe the inventory evolution of the traders. We refer to a generic fast trader as
i, and a generic slow trader as j. Each fast trader starts with an initial inventory of zi,0 = 0.
A fast trader’s inventory at time τ is:

                              zi,τ = zi,t∆ + x∗i,t∆ ,        τ ∈ (t∆, (t + 1)∆],                     (58)

where xi,t∆ is the fast trader’s demand schedule in period t, p∗t∆ is the market-clearing price in
period t, and x∗i,t∆ = xi,t∆ (p∗t∆ ). Since at time 0 no slow trader has arrived and all fast traders
have the same inventory, x∗i,0 = 0 in the time-0 double auction.
    Without loss of generality, we consider a specific slow trader j who belongs to cohort k.
Let Tj,l ∈ ((lK + (k − 1))∆, (lK + k)∆] be the l-th arrival time when the slow trader j comes
to the market. When arriving for the first time, trader j starts with an inventory zj,Tj,0 that
is independently drawn from some mean-0 distribution. Subsequently, upon his l-th return,
trader j receives an inventory shock j,Tj,l , again independently drawn from another mean-0
distribution. The repeated inventory shocks make sure that inventory information is never
common knowledge. Thus, slow trader j’s inventory evolves according to:

tentially different coefficients λF and λS , respectively. Inventory costs associated with uneven
inventories are the source of gains from trade in this extension.

In these expressions we have used the normalization that the expected asset value E[D] = 0.
    Each fast trader i selects the optimal strategy profile {xi,t∆ } to maximize Ui , and each slow
trader j selects the optimal strategy profile {xj,(lK+k)∆ } to maximize Uj . The solution concept
is still Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium from Definition 1.

that traders hold zero inventory before time 0, that is, ZF,0 = 0 and ZS,(1−k)∆ = 0 for k ∈

but the analysis would not change in any substantial way.)

That is, at period t, each trader’s demand is linear in price, his own inventory, the fast traders’
total inventory in period t − 1, and the total inventory of each cohort of the slow traders except
the current cohort. The equilibrium price in period t is
                                                                                                                         

                                                                                                   (66)
A desirable property of strategies (64) and (65) is that the equilibrium path of prices {p∗t∆ }
reveal {(ZF,t∆ , ZS,t∆ )}t≥0 .12
    This equilibrium conjecture has one difficulty with off-equilibrium behavior. If a slow trader
made a single deviation from strategy (65) in period t, p∗t∆ would not reveal the true inventory
of the cohort of slow traders present in period t. But the period-t cohort does not participate
in the market in the next K − 1 periods, so prices p∗(t+1)∆ , p∗(t+2)∆ , ..., p∗(t+K−1)∆ cannot provide
any more information about the true inventory of the period-t cohort. Therefore, cohorts of
slow traders in periods t + 1, t + 2, ..., t + K − 1 cannot learn the true inventory of the period-t
cohort through prices; they must form beliefs. From that point on, there could be an explosion
in the number of state variables, including different traders’ expectations of total inventories,
their expectations of expectations, and so on.13
    To avoid this intractable problem, we assume that all true total inventories are publicly and
truthfully disclosed with a lag of ∆. That is, at time t∆, ZF,(t−1)∆ and ZS,(t−k)∆ become common
knowledge. Such public disclosure means that beliefs about the total inventory of fast traders
or any cohort of slow traders are pin down by the true inventories regardless of the deviation
by any single trader. Although this is a technical assumption, it can be motivated from post-
  12
      To see this, consider the following inductive argument. At t =P1, ZF,0 = 0 and ZS,(1−k)∆ = 0 for k =
1, 2, . . . , K − 1. The period-1 double auction price would then reveal j∈C(∆) zj,∆ , from which we can calculate
ZF,∆ and ZS,∆ . In period t > 1, given P    that ZF,(t−1)∆ and {ZS,(t−k) }K−1               ∗
                                                                          k=1 are known, pt∆ reveals the current
                                                                         ∗
cohort of slow traders’ total inventory j∈C(t∆) zj,t∆ . Then given pt∆ , the fast and slow traders’ new total
inventory ZF,t∆ and ZS,t∆ can be calculated.
   13
      In the homogeneous-speed model of Section 2 and Section 3, this problem does not arise because, after a
trader’s single deviation from the equilibrium strategy, the same trader still participates in subsequent double
auctions. All other traders who did not deviate will infer the correct sum of total signals from prices and need
not to form beliefs about it.

trade transparency regulation observed in reality. For example, during various time periods,
stock exchanges including Euronext Paris, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Korean Exchange,
the Australian Securities Exchange, and the Helsinki Stock Exchange require that broker IDs
be displayed together with their limit orders (see Comerton-Forde, Frino, and Mollica (2005),
Foucault, Moinas, and Theissen (2007), Comerton-Forde and Tang (2009), and Linnainmaa
and Saar (2012)).
    Once the off-equilibrium-belief problem is circumvented this way, the equilibrium can be
constructed by considering a single deviation of a trader and taking the first-order condition,
just like in Section 2. Details of equilibrium construction are delegated to Appendix D.


4.3    Preferred trading frequencies by fast traders and slow traders
The equilibrium is analytically intractable, but it can be solved numerically. Using the first-
order conditions shown in Appendix D and matching coefficients, we can numerically solve the
coefficients in Equations (64) and (65). From these strategies, we can subsequently evaluate
the welfare of fast traders and slow traders.
   Since the traders are heterogeneous, we ask what respective trading frequencies fast traders
and slow traders prefer ex-ante. In other words, if fast traders dictate market design, what ∆
would they choose ex-ante? The fast traders’ optimal frequency is therefore defined by:
                                                        nF
                                                        X
                                      ∆∗F   ∈ arg max         Ui .                           (67)
                                                  ∆
                                                        i=1


Similarly, if slow traders dictate market design, they would choose their own optimal frequency,
defined by:

Note that summing over individual traders’ ex-ante welfare in the respective two groups is a
valid welfare criterion, since traders in each group are ex-ante identical.
    We numerically evaluate the ex-ante expected welfare of fast traders and slow traders for
various levels of K, with the associated ∆ = Γ/K. A higher K is is equivalent to a higher
trading frequency 1/∆, which is equivalent to a lower number of slow traders per double auction.
At the trading frequency ∆ = Γ/M , there is only one slow trader per double auction, and the
market is the thinnest. If ∆ were to get any smaller, say, Γ/(2M ), there would be periods in
which only fast traders participate in the double auctions. But because fast traders are identical
in our model, on equilibrium path they have identical inventories period by period and will not
trade any positive quantity with each other. In other words, setting a lower bound of ∆ at

                                                37
Γ/M is without loss of generality.
    Figure 7 plots the fast traders’ welfare, in red, and slow traders’ welfare, in blue, as functions
of K ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}. We take the following baseline parameters: λF = λS = 1, r = 1,
Γ = 1, M = 32 and nF = 2. The corresponding ∆ is in the finite set {Γ, Γ2 , Γ4 , Γ8 , 16       Γ Γ
                                                                                                 , 32 }.
The inventory shocks {j,Tj,l } are set to zeros to speed up numerical calculations. The initial
inventories of the slow traders upon the first arrivals are normally distributed with mean zero
and variance one. We also consider different levels of imminence of payoff-relevant news (r = 1.5
and r = 0.5) and different populations of slow traders (M = 64 and M = 128). The optimal
K is indicated by a black dot.
    The most salient result from Figure 7 is that the fast traders always prefer the highest
K, or the highest possible trading frequency, at which only one slow trader participates in
each double auction. Because it is already a corner solution, this result is not driven by our
restricted attention to a discrete grid of K. Instead, the fast trader’ preference for the highest
trading frequency comes from the rents they extract by intermediating trades among slow
traders, or market-making. Intuitively, the fewer slow traders per double auction, the higher
rents extracted by fast traders because of imperfect competition. A higher trading frequency
also reduces fast traders’ inventory costs whenever their inventories are nonzero, since they can
more quickly offload their inventories to the next cohort of slow traders. We emphasize that
this result is not about superior information advantage of fast traders.
    If there is only one fast trader (nF = 1), we also find through numerical calculations that
the fast trader’s optimal trading frequency is such that there are two slow traders per period,
which is also the highest feasible trading frequency.14 The results for nF = 1 are not reported
to preserve space.
    The result that fast traders prefer the highest possible trading frequency, or the thinnest
market, is more robust than suggested by the numerical calculations. In the supplemental
materials to this paper, we analytically solve a limiting case of our model, in which: (i) there
is only one fast trader, and (ii) M → ∞, Γ → ∞, and M/Γ converges to a positive constant.
(In this limiting case, each slow trader trades only once.) We prove, analytically, that in this
limiting case the fast trader always strictly prefers the highest feasible trading frequency of two
slow traders per period.
    Now turning to the slow traders, we observe that they typically prefer an intermediate
trading frequency.15 Too low a trading frequency incurs too much waiting cost, whereas too
  14
      A linear equilibrium does not exist if there are only two traders (one fast and one slow) in each period. This
is consistent with the existing literature such as Kyle (1989), Vives (2011), and Rostek and Weretka (2012).
   15
      Because the optimal K for slow traders is intermediate, their optimal trading frequency is subject to the
technical caveat that the welfare is calculated only for K’s such that the number of slow traders per double
auction is an integer. It is possible to calculate everything for a general K, but there is little gain in the economic

high a trading frequency makes each double auction too uncompetitive. The internal solution
for ∆∗S is obtained as a result of the tradeoff between shorter delays in offloading inventory
shocks and a thicker, more competitive market. As the arrival rate r of asset payoffs becomes
smaller, slow traders are less eager to offload their inventories; thus, they prefer a thicker and
slower market, i.e., a smaller K and larger ∆. As the population of slow traders becomes larger,
each double auction becomes thicker automatically; consequently, slow traders prefer a faster
market, i.e. a higher K or smaller ∆, to minimize delay costs. These comparative statics are
natural. The case with nF = 1 yields qualitatively similar results for the slow traders.
    An important implication from the heterogeneous-speed model is that when market par-
ticipants are heterogeneous, who designs the market matters a great deal for the welfare of
intuition.

everyone. Mapping our fast and slow traders to their likely counterparts in reality, we see that
financial intermediaries and high-frequency traders, likely the fast, benefit most from speeding
up the market as much as possible, where retail and institutional investors, likely the slow,
initially benefit from market speedup but eventually suffer from it. For more liquid securities,
corresponding to a higher M , the fast traders’ interest and the slow traders’ interest are better
aligned in speeding up the market. These implications are unique to the heterogeneous-speed
model.


4.4    Trading frequency, price discovery, and excess volatility
We close this section with a simple observation implied by the model: under heterogeneous
speeds, a higher-frequency market tends to create faster price discovery but higher short-term
volatility. Intuitively, a higher trading frequency allows more immediate market reaction to
supply or demand shocks, but due to market thinness and market power, the short-term price
reaction “overshoots” the long-term price reaction.
    Figure 8 illustrates this idea in an simple example, in which there are nF = 2 fast traders
and M = 32 slow traders, and all slow traders but one arrive with zero inventory. The 10th
slow trader arrives with a large positive inventory of 20 units. Other parameters are the same as
the baseline parameters used in Figure 7. For each K ∈ {1, 4, 32}, the prices are calculated in
the linear equilibrium characterized above, and the price paths are plotted as step functions in
order to make clear the times of price changes. This exercise is obviously subject to the caveat
that slow traders cannot coordinate their trading times. But again, as long as slow traders
cannot perfectly coordinate trading times, the intuition would not change qualitatively.
    At the slowest-market extreme of K = 1, all 32 slow traders and two fast traders participate
in the double auctions together. The 10th trader’s supply shock is shared with the other 33
traders, so the price decline is mild but comes with a delay, at clock time 1.
    At the fastest-market extreme of K = 32, each double auction has only one slow trader
and two fast traders. The 10th slow trader’s large inventory creates a large price drop in the
immediate next double auction. Price discovery is fast in that the price reflects the excess
supply almost immediately. But the extent of price drop is much larger because (i) there
are only two fast traders to share the inventory shock, and (ii) these two fast traders exercise
market power. As soon as the 10th slow trader finishes the first round of trading, price rebounds
sharply, and then gradually, as the two fast traders offload their newly acquired inventory to
other slow traders in later periods. Because the 10th slow trader retains part of his original
inventory, the price periodically drops and recovers as the 10th slow trader returns to the market

parameters in Figure 7.

repeatedly.16 As time goes by, the price swing becomes smaller and smaller, and eventually the
price converges to that under K = 1. For K = 4, the price exhibits the same drop-and-recover
patterns but is less volatile.
    These price patterns of Figure 8 nicely mirror the price patterns obtained in the model
of Duffie (2010) based on investor inattention. Both models produce sharp price responses to
supply or demand shocks and subsequent reversals, as well as later repercussions with smaller
magnitudes. Beyond Duffie’s model, our model features imperfect competition, so price reac-
tions are more pronounced.
    Overall, this simple application of our heterogeneous-speed model suggests that under im-
perfect competition, a higher market speed may lead to more frequent occurrence of (mini)
“flash crashes” and “flash rallies” in electronic markets—sharp price drop and rebound that
last for a short period of time, or vice versa. CFTC and SEC (2010), Kirilenko, Kyle, Samadi,
and Tuzun (2015), Menkveld and Yueshen (2015), and Joint Staff Report (2015) provide in-
depth analysis of such events in markets for equities, futures, U.S. Treasuries, and foreign
exchange.
  16
    The deterministic time intervals between price drops come from the assumed deterministic trading delays.
The model of Duffie (2010) has the same feature. Stochastic time intervals between price drops may be obtained
by considering an alternative model in which each slow trader revisits the market according to a stochastic
process, say a Poisson process. That alternative model does not offer new economic intuition beyond our
current model, and is technically messier because the number of trader per double auction would be a random
variable.

5     Conclusion
In this paper, we study a dynamic model in which a finite number of traders receive private
information over time and trade strategically with demand schedules in a sequence of double
auctions. We characterize a stationary linear equilibrium in closed form. The equilibrium price
aggregates a weighted sum of the common value information and private values information,
but the two components cannot be separated from the price. Due to imperfect competition,
the equilibrium allocation is not fully efficient, but it converges to the efficient allocation expo-
nentially over time. The presence of adverse selection—asymmetric information regarding the
common-value component of the asset—slows down this convergence speed.
    We use this modeling framework to study the optimal trading frequency that maximizes
welfare. Trading frequency is measured as the number of double auctions per unit of clock time.
A higher trading frequency reduces the aggressiveness of demand schedules, but allows more
immediate reactions to new information. The allocative inefficiency in this dynamic market can
be decomposed into two parts: one part due to strategic behavior and the other due to delayed
responses to new information. The optimal tradeoff between these two effects depends on the
nature of information. If new information arrives at scheduled intervals, the optimal trading
frequency is never higher than the information frequency, and these two frequencies coincide if
traders are ex-ante identical. By contrast, if new information arrives as a Poisson process, the
optimal trading frequency can be (much) higher than the information arrival frequency, unless
adverse selection is very severe or if the number of traders is very low.
    We extend the model to study how market frequency interacts with heterogeneous trading
speeds. Fast traders access the market whenever it is open, but slow traders can only trade
periodically with a delay. Fast trader extract rents by intermediating trades among slow traders
across time. As a result, fast traders prefer the highest feasible trading frequency, whereas slow
traders tend to prefer a strictly lower frequency. Under heterogeneous speeds and market power,
a higher trading frequency speeds up price discovery, but may create higher short-term volatility
and price patterns that resemble “flash crashes” and “flash rallies.”

       is the efficient allocation at clock time τ (cf. Equation (26)).
Proof. The proof follows by directly calculating the limit of Proposition 2 as ∆ → 0 using L’Hopitâl’s
rule.
    Proposition 9 reveals that even if trading occurs continuously, in equilibrium the competitive allo-
cation is not reached instantaneously. The delay comes from traders’ price impact and the associated
demand reduction. This feature is also obtained by Vayanos (1999). Although submitting aggressive
orders allows a trader to achieve his desired allocation sooner, aggressive bidding also moves the price
against the trader and increases his trading cost. Facing this tradeoff, each trader uses a finite rate
of order submission in the limit. As in Proposition 4, the rate of convergence to the competitive
allocation in Proposition 9, r(nα − 2)/2, is increasing in n, r, and σw  2 but decreasing in σ 2 . (The
                                                                                               D
proof of Proposition 4 shows that ∂(nα)/∂σw   2 > 0, ∂(nα)/∂σ 2 < 0, and ∂(nα)/∂n > 0.)

B.2     Convergence rate to efficiency in large markets
To further explore the effect of adverse selection for allocative efficiency, and to compare with the
literature (in particular with Vayanos (1999)), we consider the rate at which inefficiency vanishes as
the number of traders becomes large, with and without adverse selection. Adverse selection exists if
σD2 > 0 and σ 2 > 0. For fixed σ 2 > 0 and σ 2 > 0, we compare the convergence rate in the case of a
                                              w
fixed σD2 > 0 to that in the case of σ 2 = 0.
                                        D
     We consider the inefficiency caused by strategic behavior, that is, the difference between the
total ex-ante utility in the strategic equilibrium of Proposition 2 and the total ex-ante utility in the
competitive equilibrium:

Proposition 10. Suppose that the news times {Tk }k≥1 either satisfy Tk = kγ for a constant γ > 0 or
                                                                  2       2          1 Pn
are given by a homogeneous Poisson process. Suppose also that σ > 0, σw > 0, and n i=1 E[(zi,0 −

          2 = 0, then as n → ∞:
   2. If σD

                                   converges to zero at the rate n−2 for any ∆ > 0,
                              n
                            X1 (∆)
                        lim        converges to zero at the rate n−1 .
                        ∆→0   n

    The convergence rates under σD    2 = 0 (i.e. pure private values) are also obtained in the model of

Vayanos (1999), who is the first to show that convergence rates differ between discrete-time trading
and continuous-time trading. Relative to the results of Vayanos (1999), Proposition 10 reveals that
the rate of convergence is slower if traders are subject to adverse selection. For any fixed ∆ > 0 and
as n → ∞, the inefficiency X1 (∆)/n vanishes at the rate of n−4/3 if σD    2 > 0, but the corresponding

rate is n−2 if σD2 = 0. If one first takes the limit of ∆ → 0, then the convergence rates as n becomes

large are n −2/3  and n−1 with and without adverse selection, respectively. (The limiting behavior of
the strategic equilibrium as ∆ → 0 is stated in Appendix B.1.) Interestingly, the asymptotic rates do
not depend on the size of σD 2 but only depend on whether σ 2 is positive or not.

Because the price is a martingale, i.e. E pc(t+1)∆ | Hi,t∆ , pct∆ = pct∆ , the above equation reduces to
the conjecture (15).


C.3        Proof of Proposition 2
We conjecture that traders use the following linear, symmetric and stationary strategy:

                               xj,t∆ (p; sj,t∆ , zj,t∆ ) = asj,t∆ − bp + dzj,t∆ + f Z.                            (85)

This conjecture implies the market-clearing prices of
                                                     n
                                                  a X         d + nf
                                         p∗t∆ =       sj,t∆ +        Z.                                           (86)

                                                    j=1
                                                    P
    Fix a history Hi,t∆ and a realization of j6=i sj,t∆ . We use the single-deviation principle to con-
struct an equilibrium strategy (85): under the conjecture that other traders j 6= i use strategy (85)
in every period t0 ≥ t, and that trader i returns to strategy (85) in period t0 ≥ t + 1, we verify that
trader i has no incentive to deviate from strategy (85) in period t.17                                     P
    If trader i uses an alternative demand schedule in period t, he faces      P the residual demand − j6=i xj,t∆ (pt∆ )
and is effectively choosing a price pt∆ and getting xi,t∆ (pt∆ ) = − j6=i xj,t∆ (pt∆ ). Therefore, by dif-
ferentiating trader i’s expected utility in period t with respect to pt∆ and evaluating it at pt∆ = p∗t∆
in Equation (86), we obtain the following first order condition in period t of trader i:

where we write x∗i,(t+k)∆ = xi,(t+k)∆ (p∗(t+k)∆ ; si,(t+k)∆ , zi,(t+k)∆ ) for the strategy xi,(t+k)∆ ( · ) defined in
Equation (85), and by definition zi,(t+k+1)∆ = zi,(t+k)∆ + x∗i,(t+k)∆ .
   Since all traders follow the conjectured strategy in Equation (85) from period t + 1 and onwards,
we have the following evolution of inventories: for any k ≥ 1,

       zi,(t+k)∆ + x∗i,(t+k)∆ =asi,(t+k)∆ − bp∗(t+k)∆ + f Z + (1 + d)zi,(t+k)∆                                    (88)
                            =(asi,(t+k)∆ − bp∗(t+k)∆ + f Z) + (1 + d)(asi,(t+k−1)∆ − bp∗(t+k−1)∆ + f Z)

    The evolution of prices and inventories, given by Equations (86) and (88), reveals that by changing
the demand or price in period t, trader i has the following effects on inventories and prices in period

     For a description of the single-deviation principle, also called “one-stage deviation principle”, see Theorem
4.1 and 4.2 of Fudenberg and Tirole (1991). We can apply their Theorem 4.2 because the payoff function in our
model, which takes the form of a “discounted” sum of period-by-period payoffs, satisfies the required “continuity
at infinity” condition.

                                               f =−     −    .                                        (103)

    Under the condition nα > 2, we can show that b > 0 and −1 < d < 0, that is, the demand schedule
is downward-sloping in price and the inventories evolutions (89)–(90) converge.

     This dropped solution to Equation (100) has the property of (1+d)e−r∆ < −1, which leads to an unbounded
path of inventories (cf. Equation (88)) and utilities.

       By Equation (19), the condition nα > 2 is equivalent to the condition
                                                                      2

which is equivalent to the following condition on the fundamentals:
                                                     r

   Finally, we verify the second-order condition. Under the linear strategy in Equation (85) with
b > 0, differentiating the first-order condition (87) with respect to p0 gives
                                                   ∞
                                                                         !

                                                         k=0

This completes the construction of a perfect Bayesian equilibrium.


C.4         Proof of Proposition 3
Suppose that every trader i use the strategy:
                                     X
                        xi,t∆ (p) =      al Si,Tl + aw wi,t∆ − bp + dzi,t∆ + f,                      (107)
                                          Tl ≤t∆

where {al }l≥0 , aw , b, d and f are constants. We show that for everyone using strategy (107) to be a
perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE), the constants must be the ones given by Proposition 2. We divide
our arguments into two steps.
    Step 1. Define xl ≡ al /aw . 19 As a first step, we show that if strategy (107) is a symmetric PBE,
then we must have xl = χ for every l, where χ is defined in Equation (19).
    Suppose that (t − 1)∆ ∈ [Tk0 , Tk0 +1 ) and t∆ ∈ [Tk , Tk+1 ), so there are k − k 0 ≥ 1 dividend shocks
between time (t − 1)∆ and time t∆. 20 Without loss of generality, assume k 0 = 0. Since all other
traders j 6= i are using strategy (107), by computing the difference p∗t∆ − p∗(t−1)∆ , trader i can infer
from the period-t price the value of
                                          k

       Clearly, we cannot have aw = 0, since players use their private values in any equilibrium.

       In period t = 0, we take DT−1 = wi,T−1 = 0.

   Since we look for a symmetric equilibrium in which everyone plays strategy (107), trader i’s
conditional value in Equation (111) must place a weight of xl on Si,Tl , 1 ≤ l ≤ k, which implies that

                                                  u Σ−1 = x,                                               (112)

where x = (x1 , . . . , xk , y) and y is an arbitrary number. Clearly, Equation (112) is equivalent to

                                                   u = x Σ,

   Now define x ≡ x1 = · · · = xk . Applying Lemma 3 to the conditional value in Equation (111)
implies that for the conditional value in Equation (111) to place a weight of x on Si,Tl , 1 ≤ l ≤ k, we
must have x = χ.
   Step 2. Given Step 1, we can rewrite the strategy (107) as

                                  xi,t∆ (p) = aw · α si,t∆ − bp + dzi,t∆ + f,                              (113)

where si,t∆ is the total signal defined in Equation (20) and α is defined in Equation (21). The
equilibrium construction in Appendix C.3 then uniquely determines the values of aw , b, d and f . This

C.5     Proof of Proposition 4
The exponential convergence to efficient allocation follows directly from Equation (34).
   Now we prove the comparative statics. We write

                                                           η ≡ nα − 1.                                                     (114)

and recall that

                        ∂(1+d)
   We first note that     ∂η     < 0.

   1. The comparative statics with respect to r follow by straightforward calculations showing that
      ∂(1+d)
        ∂r   < 0.

   2. As σD 2 increases, the left-hand side of Equation (19) increases, and hence the solution χ to

      Equation (19) increases, which means that nα decreases because according to Equation (21) nα
                                              ∂η           ∂(1+d)
      is a decreasing function of χ2 . Thus, ∂σ 2 < 0, and  ∂σ 2
                                                                  > 0.

   3. As σw2 increases, the left-hand side of Equation (19) increases, and hence the solution χ to

      Equation (19) increases; by Equation (19) this means that σw2 /χ2 must increase as well. Thus,
                                                                                       2 /χ2 . Hence,
      nα increases because according to Equation (21) nα is an increasing function of σw
       ∂η          ∂(1+d)
      ∂σ 2
           > 0 and ∂σ2 < 0.

      From Equation (118) is it straightforward to show that η must increase with n. Thus, 1 + d
      decreases in n.

C.6.1        Proof of Proposition 5
For any τ > 0, we let t(τ ) = min{t ≥ 0 : t ∈ Z, t∆ ≥ τ }. That is, if new signals arrive at the clock
time τ , then t(τ )∆ is the clock time of the next trading period (including time τ ).
    For any ∆ ≤ γ, by the assumption of Proposition 5 there is at most one new signal profile arrival
in each interval [t∆, (t + 1)∆). Thus, we only need to count the changes in competitive allocation
between period t((k − 1)γ) and t(kγ), for k ∈ Z+ . Using this fact, we can rewrite X1 (∆) and X2 (∆)
as:

where the last inequality holds because d(∆) decreases with ∆ (which can be verified by taking
derivative the d0 (∆)) and where the last equality holds because t(kγ)∆ = kγ if γ = ∆. Therefore, we
have W (∆) < W (γ) for any ∆ < γ. This proves Proposition 5.
     Notice that for this lower bound of ∆∗ ≥ γ we make no use of the assumption that E[(zi,kγe    −

but have private value shocks wi,kγ − wi,(k−1)γ that are non-stationary in k.

    We first prove part 2 of Proposition 6. As n tends to infinity, the proof of Proposition 10 implies
that nα tends to infinity as well. As nα → ∞, (1 + d(lγ))/(nα − 1) → 0 for every l ∈ Z+ , and
by assumption σ02 /σz2 remains bounded, so the second term in Equation (129) dominates, and hence
X(lγ) is minimized at l∗ = 1.
    For part 1 of Proposition 6, suppose zi,0 = Z/n for every i, so we have σ02 = σz2 . Minimizing X(lγ)
over positive integers l is equivalent to maximizing W̃ (lγ) over l:

After substituting δ = e−r/(lµ) , the righthand side of the above equation is increasing in r/µ if l ≥ 2/3.
As r/µ → 0, the righthand side tends to 9/(6l − 1)2 . This proves Part 1 of Proposition 7.

    Suppose σD 2 > 0. Equation (118) (where η ≡ nα − 1) implies that nα is of order n2/3 as n → ∞.

To see this, first note that η → ∞ and η/n → 0 as n → ∞, for otherwise the left-hand side and
right-hand side of Equation (118) cannot match. Suppose that as n becomes large, η is of order ny

                                                              59
for some y < 1. The left-hand side of Equation (118) is of order ny−1 , and the right-hand side is of
order n−y/2 . Thus, y = 2/3.
    For any fixed ∆ > 0, it is straightforward to use Taylor expansion to calculate that, as n becomes
large,
                          1 + d(∆)          1
                                     =           (nα − 1)−2 + O((nα − 1)−4 ).
                           nα − 1       1 − e−r∆
Therefore, (1 + d(∆))/(nα − 1) and hence X1 (∆)/n are of order n−4/3 .
   But if we first take the limit ∆ → 0, we clearly have

                                                        1 + d(∆)     1
                                                  lim            =        ,

so lim∆→0 (1 + d(∆))/(nα − 1) and hence lim∆→0 X1 (∆)/n are of order n−2/3 .
        2 = 0, then nα = n. The same calculation as above shows that X (∆)/n is of order n−2 for a
    If σD                                                             1

D.1       Fast trader’s single deviation
For a fast trader i, raising the price p∗t̄∆ by one unit has the following effects in period t̄:

D.2          Slow trader’s single deviation
For a slow trader j, raising the price p∗t̄∆ by one unit has the following effects in period t̄:

                    ∂x∗j,t̄∆                                              ∂ZF,t̄∆                    ∂ZS,t̄∆

     Slow trader j’s first order condition at period t̄ is:

                                                                   ∂(zj,(t̄+t)∆ + x∗j,(t̄+t)∆ )               ∂p∗(t̄+t)∆

    For period t̄ + t, traders follow the strategies (64) and (65), so we can write:
                                                                             K−1

for each t ∈ {K, 2K, 3K, . . .}. The constants Dz,t,k and Dx,t,k can be recursively computed from the
coefficients in Equations (64) and (65).

where ZF,t̄∆ and ZS,t̄∆ are given by Equations (152) and (153).
    Given Equations (151) and (157), we then match the coefficients with Equations (64) and (65) to
get 2(K + 2) equations with 2(K + 2) unknown variables (bF , dF , eF , bS , dS , eS , fF,k , and fS,k , where
k = 1, . . . , K − 1).
