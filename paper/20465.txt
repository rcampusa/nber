                                             ABSTRACT

We report the results of a randomized experiment testing impacts of subsidies for modern agricultural
inputs in rural Mozambique. One-time provision of a voucher for fertilizer and improved seeds leads
to substantial increases in fertilizer use, which persist through two subsequent agricultural seasons.
Voucher receipt also leads to large, persistent increases in household agricultural production and market
sales, per capita consumption, assets, durable good ownership, and housing improvements.

Consistent with learning models of the adoption decision, we find positive treatment effects on farmers'
estimated returns to the input package. We also document positive cross-household treatment spillovers:
one's own fertilizer use rises in the number of social network members receiving vouchers. Our findings
are consistent with theoretical models predicting persistence of impacts of temporary technology adoption
subsidies, in particular due to learning effects.

1       Introduction

Dierences in technology are widely believed to explain cross-country dierences

in per capita GDP (Caselli and Coleman (2001), Comin and Hobijn (2004)).

Given that the majority of the world's poor work in agriculture (IFAD (2011)),

much attention has been focused on adoption of modern agricultural inputs.

The substantial gains in agricultural productivity due to the Green Revolu-

tion involved introduction of improved seeds and modern fertilizers.
                                                                                           1   In this

context, Sub-Saharan Africa has proved to be an outlier: from 1960 to 2000,

it experienced the smallest increase in agricultural yields across regions of the

world (Evenson and Gollin (2003)). In 2009, fertilizer utilization in sub-Saharan

Africa averaged only 13 kilograms per hectare; by contrast, in other developing

countries the average was 94 kilograms per hectare.
                                                                    2

     Motivated by this disparity, many sub-Saharan African countries have em-

barked on perhaps the most signicant new development in agricultural policy

over the past decade: large scale input subsidy programs aimed at raising the

use of fertilizer and other modern inputs in agriculture. In ten African countries

implementing input subsidy programs, program expenditures in 2011 amounted

to $1.05 billion, or 28.6 percent of public expenditures on agriculture (Jayne

and Rashid (2013)).
                             3

     The rapid spread of fertilizer subsidies has occurred alongside active debate

as to their desirability. Schultz (1964) argued that farmers are rational prot

maximizers who will choose optimal fertilizer use levels, so subsidies introduce

distortions and reduce social welfare. Other arguments against subsidies include

negative environmental externalities (WorldBank (2007)) and regressive distri-

bution schemes resulting from political inuence and elite capture (Chibwana

et al. (2010), Pan and Christiaensen (2011), Lunduka et al. (2013)). Advocates

for subsidies point to market failures that would lead laissez-faire fertilizer use

levels to be less than socially optimal. Motivated in part by concerns about such

market failures, Sachs (2004) and Ellis (1992) have argued for fertilizer subsi-

dies. In recent years, the World Bank has reversed previous decades' opposition

to subsidies and now provides budget support for fertilizer subsidy programs

    1 Norman       Borlaug famously called high-yielding seed varieties the catalysts that ignited
the Green Revolution, and chemical fertilizers the fuel that has powered its forward thrust
(Borlaug 1972).
    2 FAO   (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) statistics, accessible at
http://faostat.fao.org/site/422/default.aspx#ancor.
    3 Fertilizer   subsidies are not limited to Africa, of course. Indian fertilizer subsidies are also
substantial, amounting to 1.52 percent of GDP in 2008-09 (Sharma and Thaker (2009)).
(Morris et al. (2007)).
                          4   It is therefore important to shed light on the existence

of any market failures in this context, so that rationales for input subsidies can

be correctly evaluated.

    We contribute to this debate on three fronts. First, we provide one of the

rst randomized controlled trials of the impact of an input subsidy program,

and the rst to measure impacts on a range of important household outcomes

beyond fertilizer use itself. The only previous study using randomized methods

is Duo et al. (2011), who estimate impacts of fertilizer subsidies on fertilizer

use alone (in rural Kenya).        We show positive impacts of input subsidies (in

Mozambique) on a range of outcomes beyond input use, including farm output,

household consumption, assets, and housing quality.

    Second, we nd positive eects of input subsidies that persist up to two an-

nual agricultural seasons beyond the season in which the subsidies were oered.

This result contrasts with Duo et al. (2011), who nd no persistent impact of

either heavy (50%) subsidies for fertilizer or the well-timed nudge of oering

free delivery at the time of the previous harvest. Both treatments raise fertilizer

use in the season they are provided, but impacts are very close to zero and not

statistically signicantly dierent from zero in the next season.

    Third, we provide the rst eld experimental evidence of agricultural tech-

nology adoption spillovers within a social network.
                                                          5   Because the subsidy vouch-

ers were randomly assigned, our study also generated random variation in the

number of social network members (dened as those whom the respondent talked

with at least moderately about agriculture in the previous season) who also re-

ceived the input subsidy voucher. We nd that one's own fertilizer use rises in

the number of social network members receiving the voucher.

    Our results provide support for some classes of theoretical models of agri-

cultural households, and evidence against others, thereby sharpening the types

of arguments that can (and cannot) be made in support of input subsidies. Our

ndings are consistent with models in which a one-time subsidy leads to per-

sistent changes in technology adoption, such as models where subsidies create

wealth eects that promote adoption, or that involve learning about the returns

  4 Duo   et al. (2011) provide experimental evidence from Kenya that farmers' behavioral
biases leading to under-investment in fertilizer can be overcome more cost-eectively with
well-timed small subsidies than large subsidies akin to those currently being implemented in
sub-Saharan Africa.
  5 Previous   randomized studies of social network spillovers have focused on adoption of
health goods, and include Kremer and Miguel (2007), Dupas (2014), and Oster and Thornton
(2012). Observational studies of agricultural technology adoption include Bandiera and Rasul
(2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (1995), Conley and Udry (2010), and Munshi (2006).




                                             2
to fertilizer. We provide such a model in Section 2 of the paper.

    A number of patterns in our results are consistent with the subsidies operat-

ing via the learning channel. First, voucher winning leads study participants to

report higher estimated returns from use of the input package. In addition, the

eect of having voucher winners in one's social network is similar in magnitude

to the impact of winning a voucher oneself, and occurs only in years subsequent

to the voucher distribution season (after the results of fertilizer use by voucher

winners can be observed).

    Our results are inconsistent with models where a one-time subsidy does not

lead to persistent technology adoption.           For example, a simple Ramsey-style

model without capital market imperfections and an optimal steady-state level

of input utilization would predict that a one-time subsidy would have only

a temporary eect, and that utilization would rapidly return to the steady

state.   Our results also are contrary to the prediction of a behavioral model

a la Duo et al. (2011), in which partially naÃ¯ve farmers who face stochastic

temptation shocks systematically delay fertilizer purchases, so that some farmers

wait too long and run out of liquidity right before planting time and thus have

lower utilization than optimal. In such a setting, a one-time nudge or subsidy

raises adoption only in the current season, and is not persistent.              Similarly,

arguments that fertilizers are simply not protable at market prices because of

soil characteristics (Marenya and Barrett (2009)) imply that once-o subsidies

may have temporary, but not long-lasting, impacts.

    Our work is related to existing research on market failures in technology

adoption. Past work has shown that technology adoption is inuenced by infor-

mation imperfections, which lead to a need for learning about new technologies

(Munshi (2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (1995), Bandiera and Rasul (2006),

Conley and Udry (2010)); credit constraints (Miyata and Sawada (2007), Gine

and Klonner (2005)); and insurance market failures (Dercon and Christiaensen

(2007), Moser and Barrett (2006), Foster and Rosenzweig (2009)).
                                                                           6   Experimen-

tal research on the persistence of technology adoption in response to short-term

subsidies for health goods is also related (Kremer and Miguel (2007), Dupas

(2014), Tarozzi et al. (2014)).

    In the rest of this paper, we rst outline a simple theory that generates

persistence of adoption in response to a one-time subsidy (Section 2). We then

describe the study setting and experimental design in Section 3.                Section 4

   6 Foster   and Rosenzweig (2010) review the technology adoption literature in economics,
including studies of fertilizer adoption.

we present the empirical results, and then conclude in Section 6.




2     A Model of the Impact of One-time Input Sub-

      sidies on Technology Adoption

This section puts forward an economic model that allows us to explore the in-

teraction between protability, liquidity and information constraints on the use

of fertilizer and improved seeds. The model provides a sharper understanding

of when and how one-time input subsidies might spur sustained adoption of

improved technologies and helps structure our subsequent empirical analysis.

    The model assumes that households are risk averse, lack access to capi-

tal markets and are unable to borrow to nance the adoption of an improved

agricultural technology. To cut down on verbiage, we will simply refer to this

technology as fertilizer. Specically, the model demonstrates:


    1. Absent an input subsidy, a non-adoption equilibrium can emerge if initial

      living standards are low, especially if beliefs about the distribution of

      returns to fertilizer are downwardly biased or diuse.


    2. A one-time subsidy on the price of the new technology can move (some)

      otherwise non-adopting households to adopt the new technology.


    3. If the subsidy-induced adoption does not have any learning eects, then

      technology adoption may persist after expiration of the subsidy through a

      pure wealth eect. This wealth eect is stochastic (dependent on realized

      returns to fertilizer) and sustained adoption under it may be fragile in

      the sense that poor outcomes can lead to subsequent reversion to the no

      fertilizer equilibrium.


    4. Sustained adoption becomes more likely (and stable) if the wealth eect

      is accompanied by positive learning eect of one-time subsidies. Positive

      learning can occur through a reduction in pessimism about expected re-

      turns to fertilizers as well as through a reduction in the diuseness or

      spread of beliefs about the distribution of fertilizer returns.


After laying out our core model assumptions, this section will rst consider the

impact of fertilizers on the short- and long-run adoption of fertilizers in the

absence of learning.   We will then open the model to learning and consider



                                         4
the additional insights and implications of temporary vouchers on sustained

technology adoption. The Appendix explores learning about diuseness.



2.1 Technology and Subjective Beliefs
We model the behavior of agricultural households that are risk averse and lack

access to contracts for both insurance and credit. We assume that traditional

production technology does not require purchased inputs and provides a xed,

non-stochastic output,          xÌ.   Households can choose to augment the traditional

technology with a divisible improved technology that utilizes a purchased input

f                                 xÌ+yf , where y is the random return per unit
    (fertilizer) and produces output,

                                                                      [yâ , y + ],
fertilizer and we assume that it is distributed over the closed interval
                                                      7
with probability distribution Ï and with EÏ [y] = yÌ . Normalizing the price of

the agricultural output to 1 and denoting the market price of fertilizer as pf ,

note that absent subsidy, the technology will be is protable in expectation if

yÌ > pf .
     We justify this constant marginal impact of fertilizer via an eciency wage

theory of plant growth such that a given an amount of fertilizer is applied to an

optimal area/number of plants, yielding a constant (expected) output increment

per-unit fertilizer.
                          8   Spreading this amount of fertilizer across a larger area

will decrease returns.          Note that this perspective is consistent with standard

fertilizer practice which is to concentrate a limited amount of fertilizer in a

small area, rather than spreading it out so that each plant gets only some tiny

amount. Importantly, this production specication means that marginal returns

to fertilizer are always nite, even at low levels of use.
                                                                    9

     As we are interested in the behavior of farm households that largely lack

prior experience using the improved technology, we assume that farmers lack

full information on the true distribution of            y.   In the simplest case, we assume

that farmers correctly understand the dispersion in returns to the improved

technology, but are systematically biased in their beliefs about the level of those

    7 Strictly   speaking, this assumption applies only up to the point where the total amount of
fertilizer exceeds the optimum amount for total farm size. We will ignore this eventual drop
in returns to fertilizer as even the voucher program under study provides fertilizer well short
of the optimum amount for the total cultivated area of households in our sample.
    8 Specically    we assume that plant yields are unresponsive at low levels of fertilizer or
plant nutrition, and then have an increasing returns portion followed by a diminishing returns
portion. As in the nutrition-based eciency wage theory, this relationship will pin down a
unique level of fertilizer that maximizes returns.
    9 Note   that the same logic applies to improved seed as a small quantity of improved seeds
will boost yields in the small area where they are planted, but cannot be ground up and spread
out over the entire cultivated area for higher returns.




                                                  5
returns. Specically, we assume that individuals believe that returns to fertilizer

are driven by a random variable                  yÌ = y â B ,   where   B   is the systematic bias in

perceived returns.            At time      0,   we denote the bias as B0 , and the subjective
expected returns to fertilizer of              yÌ given period 0 beliefs as E0 (yÌ) = yÌÂ¯0 . We
dene beliefs as pessimistic if             B0 > 0 and optimistic if B0 < 0.
    For the case in which priors are not diuse, but are biased, we can write

Ï0 (yÌ) = Ï(y +B0 ). Denote the corresponding subjective cumulative distribution
function as   Î¦0 . The appendix below generalizes this specication and allows
uninformed farmers to have relatively diuse prior beliefs about the distribution

of returns to fertilizer.



2.2 Technology Adoption in the Short and Medium Run
    without Learning
In order to isolate the liquidity from the learning eects of voucher coupons,

we rst consider their impact assuming that no learning takes place. The next

section will consider what happens when households update their priors about

returns to fertilizers.

    Consider a 3-period model of an agricultural household that produces and

consumes the agricultural commodity.
                                                      10   We assume that the household is of-

fered a once-o input subsidy in in period 1 that reduces the cost of fertilizer

from   pf    to   pf â v ,   where   v   is the voucher value. After period 1, the voucher ex-

pires and the price of fertilizer returns to its xed market price of                 pf .   To explore

the impact of this temporary fertilizer voucher subsidy, we consider the follow-

ing model of an agricultural household that chooses how much to invest in rst

and second period savings (s1 , s2 ) and fertilizer (f1 , f2 ) in order to maximize

expected utility given its prior subjective beliefs about the returns to fertilizer:


                             maxf1 ,s1 ,f2 ,s2 u(c1 ) + Î²E0 [u(c2 ) + Î²u(c3 )]
                                                  subject to :
                                                c1 â¤ z0 â (pf â v)f1 â s1
                                                                                                    (1)
                                            c2 â¤ xÌ + y1 f1 â pf f2 + rs1 â s2
                                              c3 â¤ xÌ + y2 f2 + rs2
                                               f1 , s1 , f2 , s2 â¥ 0
 10 The     assumption of only 3 periods, with households consuming all cash on hand in period
3, is of course limiting, but it is sucient to allow us to garner key insights on short and
medium term technology adoption.




                                                       6
where   Î² = (1 + Î´)â1     is the per-period discount factor,              z0   is initial cash on

hand for the household,    y1   and   y2   represent the realized returns to fertilizer in

production periods 1 and 2, respectively, and           r   is the xed interest rate factor

for rst and second period savings. Given that returns to informal savings are

low or even negative, we will assume that the households are impatient in the

sense that   Î²r < 1.   Under this assumption, households will only use nancial

savings to smooth consumption between periods, but not to build wealth.



2.2.1 Second Period Problem
We begin by examining second period choice conditional on realizations from the

rst year crop yield. Dene second period cash-on-hand as                 z2 = xÌ + y1 f1 + rs1 .
Note that second period cash on hand only depends on period 1 decisions and

realizations. We can write the conditional second-period value function as:


                       V2â (z2 ) â¡ maxf2 ,s2 u(c2 ) + Î²E0 [u(c3 )]
                                      subject to :
                                       c2 â¤ z2 â pf f2 â s2                                  (2)

                                       c3 â¤ xÌ + y2 f2 + s2
                                          f2 , s2 â¥ 0

The Kuhn-Tucker conditions for this problem are:



                   dV2                                              dV2
                       = Î²E0 [y2 u03 ] â u02 pf â¤ 0;           f2     =0
                   df2                                            df2                        (3)
                     dV2                                        dV2
                         = Î²rE0 [u03 ] â u02 â¤ 0;            s2     =0

As can be seen from these conditions, the key comparison determining fertilizer
                                                                     0
use is the comparison of the expected benets (E0 [y2 u3 ]) to the shadow price
               0
of liquidity (u2 pf ) and returns to savings,      r.
   Analysis of this problem simplies when the rst order conditions are eval-

uated at the corner solution value of       f2 = 0. At this value, third period cash
on hand is non-stochastic, making        u03 independent of the random variable y2 .
Evaluated at the corner solution       (f2 = 0), the household will only set f2 > 0 if

the following expression is true:

                                                0       
                                E0 [y2 ]        u2
                                         > max       , r   .
                                 pf             Î²u03



                                               7
The rst term on the right hand side says that expected returns under fertilizer

must exceed the shadow price or opportunity cost of liquidity, while the second

says that discounted expected returns to fertilizer must exceed returns to savings

if any funds are to be invested in fertilizer.              If this condition does not hold,

then fertilizer adoption will never be sustained in the second period. That is,

consumption will be smoothed using the available savings technology.

    Assuming that expected returns to fertilizer exceed the returns to savings,
E0 [y2 ]
 pf      > r, then we can dene a critical level of cash on hand,

                            zÌ2 = {z2 |Î²u03 E0 [y2 ] = pf u02 (z2 )} ,

such that the individual is just indierent between adopting and not adopting

the improved technology in period 2. At the corner solution                   f2 , s2 = 0 increases
                                                                                  0
in   z2   will only aect the shadow price of liquidity                through u2 and hence for

values of values   z2 > zÌ2 ,   the individual will optimally adopt the new technology

        f2 > 0), whereas no adoption will occur for lower values of z2 .
(i.e., set

   Using zÌ2 , note that for any prior choices of f1 and s1 we can dene the

minimum period 1 fertilizer returns necessary to give cash on hand of zÌ and to

sustain fertilizer adoption s:


                                                 (zÌ2 â xÌ â rs1 )
                                 y(f1 , s1 ) â¡                     .
                                                        f1

Absent learning, y(f1 , s1 ) is the minimum rst period returns to fertilizer that

must be realized in order or the household to sustain the adoption of the new

technology in period 2. Note that y is decreasing in both of its arguments. A

fertilizer subsidy that induces rst period adoption of fertilizer thus creates a

potential wealth eect that sustains fertilizer adoption in the second period by

simply pushing net wealth or cash on hand above the minimum level                           zÌ2 .   In

what follows, we will assume that         zÌ > xÌ.

2.2.2 First Period Problem
Using the value function dened by 2, we can now examine the rst period

problem as:

                          maxf1 ,s1 V1 (z0 ) â¡ u(c1 ) + Î²E0 [V2â (z2 )]
                                         subject to :
                                       c1 â¤ z0 â (pf â v)f1 â s1                                  (4)

                                           z2 = xÌ + y1 f1 + rs1
                                          f1 , s1 â¥ 0
In general form, we can write the rst order conditions with respect to                      f1   and

s1    as:
                                     âE0 [V2â ]
                                 Î²              â u01 (pf â v) â¤ 0
                                       âf1                         .                              (5)
                                         âE0 [V2â ]
                                       Î²            â u01 â¤ 0
                                           âs1
These conditions broadly mimic the conditions for the second period problem

(3) except for two important dierences. First the subsidy                v   lowers the shadow

price of a unit of fertilizer, making adoption of an interior solution with                 f1   more

likely. Second, the expected gains from fertilizer or savings are more complex.

      To explore these expected gains, it is useful to break apart the second compo-

nent of the maximand in (4) above into two pieces. Recalling that  Î¦0 is the cu-
mulative distribution for prior subjective beliefs, we dene Î¦y = Î¦0 [y(f1 , s1 )] =

P rob(y1 > y(f1 , s1 )) and rewrite the second component of the maximand (4)
as:



E0 [V2â (z2 )] = (1âÎ¦y ) {E0 [V2â (z2 ) | y1 < y(f1 , s1 )]}+Î¦y {E0 [V2â (z2 ) | y1 > y(f1 , s1 )]} .

Denote the rst term in curly brackets as             A and the second term in curly brackets
as    B.    Note that   B â¥ A.
      Using this expression, we can, for example, rewrite the rst order condition

with respect to     f1   as:

                                               
                        âÎ¦y                  âÎ¦y
        Î² (1 â Î¦y )A0 â     A + Î² (Î¦y )B 0 +     B â u01 (pf â v) â¤ 0.
                        âf1                  âf1

with a similar expression for the the derivative of           V1   with respect to   s1 .   Because

it is the corner condition at no fertilizer use that will determine adoption of the

new technology, we again evaluate the rst order conditions at                  f1 = 0.     At this
                            0
corner solution, note that u2 is non-stochastic and that               Î¦y = 0,   allowing us to




                                                  9
rewrite conditions (5) as:

                        n                 dÎ¦y
                                                        o
                       Î² u02 E0 [y1 ] +    df1 (B â A)      â u01 (pf â v) â¤ 0
                                          Î² {u02 r} â u01   â¤0

           dÎ¦y
where
            df1   = ... â¥ 0.   Note that with   B > A, application of fertilizer not only has
direct, short-term eect on second period well-being, but also an option value

eect as it probabilistically opens the door to period 2 fertilizer investment and

improved third period well-being.

     As with the second period problem, there will be a critical minimum amount

of cash-on-hand above which adoption occurs (if augmented expected returns

exceed     r).    Note that this minimum level decreases with the magnitude of the

subsidy and denote it as       zÌ0 (v). Note also that pessimism about the returns to
fertilizer (a larger value of      B0 which decreases E0 [y1 ]) will make it less likely
fertilizer will increase zÌ0 (v) and make it less likely that fertilizer will be adopted

even with subsidy.



2.2.3 Sustained Adoption and Disadoption
We are now in a position to examine the economics of fertilizer adoption. Drawn

for a given set of initial beliefs, Figure 1 partitions the space dened by initial

cash on hand (z0 ) and stochastic rst period fertilizer returns (y1 ) into three

areas. The rst area is for all households with initial cash on hand less than the

minimum necessary to invest in fertilizer (z0               < zÌ0 (v)).   If we assume that   xÌ <
zÌ0 (v = 0),      then it is reasonable to assume that most households will not adopt

fertilizer absent a subsidy.         As the subsidy increases, the dashed vertical line

in Figure 1 will shift to the left, crowding in more rst period experimentation

with fertilizer.

     For those that adopt fertilizer in period 1, two outcomes are possible.                    If

returns are high enough to push second period cash on hand above the critical

level z, then adoption of the technology will be sustained. Given that returns

to fertilizer are stochastic, note that those who sustain technology adoption

will be only a subset of those who adopted it in period 1, with the second

period adoption probability being an increasing function of rst period fertilizer

returns. The solid downward sloping curve in Figure 1 displays the values of

z0   and   y1     such that the household is just indierent between disadoption and

sustained second period adoption. Those above the curve will continue to use

                  Figure 1: Fertilizer Adoption and Disadoption




fertilizer in period 2.

   For those with less buoyant rst period returns (y1 < y(z0 )), disadoption will
occur.   Note that some of these households (with 0 < y1 < y) may boost savings

in order to smooth consumption between periods 2 and 3.        However, without

more optimistic expectations about the returns to fertilizer, these households

will not continue to adopt fertilizer beyond the subsidy period.



2.3 Technology Adoption in the Presence of Learning
The analysis so far has assumed that expected returns to fertilizer are unchanged

by experience with the voucher coupons. However, individuals can learn from

their own experience using fertilizers in period 1, as well as from the experience

of others in their social network.    Lettingy1 denote the returns to fertilizer
obtained by the household in period 1, we dene the information content of this
                â
information as y1 = y1 â E0 (yÌ). Similarly, let y1n be the yields that member

n of the farmer's social network obtained using fertilizer in period 1 and the
                         â
information content as y1n = y1n â E0 (yÌ). Assuming that the farmer has N1

network members using fertilizer in period 1, then we can dene the information




                                        11
content of the signal that the farmer receives from the network as:


                                           N                
                                  â
                                           X   y1n â E0 (yÌ)
                                 y1N   =                         .
                                           n=1
                                                      N1

      From a Bayesian learning perspective, the farmer will update the bias in

prior beliefs about returns to fertilizer (B0 ) based on the strength of prior be-
           2                                           â          â
liefs (ÏB ), the new information received (y1 and              , y1n ),    and the variance or
         0
                                    2
precision of that new information (Ïy â ). Assembling these pieces, we posit a
                                     1n
                                          â 2   â     2
learning model in which B1 = B0 + f (y1 , ÏB , y1n , Ïy â ). Foreshadowing the
                                                           0         1n

later empirical analysis in which we lack many of these specic measures, we

note that the relative precision of the information received from the network

depends on        N,   the number of network members experimenting with fertilizer.

In simplest terms, we can rewrite the update equation as                  B1 = B0 + f (d1 , N1 ),
where      d   is a binary indicator of whether or not the farmer experimented with

fertilizer in period 1.

      How then does learning aect the use of fertilizer? To keep things (relatively)

simple, we assume that learning is unanticipated, meaning that rst period

decisions are not aected by learning. However, realized fertilizer outcomes in

excess of prior expectations will boost expected returns, lowering                 zÌ2   and y, as

shown by the dashed curve in Figure 1. Conversely, negative information shocks
  â     nâ
(y1 , y1       < 0)   will shift the curve in the opposite direction, making sustained

adoption less likely. Note that from a longer term perspective, positive learning

about the returns to fertilizer would be expected to inoculate future behavior

against disadoption following a single bad realization that reduces household

liquidity, implying greater stability in adoption.

      One thing to notice here is that realized returns (y1 ) for the adopting house-

hold generates both a wealth eect and a learning eect.                     Without imposing

further structure, an empirical nding that the farmer's own experimentation

enhances future adoption would not cleanly identify whether such a persistent

eect is the result of liquidity or learning eects, or some combination of the

two. In contrast, experimentation by others in the farmer's social network would

be expected to only inuence farmer learning and not his or her liquidity.

3     Project Description

3.1 Agriculture in Mozambique and Input Subsidies in the Region
Following its independence in 1975, Mozambique experienced 15 years of civil

war. Despite impressive GDP growth since the end of the civil war, it remains

one of the poorest countries in the world.           In 2011, its Human Development

Index was ranked 184th out of 187 countries rated.               More than 75% of the

Mozambican population works in small-scale agriculture, with little to no use

of tractors, ploughs, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation and other agro-inputs. The

most common crops include maize, cassava, sweet potatoes, cotton, tobacco,

sesame and groundnuts. The use of mineral fertilizer among smallholder farm-

ers is primarily limited to cash crops and is scarce on cereal crops, leading to low

yield, generally below one ton per hectare for maize production (compared to up

to 8 tons per hectare in the most productive developing countries). The nascent

input market is small and its network sparse. Between 1996 and 2003, agricul-

tural production grew by an average of 6% per year, leading to a decrease in the

rural poverty headcount, from 69% to 54% during the same period. However,

Nankani et al. (2006) note that this growth mainly resulted from the expansion

of area cultivated and labor due to the return of migrants, while technological

improvements have been modest and yields almost stagnant.

    In the 1970s and early 1980s in a majority of African countries, fertilizer

was subsidized and sold through state-owned enterprises to address perceived

under-provision of fertilizer by the market.          Most public monopolies of agro-

inputs were eliminated during structural adjustment programs in the late 1980s.

In the late 1990s, agro-input subsidies have re-emerged as what are now called

 smart subsidies. Typically, vouchers are distributed to poor farmers, giving

them access to an agro-input package provided by private sector input dealers

at a subsidized price.      Private sector dealers then trade the vouchers against

the amount of the subsidy, at an intermediary bank or agency.                This scheme

has been claimed to oer the advantages of traditional fertilizer subsidy while

stimulating rather than undermining the private sector, and targeting the poor

more eectively. On the other hand, some have criticized failures in targeting

the poor, and the low cost-eectiveness of the intervention (Minot and Benson,

2009).

3.2 Project Overview and Research Design
The study that is the subject of this paper is nested within a larger study of

the impact of input subsidies, formal savings programs, and the interaction of

subsidy and savings programs. Localities in Manica province were selected to

be part of the larger study on the basis of inclusion in the provincial input

voucher program as well as access to a mobile banking program run by Banco

Oportunidade de Mocambique (BOM, our implementation partner for the sav-

ings component of the project). To be accessible to the BOM savings program,

which involved scheduled weekly visits of a truck-mounted bank branch, a vil-

lage had to be within a certain distance of a paved road and within reasonable

driving distance of BOM's regional branch in the city of Chimoio. These restric-

tions led to inclusion of 94 localities
                                            12   in the larger study, across the districts of

Barue, Manica, and Sussundenga.

    Each of the selected 94 localities was then randomly assigned to either a no

savings condition or to one of two savings treatment conditions (basic savings

and matched savings), each with 1/3 probability. The 32 localities (with 41

component villages) randomly selected to be in the no savings condition did

not experience any savings treatment, and are the subject of this paper.
                                                                                         13

    Unlike many of its neighbors that launched nationwide input subsidy pro-

grams,
          14   Mozambique piloted a limited, two-year subsidy program funded by

the European Union, implemented by Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture,

the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fertilizer

Development Center (IFDC). The limited scope of this program allowed the

research team, in cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and IFDC, to

design and implement a randomized controlled trial of the program. Over the

2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons, the pilot targeted 25,000 farmers nationally, of

which 15,000 received a subsidy for maize production, and the remaining 10,000

received a subsidy for rice production. Among the recipients of the subsidy for

maize production, 5,000 were in Manica province (in central Mozambique along

  12 The    localities we use were dened by us for the purpose of this project, and do not
completely coincide with ocial administrative areas. We sought to create natural groupings
of households that had some connection to one another.           In most cases our localities are
equivalent to villages, but in some cases we grouped adjacent villages together into one locality,
or divided large villages into multiple localities.
  13 In   a separate companion paper, the remaining 62 localities randomly assigned to one of
the savings treatments will be combined with the 32 no savings localities in analysis of the
interaction between savings and input subsidy programs. Farmers in the 62 savings program
localities were also included in lotteries for input vouchers.

and Chirwa (2011)).

the Zimbabwean border), where the study was implemented.

   Mozambique's input subsidy program provided beneciary farmers with a

voucher subsidizing the purchase of a technology package designed for a half

hectare of improved maize production: 12.5 kg of improved seeds (either open-

pollinated variety or hybrid) and 100 kg of fertilizer (50 kg of urea and 50 kg of

NPK 12-24-12). The market value of this package was MZN 3,163 (about USD

117), of which MZN 2,800 was for the fertilizer component, and MZN 363 was

for the improved seed. Farmers were required to co-pay MZN 863 (USD 32), or

27.2% of the total value of the package.
                                                  15

   Lists of eligible farmers were created jointly by government agricultural ex-

tension ocers, local leaders, and agro-input retailers. Individuals were deemed

eligible for a voucher coupon if they met the following program criteria: 1) farm-

ing between 0.5 hectare and 5 hectares of maize; 2) being a  progressive farmer,

dened as a producer interested in modernization of their production methods

and commercial farming; 3) having access to agricultural extension and to in-

put and output markets; and 4) being able and willing to pay for the remaining

27% of the package cost. Only one person per household was allowed to register.

Participants were informed that a lottery would be held and only half of those

on the list would win a voucher. Vouchers were then randomly assigned to 50%

of the households on the list in each village.
                                                         16     Randomization was conducted

by the research team on the computer of one of the PIs, and the list of voucher

winners was provided to agricultural extension ocers. Extension ocers were

responsible for actual voucher distribution to beneciaries.

   The annual agricultural season in Mozambique runs from November (when

planting starts) through harvest the following June. The timing of the inter-

vention and various surveys was largely determined by this annual cycle. The

schedule of specic project activities was as follows:


   â¢     Sept-Dec 2010: Random assignment and distribution of vouchers


   â¢     April 2011: Survey to establish voucher use and agricultural outcomes in

         prior season


   â¢     September 2011: First follow-up survey


   â¢     September 2012: Second follow-up survey

 15 At   the time of the study, one US dollar (USD) was worth roughly 27 Mozambican meticals
(MZN).
 16 In   other words, villages served as stratication cells.

    â¢   August 2013: Third follow-up survey




4       Sample, balance tests, and attrition
Our sample for analysis in this paper consists of 514 study participants and their

households in 41 villages (in 32 localities or groupings of villages). In each one

of these villages, 50% of study participants were randomly selected to receive

an input voucher.

    Table 1 provides summary statistics on the study households, and tests for

balance on these variables across study participants in the treatment (voucher

winners) and control (voucher losers) groups. Sample household heads are 85%

male and 78% are literate. By comparison, in rural Manica province, only 66% of

household heads are male and 45% are literate.
                                                       17   This is perhaps not a surprise

given the initial intention of targeting progressive farmers. Study households

own an average 10.3 hectares of land (the sample median is 5 hectares). 11% of

households have electricity at home, and 19% used fertilizer on at least one of

their maize elds during the 20092010 season, prior to this study. While better

o than some in the province, the study population is nonetheless dominated

by poor small-scale farmers with limited experience with modern agriculture.

    Due to uncertainties in the timing of voucher distribution and delays in the

creation of the list of study participants, it was not feasible to conduct a baseline

survey prior to the voucher lottery.          Instead, we implemented a survey after

the distribution of vouchers, but asked retrospective questions on respondents'

pre-lottery agricultural outcomes and behaviors.              We check balance between

treatment and control groups for variables that are not expected to vary in the

short run (for example education of the household head), or variables related to

the 2009-10 agricultural season (the season prior to our study.) The rightmost

columns of Table 1 present the means of these variables in the control and

treatment groups separately, and the p-values of F-tests of equality of these

means. The sample is balanced on all of these variables.

    It is important to consider attrition from the study, and consider whether

such attrition could lead to biased treatment eect estimates.              We attempted

to survey everyone in the initial sample at each subsequent survey round (in

other words, attrition was not cumulative), so all attrition rates reported are

  17 The   Manica data used for comparison is from the 2007  Terceiro Recenseamento Geral da

                                              16
vis-Ã -vis that initial sample. Attrition is 8.6% in the rst (2011) follow-up sur-

vey, 10.0% in the second (2012) round, and 7.6% in the nal (2013) round. In

Online Appendix Table 1, we examine whether attrition is related to treatment

assignment. The regressions of the table regress the dummy for treatment (win-

ning the voucher lottery) on attrition, controlling for village xed eects. In no

case is attrition large or statistically signicantly dierent from zero. Attrition

bias is therefore not likely to be a concern in this context.




5        Empirical results
Random treatment assignment allows us to estimate the causal impact of eligi-

bility for fertilizer subsidy vouchers. Treatment eect estimates for outcome            Yiv
for study participant      i   in village   v   are obtained via estimation of the following

regression equation:



                                  Yiv = Î± + Î²Ziv + Î¸v + iv                              (6)


    Because use of the voucher is potentially endogenous to farmer characteris-

tics, we focus on the impact of exogenously-determined treatment status. Our

estimates will be intent to treat (ITT) eects of voucher receipt on the outcomes

of interest.   Ziv   is an indicator variable taking the value of 1 if the individual is

in the treatment group (won the lottery for the fertilizer subsidy voucher), and

0 otherwise.     The parameter of interest is the coecient            Î²   on this treatment

indicator, the estimate of the treatment eect of subsidy voucher receipt. The

regression variables do not have time subscripts: we run this regression sepa-

rately for outcomes in each of the three annual post-treatment follow-up surveys

that we implemented. This allows examination of changes in the treatment ef-

fect over time.

    Î¸v    are stratication cell xed eects representing the village of the study

participant (recall that treatment was randomly assigned within village, so each

village contains both treated and control study participants.) We report Hu-

ber/White heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors.

    Outliers may have undue inuence on the treatment eect estimates for

certain variables (such as fertilizer utilization in kilograms, or production in

kilograms or money units). We take two approaches to reduce the inuence of

outliers.    First, we take the inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST) of




                                                   17
dependent variables.
                          18   Second, when expressing certain variables in levels, we

truncate the variable at the 99th percentile (we replace values above the 99th

percentile with the 99th percentile). The results tables will always show both

IHST and levels (with 99th percentile truncation) specications.

    Outcome variables of particular interest in this study include those that

have substantial noise and relatively low autocorrelation, such as farm inputs

and outputs. In this case, one can achieve increases in statistical power by tak-

ing multiple post-treatment outcome measures and estimating treatment eects

on the average of post-treatment outcomes across multiple periods (McKenzie

(2012)). We therefore also show impacts on average outcomes across the 2012

and 2013 seasons, which follow the treated 2011 season for which the input

vouchers were distributed.



5.1 Voucher Take-up
We rst examine take-up of the subsidy voucher.
                                                              19    An important rst point

to note is that there was non-compliance in both the treatment group and in

the control group: in the treatment group, not all voucher winners used the

voucher, and some farmers in the control group received the voucher.

    Our study took place in the context of a government fertilizer voucher pro-

gram, so distribution of vouchers to study participants was the responsibility

of government agricultural extension agents (not our research sta ). Under the

supervision of the research team, extension agents held a voucher distribution

meeting in each village to which all voucher winners in that village were invited.

By itself, the requirement to co-nance the input package should be expected to

lead nontrivial fractions of winners to choose not to take the voucher. In prac-

tice, 48.7% of voucher winners actually showed up and received their voucher.
                                                                                               20

    Contrary to the study design that was agreed upon with the Manica provin-

cial government, some control group respondents (voucher lottery losers) also

ended up receiving vouchers. This resulted from a mismatch in objectives be-

tween provincial government leadership and extension agents on the ground who

  18 The

           inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHST) of   x    is   log x + x2 + 1 2 .   When

dependent variables are expressed in IHST, treatment eects can be interpreted as elasticities
(as with the log transformation), but unlike the log transformation it is dened at zero.
Burbidge et al. (1988) recommend the use of the IHST rather than the log transformation.
  19 Voucher   take-up and voucher use variables are reported by study participants in the rst
survey (April 2011).
  20 No   voucher winners were denied vouchers if they wanted them, so all voucher non-receipt
resulted from farmers choosing not to take the vouchers.




                                               18
were actually distributing vouchers. Extension agents were each given a certain

number of vouchers to distribute in the months leading up to the December 2010

planting period (including areas separate from the study villages.) The fact that

take-up of the vouchers was less than 100% in the study villages meant that the

unused vouchers were expected (by the national government and donor agencies

funding the program) to be distributed to other farmers.                 Our research team

emphasized that these unused vouchers should only be distributed outside the

study villages. We were not entirely successful in ensuring this, however, since it

was much less eort for extension agents to simply redistribute unused vouchers

in the study villages (extension agents did not need to incur time and other

costs of travel to other villages.) In the end, 12.9% of study participants in the

control group received vouchers.

   It is clear, therefore, that our intervention should be considered an en-

couragement design. Random assignment led to higher voucher receipt in the

treatment group than in the control group. Table 2, column 1 displays results

from a regression of an indicator for voucher receipt on the treatment indica-

tor (and village xed eects).
                                     21   The coecient on treatment is positive and

statistically signicant at the 1% level, indicating that the treatment led to an

increase of the rate of voucher receipt from 14% to 51%.

   Voucher receipt did not guarantee actual use of the voucher. Some voucher

recipients chose not to bear the nancial cost of the input package co-payment,

and the transport cost to and from the input supplier. The impact of assign-

ment to the treatment group on actual use of the voucher is therefore lower,

in percentage points, than the impact on voucher receipt. Table 2, column 2

presents results from a regression of an indicator of voucher use (actual purchase

of the subsidized input package) on the treatment indicator. The coecient on

treatment is positive and statistically signicantly dierent from zero at the

1% level, indicating a 29 percentage point increase in voucher use (more than

tripling the control group rate of 12%.)

   Non-compliance with treatment assignment reduces our statistical power

to detect treatment eects on subsequent outcomes, but otherwise should not

threaten the internal validity of the results.           While we would have hoped to

have seen greater compliance, our setting may be relatively representative of the

actual implementation of voucher programs in many eld settings, particularly

 21 The   dependent variable is equal to one if the household received at least one voucher. Out
of the 154 households who received at least one voucher, 146 received exactly one voucher,
and 8 received two vouchers.

5.2 Treatment eect estimates
In this section, we trace the causal chain of voucher impacts, beginning with

impacts on input use, followed by agricultural production and sales, and indi-

cators of household well-being.   We then assess the change in learning about

expected returns to better understand underlying mechanisms.



5.2.1 Input utilization
The vouchers provided a subsidy for use of fertilizer and improved seeds, so

we rst examine treatment eects on these outcomes.        Table 3 presents esti-

mates of treatment eects (Î² from equation 6).      Panel A presents regressions

where dependent variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic sine transforma-

tion (IHST), while in Panel B dependent variables are in levels (truncated at

the 99th percentile.) In each panel, we present treatment eects separately in

three post-treatment seasons: 2011 (the season for which vouchers were pro-

vided), as well as 2012 and 2013 (for which no vouchers were provided).        We

also show treatment eects on the average of the 2012 and 2013 dependent vari-

ables, which improves power by averaging out noise (McKenzie (2012).) This

table format will be followed in the next two results tables as well.

   The treatment had a clear positive impact on fertilizer use in the season

2010-11, for which the vouchers were provided.      In both the IHST and levels

specications, the treatment had a positive and statistically signicant impact

on fertilizer use on maize in kilograms, fertilizer use on maize in kg per hectare,

and total fertilizer used on all crops (in kg and in Mozambican meticals or

MZN). There is no large or statistically signicant impact on fertilizer use on

crops other than maize in that year. There is also a positive impact on use of

improved seeds (in kg, and in kg per hectare), which is statistically signicant

in the IHST specication.

   The magnitude of the treatment eect on fertilizer use is consistent with

voucher take-up rates and the size of the input package. The treatment led to

a 29 percentage point increase in voucher use (Table 2, col. 2), and the input

package included 100 kg of fertilizer. If farmers taking up the package used the

entire package and did not substitute for fertilizer they would have used anyway,

the treatment eect on take-up would imply a treatment eect on fertilizer use

amounting to 29 kg. This is very similar to the estimated treatment eect in



                                        20
Table 3, Panel B, column 4: 22.7 kg (signicant at the 5% level). This result

raises no substantial concerns that the subsidy voucher crowded out private

demand for fertilizer on the part of study participants, which has been found in

other contexts (Jayne et al. (2013).)

   Impacts on fertilizer use persist in the subsequent 2012 and 2013 seasons.

The impact on average fertilizer use across 2012 and 2013 in total across all

crops (column 4) is statistically signicant at the 1% level in both the IHST

and levels specications, with a coecient magnitude (19.13 kg in the levels

regression) that is not much smaller than the impact in 2011 (22.72 kg). The

same patterns and signicance levels hold when the dependent variable is the

money value of total fertilizer used on all crops (column 5). The treatment eects

indicate fertilizer use on crops other than maize: impacts on fertilizer use on

both maize and non-maize crops (columns 1 and 3) are statistically signicant

in the IHST specications (and positive but only marginally signicant in the

levels regressions).
                       22

   By contrast, impacts on improved seed use do not persist into 2012-13: treat-

ment eects in those periods are small and are not statistically signicantly dif-

ferent from zero. One point of note is that in the season prior to the intervention,

22% of the households were using fertilizer for maize cultivation compared to

53% for improved seeds.       Given relatively high usage of improved seeds prior

to the intervention, it may be that improved seed utilization was already near

optimal levels, while fertilizer use was not.



5.2.2 Farm production and market sales
Given the treatment eects on fertilizer use, it is natural to next examine im-

pacts on crop production and market sales. We do so in Table 4.

   The treatment has positive impacts on maize production and yield (columns

1 and 2) in the subsidy year, 2011. Impacts on yield are statistically signicantly

dierent from zero at the 5% level in the IHST and levels specications. There

is no evidence of impacts in that year on production of other crops (column 3),

 22 Treatment   eects on fertilizer use in the 2012 and 2013 seasons do not appear to be
simply due to respondents saving some fertilizer from their subsidized input packages (that
were intended to be used in 2011) for use in 2012 or 2013.   Respondents were surveyed in
2011 and, if they had redeemed the subsidy voucher for inputs, were asked What did your
household do with the fertilizer purchased with the voucher? Only 2.8% reported they had
not used the voucher yet. 88.7% said they had already used it for agricultural production.
The remainder said they had sold the voucher (1.4%), gave some other response (1.4%), or
did not respond to the question (5.6%).




                                            21
the total value of crop production (column 4), or on sales of maize or all crops

combined (columns 5 and 6).

   Positive treatment eects on maize yield persist into the 2012-13 post-

subsidy seasons, and are accompanied by positive impacts on production of

other crops and on total production.             Regressions for the average of 2012-13

outcomes reveal positive treatment eects on other crop production and total

crop production that are signicant at conventional levels in both the IHST

and levels specications. The positive eect on other crop production is likely

related to the increase in fertilizer use on other crops that occurs post-subsidy.

   The economic magnitude of the eect on total crop production is substan-

tial. On average across 2012-13, the treatment leads to MZN 3,906 higher crop

production (signicant at the 5% level), a 21.6% increase over the level in the

control group. This is consistent with the 0.16 eect in the IHST specication

and exceeds the market value of the package.

   One of the objectives of the Mozambican subsidy program was the trans-

formation of subsistence farmers into commercial farmers who sell their output

in markets. The last two columns of Table 4 therefore examine treatment ef-

fects on market sales of maize and of all crops combined.                 There is no large

or statistically signicant eect in the subsidy year, but positive eects emerge

subsequently.      On average across the 2012-13 seasons, the treatment leads to

higher market sales of both maize and all crops. These eects are statistically

signicant at the 5% level in the IHST specication for both outcomes.



5.2.3 Consumption, savings, assets, and housing quality
We now turn to treatment eects on consumption, savings, assets, and housing.

Regression results are in Table 5.

   There are no impacts on any of these outcomes in the subsidy year, 2011.

Point estimates are typically small in magnitude, and none are statistically

signicantly dierent from zero at conventional levels.

   Positive impacts emerge in the following two post-subsidy years. Again, we

focus the discussion on impacts on the average of the 2012 and 2013 outcome

variables. The treatment eect on per capita daily consumption in the household

(column 1) is positive and statistically signicant at the 5% level in both the

IHST and levels specications.
                                      23   The impact amounts to MZN 10.59 per day,

 23 In   results not shown, we nd no large or statistically signicant impact of the treatments
on the number of household members, in total as well as in various age subcategories.




                                               22
14.7% increase over the mean in the control group.       One might take this as

perhaps the best overall summary result indicating that the treatment led to an

improvement in household well-being.

   The remaining columns of the table examine impacts on various types of

assets. There are positive eects on all types of assets in columns 2-5, which

are substantial in magnitude and statistically signicantly dierent from zero in

IHST specications in the case of total savings, livestock, food stocks, and total

savings and assets (column 6). Results in levels specications are also positive

and large in magnitude, but are less precise, so only the results for total savings

and food stocks are statistically signicant (both of these at the 1% level).

   Table 6 presents impacts of the treatment on housing improvements (which

were not included in total assets and savings in Table 5). The rst dependent

variable is a dummy that is equal to one if the respondent reported undertaking

any housing improvement (across the specic types in the table). There is no

impact in the rst year, but on average over the subsequent two years there

is a 4 percentage point increase in the likelihood of making any housing im-

provement that is statistically signicant at the 5% level, providing additional

evidence of long term improvement in the living conditions of the beneciaries.

The remaining columns of the table reveal that the specic areas of housing

improvement are in walls and oors. The fact that most improvements occur in

the year 2013 is consistent with the need for a period of savings before making

this lump sum investment.



5.3 Learning eects
Our theoretical model makes clear that a temporary subsidy could have persis-

tent eects on technology adoption either via a wealth channel, or via learning

about the returns to the technology. To shed light on whether a learning channel

is operative, we asked farmers in all three survey rounds the following questions

about perceived returns to fertilizer: In the rst eld where your household

planted maize this year, if you use improved seed and fertilizer, what is the to-

tal production that is expected in: a) an average year, b) a very good year, and

c) a very bad year?. Respondents were told to assume the use of 100 kg of urea,

100 kg of NPK fertilizer, and 25 kg of improved seeds per hectare. Respondents

also gave estimates assuming that no improved inputs had been used, and were

asked to indicate how many years out of ten they expected to be average, very

good and very bad years.    These probability elicitations allow us to calculate




                                        23
farmers' unconditional expected returns to improved seeds and fertilizers.

   Table 7 presents estimated impacts of the treatment on expected returns

without the input package (column 1), with the input package (column 2) and

the dierence between the two (column 3). The latter can be interpreted as the

expected returns to the input package. The coecient on treatment is positive in

each regression, and is statistically signicantly dierent from zero in the IHST

specications for expected yield with fertilizer and for the returns to the input

package, in 2011, 2012, and on average over the 2012-13 seasons. Interestingly,

treatment eects on all outcomes in the 2013 season are consistently smaller in

magnitude and none are statistically signicantly dierent from zero. This may

reect knowledge spillovers over time to the control group, so that dierences

vis-a-vis the treatment group are attenuated.

   These ndings that the treatment raised perceived returns to the input pack-

age are consistent with the existence of a learning channel, as outlined in the

theoretical section.



5.4 Spillovers in the social network
Our theoretical model allows the subsidy to aect technology adoption via learn-

ing about the returns to the new technology, not only from one's own experience

but also from the experience of others in one's social network. Examination of

social network eects is also of interest because experimentation by others in

one's social network would be expected to only inuence farmer learning and

not his or her liquidity.   Eects stemming from experimentation in the social

network are therefore more likely to be due to learning than wealth eects.

   Our study design involved randomizing treatment assignment within vil-

lages, so fertilizer adoption of study participants could be aected not only by

their own treatment status, but also by the extent of treatment (voucher win-

ning) in their social networks. To analyze eects of treatment within the social

network, we estimate the causal eect of the number of social network members

winning vouchers in the lottery. This analysis relies on two features of our study.

   First, we have data on social network links prior to treatment, which we

collected ourselves in a manner analogous to Conley and Udry's (2010) elici-

tation of information links.   Study participants were presented with the full

list of other study participants in the same village, and asked which of these

they talked to about agriculture in the season prior to the study (2009-2010),

and if so whether they did so a bit, moderately, or a lot. For each study




                                        24
participant, others whom they indicated as having talked to about agriculture

moderately or a lot are considered part of the participant's social network.
                                                                                             24

Note that, because we are interested in understanding spillovers of our random-

ized treatment within the social network, this elicitation only captures social

network links among study participants in the village, not the full set of social

network links (which would include study non-participants). Each respondent

was asked about their links with 11.5 other study partipants on average. Cru-

cially for this analysis, respondents report quite substantial variation in social

network links with other study participants (in other words, study participants

do not have identical social networks).                The distribution of number of social

network links is given in Table 8A. The median number of social network links

is two. 30.0% of respondents said they had no social network links with other

study participants.       16.1% said they had one link, 12.6% had two, 7.4% had

three, 8.6% had four, and 25.3% had ve or more.
                                                                     25

    Second, we take advantage of the fact that randomization of the input sub-

sidy voucher also generates random variation in the number of voucher winners

within a respondent's social network.               Table 8B presents the distribution of

number of voucher winners in a respondent's social network. The median num-

ber of voucher winners in the social network is one. 44.0% of respondents have

zero voucher winners in their social network. 18.3% have one, 15.0% have two,

8.2% have three, 5.8% have four, and 8.8% have ve or more. Among the 360

individuals with at least one study participant in their social network, the ratio

of number of voucher winners in the social network to number of study partic-

ipants in one's social network has a mean of 0.485, very close to the 0.5 ratio

that would be expected given the one-half probability of voucher winning.

    We estimate impacts of voucher winning in the social network on fertilizer

use (Yiv ) for study participant      i   in village     v,   via the following modied version

of the ITT regression equation 6:


                                          5+
                                          X                   5+
                                                              X
                                                    k                   k
                   Yiv = Î± + Î²Ziv +             Î³k Wiv   +          Î»k Siv + Î¸v + iv       (7)
                                          k=1                 k=1

    As in equation 6,      Ziv   is the individual treatment indicator, and the regres-

sion includes village xed eects. In addition, this regression includes indicator

  24 We   do not require that the social network links be reciprocal. In other words, Person A
can be in Person B's social network (as reported by Person B), even if Person B is not in
Person A's social network (as reported by Person A).
  25 Balance   tests (not reported here but available from the authors) reveal that the number
of treated network members is statistically unrelated with baseline characteristics.

variables    Wiv   for the respondent having one, two, three, four, or ve or more
                                                                                           k

the respondent having one, two, three, four, or ve or more study participants

in his or her social network (for each of these sets of indicator variables, the

omitted category is zero).

      The regression analysis conditions on the number of study participants in

one's social network, because this variable is not exogenously determined, and

is (mechanically) positively correlated with the number of voucher winners in

one's social network. When controlling for number of study participants in one's

social network, the regression coecients on the number of voucher winners in

one's social network can be interpreted as causal. Rather than imposing a par-

ticular functional form (e.g., a linear relationship), we specify voucher winners

and study participants in the social network via a set of indicator variables to

capture nonlinear eects. The coecients of interest in the regression are the

Î³k coecients      on the number of voucher winners in one's social network.

      Regression results are in Table 9. For space considerations, we show only

the specications where dependent variables are expressed in inverse hyperbolic

sine transformation (IHST).
                                    26   In Panel A the dependent variable is the IHST

of fertilizer use on maize, while in Panel B it is the IHST of fertilizer use on

all crops. Coecients for each of the three seasons (2011, 2012, and 2013) are

presented in columns 1-3, and in column 4 we show results for the average of the

post-voucher-season (2012 and 2013) outcomes. For each regression we report

the   Î³k   coecients as well as the p-value of the F-test of the joint signicance of

the   Î³k   coecients in that regression.

      In the season for which the voucher was oered, 2011, social network eects

in both panels are typically negative in sign, but tests of joint signicance do

not reject the null of zero eect at conventional signicance levels.
                                                                                   27   In 2012,

there are positive social network eects on fertilizer use on maize (jointly sig-

nicant at the 10% level), and in 2013 there are positive social network eects

on fertilizer use on all crops (jointly signicant at the 1% level).               On average

over the 2012-2013 seasons, social network eects are positive and jointly statis-

tically signicant at the 5% level for fertilizer use on all crops, and marginally

statistically signicant (with p-value 0.11) for fertilizer use on maize. That these

  26 Regressions   for dependent variables expressed in levels yield very similar conclusions,
although they are often less precise.
  27 A   possible explanation for these negative coecients could be that individuals with social
network members who received vouchers adopt a wait and see approach to fertilizer, holding
o on their own investments until they can observe the returns experienced by others.




                                                26
impacts of social network voucher receipt occur only in years subsequent to the

voucher distribution season is consistent with learning about fertilizer impacts

in one's social network. It also seems sensible that statistically signicant social

network eects occur rst (2012) for fertilizer use on maize (which the input

package was designed for) and only later (2013) for fertilizer use on all crops.

    The impacts on fertilizer use of voucher winning in one's social network

are large in magnitude. For example, in the regression for fertilizer use on all

crops on average over the 2012-13 seasons (Panel B, column 4), the impact of

having one voucher winner in one's social network is nearly equal in magnitude

to the impact of winning a voucher oneself (both coecients are about 0.5).

The coecient estimates on having two or more voucher winners in one's social

network are even larger, ranging in magnitude from 0.86 to 1.37. The fact that

voucher winning in one's social network has eects equal to or larger than eects

of winning oneself is also consistent with learning being the primary channel of

the voucher impacts, as opposed to the wealth channel.

    Another broad pattern of note is that the eects of voucher winning in

the social network appear to be nonlinear. There is typically a positive eect

of having one voucher winner in the social network, and a somewhat larger

eect of having two, but the eect appears to atten thereafter, with not much

additional impact of having three, four, or ve or more winners in the social

network (relative to having two).




6     Conclusion

We report the results of a randomized experiment testing impacts of a subsidy

for modern agricultural inputs (fertilizer and improved seeds) on input utiliza-

tion, agricultural output, and other household outcomes. We nd substantial

and persistent impacts (spanning three years following the one-time subsidy) on

all these outcomes.

    Our results are consistent with a set of theoretical models that predict per-

sistence of one-time subsidies, and inconsistent with others that do not have

such a persistence feature. In particular, our ndings are consistent with mod-

els in which individuals must learn the returns to new technologies, via own

experience or the experience of others in their social network.       Winning the

voucher lottery raises individual reports of expected returns to fertilizer. In ad-

dition, individual fertilizer use is strongly inuenced by the number of voucher




                                        27
winners in one's social network.   Both these patterns are consistent with the

learning channel. Given the expense of permanent fertilizer subsidies in many

sub-Saharan African countries that have adopted them, the results here moti-

vate a more careful examination of whether the goals of permanent subsidies

can be met with temporary subsidies that overcome barriers to experimentation

and learning.

Note: Means of variables are presented, with standard deviations in brackets. Agricultural data refer to 2009-2010 season, prior to
treatment assignment. Number of observations is 514 in full sample, 267 in control group, and 247 in treatment group. To reduce
influence of outliers, starred (*) variables in levels (Panel A) have top 1% of values replaced by 99th percentile. Inverse hyperbolic
sine transformation (IHST) is similar to log transformation in helping reduce influence of outliers, but is defined at zero (Burbidge et
al. 1988).

Appendix: Higher Order Learning

 â¢   Diuse Priors: We further assume that individuals at time 0 may not only
     have biased beliefs, but they may also have relatively uninformed or diuse
     priors about the distribution of returns. Specically, we assume that the
     probability structure for an individual with unbiased beliefs B0 = 0 can
     be written as ÏyÌ (yÌ|B0 = 0) = Ïy (y) + m0 (y) where m0 (y) is a mean
     preserving spread dened such that:
                          Ë               Ë
                              m0 (y)dy,       m0 (y)Ïy (y)dy = 0

     and that             Ë
                              [Î¦yÌ (y)) â Î¦y (yÌ)] â¥ 0 â y â¤ y + ,

     where Î¦i denotes the cumulative distribution function corresponding to
     random variable i. More generally, ÏyÌ (yÌ|B0 ) = Ïy (y + B0 ) + m0 (y + B0 ).
     For the special case in which priors are not diuse, but are potentially
     biased, we can write ÏyÌ (yÌ) = Ïy (y + B0 ).
 â¢   Distribution of Returns : Second, we assume that learning reduces the
     diuseness of prior beliefs. In particular, we assume that based on ob-
     servation of own and neighbors' period 1 returns to fertilizers, updated
     period 1 beliefs are no more diuse than period 1 beliefs. Specically,
     holding the bias in expected returns constant, period 0 beliefs can always
     be expressed as a mean preserving spread of period 1 beliefs.
While there are various ways to model learning, we here assume that learning
is naive or unanticipated. Under this assumption, rst period choice is exactly
as modeled above. However, unanticipated learning will make second period or
sustained adoption more likely under our assumption that experience operates
as a mean preserving squeeze, making Ï1 (y) less diuse than the prior Ï0 (y).
As shown above, this shift in subjective beliefs will lower zÌ2 , making expanding
the set of individuals who will sustain adoption of the new technology.
