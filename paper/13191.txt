                                            ABSTRACT

In cross-sectional data sets from ten credit markets, we find that middle-aged adults borrow at lower
interest rates and pay fewer fees relative to younger and older adults. Fee and interest payments are
minimized around age 53. The measured effects are not explained by observed risk characteristics.
 We discuss several leading factors that may contribute to these effects, including age-related changes
in experience and cognitive function, selection effects, and cohort effects.

1        Introduction
        Performance tends to rise and then fall with age. Baseball players peak in their late 20s (Fair 2005,
James 2003). Mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and lyric poets make their most important contri-
butions around age 30 (Simonton 1988).            Chess players achieve their highest ranking in their mid-30s
(Charness and Bosnian 1990).          Autocratic rulers are most eﬀective in their early 40s (Simonton 1988).
Authors write their most influential novels around age 50 (Simonton 1988).1
        The present paper studies an activity that is less august, though it is directly relevant to more people:
financial decision making. We find that financial choices also have a hump-shaped performance pattern. We
document cross-sectional variation in the prices that people pay for financial services. We study several
proprietary datasets from multiple financial institutions, containing detailed information on the choices
and characteristics of consumers. We present evidence on all the data that is available to us, including (a)
interest rates in six diﬀerent collateralized and non-collateralized consumer credit markets, (b) consumers’
ability to optimally exploit balance transfers, and (c) three kinds of credit card fees.
        We find that younger adults and older adults borrow at higher interest rates and pay more fees than
middle-aged adults controlling for all observable characteristics, including measures of risk.                  Fee and
interest payments are at their minimums for borrowers in their early 50s.
        Factors idiosyncratic to each market likely contribute to the observed patterns that we observe. The
recurrence of this pattern in many diﬀerent markets suggests, however, that there may be common under-
lying explanations. We argue that the most likely explanations are age-related cognitive eﬀects, selection
eﬀects, and cohort eﬀects. We also discuss several other theories that are unlikely to play an important role
in explaining the observed patterns in our data, including age-varying risk eﬀects, age-varying opportunity
costs of time, age discrimination and other supply factors.
        The paper has the following organization.       Section 2 describes the basic structure of the empirical
analysis. The next two sections present results for interest rates on six diﬀerent financial products, three
diﬀerent kinds of credit card fee payments, and on the use of balance transfer credit card oﬀers. Section 5
uses all ten sets of results to estimate the age of peak sophistication. Section 6 discusses various common
explanations for the pattern.        Section 7 discusses market equilibrium, the economic magnitude of the
eﬀects, related work, and opportunities for future research. Section 8 concludes.


2        Overview
        In the body of the paper, we document a U-shaped age-related curve in the prices people pay for
financial services We study ten separate contexts:              home equity loans and lines of credit; auto loans;
credit card interest rates; mortgages; small business credit cards; credit card late payment fees; credit

    1
    What about economists? Oster and Hamermesh (1998) find that economists’ output in top publications declines sharply
with age. This may simply reflect lower motivation with age. More optimistic data are reported in Weinberg and Galenson
(2005)’s study of Nobel (Memorial) Prize winners. They find that “conceptual” laureates peak at age 43, and “experimental”
ones at age 61.


                                                            2
card over limit fees; credit card cash advance fees; and use of credit card balance transfer oﬀers.                        We
discuss three forms of prices paid: higher APRs (Annual Percentage Rates, i.e., interest rates); higher fee
payments; and suboptimal use of balance transfer oﬀers.
      For each application, we conduct a regression analysis that identifies age eﬀects and controls for observ-
able factors that might explain patterns of fee payments or APRs by age. Thus, unless otherwise noted,
in each context we estimate a regression of the type:

(1)                                F = α + β × Spline(Age) + γ × Controls + .

Here F is the level of the APR paid by the borrower (or the frequency of fee payment), Controls is a vector
of control variables intended to capture alternative explanations in each context (for example, measures
of credit risk), and Spline(Age) is a piecewise linear function that takes consumer age as its argument
(with knot points at ages 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70).2             We then plot the fitted values for the spline on age.
Regressions are either pooled panel or cross-sectional, depending on the context.
      Below, we discuss the nature of the products and the prices paid, briefly document the datasets used,
and present the regression results and graphs by age. We provide summary statistics for the data sets in
the Appendix.


3      Three Financial Choices
      In this section, we present evidence for a U-shaped pattern in prices paid for three financial choices:
(1) borrowing through home equity loans, (2) borrowing through home equity lines of credit and (3) the
use of credit card balance transfer oﬀers. For the first two choices, we are able to tease out the mechanism
leading to higher interest payments (namely, mistakes made in estimating house values). The U-shaped
pattern by age for the third choice is a relatively clean example and thereby merits greater emphasis.

3.1     Home Equity Loans
3.1.1     Data Summary

      We use a proprietary panel dataset constructed with records from a national financial institution that
has issued home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. The lender has not specialized in subprime
loans or other market segments.            Between March and December 2002, the lender oﬀered a menu of
standardized contracts for home equity credits.3               Consumers chose (a) either a loan or a credit line;
(b) either a first or second lien; and (c) an incremental loan amount and an estimate of her property
value, corresponding to a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than 80 percent, between 80 and 90 percent, or

   2
     For instance, in Table 1, the “Age 30-40” spline is: max (30, min (40, Age)), the “Age < 30 ” spline is min (30, Age), and
the “Age > 70 ” spline is max (70, Age).
   3
     Other interest rates in the economy varied considerably during this time period. One might therefore ask whether the
age results we report below are an artifact of borrowers of diﬀerent ages happening to disproportionately borrow earlier or
later in the sample. We observe no pattern in the distribution by month of borrowing by age over the sample.


                                                              3
between 90 and 100 percent. In eﬀect, the lender oﬀered twelve diﬀerent contract choices.4 For 75,000
such contracts, we observe the contract terms, borrower demographic information (age, years at current
job, home tenure), financial information (income and debt-to-income ratio), and risk characteristics (credit
(FICO) score, and LTV)5 We also observe borrower estimates of their property values and the loan amount
requested.

3.1.2      Results

       Table 1 reports the results of estimating regressions of APRs (interest rates) on home equity loans
on a spline for age and control variables. As controls, we use all borrower-related variables observed by
the financial institution that might aﬀect loan pricing, including credit risk measures, house and loan
characteristics, and borrower financial and demographic characteristics. The control variables all have the
expected sign, and most are statistically significant, although some of them lack economic significance.6
       The measure of credit risk, the log of the FICO score (lagged three months because it is only updated
quarterly), is statistically significant but with a negligible magnitude. Discussions with people who work
in the industry reveal that financial institutions generally use the FICO score to determine whether a
loan oﬀer is made, but conditional on the oﬀer being made, do not use the score to do risk-based pricing.
The results here, and for the other consumer credit products discussed below, are consistent with this
hypothesis.
       Loan APRs do depend strongly on the absence of a first mortgage (reducing the APR) and whether
the property is a second home or a condominium. The absence of a first mortgage reduces the probability
of default and raises the amount that might be recovered conditional on a default.                       Second homes and
condominiums are perceived as riskier properties.              Log income and log years on the job also have large
and negative eﬀects on APRs, as expected, since they indicate more resources available to pay oﬀ the loan
and perhaps less risk in the latter case. The largest eﬀects on APRs come from dummy variables for LTV
ratios between 80 and 90 percent and for ratios greater than 90 percent. This is consistent with diﬀerent
LTV ratios corresponding to diﬀerent contract choices.             7

       Even after controlling for these variables, we find that the age splines have statistically and economically

   4
      We focus on APR payment across contracts for four reasons. First, contracts do not diﬀer in points charged or in other
charges to the borrower. Second, we verify that, even conditioning on contract choice, some borrowers pay higher APRs than
others. Third, we control for borrower risk characteristics. Fourth, in section 3.3, we show that the residual variation in
APRs is explained by the propensity to make an identifiable mistake in the loan acquisition process.
    5
      We do not have internal behavior scores (a supplementary credit risk score) for these borrowers. Such scores are
performance-based, and are thus not available at loan origination.
    6
      Note that although we include all observed variables on the borrower, R-squareds are not 100 percent. In part, this
reflects the fact that bank loan pricing models also depend on other variables external to the borrower, such as the cost of
funds. Banks may also reassess their lending standards, depending on macroeconomic or other factors. As long as such factors
are not correlated with consumer age, the regression coeﬃcients on age will correctly report the impact of age on APR.
    7
      We estimate three variants as a specification check. First, we allow the FICO scores, income, and LTV ratios to have
quadratic and cubic terms. This allows us to make sure that the nonlinear eﬀects with age that we see are not a consequence
of omission of potential nonlinear eﬀects of other control variables. Second and third, we allow the splines to have knot points
at every five years, and have a dummy for each age, to ensure that the smoothing caused by the use of ten-year splines does
not artificially create a U-shape. In all three cases, our results are not qualitatively or quantitatively changed.

       The dataset described in the previous section is also used here.

3.2.2      Results

       Table 2 reports a regression of the APRs from home equity lines on a spline for age and the same
control variables used for the home equity loans regression. The control variables have similar eﬀects on
home equity line APRs as they did on home equity loan APRs.
       Fitted values on the age splines, plotted in Figure 2, continue to reveal a pronounced U-shape.

     Mortgage and other long-term interest rates were generally falling during this period. Thus, another possible explanation
for the observed pattern is that younger and older adults disproportionately borrowed at the beginning of the sample period.
However, we found no time-variation in the age distribution of borrowers over the sample period.

3.3      One Mechanism: Borrower Misestimation of Home Values
       The amount of collateral oﬀered by the borrower, as measured by the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, is an
important determinant of loan APRs. Higher LTVs imply higher APRs, since the fraction of collateral is
lower. At the financial institution that provided our data, borrowers first estimate their home values, and
ask for a credit loan or credit line falling into one of three categories depending on the implied borrower-
generated LTV estimate. The categories correspond to LTVs of 80 percent or less; LTVs of between 80
and 90 percent; and LTVs of 90 percent or greater. The financial institution then independently verifies
the house value using an industry-standard methodology.                                                           The bank then constructs a bank-generated
LTV based on the bank’s independent verification process. The bank-LTV can therefore diﬀer from the
borrower-LTV.9
       Loan pricing depends on the LTV category that the borrower falls into and not on the specific LTV
value within that category; for example, a loan with an LTV of 60 has the same interest rate as a loan with
an LTV of 70, holding borrower characteristics fixed, since the LTVs of both loans are less than 80.10 If
the borrower has overestimated the value of the house, so that the bank-LTV is higher than borrower-LTV,
the financial institution will direct the buyer to a diﬀerent loan with a higher interest rate corresponding to
the higher bank-LTV. In such circumstances, the loan oﬃcer is also given some discretion to depart from

   9
    Bucks and Pence (2006) present evidence that borrowers do not generally have accurate estimates of their house values.
  10
    We have verified this practice in our dataset by regressing the APR on both the level of the bank-LTV and dummy
variables for whether the bank-LTV falls into one of the three categories. Only the coeﬃcients on the dummy variables were
statistically and economically significant. Ben-David (2007) also shows that there are discrete jumps in lending rates at LTV
cutoﬀ points.

the financial institution’s normal pricing schedule to oﬀer a higher interest rate than the oﬃcer would have
oﬀered to a borrower who had correctly estimated her LTV. If the borrower has underestimated the value
of the house, however, the financial institution need not direct the buyer to a loan with a lower interest
rate corresponding to the bank-LTV (which is lower in this case than the borrower-LTV); the loan oﬃcer
may simply choose to oﬀer the higher interest rate associated with the borrower-LTV, instead of lowering
the rate to reflect the lower bank-LTV.11
       Since the APR paid depends on the LTV category and not the LTV itself, home value misestimation
leads to higher interest rate payments if the category of the bank-LTV diﬀers from the category of the
borrower-LTV. If, in contrast, the borrower’s estimated LTV was 60, but the true LTV was 70, the
borrower would still qualify for the highest quality loan category (LTV<80) and would not suﬀer an
eﬀective interest rate penalty.                              We define a Rate-Changing Mistake (RCM) to have occurred when the
borrower-LTV category diﬀers from the bank-LTV category — for instance, when the borrower estimates
an LTV of 85 but the bank calculates an LTV of 75 (or vice versa).12 We find that, on average, making a
RCM increases the APR by 125 basis points for loans and 150 basis points for lines (controlling for other
variables, but not age).
       To highlight the importance of RCMs, we first study the APR for consumers who do not make a Rate-
Changing Mistake. Figures 3 and 4 plot the fitted values from re-estimating the regressions in Table 1 and
2, but now conditioning on borrowers who do not make a RCM. The plots show only slight diﬀerences in

  11
     Even if the financial institution’s estimate of the true house value is inaccurate, that misestimation will not matter for the
borrower as long as other institutions use the same methodology.

     Recall that the categories are less than 80, 80 to 90, and greater than 90.

Figure 4: Home equity credit line APRs for borrowers who do not make a rate-changing mistake. The figure
plots the residual eﬀect of age, after controlling for other observable characteristics, such as log(income)
and credit-worthiness.

APR paid by age. The APR diﬀerence for a home equity loan for a borrower at age 70 over a borrower
at age 50 has shrunk from 36 basis points to 8 basis points; for a home equity line of credit, it has shrunk
from 28 basis points to 4 basis points. For a borrower at age 20, the APR diﬀerence over a borrower at
age 50 has shrunk to 3 basis points for home equity loans and 3 basis points for home equity lines of credit.
We conclude that, conditional on not making a RCM, the APR is essentially flat with age. So the U-shape
of the APR is primarily driven by the Rate-Changing Mistakes.
      We next study who makes a RCM. Figures 5 and 6 plot the probability of making a rate-changing
mistake by age for home equity loans and home equity lines, respectively.                                                                                   The figures show U-shapes
for both. Borrowers at age 70 have a 16 (19) percentage point greater chance of making a mistake than
borrowers at age 50 for home equity loans (lines); borrowers at age 20 have a 35 (41) percentage point
greater chance of making a mistake than borrowers at age 50. The unconditional average probability of
making a rate-changing mistake is 24 percent for loans and 18 percent for lines.
      This age eﬀect is consistent with the cost of a RCM calculated above and the additional probability of
making a RCM by age. For example, a 70-year old has a 16 and 19 percent additional chance of making
a RCM for loans and lines, respectively. Multiplying this by the average APR cost of a RCM for home
equity lines and loans of about 150 and 125 basis points, respectively, gives an expected incremental APR
paid of about 26 and 23 basis points. These diﬀerences are very close to the estimated diﬀerences of about
23 basis points for loans (reported in Figure 1) and of about 28 basis points for lines (reported in Figure
2).
      We conclude that in the example of home equity lines and loans, we have identified the channel for the
U-shape of the APR as a function of age (as always, controlling for other characteristics). Younger and

older consumers have a greater tendency to misestimate the value of their house, which leads to a Rate-
Changing Mistake, which leads them to borrow at an increased APR. On the other hand, for consumers
who do not make a Rate-Changing Mistake, the APR is essentially independent of age. Hence, this channel
explains quantitatively the higher APR paid by younger and older adults.
      Given the large costs associated with a Rate-Changing Mistake, one might ask why borrowers do not
make greater eﬀort to more accurately estimate their house values.                     One possibility is that potential
borrowers may not be aware that credit terms will diﬀer by LTV category; or, even if they are aware of this
fact, they may not know how much the terms diﬀer by category. This particular aspect of loan pricing
may thus be a shrouded attribute, in the sense of Gabaix and Laibson (2006).

3.4      “Eureka” Moments: Balance Transfer Credit Card Usage
3.4.1      Overview

      Credit card holders frequently receive oﬀers to transfer account balances on their current cards to a
new card.       Borrowers pay substantially lower APRs on the balances transferred to the new card for a
six-to-nine-month period (a ‘teaser’ rate).           However, new purchases on the new card have high APRs.
The catch is that payments on the new card first pay down the (low interest) transferred balances, and
only subsequently pay down the (high interest) debt accumulated from new purchases.
      The optimal strategy during the teaser-rate period, is for the borrower to make all new purchases on her
old credit card and to make all payments to her old card. The optimal strategy implies that the borrower
should make no new purchases with the new card to which balances have been transferred (unless she has
already repaid her transferred balances on that card).
      Some borrowers will identify this optimal strategy immediately — before making any purchases with
the new card. Some borrowers will never identify the optimal strategy. Some borrowers may not initially
identify the optimal strategy, but will discover it after one or more pay cycles as they observe their
(surprisingly) high interest charges. Those borrowers will make purchases for one or more months, then
have a “eureka” moment, after which they will implement the optimal strategy.13 We categorize account
holders by the speed with which they converge on the optimal strategy (and stop using the “balance
transfer” card for new purchases).

3.4.2      Data Summary

      We use a proprietary panel data set from several large financial institutions, later acquired by a single
financial institution, that made balance transfer oﬀers nationally. The data set contains 14,798 individuals
who accepted such balance transfer oﬀers over the period January 2000 through December 2002.                        The
bulk of the data consists of the main billing information listed on each account’s monthly statement,
including total payment, spending, credit limit, balance, debt, purchases, cash advance annual percentage

      We thank Robert Barro for drawing our attention to this type of potentially tricky financial product.



                                                              12
rates (APRs), and fees paid. We also observe the amount of the balance transfer, the start date of the
balance transfer teaser rate oﬀer, the initial teaser APR on the balance transfer, and the end date of the
balance transfer APR oﬀer.         At a quarterly frequency, we observe each customer’s credit bureau rating
(FICO) and a proprietary (internal) credit ‘behavior’ score. We have credit bureau data about the number
of other credit cards held by the account holder, total credit card balances, and mortgage balances. We
have data on the age, gender, and income of the account holder, collected at the time of account opening.
In this sample, borrowers did not pay fees for the balance transfer Further details on the data, including
summary statistics and variable definitions, are available in the Appendix.

3.4.3      Results

       About one third of all customers who make a balance transfer do no spending on the new card, thus
implementing the optimal strategy immediately. Slightly more than one third of customers who make a
balance transfer spend on the new card every month during the promotional period, thus never experiencing
a “Eureka” moment. The remaining third of customers experience “Eureka” moments between the first
and sixth months.
       Figure 7 plots the frequency of Eureka moments for each age group. The plot of those who never
experience a “Eureka” moment — that is, who never implement the optimal strategy — is a pronounced
U-shape by age. The plot of those who implement the optimal strategy immediately (the “Month One”
line) is a pronounced inverted U-shape by age. Plots for Eureka moments in the interior of the time space
(that is Eureka moments that occur strictly after Month One) are flat.14 The No Eureka line implies that
the groups with the greatest frequency of maximal confusion are younger adults and older adults. The
group with the greatest frequency of optimality is middle-aged adults.
       Table 3 reports the results of a regression of a dummy variable for ever having a Eureka moment on a
spline for age and controls for credit risk (log(FICO)), education, gender, and log(income).15 . Credit risk
is included because higher scores may be associated with greater financial sophistication.                   Similarly, we
would expect borrowers with higher levels of education to be more likely to experience Eureka moments
The coeﬃcients on the age spline imply that young adults and older adults are less likely to experience
Eureka moments.
       Figure 8 plots the fitted values of the age splines for the propensity of ever experiencing a “Eureka”
moment. Note that, unlike the other figures, higher values indicate a smaller propensity to make mistakes.
Consistent with the evidence so far, we observe a performance peak in middle age.

  14
     Although the average percent of borrowers for each of the intermediate categories is small—on the order of five percent—
summing over all the months yields a fraction of borrowers equal to the one-third of total borrowers.
  15
     Although we report an OLS regression for ease in interpreting the coeﬃcients, we have also run the regression as a logit
and found similar results.

4     Seven Other Choices
    In this section, we present results on all seven other financial choices we studied.

4.1     Credit Cards
4.1.1    Data Summary

    We use a proprietary panel dataset from several large financial institutions that oﬀered credit cards
nationally, later acquired by a larger financial institution. The dataset contains a representative random
sample of about 128,000 credit card accounts followed monthly over a 36 month period (from January 2002
through December 2004).      The bulk of the data consists of the main billing information listed on each
account’s monthly statement, including total payment, spending, credit limit, balance, debt, purchases
and cash advance annual percent rates (APRs), and fees paid. At a quarterly frequency, we observe each
customer’s credit bureau rating (FICO) and a proprietary (internal) credit ‘behavior’ score. We have credit
bureau data about the number of other credit cards held by the account holder, total credit card balances,
and mortgage balances. We have data on the age, gender and income of the account holder, collected
at the time of account opening. Further details on the data, including summary statistics and variable
definitions, are available in the data Appendix.

                              Adjusted R-squared             0.0826

Table 4: This table gives coeﬃcient estimates for a regression of the APR of a credit card on a spline
with age as its argument, financial control variables (Log(FICO) credit risk score, income, total number of
cards, total card balance, home equity debt balance and mortgage balance).


4.1.2    Results

   Table 4 reports the results of regressing credit card APRs on a spline with age as its argument and other
control variables.   As controls, we again use information observed by the financial institution that may
influence pricing. As before, we find that credit scores have little impact on credit card APRs. APRs rise
with the total number of cards, though the eﬀect is not statistically significant. Other controls, including
the total card balance, log income, and balances on other debt, do not have economically or statistically
significant eﬀects on credit card APRs.
   Figure 9 plots the fitted values on the spline for age. A U-shape is present, though it is much weaker
than the age-based patterns that we document for other financial products.

4.2     Auto Loans
4.2.1    Data Summary

   We use a proprietary data set of auto loans originated at several large financial institutions that were
later acquired by another institution. The data set comprises observations on 6,996 loans originated for
the purchase of new and used automobiles. We observe loan characteristics including the automobile value
and age, the loan amount and LTV, the monthly payment, the contract rate, and the time of origination.
We also observe borrower characteristics including credit score, monthly disposable income, and borrower
age.

4.2.2    Results

   Table 5 reports the results of regressing the APR paid for auto loans on an age-based spline and control
variables. FICO credit risk scores again have little eﬀect on the loan terms. Higher incomes lower APRs
and higher debt-to-income ratios raise them, though the magnitudes of the eﬀects are small. We also
include car characteristics, such as type and age, as one of us has found those variables to matter for APRs
in other work (Agarwal, Ambrose, and Chomsisengphet, forthcoming)—though we note that the financial
institutions do not directly condition their loans on such variables. We also include loan age and state
dummies.
   Figure 10 plots the fitted values on the spline for age. The graph shows a pronounced U-shape.



4.3     Mortgages
4.3.1    Data Summary

   We use a proprietary data set from a large financial institution that originates first mortgages in
Argentina.    Using data from one other country provides suggestive evidence about the international
applicability of our findings. The data set covers 4,867 owner-occupied, fixed-rate, first mortgage loans
originated between June 1998 and March 2000 and observed through March 2004. We observe the original
loan amount, the LTV and appraised house value at origination, and the APR. We also observe borrower
financial characteristics (including income; second income; years on the job; wealth measures, such as
second house ownership, car ownership, and car value), borrower risk characteristics (Veraz score-a credit
score similar to the U.S. FICO score-and mortgage payments as a percentage of after-tax income), and

borrower demographic characteristics (age, gender, and marital status).

4.3.2    Results

   Table 6 reports results of regressing the mortgage APR on an age-based spline and control variables.
As controls, we again use variables observed by the financial institution that may aﬀect loan pricing,
including risk measures (credit score, income, mortgage payment as a fraction of income, and LTV), and
various demographic and financial indicators (gender, marital status, a dummy variable for car ownership,
and several others — these coeﬃcients are not reported to save space). The coeﬃcients on the controls are
again of the expected sign and generally statistically significant, though of small magnitude.
   The coeﬃcients on the age spline are positive below age 30, then negative through age 60 and positive
thereafter. Figure 11 plots the fitted values on the spline for age. The figure provides only partial support
for the U-shape hypothesis.



4.4     Small Business Credit Cards
4.4.1    Data Summary

   We use a proprietary data set of small business credit card accounts originated at several large institu-
tions that issued such cards nationally. The institutions were later acquired by a single institution. The
panel data set covers 11,254 accounts originated between May 2000 and May 2002. Most of the business
are very small, owned by a single family, and have no formal financial records. The dataset has all infor-
mation collected at the time of account origination, including the business owner’s self-reported personal

income, the number of years the business has been in operation, and the age of the business owner. We
observe the quarterly credit bureau score of the business owner.

4.4.2   Results

   Table 7 reports the results of regressing the APR for small business credit cards on an age-based spline
and control variables.   As with individual credit card accounts, we control for the FICO score of the
business owner, the total number of cards, card balance, and card limit. We also include dummy variables
for the number of years the small business has been operating — we expect APRs to fall for businesses with
longer operating histories.   All control variables are statistically significant and have the expected sign,
though only the dummies for years in business have substantial magnitudes.


   The APRs are decreasing in the age of the borrower through age 60 and increasing thereafter. Figure
12 plots the fitted values on the spline for age. The graph shows a pronounced U-shape.

4.5     Credit Card Fee Payments: Late Fees
4.5.1     Overview

    Certain credit card uses involve the payment of a fee. Some kinds of fees are assessed when terms of
the credit card agreement are violated. Other fees are assessed for use of services.
    In the next three sections, we focus on three important types of fees: late fees, over limit fees, and cash
advance fees.16 We describe the fee structure for our dataset below.

   1. Late Fee: A late fee of between $30 and $35 is assessed if the borrower makes a payment beyond the
        due date on the credit card statement. If the borrower is late by more than 60 days once or by more
        than 30 days twice within a year, the bank may also impose ‘penalty pricing’ by raising the APR
        to over 24 percent. The bank may also choose to report late payments to credit bureaus, adversely
        aﬀecting consumers’ FICO scores.                                    If the borrower does not make a late payment during the six
        months after the last late payment, the APR will revert to its normal (though not promotional)
        level.

   2. Over Limit Fee:                          An over limit fee — also between $30 and $35 — is assessed the first time the
        borrower exceeds his or her credit limit.                                          Over limit violations generate penalty pricing that is
        analogous to the penalty pricing that is imposed as a result of late fees.

   3. Cash Advance Fee: A cash advance fee — which is the greater of 3 percent of the amount advanced,

   16
      Other types of fees include annual, balance transfer, foreign transactions, and pay by phone. All of these fees are relatively
less important to both the bank and the borrower. Few issuers (the most notable exception being American Express) continue
to charge annual fees, largely as a result of increased competition for new borrowers (Agarwal et al., 2005). The cards in our
data do not have annual fees. We study balance transfer behavior using a separate data set below. The foreign transaction
fees and pay by phone fees together comprise less than three percent of the total fees collected by banks.


                                                                                               22
        or $5 — is levied for each cash advance on the credit card. Unlike the first two fees, this fee can be
        assessed many times per month. It does not cause the imposition of penalty pricing. However, the
        APR on cash advances is typically greater than the APR on purchases, and is usually 16 percent or
        more.

    Payment of these fees is not generally a mistake. For example, if a card holder is vacationing in Tibet,
it may not be optimal to arrange a credit card payment for that month. However, payments of fees are
sometimes mistakes, since the fee payment can often be avoided by small and relatively costless changes
in behavior. For instance, late fees are sometimes due to memory lapses that could be avoided by putting
a reminder in one’s calendar.
    We use the same data set as that used for the credit card APR case study discussed above.

4.5.2     Results

    Table 8 presents panel regressions for each type of fee.     In each of the three regressions, we regress
a dummy variable equal to one if a fee is paid that month on an age-based spline and control variables.
Hence, the coeﬃcients give the conditional eﬀects of the independent variables on the propensity to pay
fees.
    The control variables diﬀer from those of the preceding six examples. Now we control for factors that
might aﬀect the propensity to pay a fee, which are not necessarily the same as factors that might lead
borrowers to default or otherwise aﬀect their borrowing terms. “Bill Existence” is a dummy variable equal
to one if a bill was issued last month; borrowers will only be eligible to pay a late fee if a bill was issued.
“Bill Activity” is a dummy variable equal to one if purchases or payments were made on the card; borrowers
will only be eligible to pay over limit or cash advance fees if the card was used. “Log(Purchases)” is the log
of the amount purchased on the card, in dollars; we would expect that the propensity to pay over limit and
cash advance fees would be increasing with the amount of purchases. “Log(FICO)” is the credit risk score,
and “Log(Behavior)” is an internal risk score created by the bank to predict late and delinquent payment
beyond that predicted by the FICO score. Higher scores mean less risky behavior. The scores are lagged
three months because they are only updated quarterly. We would expect the underlying behavior leading
to lower credit risk scores would lead to higher fee payment.      “Debt/Limit” is the ratio of the balance
of credit card debt to the credit limit; we would expect that having less available credit would raise the
propensity to pay over limit fees, and possibly other fees.
    For late fee payments — column one of the table —all control variables have the expected signs and are
statistically significant, though they are also small in magnitude. Note that some control variables may
partly capture the eﬀects of age-related cognitive decline on fees. For example, if increasing age makes
borrowers more likely to forget to pay fees on time, that would both increase the propensity to pay late
fees and decrease credit and behavior scores.      Hence, the estimated coeﬃcients on the age splines may
understate some age-related eﬀects.
    Coeﬃcients on the age splines are uniformly negative for splines through age 50; negative or weakly

    The top line in Figure 13 plots fitted values for the age splines for the late fee payment regression.17

4.6    Credit Card Fee Payments: Over Limit Fees
    The second column of Table 8 presents regression results for the over limit fee, on the same controls
and age splines that were used for the late fee. Results are similar to those generated in analysis of the
late fee.
    The bottom line in Figure 13 plots fitted values of the age splines for the over limit fee payment
regression.

4.7    Credit Card Fee Payments: Cash Advance Fees
    The second column of Table 8 presents regression results for the cash advance fee, on the same controls
and age splines that were used for the late fee. Results are similar to those generated in analysis of the
late fee and the over limit fee.

     In Agarwal, Driscoll, Gabaix, and Laibson (2008), we study this propensity of paying fees as the interaction of learning
from the payment of past fees and forgetting.

5      The Peak of Performance
5.1     Locating the Peak of Performance
      Visual inspection of the age splines for the ten case studies suggests that fees and interest rates paid
are minimized in the late 40s or early 50s. To estimate the minimum more precisely, we re-estimate each
model, replacing the splines between 40 and 50 and 50 and 60 with a single spline running from 40 to
60, and the square of that spline. This enables us to more precisely estimate the local properties of the
performance curve.
      In other words, we run the following regression, where F is the outcome associated respectively with
each of the 10 studies:

(2)                    F                               = α + β × Spline(Age)Age∈[40,60]
                                                                               /        + γ × Controls +
                                                               +a × Spline (Age)Age∈[40,60] + b · Spline (Age)2Age∈[40,60] .

Here Spline(Age) is a piecewise linear function that takes consumer age as its argument (with knot points
at ages 30, 40, 60 and 70). Spline(Age)Age∈[40,60]
                                          /        represents the splines outside of the [40, 60] age range,
while Spline (Age)Age∈[40,60] is the linear spline with knot points at 40 and 60. Hence, for age between 40

and 60, the above formulation is implicitly quadratic in age:

                                   F = Controls + a × Age + b × Age2 .

      The peak of performance is defined as the value that minimizes the above function:

(3)                                           P eak = −a/ (2b) .

We calculate the asymptotic standard errors on P eak using the delta method, so that the standard error
of P eak is the standard error associated with the linear combination: −1/(2b)·(Coeﬃcient on age) +
a/(2b2 )·(Coeﬃcient on age2 ).
      In Table 9, we report the location of the “age of reason”: the point at which financial mistakes are
minimized. The mean age of reason appears to be at 53.3 years. The standard deviation calculated by
treating each study as a single data point is 4.3 years.
      Formal hypothesis testing (H0 : a + 2b × 53 = 0) shows that only the location of the Eureka moment
is statistically diﬀerent from 53 years. Interestingly, the Eureka task is arguable the most most dependent
on analytic capacity and least dependent on experience (since the kinds of balance transfer oﬀers that we
study were new financial products when our data was collected). It is not surprising that the peak age
for succeeding at that task would be earlier than the peak age for the other tasks. However, since we do
not have a rigorous measure of the “diﬃculty” of a task, the interpretation of the Eureka case remains
speculative.




5.2     Formal Test of a Peak of Performance Eﬀect
      Table 9 allows us do a formal test for a peak eﬀect. In regression (2), the null hypothesis of a peak
eﬀect is: (i) b > 0, and (ii) P eak = −a/ (2b) ∈ [40, 60]. Together these conditions imply that mistakes


                                                     26
follow a U-shape, with a peak that is between 40 and 60 years of age.
         For criterion (i), we note that the b coeﬃcients are positive for all 10 studies. For 9 of the 10 studies, b
is significantly diﬀerent from zero (the credit card APR study is the exception).18 For criterion (ii), Table
9 shows that a peak in the 40-60 age range can not be rejected for all ten studies.


6         Possible Explanations
         Each credit market has idiosyncratic factors that contribute to the hump-shaped age patterns that we
have measured. The recurrence of that hump-shaped pattern across all ten outcomes suggests that the
regularities may also have some common underlying explanations. In this section, we discuss such common
explanations. We argue that the leading candidates are cognitive age eﬀects, selection eﬀects, and cohort
eﬀects. However, our data does not enable us to identify the respective contributions of these factors.

6.1         Cognitive Age Eﬀects
         One possible explanation for the U-shaped pattern of mistakes is a combination of diminishing returns
to learning and age-based declines in analytic function.               Relatively young borrowers have low levels of
experience and a high degree of analytic function, while older borrowers have high levels of experience but
relatively lower levels of analytic function.         We discuss these mechanisms below and explain how these
oﬀsetting lifecycle trends produce a hump-shaped pattern in financial sophistication.
         Analytic cognitive function can be measured in many diﬀerent ways, including tasks that evaluate
working memory, reasoning, spatial visualization, and cognitive processing speed (see Figure 14). Analytic
function shows a robust age pattern in cross-sectional datasets. Analytic function is strongly negatively
associated with age in adult populations (Salthouse, 2005; and Salthouse, forthcoming). On average,
analytic function falls by 2 to 3 percent of one standard deviation19 with every incremental year of age
after age 20. This decline is steady from age 20 to age 90 (see Figure 15).
         The measured age-related decline in analytic performance results from both age eﬀects and cohort
eﬀects, but the available panel data implies that the decline is primarily driven by age eﬀects (Salthouse,
Schroeder, and Ferrer, 2004).20 Medical pathologies represent one important pathway for age eﬀects. For
instance, dementia is primarily attributable to Alzheimer’s Disease (60%) and vascular disease (25%). The
prevalence of dementia doubles with every five additional years of lifecycle age (Fratiglioni, De Ronchi, and
Agüero-Torres, 1999). There is a growing literature that identifies age-related changes in cognition (see
Park and Schwarz, 1999; and Denburg, Tranel, and Bechara 2005).21

    18
     To save space, we only report the t−statistics associated with the b coeﬃcients. Following the order of Table 9, they are:
2.20, 4.55, 7.80, 8.77, 17.05, 1.61, 4.57, 2.91, 3.08, 2.67.
  19
     This is a standard deviation calculated from the entire population of individuals.
  20
     See Flynn (1984) for a discussion of cohort eﬀects.
  21
     Mather and Carstensen (2005) and Carstensen (2006) identify a diﬀerent type of age-variation in cognitive preferences.
Subjects with short time horizons or older ages attend to negative information relatively less than subjects with long time
horizons or younger ages.

Figure 16: Hypothesized relation between general task performance and age. Analytic capital declines with
age and experiential capital increase with age. This generates the hypothesis that general task performance
(which uses both analytic and experiential capital) first rises and then declines with age.


       Age-driven declines in analytic function are partially oﬀset by age-driven increases in experience.22
Most day-to-day tasks rely on both analytic and experiential human capital — e.g., buying the right amount
of milk at the grocery store. For most tasks, we hypothesize that performance is hump-shaped with respect
to age. Formally, this would result from the following conditions (1) general task performance is determined
by the sum of analytic capital and experiential capital, (2) experiential capital is accumulated with strictly
diminishing returns over the lifecycle, and (3) analytic capital falls linearly (or concavely) over the lifecycle
(see Figure 15).      Then general task performance will be hump-shaped with respect to age.                      Figure 16
illustrates this case.

       A Possible Interpretation of the Location of the Performance Peak                            This hypothesis above
also provides us with a possible explanation of the location of the peak of performance. We hypothesize that
peak performance reflects a trade-oﬀ between experience (that is accumulated with diminishing returns) and
analytic function (that declines roughly linearly after age 20). If so, the sooner people start experimenting
with the product, the earlier the peak of performance should be. For instance, suppose Analytic Capital
declines linearly with age, so that Analytic Capital = α − age/β. Suppose that Experiential Capital is
accumulated with diminishing returns — for instance, Experiential Capital = ln(age − γ age0 ), where age0
is the actual age at which people start using the product, and γ age0 < age0 is the eﬀective age at which
people start using the product (so γ < 1). The eﬀective age is less than the actual age, since consumers get
indirect experience (observation and advice) as a result of their interactions with slightly older individuals
who use the product. The model implies that peak performance occurs at P eak = β + γ age0 . Hence,

  22
    Experience may either be directly acquired or it may be indirectly acquired from peers. As social networks are built up
over the lifecycle, external sources of experience become better and better developed. However, such social networks tend to
fray as individuals retire and leave well-developed work-based social networks. Peer mortality also contributes to a late-life
decline of social networks. All of these channels suggest that experiential knowledge embodied in social networks follows a
hump-shaped lifecycle pattern.

peak performance is later when people start using the product later in life.
    To evaluate this hypothesis for each financial product, we first construct the distribution of the ages of
the users of this product in our data set and calculate the age at the 10th percentile of the distribution,
which we call “age10% ”. It is a crude proxy for the age at which people start using the product. We
then regress the location of the peak of performance on age10% . We find: Peak= 33 + 0.71×age10% ,
(R2 = 0.62, n = 10; the s.e. on the coeﬃcients are respectively 5.7 and 0.19).23 We reject the null
hypothesis of no relationship between P eak and age10% . Products that are used later in life tend to have
a later performance peak.
    This analysis only provides suggestive evidence. It is important to measure this correlation and to test
the hypothesized mechanism with other data sets.

6.2    Selection eﬀects
    The cross-sectional age eﬀects that we measure are probably also partially attributable to diﬀerences
in the pool of borrowers by age group: a selection eﬀect.               For example, in the total population of US
households, retirees borrow less than other adults (matching a prediction of the lifecycle consumption
model). Older adults who are using home equity loans and lines of credit may therefore be unrepresentative
of the population of all older adults. Likewise, older adults who are using home equity loans and lines
of credit might be less financially savvy than 20- to 60-year-old borrowers (since borrowing is not a “bad
signal” at these lower ages).24
    In this subsection, we look at measurable financial characteristics by age in our sample. We first ask
whether the older adults in our sample have comparable socio-economic characteristics to the other adults
in our sample. Figure 17 shows that credit-worthiness (FICO) scores on home equity loans and lines show
a U-shape by age distribution. In other words, older and younger borrowers in our sample, are less risky
than middle-aged borrowers in our sample. Figure 18 shows that LTV ratios decline substantially with
age, indicating that older borrowers in our sample are devoting a relatively smaller fraction of their assets
to servicing home equity loans and lines. Likewise, Appendix Table A8 shows that debt levels rise from
age 25 to 50 and then decline to age 75.25 Finally, in section 6.4 (below), we report that default rates are
lower for older borrowers in our sample relative to younger borrowers. These analyses suggest that the
older borrowers in our sample compare favorably (in terms of risk characteristics) to the younger borrowers
in our sample.
    We also find that average income for home equity loan borrowers rises from $76,000 for those aged less
than 30, and about the same to those between 30 and 40 to a peak of $88,500 for those between 40 and
50, and then declines to about $69,000 for those between 60 and 70 and $62,000 for those over 70. These

  23
     The eﬀect is robust to the choice of the 10th percentile. For instance, the correlation between Peak age and Median age
(of users for the product, in our data set) is 0.83.
  24
     They could also be riskier, a hypothesis that we consider (and reject) in section 6.4.
  25
     In comparing the debt levels with those from survey data, one should bear in mind that these data, from the lender, may
be higher than those reported by individuals. Gross and Souleles (2002a, 2002b) document the under-reporting of credit card
debt by individuals.

Figure 17: This figure plots the FICO (credit-worthiness) scores of home equity loan and line of credit
borrowers by age. A high FICO score means a high credit-worthiness.


relative income levels are consistent with the pattern of earnings measured in studies of representative
populations of US households (e.g. Gourinchas and Parker, 2001).
    All in all, the characteristics that we observe do not point to strong negative selection eﬀects for the
older adults in our sample. This is probably due to the fact that our sample only includes prime borrowers,
and is thus truncated in a way that reduces some selection eﬀects that would otherwise arise. In our sample
average FICO score levels are much higher than those for the population as a whole; default rates are lower;
and income levels are higher.
    Figure 19 shows the results of re-estimating the regressions for home equity loans and lines of credit,
now dropping data on all borrowers over the age of 60. There is less reason to believe that the pool of
borrowers below 60 are subject to the sample selection issues discussed above. The results still show a
U-shape, albeit a somewhat less pronounced one.26
    These analyses do not lend support to selection eﬀects, but the analyses also do not rule selection eﬀects
out. For example, it is possible that only unsophisticated older adults borrow; and such unsophisticated
older adults might still have good credit scores and low default rates.                                    Hence, we believe that selection
eﬀects probably do contribute to our results, but it is hard to quantify that impact. However, we do not
believe that selection eﬀects explain the entire U-shaped pattern, particularly the left-hand arm of the U.
Indeed, the kinds of selection eﬀects that we have discussed above would predict a monotonic decline in
financial performance over the entire lifecycle.

  26
     This graph also reinforces the arguments above that potential higher riskiness of borrowers above age 60 is likely not
responsible for the results.

because they belong to cohorts that have less human capital than younger cohorts (e.g. Flynn, 1984).
For example, older cohorts may be less mathematically literate than younger cohorts. In addition, older
cohorts may use less sophisticated search technologies — for instance, older cohorts may be less inclined to
use the internet to compare financial products. Finally, older cohorts may have grown up with diﬀerent
financial products than the products that are now available from financial intermediaries.
      In the absence of a true panel dataset with information of twenty years or more, we cannot measure the
role of cohort eﬀects to explain the U-shape relative to other explanations. However, several facts make us
think that cohort eﬀects do not provide a complete explanation for the U-shaped patterns in our data.
      First, education-based cohort eﬀects do not explain the pattern of declining mistakes that we observe
over the first half of the adult lifecycle.        Second, we observe the U-shaped pattern over a broad range
of products; while some of these products, such as mortgages, have seen substantial changes in their
institutional characteristics over time, others, such as auto loans, have not. Third, if cohort eﬀects were
dominant, we might expect to see diﬀerences in APRs between male and female borrowers on the grounds
that the current cohort of older female borrowers has tended to be less involved in financial decision-making
than their male contemporaries.          Figures 20 and 21 plot the residual eﬀects of age on home equity line
and loan APR for female and male borrowers, respectively. Both show a U-shaped pattern by age, with
no substantive diﬀerence between the two groups.
      Finally, for two products—auto loans and credit cards—we have data from 1992, ten years earlier than
the data used for our other studies. Figures 22 and 23 replicate the plots of the fitted values of the eﬀects
of age on APR for this earlier dataset. Both plots show the same U-shape, with the minimum in the early
50s (like our results using later cross-sections). If our findings were driven by cohort eﬀects, the U-shape
should not reproduce itself in cross-sections from diﬀerent years.
      In summary, cohort eﬀects are probably present in our data, though we doubt that they explain all of the
U-shaped pattern. Cohort eﬀects are most likely to make some contribution to the decline in performance
that we measure after middle age. The improvement in performance up to middle age is harder to explain
with cohort stories, though some preference-based cohort story might be generating this pattern.27

6.4      Risk eﬀects
      Some of our results could be driven by unobserved variation in default risk that is not reflected in the
risk measures — like FICO — that we use as control variables. For instance, the U-shape of APRs could be
due to a U-shape of default by age. We test this alternative hypothesis by analyzing default rates of credit
cards, auto loans, and home equity loans and credit lines. Specifically, we estimate a linear regression in
which the default rate is modeled as a weighted sum of an age spline, log income, and all of the standard
risk measures that are in our data.

Figure 24: Default frequency by borrower age. The figure plots the residual eﬀect of age, after controlling
for other observable characteristics, such as log(income) and credit-worthiness.


   We plot fitted values in Figure 24. None of the graphs is U-shaped. On the contrary, home equity
loans and lines show a pronounced inverted U-shape, implying that the young and old have lower default
rates.    Credit cards and auto loans also show a slight inverted U-shape. Hence, Figure 24 contradicts
the hypothesis that our APR results are driven by an unmeasured default risk. Finally, note that age-
dependent default risks would not explain the observed patterns in credit card fee payments or suboptimal
use of balance transfers.



6.5      Opportunity Cost of Time
   Some age eﬀects could be generated by age-variation in the opportunity cost of time (Aguiar and
Hurst, forthcoming). However, standard opportunity-cost eﬀects would predict that retirees pay lower
prices, which is not what we observe in our data. Nevertheless, our findings and those of the Aguiar and
Hurst article are not contradictory. Shopping for a familiar commodity — for instance, a gallon of milk — is
much less analytically demanding than shopping for a complicated and somewhat unfamiliar product that
can diﬀer across many dimensions — for instance, a mortgage. Hence, we are not surprised to see older
adults shop more eﬀectively for food at the same time that they lose ground in relatively complex domains
— like shopping for mortgage. In addition, shopping at stores and supermarkets may be a more pleasant
activity than shopping at banks and other lenders, leading consumers to do more intensive shopping for
food than for loans.




                                                                                                               36
6.6        Discrimination and Other Supply Factors
         The presence of age eﬀects might also be interpreted as evidence for some kind of age discrimination.
Banks may explicitly choose to charge older and younger borrowers higher APRs, or may simply market
products that happen to have higher APRs or fees more aggressively to the young or old.                          We believe
these explanations to be unlikely for two reasons.                 First, the U-shaped pattern shows up in contexts
such as fee payments and failures to optimally use balance transfer oﬀers in which discrimination is not
relevant (since the products are the same and all card holders face the same rules). Second, firms avoid age
discrimination for legal reasons. Penalties for age discrimination from the Fair Lending Act are substantial
(like the resulting negative publicity).28 We discuss the issue of supply factors further in the section on
market equilibrium below.


7         Discussion
7.1        Market Equilibrium
         The markets we describe may seem paradoxical. First, the markets appear to be competitive, since
many firms compete to sell commodity credit products. However, consumers with ostensibly identical risk
characteristics, fare diﬀerently, implying that the goods being sold are somehow de-commodified.
         Markets like this have been described in the industrial organization literature. A first generation of
models (e.g., Salop and Stiglitz 1977, Ellison 2005, and the citations therein) emphasizes heterogeneous
search costs, which are costs of discovering the products of diﬀerent firms. A second generation (sometimes
under the name of “behavioral industrial organization,” e.g. Ellison 2005 and Gabaix and Laibson, 2006)
emphasizes heterogeneous levels of consumer rationality. For instance, a balance transfer oﬀer provides
a rent that only some consumers are smart enough to exploit.                    Some consumers unravel the shrouded
attribute — the “catch” that they should transfer balances to the card but make no purchases with it —
and some consumers never get it. In the market equilibrium (with competition and free entry), the naive
consumers end up paying above marginal cost, subsidizing the sophisticated consumers, who pay below
marginal cost. From an ex ante point of view, the market is fully competitive, since expected firm profits
are zero.29

    28
     Charles, Hurst and Stephens (2006) show that racial diﬀerences in lending rates exist at auto finance companies, but not
at banks.
  29
     One may ask how such a potentially ineﬃcient equilibrium can persist in a competitive environment. An answer is
proposed in Gabaix and Laibson (2006): the cross-subsidy from naives to sophisticates makes the market more “sticky.”
The sophisticates may not have an incentive to switch from the firms with shrouded attributes (at which they are getting
cross-subsidies). Such stickiness explains why these equilibria are robust even when the equilibria are ineﬃcient. For example,
in the home equity loan and line of credit markets, shrouding may take the following form. The degree to which the pricing
depends on the loan-to-value ratio may well not be apparent to the consumer; the bank will generally not give them a full
schedule of APRs by LTV bucket. Thus, consumers may be unaware of the cost of a rate-changing mistake.




                                                              37
7.2      On the Economic Magnitude of the Eﬀects
       The eﬀects we find have a wide range of dollar magnitudes. Appendix Table A7 provides estimates of
the magnitudes for borrowers aged 75 and 25 relative to borrowers aged 50.30 . For instance, for home-equity
lines of credit, 75-year-olds pay about $265 more each year than 50-year-olds, and 25-year-olds pay about
$295 more. For other quantities, say, credit card fees, the implied age diﬀerentials are small — roughly
$10-$20 per year for each kind of fee.31
       None of the economic decisions that we study is of significant economic relevance on its own, but rather
that there is a U-shaped pattern of payments that may merit economists’ attention become it points to a
phenomenon that might apply to many decision domains. An important question is whether the U-shape
of mistakes translates into other decision domains, including savings choices, asset allocation choices, and
healthcare choices.

7.3      Related Work
       Other authors have studied the eﬀects of aging on the use of financial instruments.                    Korniotis and
Kumar (2007) examine the performance of investors from a major U.S. discount brokerage house. They
use census data to impute education levels and data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in
Europe to estimate a model of cognitive abilities. They find that investors with cognitive declines earn
annual returns between 3-5 percentage points lower on a risk adjusted basis.
       In their work on financial literacy, Lusardi and Mitchell find evidence consistent with an inverse-U
shape of financial proficiency. Lusardi and Mitchell (2006) find a decline in financial knowledge after age
50. Lusardi and Mitchell (2007) also find an inverse U-shape in the mastery of basic financial concepts,
such as the ability to calculate percentages or simple divisions.
       After some of our presentations, other researchers have oﬀered to look for age patterns of financial
mistakes in their own data sets. Lucia Dunn has reported to us that the Ohio State Survey on credit cards
shows a U-shaped pattern of credit card APR terms by age (Dunn, personal communication). Fiona Scott
Morton has reported that in her data set of indirect auto loans (made by banks and finance companies
using the dealer as an intermediary; see Scott Morton et al., 2003), loan markups show a U-shaped pattern
(Scott Morton, personal communication). Luigi Guiso finds that, when picking stocks, consumers achieve
their best Sharpe ratios at about age 43, and this eﬀect appears to be entirely driven by the participation
margin (Guiso, personal communication). Ernesto Villanueva finds that mortgage APRs in Spanish survey
data (comparable to the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances) are U-shaped by age (Villanueva, personal
communication).

     We use the average levels of debt at ages 25 and 75, which diﬀer from those at age 50. We provide those figures in
Appendix Table A8.
  31
     As shown in the columns in Table A7, a diﬀerence in late fee probabilty of 2% per month, and and a fee amount $35,
leads to a total extra yearly expense of $8.40. Note, however, that some of these fees, if paid too often, can trigger “penalty
pricing,” in which interest rates ten percentage points or higher are levied on card balances, thus greatly increasing the cost
of fee payment. See Agarwal, Driscoll, Gabaix and Laibson (2006) for further discussion.



                                                              38
   A relationship between earning and performance has been noted in many nonfinancial contexts. Survey
data suggests that labor earnings peak around age 50 (Gourinchas and Parker, 2002) or after about 30
years of experience (Murphy and Welch, 1990). Shue and Luttmer (2006) find that older and younger
voters disproportionately make more errors in voting.
   Aguiar and Hurst (2007, forthcoming) demonstrate that older adults find lower prices for everyday
items by spending more time shopping around.          In contrast, we find that older adults seem to make
more mistakes in personal financial decision-making. We reconcile these findings by noting that financial
products require more analytic ability than everyday items (like food or clothing). Moreover, shopping
for financial products may be less pleasurable.
   Turning to purely noneconomic domains, there is a literature on estimating performance peaks in
professional athletics and other competitive areas.     Fair (1994, 2005, 2007) estimates the eﬀects of age
declines in baseball and chess, among other sports. Simonton (1988) provides a survey.
   A new literature in psychology and economics reports systematic diﬀerences in “rationality” between
groups of people. Benjamin, Brown, and Shapiro (2006) find that subjects with higher test scores, or less
cognitive load, display fewer behavioral biases. Frederick (2005) identifies a measure of “analytical IQ”:
people with higher scores on cognitive ability tasks tend to exhibit fewer/weaker psychological biases.
While this literature is motivated by experimental data (where it is easier to control for unobservables),
we rely on field data in our paper. Similarly, Massoud, Saunders, and Schnolnick (2006) find that more
educated people make fewer mistakes on their credit cards, and Stango and Zinman (2007) find evidence
that more naive consumers make mistakes across a range of financial decisions.
   Several researchers have looked at the response of consumers to low, introductory credit card rates
(‘teaser’ rates) and at the persistence of otherwise high interest rates. Shui and Ausubel (2004) show that
consumers prefer credit card contracts with low initial rates for a short period of time to ones with somewhat
higher rates for a longer period of time, even when the latter is ex post more beneficial.        Consumers
also appear ‘reluctant’ to switch contracts.      DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004) theorize that financial
institutions set the terms of credit card contracts to reflect consumers’ poor forecasting ability over their
future consumption.
   Many of those eﬀects are discussed in “behavioral industrial organization,” a literature that documents
and studies markets with behavioral consumers and rational firms: examples from this literature include
DellaVigna and Malmendier (2004), Gabaix and Laibson (2006), Heidhues and Koszegi (2006), Malmendier
and Devin Shanthikumar (2005), Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005), Oster and Scott Morton (2005), Spiegler
(2006). In some of those papers, it is important to have both naive and sophisticated consumers (Campbell
2006). Our paper suggests than those naive consumers will disproportionately be younger and older adults.
   Bertrand et al. (2006) find that randomized changes in the “psychological features” of consumer credit
oﬀers aﬀect adoption rates as much as variation in the interest rate terms. Ausubel (1991) hypothesizes
that consumers may be over-optimistic, repeatedly underestimating the probability that they will borrow,
thus possibly explaining the stickiness of credit card interest rates.    Calem and Mester (1995) use the
1989 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to argue that information barriers create high switching costs


                                                       39
for high-balance credit card customers, leading to persistence of credit card interest rates, and Calem,
Gordy, and Mester (2005) use the 1998 and 2001 SCFs to argue that such costs continue to be important.
Kerr and Dunn (2002) use data from the 1998 SCF to argue that having large credit card balances raises
consumers’ propensity to search for lower credit card interest rates. Kerr, Cosslett, and Dunn (2004) use
SCF data to argue that banks oﬀer better lending terms to consumers who are also bank depositors (and
about whom the bank would thus have more information).
   A literature analyzes heuristics and biases in financial decision-making. For instance, Benartzi and
Thaler (2002) show that investors prefer the portfolios chosen by other people rather than the ones chosen
by themselves, a pattern that suggests that task diﬃculty prevents people from reaching an optimal deci-
sion. Benartzi and Thaler (forthcoming) also document the use of a number of sometimes inappropriate
heuristics. Our findings imply that the U-shaped pattern of financial mistakes should also be found in the
examples that Bernatzi and Thaler document.
   A number of researchers have written about consumer credit card use. Our work most closely overlaps
with that of Agarwal et al. (2005), who use another large random sample of credit card accounts to show
that, on average, borrowers choose credit card contracts that minimize their total interest costs net of
fees paid. About 40 percent of borrowers initially choose suboptimal contracts. While some borrowers
incur hundreds of dollars of such costs, most borrowers subsequently switch to cost-minimizing contracts.
The results of our paper complement those of Agarwal et al. (2005), since we find evidence of learning to
avoid fees and interest costs given a particular card contract. Other authors have used credit card data to
evaluate more general hypotheses about consumption. Agarwal, Liu, and Souleles (forthcoming) use credit
card data to examine the response of consumers to the 2001 tax rebates. Gross and Souleles (2002a) use
credit card data to argue that default rates rose in the mid-1990s because of declining default costs, rather
than a deterioration in the credit-worthiness of borrowers. Gross and Souleles (2002b) find that increases
in credit limits and declines in interest rates lead to large increases in consumer debt.     Ravina (2005)
estimates consumption Euler equations for credit card holders and finds evidence for habit persistence.
   Finally, from a methodological perspective our work is related to recent research that studies age
variation along other dimensions. For example, Blanchflower and Oswald (2007) report that well-being is
U-shaped over the lifecycle controlling for observable demographic characteristics. The trough occurs in
the 40s.

7.4    Some Open Questions for Future Research
   Our findings suggest several directions for future research.
   First, it would be useful to measure such eﬀects in other decision domains. We have described a simple
procedure for this: (1) identify the general shape of age eﬀects, as in equation (1), using controls and age
splines; (2) estimate a linear-quadratic form to localize the peak of performance, as in equations (2) and
(3).
   Second, it may be possible to develop models that predict the location of peak performance. There is
a growing consensus that analytically intensive problems — like mathematics — are associated with younger


                                                     40
peak ages (see Simonton 1988, Galenson 2005, and Weinberg and Galenson 2005). Analogously, problems
that require more experiential training have older peak ages.     For instance, Jones (2006) finds that the
peak age for natural scientists has drifted higher over the twentieth century. Relative to 100 years ago,
more experience now needs to be accumulated to reach the cutting edge of scientific fields.
    In our last case study, we found that what is arguably the most analytically demanding task — deducing
the best way to exploit “interest-free” balance transfers — is associated with the youngest age of peak
performance. It would be useful to assess the generality of this association between analytically demanding
problems and young peak ages.
    Advice markets may solve many of the potential problems identified in this paper. On the other hand,
advise markets may not function eﬃciently because of information asymmetries between the recipients and
the providers of advice (Dulleck and Kerschbamer, 2006). It may be particularly interesting to study the
advice market for retirees who control historically unprecedented amounts of financial wealth.


8    Conclusion
    We find that middle-aged adults borrow at lower interest rates and pay lower fees in ten financial
markets. Our analysis suggests that this fact is not explained by age-dependent risk factors. For example,
FICO scores and default rates would predict the opposite pattern of age variation.
    We believe that our findings are driven by three complementary factors: age-related cognitive eﬀects,
selection eﬀects, and cohort eﬀects.    We are unable to disentangle the contributions of each of these
factors. We speculate that, to the extent they are present, cohort and selection eﬀects have larger eﬀects
on the reported outcomes for older borrowers, since the natural cohort- and selection-stories for younger
borrowers imply that those groups should on average be paying lower prices (controlling for observable risk
characteristics).
    Whatever the mechanisms, there is a robust relationship between age and financial sophistication
in cross-sectional data, after controlling for available consumer characteristics.   Future research should
untangle the diﬀerent forces that give rise to these eﬀects.    Measuring age-related cognitive eﬀects will
be particularly important because cognitive decline over the lifecycle has significant implications for the
financial decisions that older adults are now routinely expected to make.

   Notes: The “Credit Bureau Risk Score” is provided by Fair, Isaac, and Company (FICO). The greater the score,
the less risky the consumer is. The “Behavior Score” is a proprietary score based on the consumer’s past payment
history and debt burden, among other variables, created by the bank to capture consumer payment behavior not
accounted for by the FICO score.

    Notes: This table computes the diﬀerence in annual costs of each product borne by 25-year-old and 75-year-old
borrowers relative to 50-year-old borrowers.     For home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, auto loans,
mortgages, and small business credit cards, the annual cost diﬀerence is the product of the APR diﬀerence and the
average debt levels by age given in Table A8. For “Eureka,” it is the probability diﬀerence of experiencing a “eureka”
moment multiplied by the APR diﬀerence multiplied by the amount of the balance transferred. For the three types
of credit card fees, it is the probability diﬀerence of paying the fee multiplied by a fee amount of $35. For these last
three, the calculations likely understate the amount of the fee, since they do not incorporate interest rate changes
that may be triggered by multiple fee payments or the interest paid on cash advance balances.
