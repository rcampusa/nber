 country weights and of base periods and, most important of all, the fteaUnent of quality change.
 Later base periods and higher weights for rapidly growing exporters, such as Japan or the newly

in prices.
        Conservative estimates of the bias in the most commonly used measure ofexport prices
of manufactured products, the United Nations export unit value index for manufactures, suggest
that this measure overstates the long-mn rise in manufactured goods prices by more than half of
one per cent per year, probably one per cent or more, If this is the case, there has beenno long
term Uend toward rising prices of manufactures relative to primary products. However, no
conceivable estimate of bias in measures of manufactured goods prices wouldreverse the picture
of declining relative primary product prices during the 1980s.

                                   Introduction

       The issue of long-term changes in the terms of trade between primary

products and manufactures has a long history, going back at least to Torrens

 (1821), Ricarda (1832), and Mill (1848). It engaged the     attention at various

times, of Jevons (1866) and Keynes (1912), and of Singer (1950),      Prebisch, in
United Nations (1950), Lewis (1952), Kindleberger (1956), Haberler (1959. 1961)

and Viner (1953), among mote recent commentators. The classical views were based

mostly on theoretical considerations of the inevitability of increasing
                                                                            costs,
while the later debate has been centered around empirical
                                                             questions.

      Many improvements have taken place in the measures of prices of primary

products, but the manufactures side of the debate has rested on a collection of

inappropriate or low-quality series stitched together in a variety of ways by

different analysts. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications for

this discussion of some efforts to construct better price series for exports of

manufactures by developed countries for the period since 1953.    Among the issues

that are examined here with the new price data are:

      (1) The effects of shifting the dates of the export weights used;

      (2) The effect of changing the country on whose export pattern the

           weighting is based;

      (3) The difference between price movements for exports to developing
 •

           countries and those for exports to all countries,

                                    and

      (4) Most important, the effects of making some adjustments for

 •
           changes in the, "quality" or characteristics, of manufactured

           goods, not taken into account in standard price measures.

     It has been said that the importance of the quality improvement issue to the

terms of trade debate has been exaggerated because there have been quality
                                      -2-
improvements in primary products as welt as in manufactures. For example, Spraos

(1983) mentions that in Kenya, the proportion of coffee beans harvested that was

of the highest quality rose from .2 per cent in 1955-58 to 16 per cent in 1964-65

and that the proportion of iron ore exports that had an iron content of more than

60 per cent rose from one third in 1960 to more than half in 1964 (p. 58). It

is not clear how that information is relevant to the question of bias in price

measurement unless it is shown, as it has not been so far, that the primary

product prices used for price indexes fall to take account of such quality

improvement.

      These changes in the average quality of primary products could certainly

produce an upward bias in primary product prices if these prices were measured

by unit values that took no account of quality distinctions. However, most price

indexes for primary products and most calculations of the tens of trade between

primary products and manufactures use specification prices for primary

commodities, a procedure that should eliminate that source of bias. On the other

hand, if commodities sold on organized markets, the source of specification

prices, are a small part of total commodity trade, the reported prices may be

biased as new and improved versions of commodities gradually replace the

traditional specifications.

     How large is the alleged movement in the net barter terms of trade? Spraos

(1980) calculated many varieties, and these can be used as one reference point.

For periods going back to the l87Os and ending before World War II the annual

deterioration for primary product terms of trade reported ranged from a quarter

of one per cent to one per cent per year, according to his calculations,

clustering roughly around one half of one per cent. For periods after 1950, to

1975 or so, and excluding petroleum from primary products, the rates of

deterioration range up to over 2 per cent per year. For the totality of primary
                                      -3-
products, Spraos thought the evidence for the long run, extending through the

1970s, did not show any statistically significant trends. Extending the data

through the l980s would probably restore that negative coefficient for relative

primary product prices but would not bring it outside the range mentioned above.

      A paper by Cuddington (1990) examining terms of trade for 26 individual

commodities from 1900 to 1983 lists time coefficients ranging from +2 per cent

per year to -1.2 per cent per year in trend-stationary models, with S out of 6

negative coefficients smaller than 1 per cent in absolute value, Of 10 negative

time coefficients for commodities for which difference -   stationary   models are

used, only 2 are above 1 per cent per year.

      Crilli and Yang (1988) calculated that the trend rate of decline in primary

commodity prices relative to manufactures prices from 1900 through 1986 was .5

per cent per year, or .6 per cent per year if fuels were excluded from primary

products.



A. Measures of Prices of Manufactured Coods1

      Measures of.manufactured goods prices have long been a weak link in all

kinds of empirical studies of international merchandise trade. The deficiencies

of these indexes affect studies of international competitiveness, of real

exchange rates, of income, price, and substitution elasticities, of export

supply, and of the terms of trade.

      What are these deficiencies? Most countries do not survey export and

import prices at all, although the number doing so has increased over the last

twenty years. Most trade studies rely on indexes of export and import unit

values, despite a long history of adverse appraisals of their accuracy as price


     1This section is taken mainly from Lipsey, Molinari, and Kravis (1991).
                                      -4-
measures and despite the use of unit values in some studies to measure quality

differences or quality changes, uses that imply their inaccuracy for measuring

price changes. Not only are the unit values inaccurate as measures of the prices

of individual products, but in different- countries they are combined with

different weights and using different index-number formulas. They are relied on

because they are almost universally available from customs records and have been

for a long time.

      An alternative to the unit-value indexes is the use of domestic wholesale

or producer-price indexes. These are collected with a much higher degree of

quality control than is applied to the unit-value indexes, but the prices

themselves, and their weighting in the indexes, do not purport to apply to

external trade.       The producer-price indexes are computed with different

weighting, coverage, and index-number formulas in different countries, as are the

unit-value indexes,

      A more general problem with both sources of data, and also with existing

export and import price indexes, is that new products are underrepresented for

some period after their introduction, and complex products are permanently

underrepresented. A related problem is that price indexes for some manufactured

goods suffer from upward bias due to the neglect of quality change, an issue that

has been discussed extensively in connection with the domestic producer and

consumer price indexes. The two issues are related because it is the complexity

and rapid change in specifications that lead to the omission of many products

from most countries' price indexes. Computers and computer accessories may be

excluded completely, although they have become an increasingly important part of

manufactured- goods trade.

      To deal with these problems of measurement of manufactured goods prices in
                                      -5-
international trade, the National Bureau embarked on a program of international

price measurement research beginning over 30 years ago. The present BLS export

and import price indexes for the United States were to some extent an outgrowth

of those studies.    The first phase of the National Bureau's research was

summarized in Kravis and Lipsey (1971), and the latest publication is Lipsey,

I1olinari, and Kravis (1991). This research has produced new measures of the

prices relevant to the explanation of trade flows. These are now being broadened

with respect to the country coverage of the indexes and by experiments with

methods of dealing with quality change. Some of the characteristics of these

measures are:

      1.   Weighting. Two types of indexes of manufactured goods prices are

constructed. The one discussed here1 which is used, for example, in studying

world trends in terms of trade, is a "world" or developed-country index of

manufactured-goods prices, using as weights aggregate developed-country exports

or developed-country exports to developing countries. Indexes for individual

countries are also constructed based on these two sets of weights. A second type

of index is intended mainly for studies of competition in international trade.

It is calculated for the United States and for the aggregate of many of its major

competitors, using the export weights of the United States and weighting at a

fine level of commodity detail, such as the 4-digit Slit. Indexes of domestic

prices with own-country export weights are also calculated for each of the three

countries, to examine the possibility of divergences between export and domestic

price movements and the implications for changes in margins of profitability of

export and domestic sales.

      2. I1issing prices. In place of the assumption that prices for products

not covered move in the same way as those covered in the same country, in the
                                      -6-
aggregate indexes for all developed countries, a method is used that incorporates

both country and commodity effects in estimating missing prices. The method is

an adaptation of the country-product dummy (CPD) method developed by Summers

(1973) for the estimation of country price levels.       It involves fitting an

equation to each block of country and commodity price change observations for a

given year. The block is defined by the full list of commodities and countries

in, say, a 2-digit SITC class. The equation contains dummy variables for both

country and commodity and therefore permits the data to determine the degree to

which each influences the estimate of the missing price.

      3. Quality corrections. There have been almost no studies examining the

relation of changes in product quality to the measurements of export and import

prices, although there have been studies in which attempts were made to measure

changes or differences in product quality by changes or differences in unit

values (for example, Ohlsson, 1980; Aw and Roberts, 1988; Boorstein and Feenstra,

1991; and Rodrik, 1988). There have been a number of studies attempting to

correct domestic U.S. prices for quality change, mostly by the use of hedonic

price measures. Many of these are summarized in Gordon (1990). In the indexes

used here, the effect on the U.S. export price indexes of introducing quality-

adjusted price measures for a few commodities is calculated, as well as the

effect on world price indexes, under two possible assumptions about the relation

between quality and price change in the U.S. and price change in other countries'

exports.



B.   Data   Collection
      For these studies, export and domestic price data have been collected at

the moat detailed level available, some from price data on computer tape or
                                      -7-
diskettes, but most keypunched from published or unpublished price compendia.

These price data, which go back to 1953 for most countries included, are arranged

according to the 4-digit SITC Revision 1. The countries included, some more

extensively than others, are the U.S., the U.K., Cermany, Japan, Canada, The

Netherlands, Sweden, and France. We have also begun to collect data for Korea,

Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, but they are not included in the indexes

discussed here. The data are classified into the SITC Revision 1 at the four-

digit level and then aggregated to 3-digit. 2-digit, and 1-digit levels for SITC

5-8, and to total manufactures, defined as SITC S through 8.      The methods are

explained most recently in Lipsey, Molinari, and Kravis (1991).



       Factors Affectint Measures of ExDort Prices of Manufactured Goods

      One advantage of the NBER price indexes used here over the UN unit value

indexes and other representations of manufactured goods prices is that the price

indexes here are transparent; the ingredients and how they were put together are

known. The UN unit value indexes, on the other hand, are derived from a variety

of national indexes, put together by national statistical offices in many

different ways, and some of which, in fact, are not even based on unit values.

The estimates here of the influence of various factors, such as weighting and

quality change, on measures of manufactured goods prices are, therefore, derived

from the NBER indexes.

      The influence of each factor is measured in two ways. One is by its effect

on the change from the initial year of the indexes, 1953, to the final year,

expressed also as an annual rate of change. Since this method carries the risk

that it may be excessively influenced by the circumstances of the first and last

years, a linear logarithmic trend is also fitted to each of the series and the
                                        -8-
estimated coefficient of time used as the       average   rate of change.



ExDorts to the World vs. ExDorts to Develooin2 Countries

      The composition of exports by developed countries (DCs) to developing

countries (LDCs) is somewhat different from that of their exports to developed

countries and to the world as a whole. An indication of the effect of that

difference on price measures is given by comparisons of changes in the price

indexes for the two   destinations   between 1953 and 1991 (Table 1):


                                       Table 1

The prices of developed country exports of manufactures to developing countries

declined by about S to 6 1/2 per cent over this period, depending on the base

period used, relative to prices of exports to all destinations, or an average of

between .13 and .18 per cent per year. If the average decline in prices for

exports to developing countries relative to exports to the world is calculated

from fitted equations in logs, the rate of decline is somewhat larger --      between

.16 and .21 per cent per year, with the later weights indicating larger declines

in the relative prices of exports to developing countries. Thus, an estimate of

the terms of trade of developing countries based on data         for developed-country
exports to all countries would be biased downward slightly on this account.

The Effect of Chanpina Ease Years
      Price   indexes have been calculated using several different base years,

1963, 1915, and 1986. The composition of trade in manufactures has, of course,

changed substantially over this period. Qne way it has changed is that world

trade has moved steadily toward more high-tech products, in the sense of products

of industries in which R & D expenditures are important relative to value added

or sales (Table 2).

      Whether because of the shift over time to high-tech products or the more

general tendency of consumers to shift to products declining in price, the export

price indexes based on 1915 weights rise less than those based on 1963 weights

and the indexes based on 1986 weights rise still less (Table 3):

The shift in commodity and country weights from 1963 to 1975 reduced the estimate

of the price increase for manufactured goods by about S or 6 per cent, or about

.15 per cent per year.    The shift to a 1986 base reduced the rate of pri.ce

increase still further1 by about .19 per cent per year. Thus, the difference

between the growth in prices calculated on 1963 weights and that based on 1986

weights is about a third of a per cent per year.

      The estimates from fitting logarithmic time trends are that the change from

1963 to 1975 weights reduces the growth in prices of exports to the world by

about .11 per cent per year, and the change from 1975 to 1986 weights reduces it

by about another .17 per cent or more per year, a total reduction by a little

over a quarter of a per cent per year. For exports to developing countries the

effect of the 1963 to 1975 weight shift is about .14 per cent per year and of the

1975 to 1986 shift, another .19 per cent, a total reduction of about a third of

a per cent per year.

      Within machinery and transport equipment1 SITC 7, the effect of shifting

weights was much larger. For exports to the world (Appendix Table 2), the index

on a 1975 base rose more slowly than that on a 1963 base by more than a quarter

of a per cent per year, as measured from a logarithmic regression, and the index

on a 1986 base increased by about another third of a per cent less than that on
                                      - 11   -


 the 1975 base. Thus, the shift of 20 plus
                                           years in the base reduced the rate
 of growth in prices of machinery and transport
                                                  equipment by roughly .6 per cent
each year. Countries apparently shifted their imports toward the products that

were declining relatively in price much more extensively in
                                                                    machinery and
transport equipment than in manufacturing as a whole.



New and RaDidly Crowing Countries

      Two of the major changes that have taken place in the world      market for
exports of manufactures have been, first and most important, the rapid growth of

Japanese production and exports, and second, the rapid growth of exports by the

Asian NICs.     That growth could affect the markets and world prices for

manufactures in several ways, depending on the way in which entry into or

expansion in the share of world markets was accomplished.        The most readily

observable method of entry would be entry into world markets at high prices and

low market shares, followed by relative declines in the newcomers' prices as

their productivity grew relative to others. Indexes with later country weights

would decline in comparison with indexes based on earlier weights, because they

would give more importance to the new countries with declining prices. A second

method of entry would be that the new countries enter world markets
                                                                      by selling
at low prices, gradually raising their market shares as buyers learn about and

shift to the new sources of supply, but with no change in relative prices offered

by old and new suppliers. 8oth of these assume that the "law of one price" does

not hold. A third method would be, if the law of one price does operate, that

the new entrants influence the market by driving down the price for all

suppliers, forcing less efficient producers out of the market.

      The various methods of market entry would show up in different ways in
                                      - 12   -


 measures of price competition and of world price changes. The first scenario,

 with declining relative prices of flew entrants1 is exactly what is envisaged in

 measures of relative prices and price competitiveness, which would therefore be

 suitable for explaining shifts in market shares. However, as long as     separate
 export price indexes were constructed for each exporting country, the part of the

price decline that consisted of a shift toward sources with declining relative

prices weuld be missed in a fixed-weight world price index, although it would

show up as a decline in indexes with later country weights relative to those with

earlier weights.

      The second method of entry would be difficult to observe without measures

of relative price levels, as well as of price changes, as in Kravis and Lipsey

(1971).   In both the present indexes and-the standard unit value or price

indexes, the effective decline in price would be missed, because both export unit

values and export prices are compiled separately for each country, in effect

treating each country's export of a product as a separate product. These effects

could be caught in import price or unit value indexes but their only mark on

export indexes would be in the rise in market shares of the low-price countries.

      Finally, in the third case, where new entrants bring down their rivals'

prices there would be an indication of the change in country shares even in

conventional export price indexes.     A world export price index on Japanese

weights, for example, would decline relative to an index based on world or other

countries' weights because the Japanese weights would give greater importance to

products that are declining relatively in price.

      Some evidence for the existence of the third sequence of events is provided

by a comparison of annual rates of growth of world
                                                      manufactures export price

      World export price indexes for manufactures weighted by Japanese export

weights rose less rapidly than indexes based on world, or U.S. or German, export

weights, no matter what year's export composition is used, although Japan's

advantage in this respect is smaller with the later year's weights. In other

words, Japanese exports were more concentrated than, for example, U.S. exports

on products for which prices were rising less rapidly than average or were even

declining. Either Japan's exports were more heavily concentrated on products for

which productivity was rising relatively fast everywhere or its rapid

productivity growth was driving down world prices of the products in which its

exports were concentrated, whether or not other countries' productivity was

growing rapidly in these products.

      That phenomenon of the impact of new suppliers appears even more strongly

if we compare developed-country export price indexes for 1991 relative to 1981

based on developed-country weights with developed-country price indexes based on

the weights of Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.

Even over this short period, developed-country export price indexes based on the

weights of the fast-growing Asian exporters declined substantially relative to

an index based on the developed countries' own export weights. The differences

ranged from a half per cent per year to more than one per cent.



Quality chanEe

      Our attempt to adjust manufactured goods price indexes for changes in

quality is based on the idea that neither unit value indexes nor price indexes

based on specification pricing have captured the effects of changes in the

quality of manufactured goods, particularly those that are complex or one-of-a-

kind. Many such products are simply omitted from most price indexes and, when

they are included, the prices tend to be list, rather than transactions prices,

because the actual products sold differ substantially from one transaction to

another.

      There are virtually no studies of the relation of quality change to price

measures that refer specifically to exported or imported goods aside from the

studies mentioned above attempting to measure quality change from unit value
                                      - 15   -



data.   A partial exception is a set of hedonic price indexes in Kravis and Lipsey

(1971) as part of a much broader attempt to measure prices in world trade, but

even there, most of the data for the hedonic price indexes actually referred to

domestic markets. For years since 1982, there are also recent calculations by

the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce for

exports and imports of computers.

        Most of the literature on the adjustment of the price quotations for

quality change involves the calculation of hedonic price indexes to replace the

standard specification-based price measures.         There are other types of
corrections, such as the cost of improvement calculations used for automobiles

by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, calculations based on prices in second

hand markets, and corrections for the bias resulting from the slow introduction

of new products into price indexes. However, what is used here are hedonic price

indexes that have been calculated in various studies of domestic technological

change and prices. The specific series we have used are listed in the notes to

Appendix Table 5.

        What we did was to collect studies of quality change that had been carried

out by others. All referred to domestic prices in the United States, and all the

products were in 51W Division 7 Machinery and Transport Equipment. Within

Division 7, they were confined to 9 four digit subgroups and 2 three-digit groups

and drew heavily on Gordon (1990) and two or three papers on individual products.

We had to assume, in effect, that the quality adjustments applied equally to

domestically used and exported products. Since only some products were covered,

and since most of the quality corrections did not go beyond 1983, we felt that

the adjustments we made were minimal even for SITC Division 7 for the United

States, and must surely understate what a comprehensive quality correction would

show.

        For the export priàes of the United States, based on the weights of

developed-country exports of manufactures to developing countries, the effect of

the quality adjustments is as follows, forall manufactures and for SITC 7;

        For SITC 7, the group in whith the quality adjustments were carried out,

the rise in U.S. export prices was considerably less with the quality adjustment.

by about one quarter, or .86 per cent per year. And that quality adjustment in

SITC 7 alone results in a reduction in the estimated price increase for all US.

manufactured exports, assuming no omitted quality change in other groups, of

almost a half of one per cent per year. In other words1 the estimated upward

bias front the omission of quality change is about a third for U.S. exports of

machinery and transport equipment and almost 20 per cent for U.S. exports of all

manufactures.

        If we estimate the average quality correction from an equation rather than
                                       - 17   -



from   the change from beginning to end years, the relative decline in the adjusted

price index for the U.S. is around .4 per cent per year for all manufactures and

.7 or .8 per cent per year for SITC 7.

        There are several possible ways to calculate the implication of these

quality adjustments for world price changes, of which we show two here. The most

conservative is to adjust only the U.S. price index and combine the adjusted U.S.

price index with the conventional indexes for the other countries.             That

calculation, referred to below as "adjusted for U.S. only." must understate the

quality change bias in our conventional indexes.

        The other adjustment is performed by assuming, in effect, that for these

products the law of one price holds in time-to-time form.              It involves

substituting the U.S. hedonic price index for a subgroup for whatever is reported

by each country and also using that U.S. hedonic price index where no

conventional price index is reported. The assumption flies in the face of the

strong evidence that the law of one price is frequently violated. But it is more

reasonable than the alternative assumption that the prices of these goods move

as indicated by conventional indexes or, since most of these products are not

covered by most countries' price indexes, the assumption that these prices move

in the same way as those of all covered products.           Some support for our

assumption of common worldwide price changes is that the price index for U.S.

imports of computers and parts falls by about as much as the domestic and export

prices.

       The effects of these quality change adjustments over the 1953 to 1991

period as a whole, calculated from indexes with 1975 weights, is shown in Table

7, for SITC 7 and for all manufactures.

        The   most conservative adjustment, assuming no quality change outside the
U.S., indicates an upward bias in the price indexes for developed-country exports
to   the world of about .15 per cent per year for all manufactures and .23 per cent

per year for machinery and transport equipment (SITC 7) alone. If we adopt the

assumption that in the 11 products with quality adjustments prices in other

countries followed those of the U.S. •    the adjustment is ouch larger: over half
of one per cent per year for all manufactures and almost one     per cent per year

for machinery and transport equipment. The adjustment is even larger for price

indexes of exports to developing countries.

        The average declines in the adjusted indexes relative to the unadjusted

ones for exports to the world estimated from equations are, when the adjustment

is made to all countries' indexes1 more than a half per cent per year for all

manufactures and a little over 1 per cent per year for 51W 7, slightly higher

than the estimates from beginning to end years. The same relationship holds for

exports to developing countries.

       Given the rough nature of these adjustments and the incompleteness of
                                         -19-
coverage, these estimates must be subject to a considerable range of error.

However, it     seems as if quality adjustments   could welt be large enough to offset

the   supposed long-run deterioration in the terms of trade of primary products.
as it    has   been estimated by supporters of .the thesis that there has been such
deterioration.
         It is worth mentioning that these quality adjustments are much too gradual
to   offset the large short-ten or medium term cycles in terms of trade, where the
year-to-year movements are far greater than any        conceivable offsetting changes
in    quality on the manufactures side. Thus they do little to alter the picture
of    deteriorating terms of trade for primary products during the l9SOs.



Comoarison wjth UN Unit Value Index for Exports pf Manufactures

         If we want to get some idea of what difference the use of these

manufactures price indexes would make in comparison with the movement of

commodity prices over the same period, we can start by comparing the UN unit

value index to the price index for all manufactured exports to the world by

developed countries, without the adjustment for quality change. That difference

of almost .4 per cent per year measured from beginning to end years, or .35 per

cent estimated from an equation, might be the result of many factors, some

possibly offsetting, but in any case, hard to identify. The difference between
                                       - 20   -



unit values   and specification prices is there, as well as differences in weights.

in country coverage, and in index number formulas.

        It is impossible to explain the differences between these price indexes and

the unit value series reliably because the commodity composition of the

individual-country unit value series is not known. The country indexes are

combined into a world index using Paasche (current-year) weights, and many of the

country indexes are of the same type. However, some important countries use

other   types of index numbers such as I.aspeyres (United Kingdom) or Fisher (The
Netherlands and, until recently, the U.S.). In addition, for eight countries,
price indexes, rather than unit value indexes, are used to produce the world unit
value   indexes (United Nations, 1991, p. 42).
        As can be seen in the most recent description of the UN indexes (United

Nations, 199la), the unit value indexes cover more countries than those presented

here. They include 25 developed countries, instead of the 8 in the price indexes

here.     However, these 8 countries included here accounted for about three

quarters of the total exports by the 25 in 1989.

        To judge by the unit value data, the use of the 8 countries in our list

produces an index that is biased upward to some degree, as compared with that for

the full list of developed countries, at least during the 1980s. For 1980-89,

a unit value index with 1989 export value weights for the 8 countries rose by 2

per cent, or about .2 per cent per year relative to the 25-country unit value

series.
                                       - 21   -



                                     conclusions
       It seems likely that certain characteristics of the UN export unit value

 index for manufactures cause it to be biased upward as a measure of the prices

 of manufactured goods exported by developed countries to developing countries.

 It also appears that these biases could be largeenough to offset the long-term

 deterioration in export prices of commodities relative to the UN unit value index

 for manufactured exports that has been calculated by proponents of the belief

 that there has been such a deterioration. Thus, the case is weak that there has

been a long-tern deterioration in commodity prices in general relative to a price

 index, adjusted for quality change, of manufactured exports from developed

countries to developing countries.

      The main ingredient in this conclusion is the adjustment for quality

change, which we estimate to be at least .5 per cent per
                                                           year, just about enough
by itself to offset the reported deterioration in relative
                                                             commodity prices. We
find an additional "bias" of about .35 or .40 per cent per year from the

difference between our unadjusted index for exports by developed countries to all

countries and the UN Unit Value Index, possibly, but not necessarily, due to the

use by the UN of unit value data rather than specification price data.        The

country selection for our index might bias it upward relative to a more

comprehensive index by about another .2 per cent per year, although we have

evidence for this only for the l980s and the direction of the effect could be

opposite, if it even exists, in earlier years. The use of an index weighted by

exports to developing countries rather than to all countries amounts to about

another .1 per cent or more per year. The sum of these items implies that the

true rate of growth of manufactured goods prices may be lower than that in the

UN unit value index by as much as I per cent per year.
                                       - 22   -


      Although   there is certainly room for disagreement with the assumption used

here, there are grounds for judging that the adjustments are conservative. In

particular, the assumption is made, in effect, that there are no overlooked

failures to correct for quality improvements outside of the eleven groups for

which hedonic measures are used here.         While some of the obvious cases are

covered in the adjustments included here, there are other likely candidates for

adjustment. Even within SIlt 7, there are products for which quality adjustments

may be desirable, such as aircraft engines, agricultural machinery other than

tractors, office machinery other than computers, such as copiers and fax

machines, all non-electrical machinery for special industries, radio and

television receivers, electrical apparatus for medical purposes, such as

diagnostic equipment, motor vehicles and parts except passenger cars, and ships.

In groups other than SIlt 7, where we made no quality adjustments,

pharmaceuticals price indexes are almost certainly biased upward, and to a

substantial degree, and prices of plastics may also be subject to quality

adjustments. This listing is not proof that there are any quality improvement

overlooked in specification price indexes, but it suggests that we have not

exhausted the possibilities for such adjustment.

      A further reason for considering our estimates of quality adjustment

conservative is that the ones we have used, with the exception of two, are not

available after 1983. We are therefore, in effect, assuming that there was no

further unaccounted for quality change outside of computers and semiconductors

after 1983, an unlikely story.

      The conclusion here is that the estimate of long term increases in world

prices of manufactured goods derived from the UN unit value index is too high by

at least one per cent per year.         Furthermore, the overestimate could be
                                      - 23   -


considerably   greater if the quality corrections made here have counterparts in

other manufactured products, even if there would be few, if any, on the scale of

the corrections for conuputers and semiconductors.

Notes to Aooendix Table 6


      For the indexes labeled "Adjusted for U.S. Only." the U.S. indexes for

SITC 7 adjusted for quality change are combined with the indexes for other

countries as described in the text.

      For the indexes labeled "Adjusted for All Countries," each U.S. hedonic

price index was substituted for the conventional price index for that particular

SITC subgroup or group at the three or, usually, four digit SITC level (or

inserted where there had been no conventional index) in the index for every

country. The individual country indexes for all manufactures and the world

indexes were then aggregated, as in earlier tables. To prevent the hedonic

adjustment from affecting uncovered groups and.subgroups, the substitution was

performed by subtracting the unadjusted indexes from the SItC aggregate and

adding back the adjusted indexes with the same weights. Where no unadjusted

index existed for a group or subgroup, the subtraction was done assuming that

the uncovered items had the same price index as SIlt 7 as a whole.
