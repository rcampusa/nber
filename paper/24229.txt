                                           ABSTRACT

Workplace wellness programs cover over 50 million workers and are intended to reduce medical
spending, increase productivity, and improve well-being. Yet, limited evidence exists to support
these claims. We designed and implemented a comprehensive workplace wellness program for a
large employer with over 12,000 employees, and randomly assigned program eligibility and
financial incentives at the individual level. Over 56 percent of eligible (treatment group)
employees participated in the program. We find strong patterns of selection: during the year prior
to the intervention, program participants had lower medical expenditures and healthier behaviors
than non-participants. However, we do not find significant causal effects of treatment on total
medical expenditures, health behaviors, employee productivity, or self-reported health status in
the first year. Our 95% confidence intervals rule out 83 percent of previous estimates on medical
spending and absenteeism. Our selection results suggest these programs may act as a screening
mechanism: even in the absence of any direct savings, differential recruitment or retention of
lower-cost participants could result in net savings for employers.

1        Introduction

Sustained growth in medical spending has prompted policymakers, insurers, and employers
to search for ways to reduce medical spending. One widely touted solution is to increase
the use of “wellness programs,” interventions designed to encourage preventive care and dis-
courage unhealthy behaviors such as inactivity or smoking. The 2010 Affordable Care Act
(ACA) encourages firms to adopt wellness programs by permitting them to offer participa-
tion incentives up to 30 percent of the total cost of health insurance coverage. Workplace
wellness industry revenue has more than tripled in size to $8 billion since the passage of
the ACA, wellness programs now cover over 50 million U.S. workers, and recent studies have
investigated expanding wellness programs into Medicare and Medicaid (Mattke, Schnyer and
Van Busum, 2012; Fout et al., 2013; Kaiser, 2016b; Askelson et al., 2017). A meta-analysis
by Baicker, Cutler and Song (2010) finds large medical and absenteeism cost savings, but
some studies find only limited benefits (e.g., Gowrisankaran et al., 2013; Baxter et al., 2014).
As these authors have noted, identification is limited in prior studies because employee par-
ticipation, along with the firm’s decision to adopt a wellness program, is voluntary.
        Moreover, the prior literature has overlooked important questions regarding selection
into wellness programs. The increasing use of large financial incentives now permitted by
the ACA may redistribute resources across employees in a manner that runs counter to the
intentions of policymakers.1 For example, wellness incentives may shift costs onto unhealthy
or lower-income employees if these groups are less likely to participate in wellness programs.
Furthermore, wellness programs may act as a screening device by encouraging employees
who benefit most from these programs to join or remain at the firm—perhaps by earning
rewards for behaviors they already enjoy.
        To improve our understanding of what workplace wellness programs do, we designed and
implemented the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, a large-scale, randomized controlled trial
    1
    Kaiser (2017) estimates that 13 percent of large firms (at least 200 employees) offer incentives that
exceed $500 dollars per year, and 4 percent of large firms offer incentives that exceed $1,000 per year.



                                                   1
(RCT) conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).2 In conjunction
with the director of Campus Wellbeing Services, we developed a comprehensive workplace
wellness program that included an on-site biometric health screening, an online health risk
assessment, and a wide variety of wellness activities (e.g., smoking cessation, stress manage-
ment, and recreational classes). We invited 12,459 benefits-eligible university employees to
participate in our study.3 Study participants (N = 4, 834) assigned to the treatment group
(N = 3, 300) were invited to take paid time off to participate in our workplace wellness pro-
gram. Those who successfully completed the entire program earned rewards ranging from
from $50 to $350, with the amounts randomly assigned and communicated at the start of
the program. The remaining subjects (N = 1, 534) were assigned to a control group, which
was not permitted to participate. Our analysis combines individual-level data from online
surveys, university employment records, health insurance claims, campus gym visit records,
and administrative records from a popular community running event. We can therefore ex-
amine outcomes commonly studied by the prior literature (namely, medical spending and
employee absenteeism) as well as a large number of novel outcomes.
       In this paper, we provide the first set of findings from the Illinois Workplace Wellness
Study. We address three key research questions. First, how do financial incentives affect
the level of participation in wellness programs? Theory generally predicts that incentives
should increase participation, but the magnitude of this increase, which matters for under-
standing whether these programs shift costs onto non-participants, is an empirical question.
If employee participation is price elastic, then increasing the size of incentives reduces com-
pensation gaps between participants and non-participants; if it is price inelastic, then larger
incentives exacerbate those gaps. Second, what types of employees select into wellness pro-
   2

      UIUC administration provided access to university data and guidance to ensure our study conformed
with university regulations, but did not otherwise influence the design of our intervention. Each component
of the intervention, including the financial incentives paid to employees, was paid for entirely by our external
funders. Participation required electronically signing an informed consent form and completing a 15-minute
online survey. Our study was approved by the UIUC and University of Chicago Institutional Review Boards.



                                                       2
grams? The expected direction of the effect is ambiguous. For example, while healthy
employees may have low costs of participating in these programs, employees in poor health
may have the most to gain from participating. Third, what are the causal effects of work-
place wellness programs on medical spending, employee productivity, health behaviors, and
well-being after one year? Again, the expected signs of these effects are uncertain. For
example, medical spending could decrease if wellness programs improve health, but it could
increase if wellness programs and primary care are complements.
   In turn, we have three main sets of results. First, 56 percent of employees in our treatment
group completed the initial major component of our study, which included an on-campus
health screening. Completion depended on the size of the monetary incentive assigned to
an employee: increasing the screening completion reward from $0 to $100 boosted the com-
pletion rate by 12 percentage points, from 47 to 59, but further increasing the reward to
$200 only increased completion by 4 percentage points, to 63 percent. When combined with
our accounting records, these participation rates imply that the marginal cost of using fi-
nancial incentives to induce additional screening participation reaches $1,750 at the highest
screening incentive level ($200). This rapidly diminishing effect implies that—at least in our
setting—increasing a large financial incentive to even greater levels will transfer large sums
of money to workplace wellness program participants, but will have little effect on their com-
position. We also find that incentives tied to completing downstream wellness activities are
more cost-effective than up-front incentives tied to completing the initial health screening.
   Second, we find evidence of significant advantageous selection into our program: at base-
line, average annual medical spending among participants was $1,393 less than among non-
participants. A more detailed investigation reveals that this selection effect is concentrated
in the middle of the spending distribution: employees in the upper and lower tails of the
medical spending distribution were least likely to participate. Because spending is right-
skewed, the net result is that average, baseline spending among participants is lower than
that of non-participants. Our estimate is economically significant: considering only medical


                                              3
spending, if our program increased the share of participating (i.e. low-spending) workers
employed at the university by 4.5 percentage points or more, then our result implies that
this change in composition alone would offset the entire costs of our intervention.4 We also
find that participants were more likely to have visited campus recreational facilities prior
to our study, and were more likely to have participated in prior community running events.
Thus, a primary benefit of these programs to employers may be their potential to attract
and retain healthy workers with low medical spending.
    Third, we do not find significant effects of our intervention on 37 out of the 39 outcomes
we examine in the first year following random assignment.5 These 37 outcomes include all
our measures of medical spending, productivity, health behaviors, and self-reported health.
We investigate the effect on medical expenditures in detail, but fail to find significant effects
on different quantiles of the spending distribution or on any major subcategory of medical
expenditures (pharmaceutical drugs, office, or hospital). We also do not find any effect of
our intervention on the number of visits to campus gym facilities or on the probability of
participating in a popular annual community running event, two health behaviors that are
relatively simple for a motivated employee to change over the course of one year.
    These null estimates are meaningfully precise, particularly for two key outcomes of inter-
est in the literature: medical spending and absenteeism. Our 95 percent confidence intervals
rule out 83 percent of the effects reported in 115 prior studies, and the 99 percent confidence
intervals for the return on investment (ROI) of our intervention rule out the widely cited
medical spending and absenteeism ROI’s reported in the meta-analysis of Baicker, Cutler and
Song (2010). In addition, we show that our OLS (non-RCT) estimate for medical spending
is in line with estimates from prior observational studies, but is ruled out by the 95 percent
confidence interval of our IV (RCT) estimate. This demonstrates the value of employing an
   4
     Our causal effects analysis finds positive, albeit small and insignificant, effects of the intervention on
retention after one year. Our study, which focuses on an employee cohort, was not designed to examine
recruitment effects.
   5
     Participants were assigned to treatment and control groups in August 2016. Health screenings occurred
in August and September, and wellness activities ran from October 2016 to April 2017.

RCT design in this literature.
       We do find two robust, positive treatment effects from the intervention, both based on
follow-up survey responses.6 First, employees in the treatment group were more likely than
employees in the control group to report that they had ever received a health screening.
This indicates that the health screening component of our program did not merely crowd
out health screenings that otherwise would have occurred in the absence of our intervention.
Second, treatment group employees were much more likely to report that management places
a high priority on worker health and safety.
       Our study contributes to the economics literature on selection in labor and insurance
markets. It is well known that signaling (Spence, 1973) and screening (Rothschild and
Stiglitz, 1976; Wilson, 1977) can be effective responses to asymmetric information about
worker productivity (e.g. Mas-Colell et al., 1995, Chapter 13; Lazear and Oyer, 2012).
Because health insurance represents an increasingly large component of firm costs, prior
studies have also focused on asymmetric information about worker health status (Cutler
and Zeckhauser, 2000; Bhattacharya and Vogt, 2014). Our results suggest that workplace
wellness programs may be an effective way to encourage workers with low medical spending
to join or remain at firms, thereby presenting a novel example of a “self-selection” device
(Salop and Salop, 1976). In doing so, we complement prior studies that show compensation
packages may be used to attract specific types of workers (Lazear, 2000; Liu et al., 2017) and
provide an additional economic justification for the prevalent and growing use of non-wage
employment benefits (Oyer, 2008). Moreover, because enrollment into wellness programs is
often linked to discounts on insurance premiums, our work is related to a broader literature
on adverse selection in insurance markets (see Chiappori and Salanié, 2013, and Geruso and
Layton, 2017, for reviews).
       Our results also speak directly to the effects of workplace wellness on worker equity.
When incentives are linked to pooled expenses such as health insurance premiums, wellness
   6
    We address the multiple inference concern that arises when testing many hypotheses by controlling for
the family-wise error rate. We discuss our approach in greater detail in Section 3.4.


                                                   5
programs can have distributional consequences. A concern is that wellness programs may
effectively increase insurance premiums for low-income workers in poor health (Volpp et al.,
2011; Horwitz, Kelly and DiNardo, 2013; McIntyre et al., 2017). The results of our selection
analysis provide support for these concerns: non-participating employees are more likely
to be in the bottom quartile of the salary distribution, are less likely to engage in healthy
behaviors, and have higher medical spending, on average.
       We also contribute to the large health literature evaluating the causal effects of workplace
wellness programs. Our randomized controlled design allows us to establish reliable causal
effects by comparing outcomes across the treatment and control groups. By contrast, the
majority of existing studies rely on observational comparisons between participants and
non-participants (see Pelletier, 2011, and Chapman, 2012, for reviews). Reviews of the
literature have called for additional research on this topic and have also noted the potential for
publication bias to skew the set of existing results (Baicker, Cutler and Song, 2010; Pelletier,
2011; Abraham and White, 2017). To that end, our intervention, empirical specifications,
and outcome variables were pre-specified and publicly archived.7 In addition, the analyses in
this paper were independently replicated by a J-PAL affiliated researcher. A number of RCTs
have focused on components of workplace wellness, such as wellness activities (Volpp et al.,
2008; Charness and Gneezy, 2009; Royer, Stehr and Sydnor, 2015), health risk assessments
(Haisley et al., 2012), or particular biometric outcomes such as obesity (Meenan et al., 2010).
To our knowledge, no RCTs of comprehensive workplace wellness programs exist.
       The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a background on workplace
wellness, a description of our experimental design, and a summary of our datasets. Section
3 outlines our empirical methods, while Section 4 presents the results of our analysis and
discussion. Finally, section 5 offers concluding observations.

2.1    Background

Workplace wellness programs are employer-provided efforts to “enhance awareness, change
behavior, and create environments that support good health practices” (Aldana, 2001, p.
297). For the purposes of this study, “wellness programs” encompass three major types of
interventions: (1) biometric screenings, which provide clinical measures of health; (2) health
risk assessments (HRA), which identify potential health issues; and (3) wellness activities,
which promote a healthy lifestyle by encouraging behaviors such as smoking cessation, stress
management, or fitness. Best practice guides advise employers to let employees take paid
time off to participate in wellness programs, and to combine wellness program components
to maximize their effectiveness (Ryde et al., 2013). In particular, it is recommended that
information from a biometric screening and HRA inform the selection of wellness activities
(Soler et al., 2010). Among firms with 200 or more employees, the share offering a biometric
screening, HRA, or wellness activities in 2016 was 53 percent, 59 percent, and 83 percent,
respectively (Kaiser, 2016a). These benefits are often coupled with financial incentives for
participation, such as cash compensation or discounted health insurance premiums. A 2015
survey estimates an average cost of $693 per employee for these programs (Jaspen, 2015)
and a recent industry analysis estimates annual revenues of $8 billion (Kaiser, 2016b).
    A number of factors may explain the increasing popularity of workplace wellness pro-
grams. First, some employers believe that these programs reduce medical spending and
increase productivity. For example, Safeway famously attributed its low medical spending
to its wellness program (Burd, 2009) (although this evidence was subsequently disputed
(Reynolds, 2010)), and recent work suggests wellness programs may increase productiv-
ity (Gubler, Larkin and Pierce, 2017). Second, if employees have a high private value of
wellness-related benefits, then labor market competition may drive employers to offer well-
ness programs in order to attract and retain workers. Third, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)


                                              7
has relaxed constraints on the maximum size of financial incentives offered by employers.
Prior to the ACA, health-contingent incentives could not exceed 20 percent of the cost of
employee health coverage. The ACA increased that general limit to 30 percent, and raised
it to 50 percent for tobacco cessation programs (Cawley, 2014). The average premium for a
family insurance plan in 2017 was $18,764 (Kaiser, 2017), which means that many employers
are permitted to offer wellness rewards or penalties in excess of $5,000.
       Like other large employers, many universities also have workplace wellness programs. Of
the nearly 600 universities and liberal arts colleges ranked by U.S. News & World Report,
over two-thirds offer an employee wellness program.8 Prior to our intervention, UIUC’s cam-
pus wellness services were run by the University of Illinois Wellness Center, which has one
staff member. The Wellness Center coordinates smoking cessation resources for employees
and provides a limited number of wellness activities, many of which are not free. Impor-
tantly for our study, the campus did not offer any health screenings or HRAs and did not
provide monetary incentives to employees in exchange for participating in wellness activities.
Therefore, our intervention effectively represents the introduction of all major components
of a wellness program at this worksite.


2.2       The Illinois Workplace Wellness Study and iThrive

The Illinois Workplace Wellness Study is a large-scale randomized controlled trial designed
to investigate the effects of workplace wellness programs on employee medical spending,
productivity, and well-being. As part of the study, we designed a comprehensive wellness
program named “iThrive” at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We summarize
the program here and provide full details in Appendix D.
       Figure 1 illustrates the experimental design of our study. In July 2016 we invited 12,459
benefits-eligible university employees to enroll in our study by completing a 15-minute online
survey designed to measure baseline health and wellness. The invitations were sent by
   8
    Source: authors’ tabulation of data collected from university and colleges via website search and phone
inquiry.

                                                    8
postcard and email. Employees were offered a $30 Amazon.com gift card to complete the
survey, as well as a chance “to participate in a second part of the research study.” Over the
course of three weeks, 4,834 employees completed this baseline survey. Study participants,
whom we define as anybody completing the 15-minute baseline survey, were then randomly
assigned to either a control group (N =1,534), or one of six treatment groups (N =3,300).
Members of the control group were notified that they may be contacted for follow-up surveys
in the future, and further contact with this group was thereafter minimized. Members of the
treatment group were offered the opportunity to participate in iThrive.
   The first step of iThrive included a biometric health screening and an online HRA. For a
period of 5 weeks in August and September 2016, participants had an opportunity to schedule
a screening at one of many locations on campus. They had to make an appointment in
advance and fast for 12 hours prior to the screening, where a clinician measured their height,
weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure. The clinician also performed a fingerstick
test to measure blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels. Finally, participants met
with a health coach, who explained their health measurements to them. The entire screening
process lasted about 20 minutes. A few days later, participants received an email invitation
to complete an online HRA designed to assess their lifestyle habits. Upon completion of
the HRA, participants were given a score card incorporating the results of their biometric
screening and providing them with recommended areas of improvement. The HRA was
available as early as one week after the beginning of biometric screening and remained open
until two weeks after the last biometric screening. Only participants who completed both
the screening and HRA were eligible to participate in wellness activities.
   The second step of iThrive consisted of wellness activities. Eligible participants were
offered the opportunity to participate in one of several activities in the fall and then again
in the spring. Eligibility to participate in spring wellness activities was not contingent on
enrollment or completion of fall activities. In the fall, activities included in-person classes on
chronic disease management, weight management, tai chi, physical fitness, financial wellness,


                                                9
and healthy workplace habits; a tobacco cessation hotline; and an online, self-paced wellness
challenge. A similar set of activities was offered in the spring. Classes ranged from 6 to 12
weeks in length, and “completion” of a class was generally defined as attending at least three-
fourths of the sessions. Participants were given two weeks to enroll in wellness activities and
were encouraged to incorporate their HRA feedback when choosing a class.
   Study participants were offered monetary rewards for completing each step of the iThrive
program, and these rewards varied depending on the treatment group to which an individual
was assigned. Individuals in treatment groups labeled A, B, and C were offered a screening
incentive of $0, $100, or $200, respectively, for completing the biometric screening and the
HRA. Treatment groups were further split based on an activity incentive of either $25 or $75
for each wellness activity completed (up to one per semester). Thus, there were six treatment
groups in total: A25, A75, B25, B75, C25, and C75 (see Figure 1). The total reward for
completing all iThrive components—the screening, the HRA, and a wellness activity during
both the fall and spring—ranged from $50 to $350, depending on the treatment group.
These amounts are in line with typical wellness programs (Mattke, Schnyer and Van Busum,
2012). The probability of assignment to each group was equal across participants, and
randomization was stratified by employee class (faculty, staff, or civil service), sex, age,
quartile of annual salary, and race (see Appendix D.1.2 for additional randomization details).
We privately informed participants about their screening and wellness activity rewards at
the start of the intervention (August 2016), and did not disclose information about rewards
offered to others.
   To help guide participants through iThrive, we developed a secure online website that
granted access to information about the program. At the onset of iThrive in August, the
website instructed participants to schedule a biometric screening and then to take the online
HRA. Beginning in October, and then again in January, the website provided a menu of
wellness activities and online registration forms for those activities. The website also provided
information on a participant’s current progress and rewards earned to date, answers to


                                               10
frequently asked questions, and contact information for participant support.


2.3     Data

Our analysis employs a combination of self-reported survey data and a number of admin-
istrative data sources, all merged together at the individual level. We briefly describe each
data source below. Appendix Table A.7 provides a definition for each variable used in our
analysis. Additional details are provided in Appendix D.2.


2.3.1   University Administrative Data

We obtained university administrative data on 12,486 employees who as of June 2016 were
(1) working at the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois and (2) eligible for
part-time or full-time employee benefits from the Illinois Department of Central Management
Services. We excluded 27 people who did not have a university email address or who were
substantially involved with our study, yielding a final sample size of 12,459 employees.
   The initial denominator file includes the employee’s name, university identification num-
ber, contact information (email and home mailing address), date of birth, sex, race, salary,
and employee class (faculty, academic staff, or civil service). We used the email and home
mailing address to invite employees to participate in our study, and we used the sex, race,
date of birth, salary, and employee class variables to generate the strata for random sampling.
   A second file includes employment history information as of July 31, 2017. This provides
two employee productivity outcomes that are measured over the first 12 months of our study:
job termination and salary raises. All employees in our sample were eligible for a mid-year,
merit-based salary increase that occurred in February 2017.
   A third file provides data on sick leave. The number of sick days taken is available at the
monthly level for Civil Service employees. For academic faculty and staff, the number of sick
days taken is available biannually, on August 15 and May 15. We first calculate the total
number of sick days taken during our pre-period (August 2015 - July 2016) and post-period


                                              11
(August 2016 - July 2017) for each employee. We then normalize by the number of days
employed to make this measure comparable across employees. All specifications that include
sick days taken as an outcome variable are weighted by the number of days employed.
      A fourth file contains data on exact attendance dates for the university’s gym and recre-
ational facilities. Entering one of these facilities requires swiping an ID card, which creates
a database record linked to the individual’s university ID. We calculate the total number of
visits per year for the pre-period (August 2015 - July 2016) and the post-period (August
2016 - July 2017).


2.3.2      Online Survey Data

As described in Section 2.2, all study participants took a 15-minute online survey in July
2016 as a condition of enrollment in the study. The survey covered topics including health
status, health care utilization, job satisfaction, and productivity.
      Our survey software recorded that, out of the 12,459 employees invited to take the survey,
7,468 employees clicked on the link to the survey, 4,918 employees began the survey, and
4,834 employees completed the survey. Although participants were allowed to skip questions,
response rates for the survey were very high: 4,822 out of 4,834 participants (99.7 percent)
answered every one of the questions used in our analysis. To measure the reliability of the
survey responses, we included a question about age at the end of the survey and compared
participants’ self-reported ages with the ages available in the university’s administrative data.
Of the 4,830 participants who reported an age, only 24 (<0.5 percent) reported a value that
differed from the university’s administrative records by more than one year.
      All study participants were also invited via postcard and email to take a one-year, follow-
up survey online in July 2017.9 In addition to the questions asked on the baseline survey,
the follow-up survey included additional questions on productivity, presenteeism, and job
satisfaction. A total of 3,568 participants (74 percent) successfully completed the 2017
  9
      Invitations to the follow-up survey were sent regardless of current employment status with the university.

follow-up survey. The completion rates for the control and treatment groups were 75.4
and 73.1 percent, respectively. This difference in completion rates is marginally significant
(p = 0.079). The full texts of our 2016 baseline and 2017 follow-up online surveys are
available on the study website and as part of our supplementary materials.10


2.3.3    Health Insurance Claims Data

We obtained health insurance claims data for the time period January 1, 2015, through July
31, 2017, for the 67 percent of employees who subscribe to the university’s most popular
insurance plan. We use the total payment due to the provider to calculate average total
monthly spending. We also use the place of service code on the claim to break total spending
into four major subcategories: pharmaceutical, office, hospital, and other.11 Our spending
measures include all payments from the insurer to providers, as well as any deductibles or
copays paid by individuals. We merged these data at the individual level with our other
datasets for those employees who consented to participate in our study. In addition, we
have access to anonymized panel data on health claims for non-participating employees who
subscribe to this same plan.
    Employees choose their health plan annually during the month of May, and plan changes
become effective July 1. Participants were informed of their treatment assignment on August
9, 2016. We therefore define baseline medical spending to include all allowed amounts with
dates of service corresponding to the 13-month time period July 1, 2015, through July 31,
2016. We define spending in the post period to correspond to the 12-month time period
August 1, 2016, through July 31, 2017.
    In our health claims sample, 11 percent of employees are not continuously enrolled
   10
      Interactive examples of the surveys administered for the study are available at http://www.nber.org/
workplacewellness.
   11
      Pharmaceutical and office-based spending each have their own place of service codes. Hospital spending
is summed across the following four codes: “Off Campus - Outpatient Hospital,” “Inpatient Hospital,” “On
Campus - Outpatient Hospital,” and “Emergency Room - Hospital.” All remaining codes are assigned to
“other” spending, which serves as the omitted category in our analysis. We did not pre-specify subcategories
of spending in our pre-analysis plan.



                                                    13
throughout the 13-month pre-period, and 9 percent are not continuously enrolled through-
out the 12-month post-period. This is primarily due to job turnover. Because measures of
average monthly spending are less noisy for employees with more months of claims data, we
weight our regressions by the number of covered months whenever the outcome variable is
average spending.


2.3.4   Illinois Marathon/10K/5K Data

The Illinois Marathon is a running event held annually in Champaign, Illinois. The individual
races offered include a marathon, a half marathon, a 5K, and a 10K. When registering for
a race, a participant must provide her name, age, sex, and hometown. That information,
along with the results of the race, are published online after the races have concluded. We
downloaded those data for the 2014-2017 races and matched it to individuals in our dataset
using name, age, sex, and hometown.


2.4     Baseline Summary Statistics and Balance Tests

Tables 1a and 1b provide summary statistics at baseline for the employees in our sample.
Columns (2)-(8) report means for those who were assigned to our control group and to each
of our six treatment groups. Column (1) additionally reports summary means for employees
not enrolled in our study, where available. The variables are grouped into four panels, based
on the source and type of data. Panel A presents means of the university administrative
data variables used in our stratified randomization, Panel B presents means of variables
from our 2016 baseline survey, Panel C presents means of medical spending variables from
our health insurance claims data for the July 2015 - July 2016 time period, and Panel D
presents baseline means of administrative data variables used to measure health behaviors
and employee productivity.
   Our experimental framework relies on the random assignment of study participants to the
treatment and control groups. To evaluate the validity of this assumption, we first compare


                                             14
the means of the variables displayed in Tables 1a and 1b. For each row, we regress the study
variable on seven indicators, one for the control and each of six treatment groups, and test
for the joint equality of the seven coefficients. Column (9) reports the p-value from that
test. We also estimate a seemingly unrelated regression model to test whether the variables
listed within each panel predict enrollment into either the control or any of the six treatment
groups. The bottom of Tables 1a and 1b reports the p-value from jointly testing whether all
regression coefficients across all seven groups are equal to 0, within each panel.
   By construction, we find no evidence of differences in means among the variables used for
stratification (Panel A): all p-values in column (9) are greater than 0.97. Among all other
variables listed in Panels B, C, and D, we find statistically significant differences at a 10
percent or lower level in 2 out of 34 cases, which is approximately what one would expect
from random chance. This is confirmed by our joint balance tests, which fail to reject the
null hypothesis that the variables in Panel B (p = 0.165), Panel C (p = 0.220), or Panel D
(p = 0.437) are not predictive of group assignment.
   A unique feature of our study is our ability to characterize the employees who declined
to participate in our experiment. We investigate the extent of this selection into our study
by comparing means for study participants, reported in columns (2)-(9) of Tables 1a and
1b, to the means for non-participating employees who did not complete our baseline survey,
reported in column (1). Study participants are younger, are more likely to be female, are
more likely to be white, have lower incomes on average, are more likely to be administrative
staff, and are less likely to be faculty. They also have lower baseline medical spending, are
more likely to have participated in one of the Illinois Marathon/10K/5K running events, and
have a higher rate of monthly gym visits. These selection effects mirror the ones we report
below in Section 4.2, suggesting that the factors governing the decision to participate in a
wellness program are similar to the ones driving the decision to participate in our study.




                                              15
3     Empirical Methods

3.1    Participation

We begin by estimating the effect of our wellness program incentives on participation out-
comes among employees randomly assigned to a treatment group. We exclude members of
the control group, for whom participation is mechanically zero. First, we jointly estimate
the average effects of being assigned a positive screening incentive (groups B and C) or being
assigned the $75 wellness activity incentive using the following ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression:
                             Pi = α + βBC Ti,BC + β75 Ti,75 + ΓXi + εi .                    (1)

Here, Ti,BC is an indicator for membership in treatment groups B or C, and Ti,75 is an
indicator for receiving the $75 wellness activity incentive. The omitted category includes
members of treatment group A with a $25 wellness activity incentive.
    Second, we augment equation (1) to estimate participation effects for groups B and C
separately, as follows:


                          Pi = α + βB Ti,B + βC Ti,C + β75 Ti,75 + ΓXi + εi .               (2)


Here, the independent variables Ti,B and Ti,C are indicators for membership in treatment
groups B and C, respectively.
    In equations (1) and (2), the outcome Pi is an indicator for one of the following three
participation outcomes: completing a screening and HRA, completing a fall wellness activity,
or completing a spring wellness activity. The coefficients of interest—βBC , βB , βC , and β75 —
represent the causal effect of increased incentives on participation. We estimate results with
and without the inclusion of strata fixed effects, Xi . The identifying assumption requires
that treatment be uncorrelated with unobservable determinants of participation, εi , which
is delivered by virtue of random assignment. This assumption is supported by the balance


                                                  16
tests across the treatment groups, reported in Section 2.4.


3.2    Selection

Next, we characterize the types of employees who are most likely to participate in or complete
the various stages of our wellness program. We pool data across the six treatment groups
and estimate the following OLS regression:


                                      Xi = α + θPi + εi .                                  (3)


The left-hand side variable, Xi , is a pre-determined covariate. The regressor, Pi , is an
indicator for one of the following three participation outcomes: completing a screening and
HRA, completing a fall wellness activity, or completing a spring wellness activity. The
coefficient θ represents the correlation between participation and the baseline characteristic,
Xi ; it should not be interpreted causally.


3.3    Causal Effects

In our final analysis, we estimate the one-year effect of our wellness intervention on a number
of outcomes, including medical spending from health claims data, employment and produc-
tivity variables measured in administrative and survey data, health behaviors measured in
administrative data, and self-reported health status and behaviors. We compare outcomes
in the treatment group to those in the control group using the following specification:


                                   Yi = α + γTi + ΓXi + εi .                               (4)


Here, Ti is an indicator variable for membership in one of our six treatment groups, and Yi is
an outcome of interest. We estimate equation (4) with and without the inclusion of controls,
Xi . In one control specification, Xi includes baseline strata fixed effects. One could also



                                              17
include a much broader set of controls, but doing so comes at the cost of reduced degrees
of freedom. Thus, our second control specification implements the Lasso double-selection
method of Belloni, Chernozhukov and Hansen (2014), as outlined by Urminsky, Hansen and
Chernozhukov (2016), which selects controls that predict either the dependent variable or
the focal independent variable.12 The set of potential controls includes baseline values of
the outcome variable, strata variables, the baseline survey variables reported in Table 1a,
and all pairwise interactions. We then estimate a regression that includes only the controls
selected by double-Lasso. In our tables, we follow convention and refer to this third control
strategy as “post-Lasso.” As before, our main identifying assumption requires treatment
to be uncorrelated with unobserved determinants of the outcome. The key parameter of
interest, γ, is the intent-to-treat effect of our intervention on the outcome Yi .


3.4       Inference

We report conventional robust standard errors in all tables. We do not cluster standard errors
because randomization was performed at the individual level (Abadie et al., 2017). Because
we estimate equations (3) and (4) for many different outcome variables, the probability that
we incorrectly reject at least one null hypothesis is greater than the significance level used
for each individual hypothesis test. When appropriate, we address this multiple inference
concern by controlling for the family-wise error rate, i.e. the probability of incorrectly
rejecting one or more null hypotheses belonging to a family of hypotheses.
       To control for the family-wise error rate, we first define seven mutually exclusive fam-
ilies of hypotheses that encompass all of our outcome variables. Each family contains all
variables belonging to one of our four outcome domains (strata variables, medical spending,
employment/productivity, or health) and one of our two types of data (administrative or
  12
    No control variable will be predictive of a randomly assigned variable, in expectation. Thus, when
implementing the double-selection method with randomly assigned treatment status as the focal independent
variable, we only select controls that are predictive of the dependent variable. When implementing Lasso,
we use the penalty parameter that minimizes 10-fold cross-validated mean squared error.




                                                   18
survey).13 When testing multiple hypotheses using equations (3) and (4), we then calculate
family-wise adjusted p-values based on 10,000 bootstraps of the free step-down procedure of
Westfall and Young (1993).14



4          Results

4.1         Participation

We begin by summarizing the effect of incentives on participation. Figure 2 reports that
56.0 percent of participants in the treatment group completed both the health screening and
online HRA, which together comprise the first major step of our workplace wellness program.
These participants earned their assigned rewards ($0, $100, or $200), and were subsequently
allowed to sign up for wellness activities; the remaining 44 percent were excluded. In the fall,
39.5 percent of the treatment group registered for an activity, and 27.4 percent completed
enough of the activity to earn their assigned activity reward. Registration and completion
rates were slightly lower for the spring wellness activity. By way of comparison, a survey
of employers with workplace wellness programs found that less than 50 percent of their
eligible employees complete health screenings, and that most firms have wellness activity
participation rates of less than 20 percent (Mattke et al., 2013).
         Figure 3 reports participation rates for different levels of incentives, first for the screening
and HRA stage and then for the fall activities.15 The first set of three dark bars in Figure 3a
show how screening participation varies as a function of the screening incentive. Increasing
the screening incentive from $0 to $100 boosts participation from 46.9 percent to 58.5 percent.
    13
      One could assign all variables to a single family of hypotheses. This is unappealing, however, because
it assigns equal importance to all outcomes when in fact some outcomes (e.g., total medical spending) are
of much greater interest than others. Instead, our approach groups together variables that measure related
outcomes and that originate from similar data sources.
   14
      We have made our generalized Stata code module publicly available for other interested researchers
to use. It can be installed by typing “ssc install wyoung, replace” at the Stata prompt. We provide
additional documentation of this multiple testing adjustment in Appendix C.
   15
      We report the results for spring activities, which are very similar to those for the fall, in Appendix A.




                                                      19
This difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. Increasing the screening
incentive to $200 increases turnout further, to 62.5 percent. The second set of two dark bars
in Figure 3a shows screening participation as a function of the wellness activity incentives.
Increasing the activity incentive from $25 to $75 increases turnout from 53.6 percent to 58.4
percent, indicating that at least some participants were forward looking: they understood
that they needed to first complete the screening and HRA in order to later be eligible to
sign up for a wellness activity.
   Table 2 provides formal statistical testing of the patterns described above for health
screening participation. Panel A reports estimates of equations (1) and (2), using the com-
pletion of the screening and HRA as the outcome variable. Columns (1) and (2) pool together
groups B and C, while columns (3) and (4) estimate the effects separately for groups B and
C. The omitted group in each specification is group A25: members who were assigned a $0
screening incentive and a $25 wellness incentive.
   As reported in Panel A, the baseline participation rate for the screening and HRA in the
omitted group is 44.5 percent (see column (1) or (3)). Column (3) of Panel A shows that the
screening/HRA completion rates of treatment groups B and C are larger than those of group
A by 11.6 (p < 0.001) and 15.6 (p < 0.001) percentage points, respectively. In addition, the
difference between group B and C is marginally significant (p = 0.05). We also estimate that
a $75 wellness incentive increases screening and HRA completion by 4.9 percentage points
relative to a $25 wellness incentive (p < 0.01). Comparing columns (1) and (3) to columns
(2) and (4), respectively, shows that controlling for baseline stratification variables has very
little effect on the point estimates.
   We find consistently positive, but marginally diminishing, effects of monetary rewards
on screening and HRA participation. The optimal reward amount depends on the marginal
cost and marginal benefit associated with additional participation. Using our participation
results, it is straightforward to provide some basic estimates of marginal cost using data on
the field costs of our study.


                                              20
       The lightly shaded bars in Figure 3a report the realized average variable costs for treat-
ment groups with different monetary rewards. The average variable costs are equal to the
average monetary incentives paid to the group plus the costs of providing the health screen-
ing, the HRA, and the wellness activities.16 We calculate the marginal cost of the additional
participation induced by each reward by dividing the increase in average cost for each group
by the corresponding increase in participation.17 The results of those calculations are plotted
in Figure 3c. The marginal cost is increasing in the share of employees participating and is
largest (at $1,750) for group C, whose members received $200 if they completed a screening
and HRA. All else equal, this estimate implies that the optimal screening incentive is less
than $200 if the marginal benefit associated with additional participation in group C is less
than $1,750. Interestingly, the marginal cost of using activity incentives to increase screening
participation lines up closely with that of the screening incentives.
       We repeat this exercise for fall activity participation in Figures 3b and 3d. Here, a
different pattern emerges. Screening incentives have only a small effect on fall activity
completion, and, as a result, generate a relatively steep marginal cost curve. On the other
hand, wellness activity incentives have a sizeable effect on activity completion, and exhibit
a much flatter marginal cost.18
       Panels B and C of Table 2 report that the screening incentives for groups B and C
increase the completion probability for the fall or spring wellness activity by about 4-5
percentage points (0.004 ≤ p ≤ 0.03). Finally, the $75 wellness incentive, as compared to
a $25 incentive, generates a 12 percentage point increase in the likelihood of completing a
fall or spring wellness activity (p < 0.001). This last effect is sizeable when compared to a
  16
     Our variable cost measure does not account for paid time off or the fixed costs of managing the iThrive
intervention. The health screening and HRA cost $78.22 per participant. This includes the costs of pur-
chasing a fingerstick blood test, hiring nurses to administer the test, and licensing the HRA. The wellness
activities cost an average of $26.07 per enrollee per semester. Employees who declined to participate in the
health screening are assigned a variable cost of $0.
  17
     For the $25 activity incentive and $0 screening incentive groups, the marginal cost is calculated relative
to a baseline of 0 percent participation and $0 average variable cost. Thus, the marginal cost for these two
groups is simply the group’s average variable cost divided by its participation rate.
  18
     We find qualitatively similar patterns for spring activity participation, which we present in Appendix
Figure A.1.


                                                      21
baseline completion rate of 18.2 percent in the fall and 13.7 percent in the spring for group
A (see column (1) or (3)).
   Overall, we find that financial incentives have a significant, but diminishing, effect on
health screening participation. This suggests that when screening incentives are large, fur-
ther increases in reward sizes will result in larger transfers to existing participants but little
change in total participation. By contrast, we find that screening incentives have little ef-
fect on subsequent wellness activity participation, while wellness incentives have a relatively
large effect. For this reason, the back-loaded wellness activity incentives are arguably more
cost-effective than the upfront screening incentives: they are about as effective as screen-
ing incentives in increasing screening participation—as evidenced by similar marginal cost
curves (Figure 3c)—and at the same time are more efficient at increasing wellness activity
completion—i.e., they have a flatter marginal cost curve (Figure 3d).


4.2     Selection

4.2.1   Average Selection

Next, we characterize the types of workers most likely to participate in our wellness program.
We focus on medical spending and health behaviors, which are primary targets of wellness
programs, and on salary, which is useful for understanding the redistribution effects of these
programs. Selection results for the full set of pre-specified observables are presented in
Appendix Tables A.1a through A.1d.
   Table 3 reports our main selection results, as estimated by equation (3). We test for
selection at three different, sequential points in the study: completing the health screening
and HRA; completing a fall wellness activity; and completing a spring wellness activity.
Column (1) reports the mean of the selection variable of interest for employees assigned to
one of our study’s treatment groups. Columns (3)-(5) report the difference in means between
those employees who successfully completed the participation outcome of interest and those
who did not. We also report family-wise p-values in brackets that account for the number of

                                               22
selection variables in each “family.” 19
    Column (3) of the first row of Table 3 reports that employees who completed the screening
and HRA spent, on average, $116.1 per month less on health care in the 13 months prior to
our study than employees who did not participate. This pattern of advantageous selection
is strongly significant using conventional inference (p = 0.026), and remains marginally
significant even after adjusting for the five outcomes in this family (family-wise p = 0.080).
The magnitude is also economically significant, representing about 25 percent of the $479
in average monthly spending (column (1)). Columns (4) and (5) present further evidence
of advantageous selection into the fall and spring wellness activities, although in these cases
the magnitude of selection falls by half and becomes statistically insignificant.
    In contrast, the second row of Table 3 reports that employees participating in our well-
ness program were more likely to have non-zero medical spending at baseline than non-
participants, by about 5 percentage points (family-wise p ≤ 0.021), for all three participa-
tion outcomes. When combined with our results from the first row on average spending, this
suggests that our wellness program is more attractive to employees with moderate spending
than to employees in either tail of the spending distribution.
    We investigate these results further in Figure 4, which displays the empirical distributions
of prior spending for those employees who participated in screening and for those who did
not. We perform two tests of the equality of the spending distributions across these two sam-
ples: Pearson’s chi-squared test and the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.20 Both
tests strongly reject the null hypothesis that these two samples were drawn from the same
distribution (Chi-squared p < 0.001; Kolmogorov-Smirnov p = 0.007). More specifically,
Figure 4 reveals a “tail-trimming” effect: participating (screened) employees are less likely to
be high spenders (> $2, 338 per month), but they are also less likely to be low spenders ($0
  19
     The seven families of outcome variables are defined in Section 3.4. The family-wise p-values reported in
Table 3 account for all the variables in the family, including ones that are not reported in the main text. An
expanded version of Table 3 that reports estimates for all pre-specified outcomes is provided in Appendix
Tables A.1a through A.1d.
  20
     These tests were not specified in our pre-analysis plan.



                                                     23
per month). Because medical spending is highly skewed to the right, the overall effect on
the mean among participants is negative, which explains the advantageous selection effect
reported in the first row of Table 3.
   Panel B of Table 3 reports selection estimates for income. The first row reports that the
average annual salary of participants is lower than that of non-participants, significantly so
for the fall and spring wellness activities (family-wise p ≤ 0.012). This initially suggests that
participants are disproportionately lower-income. Yet, the second row of Panel B reports
that the share of screening participants in the first (bottom) quartile of income is actually
6.9 percentage points lower than the share among non-participants (family-wise p < 0.001).
Columns (4) and (5) also report negative, albeit smaller, selection effects for the fall and
spring wellness activities. We again delve deeper by comparing the entire empirical distribu-
tions of income for participants and non-participants in Figure 5. We can reject that these
two samples came from the same distribution (p ≤ 0.02). As in Figure 4, we again find a
tail-trimming effect: participating employees are less likely to come from either tail of the
income distribution.
   Lastly, we test for differences in baseline health behaviors as measured by our adminis-
trative data variables. The first row of Panel C in Table 3 reports that the share of screening
participants who had previously participated in one of the IL Marathon/5K/10K running
events is 8.9 percentage points larger than the share among non-participants (family-wise
p < 0.001), a sizeable difference that represents over 75 percent of the mean participation
rate of 11.8 percent (column (1)). This selection effect is even larger for the fall and spring
wellness activities. The second row of Panel C reports that participants also visited the
campus gym facilities more frequently, although these selection effects are only statistically
significant for screening and HRA completion (family-wise p = 0.013).
   Prior studies have raised concerns that the benefits of wellness programs accrue primarily
to higher-income employees with lower health risks (Horwitz, Kelly and DiNardo, 2013). Our
results are broadly consistent with these concerns: participating employees are less likely to


                                               24
have very high medical spending, less likely to be in the bottom quartile of income, and more
likely to engage in healthy activities such as running or visiting the gym. At the same time,
participating employees are also less likely to have very low medical spending or have very
high incomes, which suggests a more nuanced story.


4.2.2    Marginal Selection

Our study design allows us to characterize not only how participants differ from non-
participants on average, but also how the marginal participant varies as we increase incen-
tives. As reported previously in Table 3, screening participants had lower baseline medical
spending than non-participants, on average. Figure 6a (orange bars) shows how this pattern
of selection varies by screening incentive size. For example, participants in the treatment
groups with $100 and $200 screening incentives spent, on average, $79 more per month
(p = 0.06) than participants in the treatment group with a $0 screening incentive. At low
levels of screening incentives, wellness programs attract below-average spenders, but as in-
centive levels increase, the marginal participants have spending levels that are higher than
the average participant. Thus, over the range of incentives we offer, increasing the size of
the screening incentive reduces the average amount of selection.
   By contrast, Figure 6a (blue bars) illustrates a different pattern for wellness activity in-
centives: as we increase activity incentives, the marginal participant has significantly lower
spending (p = 0.03). While we have less power for other outcomes, we find similar selection
patterns when using pre-intervention health behaviors as a proxy for health status.21 As we
increase screening incentives, the marginal participant is potentially less likely to have par-
ticipated in a prior marathon or have used the campus gym. Conversely, increasing wellness
activity incentives potentially draws in marginal participants with a higher propensity for
gym use. Thus, the selection patterns are potentially heterogeneous across type of incentive.
As was the case when we examined the marginal cost of increasing participation, the type
  21
     Marginal selection patterns with respect to income and non-zero health spending are provided in Ap-
pendix A.


                                                  25
of incentive matters when examining selection into wellness programs.


4.2.3      Health Care Cost-Savings via Selection

The selection patterns we have uncovered may provide, by themselves, a potential motive for
firms to offer wellness programs. We have shown that wellness participants have lower med-
ical spending on average than non-participants. If wellness programs differentially increase
the recruitment or retention of these types of employees, then the accompanying reduction
in health care costs will save firms money.22
       A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation demonstrates this possibility. In our setting,
39 percent (= 4, 834/12, 459) of eligible employees enrolled into our study, and 56 percent of
the treatment group completed a screening and health assessment (Figure 2). Participating
employees spent on average $132.7 per month less than non-participants in the post-period
(Table 5, column 4), which translates into an annual spending difference of $1,592. When
combined with average program costs of $271 per participant, this implies that the employer
would need to increase the share of employees who are similar to wellness participants by
4.5 (= 0.39 × 0.56 × 271/(1592 − 271)) percentage points in order for the resulting reduction
in medical spending to offset the entire cost of the wellness program. To be clear, this
calculation does not imply that adoption of workplace wellness programs is socially beneficial.
But, it does provide a profit-maximizing rationale for firms to adopt wellness programs, even
in the absence of any direct effects on health, productivity, or medical spending.


4.3       Causal Effects

4.3.1      Intent-to-Treat

Finally, we estimate the causal, intent-to-treat (ITT) effect of our intervention on three
domains of outcomes: medical spending, employment and productivity, and health behaviors.
  22
    Wellness participants differ from non-participants along other dimensions as well (e.g., health behaviors).
Because it is difficult in many cases to sign, let alone quantify, a firm’s preferences over these other dimensions,
we focus our cost-savings discussion on the medical spending consequences.


                                                        26
Table 4 reports estimates of equation (4) for all administratively measured outcomes, as well
as a select set of outcomes from the one-year follow-up survey. An expanded version of this
table reporting 39 administrative and survey outcomes is provided in Appendix Tables A.2a
through A.2f.
   We report ITT estimates using three specifications. The first includes no control variables.
Our second specification includes fixed effects for the 69 strata used for stratified random
assignment at baseline. Because the probability of treatment assignment was constant across
strata, these controls are included not to reduce bias, but to improve the precision of the
treatment effect estimates (Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009). Our third specification includes a
set of baseline outcomes and covariates chosen via Lasso, as described in Section 3.3.


Medical spending We do not detect statistically significant effects of treatment on av-
erage medical spending over the first 12 months (August 2016 - July 2017) of the wellness
intervention in any of our specifications. Column (2) of the first row of Table 4 shows that
the difference in average spending between treatment and control was only $4.1 per month.
The point estimate increases slightly when using either of our control strategies (columns
(3) or (4)) but remains small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. The post-Lasso
specification generates a significant improvement in precision, with a standard error about 25
percent smaller than that of either the no-control or strata fixed effects specifications. In the
rest of Panel A, we continue to find small and insignificant results for different subcategories
of spending, as well as the probability of any spending over this 12-month period.
   Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 7—which reproduce the basic results for total and non-zero
spending presented in Panel A, column (2) of Table 4—reveal no significant differences in
average spending or probability of any spending between treatment and control. However,
these results do not rule out mean-preserving treatment effects that alter other moments of
the distribution. We investigate this possibility in Panel (c) of Figure 7, which displays the
empirical distributions of spending for the treatment and control groups, but fail to observe



                                               27
any clear differences between these two groups. This is confirmed formally by Pearson’s chi-
squared test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which both fail to reject the null hypothesis
that the control and treatment samples were drawn from the same spending distribution
(p = 0.867 and p = 0.458, respectively).
   Finally, we investigate the potential for spending treatment effects to vary by treatment
arm. Those results, which are available in Appendix Tables A.4a and A.4b, show no evidence
of meaningful differences in spending effects across treatment arms.


Employment and productivity Next, we estimate the effect of treatment on a variety
of employment and productivity outcomes. As reported in Panel B of Table 4, we do not
detect statistically significant effects on any of the three outcomes that are administratively
measured: annual salary, the probability of job termination after 12 months of the well-
ness intervention, and sick leave taken. Turning to variables measured during the one-year
follow-up survey, we find no statistically significant effects on most self-reported employment
and productivity measures, including being happier at work than last year or feeling very
productive at work. The only exception is that individuals in the treatment group are 5.7
percentage points (7.2 percent) more likely (family-wise p < .001) to believe that manage-
ment places a priority on health and safety (column (2), Table 4). Appendix Tables A.2c
and A.2d report ITT estimates for all pre-specified administrative and survey productivity
measures.


Health behaviors Finally, we investigate health behaviors, which may respond more
quickly to a wellness intervention than medical spending and productivity outcomes. Our
main results are reported in Panel C of Table 4. We find very small and statistically insignif-
icant effects of treatment assignment on participation in any running event of the April 2017
Illinois Marathon (i.e. 5K, 10K, and half/full marathons). Similarly, we do not find mean-
ingful effects on the average number of days per month that an employee visits a campus
recreation facility. However, we do find that individuals in the treatment group are nearly 4

                                              28
percentage points more likely (p < .01) to report having a previous health screening. This
provides evidence that our program provided biometric health information to a significant
number of employees who report not previously being screened, and did not completely
crowd out screenings that would have otherwise occurred within the first year of our study.


Discussion Across all 39 outcome variables we examine, we only find two statistically
significant effects of our intervention: an increase in the number of employees who ever
received a health screening, and an increase in the number who believe that management
places a priority on health and safety.23 The next section addresses the precision of our
estimates by quantifying what effects we can rule out. But first, we mention two caveats.
       First, our post-period only includes one year of data. While we do not find significant
effects for most of the outcomes we examine, it is possible that longer-run effects may emerge
in the second or third year following the intervention. Second, our analysis assumes that
the control group was unaffected by the intervention. The research team’s contact with the
control group was confined to the communication procedures employed for the 2016 and 2017
online surveys. Although we never shared details of the intervention with the control group,
some of them may have learned about it from their colleagues. To evaluate how often this
occurred, we asked study participants on the 2017 follow-up survey whether they ever talked
about the iThrive workplace wellness program with any of their coworkers. Only 3 percent
of the control group responded affirmatively, compared to 44 percent of the treatment group.


4.3.2      Comparison to Prior Studies

We now compare our estimates to the prior literature, which has focused on medical spending
and absenteeism. This exercise employs a spending estimate derived from a data sample that
winsorizes (top-codes) medical spending at the one percent level (see Column 3 of Table 6).
We do this to reduce the influence of a small number of extreme outliers on the precision of
  23
    We show in the appendix that these two effects are driven by the health screening component of our
intervention rather than the wellness activity component.



                                                 29
our estimate, as has been done in prior studies (e.g. Clemens and Gottlieb, 2014).24
       Figure 8 illustrates how our estimates compare to the prior literature.25 The top-left
figure in Panel (a) plots the distribution of the intent-to-treat (ITT) point estimates for
medical spending from 22 prior workplace wellness studies. The figure also plots our ITT
point estimate for total medical spending from Table 4, and shows that our 95-percent
confidence interval rules out 20 of these 22 estimates. For ease of comparison, all effects are
expressed as percent changes. The bottom-left figure in Panel (a) plots the distribution of
treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates for health spending from 33 prior studies, along
with the IV estimates from our study. In this case, our 95-percent confidence interval rules
out 23 of the 33 studies. Overall, our confidence intervals rule out 43 of 55 (78 percent) prior
ITT and TOT point estimates for health spending.26 The two figures in Panel (b) repeat
this exercise for absenteeism, and show that our estimates rule out 53 of 60 (88 percent)
prior ITT and TOT point estimates for absenteeism. Across both sets of outcomes, we rule
out 96 of 115 (83 percent) prior estimates.
       We can also combine our spending and absenteeism estimates with our cost data to
calculate a return on investment (ROI) for workplace wellness programs. The 99 percent
confidence intervals for the ROI associated with our intervention rule out the widely cited
savings estimates reported in the meta-analysis of Baicker, Cutler and Song (2010).27
  24
     Winsorizing can introduce bias if there are heterogeneous treatment effects in the tails of the spending
distribution. However, Figure 7c provides evidence of a consistently null treatment effect throughout the
spending distribution. This evidence is further supported by Table 6, which shows that the point estimate of
the medical spending treatment effect changes little after winsorization. For completeness, Appendix Figure
A.3 illustrates the stability of the point estimate across a wide range of winsorization levels.
  25
     Appendix B provides the sources and calculations underlying the point estimates reported in Figure 8.
  26
     If we do not winsorize medical spending, we rule out 37 of 55 (67 percent) prior health studies.
  27
     The first year of the iThrive program cost $152 (= $271 × 0.56) per person assigned to treatment. This is
a conservative estimate because it does not account for paid time off or the fixed costs of managing iThrive.
Focusing on the first year of our intervention and assuming that the cost of a sick day equals $240, we
calculate that the lower bounds of the 99 percent confidence intervals for annual medical and absenteeism
costs are -$415 (= (15.4 − 2.577 × 19.4) × 12) and -$74 (= (0.195 − 2.577 × 0.196) × 240), which imply ROI
lower bounds of 2.73 and 0.49, respectively. By comparison, Baicker, Cutler and Song (2010) found that
spending fell by $3.27, and absenteeism costs fell by $2.73, for every dollar spent on wellness programs.




                                                     30
4.3.3      IV versus OLS

Across a variety of outcomes, we find very little evidence that our intervention had any
effect in its first year. As shown above, our results differ from many prior studies that find
significant reductions in health expenditures and absenteeism. One possible reason for this
discrepancy is the presence of advantageous selection bias in these other studies, which are
generally not randomized controlled trials. A second possibility is that there is something
unique about our setting. We investigate these competing explanations by performing a
typical observational (OLS) analysis and comparing its results to those of our experimental
estimates.28 Specifically, we estimate


                                         Yi = α + γPi + ΓXi + εi ,                                            (5)


where Yi is the outcome variable as in (4), Pi is an indicator for participating in the screening
and HRA, and Xi is a vector of variables that control for potentially non-random selection
into participation.
       We estimate two variants of equation (5). The first is an instrumental variables (IV)
specification that includes observations for individuals in the treatment or control groups,
and uses treatment assignment as an instrument for completing the screening and HRA. The
second variant estimates equation (5) using OLS, restricted to individuals in the treatment
group. For each of these two variants, we estimate three specifications similar to those used
for the ITT analysis described above (no controls, strata fixed effects, and post-Lasso).29
This generates six estimates for each outcome variable. Table 5 reports the results for our
  28
     This observational analysis was not specified in our pre-analysis plan.
  29
     To select controls for the post-Lasso IV specification, we follow the “triple” selection strategy proposed in
Chernozhukov, Hansen and Spindler (2015). This strategy first estimates three Lasso regressions of (1) the
(endogenous) focal independent variable on all potential controls and instruments; (2) the focal independent
variable on all potential controls; and (3) the outcome on all potential controls. It then forms a 2SLS
estimator using instruments selected in step (1) and all controls selected in any of the steps (1)-(3). When
the instrument is randomly assigned, as it is in our setting, the set of controls selected in steps (1)-(2) above
will be the same, in expectation. Thus, we form our 2SLS estimator using treatment assignment as the
instrument and controls selected in Lasso steps (2) or (3) of this algorithm.



                                                       31
primary outcomes of interest. The results for all pre-specified administrative and survey
outcomes are reported in Appendix Tables A.3e-A.3f.
   As in our previous ITT analysis, the IV estimates reported in columns (1)-(3) are small
and indistinguishable from zero for nearly every outcome. By contrast, the observational esti-
mates reported in columns (4)-(6) are frequently large and statistically significant. Moreover,
the IV estimate rules out the OLS estimate for several key outcomes. Based on our most
precise and well-controlled specification (post-Lasso), the OLS monthly spending estimate of
−$88.1 (row 1, column (6)) lies outside the 95 percent confidence interval of the IV estimate
of $38.5 with a standard error of $58.8 (row 1, column (3)). For participation in the 2017
IL Marathon/10K/5K, the OLS estimate of 0.024 lies outside the 99 percent confidence in-
terval of the corresponding IV estimate of -0.011 (standard error = 0.011). For campus gym
visits, the OLS estimate of 2.160 lies just inside the 95 percent confidence interval of the
corresponding IV estimate of 0.757 (standard error = 0.656). Under the assumption that the
IV (RCT) estimates are unbiased, these difference imply that even after conditioning on a
rich set of controls, participants selected into our workplace wellness program on the basis of
lower-than-average contemporaneous spending and higher-than-average health activity. This
is consistent with the evidence presented in Section 3.2 that pre-existing spending is lower,
and pre-existing behaviors are healthier, among participants than among non-participants.
   In addition, the observational estimates presented in columns (4)-(6) are in line with
estimates from previous observational studies, which suggests that our setting is not par-
ticularly unique. In the spirit of LaLonde (1986), these estimates demonstrate that even
well-controlled observational analyses can suffer from significant selection bias in our set-
ting, suggesting that similar biases might be at play in other wellness program settings as
well.




                                              32
5    Conclusion

This paper presents a first set of findings from the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study. We
find a large but diminishing effect of incentives on wellness participation. At large incentive
levels, further increases have little effect on participation and thus primarily just increase
compensation for inframarginal participants. We also find that employees who chose to
participate in our wellness program were less likely to be in the bottom quartile of the
income distribution, and already had lower medical spending and healthier behaviors than
non-participants prior to our intervention. These selection results have two implications.
First, they suggest that workplace wellness programs shift costs onto low-income employees
with high health care spending and poor health habits. Second, the large magnitude of
our spending estimate suggests the primary value of wellness programs to firms may be their
potential to attract and retain workers with low health care costs. All else equal, reducing the
share of non-participating employees by just 4.5 percentage points would lower total medical
spending in our setting by an amount sufficient to pay for our entire wellness program.
    After one year we find no significant effects of our wellness program on the many out-
comes we examine, with two exceptions: employees are more likely to have received a health
screening and to believe that the employer places a priority on worker health and safety. Our
null results are economically meaningful: we can rule out 83 percent of the medical spending
and absenteeism estimates from the prior literature, along with the average ROIs calculated
by Baicker, Cutler and Song (2010) in a widely cited meta-analysis. Our OLS estimate is
consistent with results from the prior literature, but ruled out by our IV estimate, suggesting
that non-RCT studies in this literature suffer from selection bias.
    Although we fail to find effects of our workplace wellness program on the majority of
the outcomes in our analysis, we emphasize that we have only examined outcomes in the
first year following randomization. It is possible that meaningful effects may emerge in later
years, although if there is sufficient employee turnover then these benefits may not accrue
to the employer who made the initial investment in workplace wellness. The net effect is

                                              33
therefore an empirical question. As a part of the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, we will
continue to collect data so that we can estimate long-run effects in future research.

     incentives, separately for screening and fall activity particpation. Vertical bars display 95% confidence intervals on the difference in means relative to
     the lowest reward group. AVC includes costs of the health screening, HRA, and wellness activities. Panels (c) and (d) plot the implied marginal
     costs (MC), calculated as MC= ∆AVC∆PR . The MC of the control group (PR=0 percent) is set equal to 0.

     Notes: Data are from claims covering the period July 2015 - July 2016 (N = 2, 187). The first two bins ($0 and (0 − 25]) include 25 percent of those
     not screened. The remaining five bins were defined to include 25, 25, 15, 5, and 5 percent of those not screened, respectively. The null hypothesis of
     the Pearson’s chi-squared and the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests is that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution.

Notes: Results based on health care claims over the 12-month period August 2016 - July 2017. The null
hypothesis of the Pearson’s chi-squared and the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests is that the two
samples are drawn from the same distribution.

         Notes: Each figure shows the distribution of N point estimates from prior workplace wellness studies. Panel (a) plots intent-to-treat (ITT) and
         treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) estimates for medical spending. Panel (b) plots corresponding estimates for absenteeism. The point estimates from
         our own study (“RCT Estimate”), and their associated confidence intervals, are taken from Table 6, Column 3, for medical spending, and Table 4,
         Column 4 and Table 5, Column 3 for absenteeism. Our RCT estimates and confidence intervals are plotted in order to demonstrate the share of
         prior study point estimates we are able to rule out. Appendix Table B.1 provides the full details of this meta-analysis.

     Notes: Columns (1)-(8) report unweighted means for different, nonoverlapping subsets of university employees. Column (9) reports the p-value from a joint
     test of equality of the seven coefficients reported in Columns (2)-(8). We also estimate a seemingly unrelated regression model to test whether the variables
     listed in a particular panel predict enrollment into any of the seven control or treatment groups. The joint balance test row reports the p-value from jointly
     testing whether all regression coefficients across all seven study groups are equal to 0.

Notes: This table reports rates of completion for the three components of the wellness program tied to
completion incentives. Each column in each panel reports estimates from a separate regression estimated
over individuals in one of the six treatment groups (A25, A75, B25, B75, C25, and C75). The outcome in
each regression is an indicator for completing the program component indicated by the panel, and the
independent variables are indicators for inclusion in the specified treatment groups. The regressions
reported in Columns (2) and (4) are the same as those reported in Columns (1) and (3), respectively, but
with the addition of strata fixed effects. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */**/***

Notes: Each row and column reports estimates from a separate regression, where observations include individuals in the
control or treatment groups. The outcome in each regression is specified by the table row. The focal independent variable is
an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group, and the control strategy is specified by the column. Post-Lasso controls

Notes: Each row and column reports estimates from a separate regression, where observations include
individuals in the control or treatment groups. The outcome in each regression is winsorized (top-coded)
average monthly medical spending over the first 12 months of the intervention, winsorized at the level
indicated in each column. Regressions are weighted by the number of months of coverage. In Panel A
(ITT), the focal independent variable is an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group, and all
regressions include the same controls as the ITT post-Lasso specification reported in row 1 and column (4)
of Table 4. In Panel B (IV), the (endogenous) focal independent variable is an indicator for completing the
screening and HRA, the instrument is an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group, and all regressions
include the same controls as the IV post-Lasso specification reported in row 1 and column (3) of Table 5.
Column (1) replicates the (non-winsorized) ITT and IV post-Lasso results reported in Table 4 and Table 5.
Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses, and 95% confidence intervals are reported in brackets.

Appendix A: For Online Publication Only
Figure A.1 reports how participation in the spring wellness activities varies as a function
of rewards. It also reports the marginal cost of the additional participation induced by
each reward. An increase in the size of screening incentives has modest, positive effects
on participation rates for spring wellness activities; an increase in the size of participation
incentives has a large, positive effect.
    Panels (a)-(c) of Figure A.2 shows how selection on prior probability of nonzero medical
spending, prior annual salary, and prior annual salary in the first quartile varies as a function
of the monetary incentives assigned to study participants. Panel (a) shows that, at larger
incentive levels, participants are slightly less likely to have non-zero medical spending in the
prior year. Panels (b) and (c) show little effect of the size of incentives on selection with
respect to annual salary
    Tables A.1a - A.1d provide selection results for the full set of pre-specified variables shown
in Tables 1a and 1b using equation (3). Tables A.2a - A.2f provide the causal, intent-to-
treat (ITT) effect of our intervention on all pre-specified variables. In addition, Table A.2g
provides results for different measures of medical utilization. Tables A.3a - A.3g provide the
corresponding IV and OLS estimates of equation (5) for all pre-specified variables.
    Tables A.4a and A.4b report intent-to-treat estimates for medical spending from a model
that allows the treatment effect to vary by treatment group. We do not find statistically
significant treatment effects for any treatment group in any of these specifications.
    As discussed in the main text, we find two statistically significant effects of our interven-
tion: an increase in the number of employees who ever received a health screening, and an
increase in employees who believe that management places a priority on health and safety.
Because our monetary incentives were varied independently across the health screening and
wellness activity components of our study, these incentives can be used as instruments for
participation in those components. Table A.5 reports estimates of those IV regressions. For
both outcomes, the effects are driven by the health screening component of our intervention.
    Finally, Table A.7 provides the definition, data source, and time period for every variable
presented in the paper.

Notes: Panel (a) plots health screening participation rates (PR) and average variable costs (AVC) as a
function of screening and activity incentives. Vertical bars display 95% confidence intervals on the
difference in means relative to the lowest reward group. AVC includes costs of the health screening, HRA,
and wellness activities. Panel (b) plots the implied marginal costs (MC), calculated as MC= ∆AVC

MC of the control group (PR=0 percent) is set equal to 0. We omit the MC for group C because its
marginal PR is negative.

Notes: The figure reports how intent-to-treat (ITT) medical spending effect estimates vary by the degree of winsorization
(top-coding) of medical spending, calculated as the average monthly health care spending over the first 12 months of the
wellness program (August 2016 - July 2017). Each ITT estimate is estimated from a separate regression of medical
spending (winsorized at the level indicated by the horizontal axis) on an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group.
Observations include individuals in the control or treatment groups, and regressions are weighted by the number of months
of medical coverage. The solid orange line reports estimates from a specification that includes no controls. The dashed
black line reports estimates from a specification that includes the same controls as the ITT post-Lasso specification
reported in row 1 and column (4) of Table 4. Shaded regions indicate 95% confidence intervals based on robust standard
errors. The values of the ITT point estimates and confidence intervals for selected levels of winsorization are reported in
Panel A (no controls) and Panel B (post-Lasso controls) of Table A.6.

Notes: Column (1) reports the mean among subjects assigned to treatment. Columns (3)-(5) report the difference in means
between those who completed the participation outcome and those who did not. Robust standard errors are reported in
parentheses. A */**/*** indicates significance at the 10/5/1% level using conventional inference, i.e., not adjusting for
multiple outcomes. Family-wise p-values, reported in brackets, adjust for the number of outcome (selection) variables in
each family and are estimated using 10,000 bootstraps.

Notes: The outcomes in this table constitute a single family of outcomes for calculating family-wise p-values. Each row and
column reports estimates from a separate regression, where observations include individuals in the control or treatment
groups. The outcome in each regression is specified by the table row. The focal independent variable is an indicator for
inclusion in the treatment group, and the control strategy is specified by the column. Post-Lasso controls include covariates
selected by Lasso to predict the dependent variable. The set of potential predictors include baseline values of all available
variables in the same family of outcomes, strata variables, and the baseline (2016) survey variables reported in Table 1a, as
well as all two-way interactions between these predictors. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */**/***

Notes: Each row and column reports estimates from a separate regression. The outcome in each regression is
specified by the table row, and the (endogenous) focal independent variable is an indicator for completing the
screening and HRA. For the IV specifications (columns (1)-(3)), the instrument is an indicator for inclusion in the
treatment group, and observations include individuals in the control or treatment groups. For the OLS
specifications (columns (4)-(6)), there is no instrument and observations are restricted to individuals in the
treatment group. The control strategy is specified by the column. Post-Lasso controls include covariates selected by
Lasso to predict either the dependent variable or the focal independent variable. The set of potential predictors
include baseline values of all available variables in the same family of outcomes, strata variables, and the baseline
(2016) survey variables reported in Table 1a, as well as all two-way interactions between these predictors. Robust
standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */**/*** indicates significance at the 10/5/1% level using
conventional inference.

Notes: Each column reports estimates from a separate regression estimated over individuals in the treatment and control
groups in the claims sample. The outcome in each regression is average monthly health care spending over the first 12
months of the wellness program (August 2016 - July 2017), and regressions are weighted by the number of months of
coverage. The independent variables are indicators for inclusion in the specified treatment groups. Regressions reported in
columns (2), (4), and (6) are the same as those reported in columns (1), (3), and (5) respectively, but with the addition of
strata fixed effects. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses. A */**/*** indicates significance at the 10/5/1%
level using conventional inference.

Notes: Each column reports estimates from a separate regression estimated over individuals in the treatment and control
groups in the claims sample. The outcome in each regression is an indicator for positive health care spending over the first
12 months of the wellness program (August 2016 - July 2017). The independent variables are indicators for inclusion in the
specified treatment groups. Regressions reported in columns (2), (4), and (6) are the same as those reported in columns (1),
(3), and (5) respectively, but with the addition of strata fixed effects. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses.

Notes: Each row and column reports estimates from a separate regression, where observations include individuals in the
control or treatment groups. The outcome in each regression is winsorized (top-coded) average monthly health care
spending over the first 12 months of the wellness program (August 2016 - July 2017), winsorized at the level indicated in
each column. Regressions are weighted by the number of months of coverage. In Panels A and B (ITT), the focal
independent variable is an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group. The specifications reported in Panel A do not
include controls, while those reported in Panel B include the same controls as the ITT post-Lasso specification reported in
row 1 and column (4) of Table 4. In Panels C and D (IV), the (endogenous) focal independent variable is an indicator for
completing the screening and HRA and the instrument is an indicator for inclusion in the treatment group. The
specifications reported in Panel C do not include controls, while those reported in Panel D include the same controls as the
IV post-Lasso specification reported in row 1 and column (3) of Table 5. There is no winsorization of the outcome in
column (1), and thus the ITT and IV estimates are identical to the total spending effects of the corresponding No Controls
and Post-Lasso specifications reported in Table 4 and Table 5. Robust standard errors are reported in parentheses, and 95%
confidence intervals are reported in brackets. A */**/*** indicates significance at the 10/5/1% level using conventional
