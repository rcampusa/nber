Mothers' Employment and Children's Educational Gender Gap

JEL No. I2,J2

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the connection between two concurrent trends since 1950: the narrowing and reversal
of the educational gender gap and the increased labor force participation rate (LFPR) of married women.
We hypothesize that the education production for boys is more adversely affected by a decrease in
the mother's time input as a result of increasing employment. Therefore, an increase in the labor force
participation rate of married women may narrow and even reverse the educational gender gap in the
following generation. We use micro data from the Norwegian registry to directly show that the mother's
employment during her children's childhood has an asymmetric effect on the educational achievement
of her own sons and daughters. We also document a positive correlation between the educational gender
gap in a particular generation and the LFPR of married women in the previous generation at the U.S.
state level. We then propose a model that generates a novel prediction about the implications of these
asymmetric effects on the mothers' labor supply decisions and find supporting evidence in both the
U.S. and Norwegian data.

1     Introduction
    This paper analyzes the connection between two concurrent trends: the narrowing and reversal of
the educational gender gap and the increased labor force participation rate (LFPR) of married women
since 1950. Figure 1 plots the gender gap in college achievement for different cohorts in the U.S.1 For the
cohort born in 1950 the gender gap is negative—the women’s college completion rate is 7.5 percentage
points lower than the men’s. However, the college gender gap narrows rapidly since then, disappears
after ten years, and reverses for cohorts born after 1960. For cohorts born in late 1980s the women’s
college completion rate is 10.5 percentage points higher than the men’s.2 Figure 1 also plots trends in
the labor force participation rates (LFPR) of both married and unmarried women between the ages of
25 and 30.3 Since 1950 the LFPR of married women in this age group has more than tripled, rising from
20% to around 70% in 1990. In contrast, the LFPR of unmarried women in the same age group increased
only slightly, from 77% to 81%, during the same period. This increasing trend is similar across different
education and age groups.4
    We find that the education production for boys is more adversely affected by a decrease in mothers’
time input as a result of their increasing employment. Therefore, an increase in the labor force participa-
tion rate of married women may narrow and even reverse the educational gender gap in the following
generation. We investigate the direct evidence of the asymmetric effect of mothers’ employment on their
children’s educational achievement as well as its implication on mothers’ labor supply decisions. For
the direct evidence, we find that in the Norwegian registry data the educational gender gap is positively
and significantly correlated with their own mothers’ employment during their childhood, even after
controlling for the family fixed effect. We also document a positive correlation between the educational
gender gap in one generation and the LFPR of married women in the previous generation at the U.S.
state level. For the implication, we first propose a model that generates a novel prediction about the im-
plications of these asymmetric effects—conditional on having the same number of children a mother’s
labor supply should be higher if she has more girls. We then find evidence supporting this prediction
in both the U.S. and Norwegian data. Taken together, we argue that the evidence suggests a plausible
causal link between mothers’ employment and their children’s educational gender gap.
    We begin with the Norwegian registry data,5 where we find direct evidence of the gender-asymmetric
    1 The   college achievement rate is separately calculated among females and males between age 25 and 64, and the gender gap
in college achievement is calculated as the rate of females minus the rate of males. The gender gap in Some College and College,
calculated among females and males aged between 22 and 64, is very similar. Therefore we do not distinguish the educational
gender gap and the college gender gap in this paper, and use them interchangeably.
    2 This trend is well documented by many other researchers (Freeman, 2004; Goldin et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2010). Goldin et

al. (2006) report that the reversal of the college gender gap is found at all socio-economic status (SES) levels, and in most OECD
countries. We focus on the cohorts born after 1950. The widening educational gender gap for cohorts born between 1910 and
1950 are plausibly caused by the World War II and Korean War GI bills (Bound and Turner, 2002; Stanley, 2003), as well as the
Vietnam War (Card and Lemieux, 2001). All of them substantially increase the male educational attainment, intentionally or
unintentionally.
    3 The LFPR of married and unmarried women in 1950 and 1960 are from the IPUMS Census data, while those since 1962 are

from the IPUMS CPS data.
    4 This trend has been documented and studied in Mincer (1962) and Eckstein and Lifshitz (2011), among many others.
    5 It is an administrative data for Norway, covering the full population.

Notes: The solid line represents the gender gap in college achievement (females versus males) for each
cohort while the according x-axis represents the year when the cohort is one-year-old. For example, in
year 1980 it represents the gender gap of the cohort who was born in 1979. The college achievement is
calculated from individuals aged 25 or older in the U.S. Census data. The dashed and the dot-dashed
lines represent the LFPR of married, and respectively, unmarried women aged 25-30 in the following
five years. For instance, in year 1980 it represents the average LFPR between 1980 and 1984. The LFPR
between 1962 and 2013 are from the U.S. CPS data while those for decennial years in 1950 and 1960 are
from the U.S. Census data.




                                                                  2
effects of mothers’ employment on their own children’s educational achievement. In the difference-in-
differences regression model controlling for gender specific cohort fixed effects and family fixed ef-
fects, we find that the mother’s employment has an extra positive effect on her daughter’s educational
achievement relative to the effect on her son’s, and this effect is statistically significant.
    We also document a positive correlation between the educational gender gap in a particular genera-
tion and their mothers’ LFPR when the generation was still in their childhood at the state level in the US. We
find that the college gender gap in one cohort is positively correlated with the LFPR of married women
in the birth state during the cohort’s first five years. This positive correlation is statistically significant
in the difference-in-differences model controlling for the cohort and state fixed effects. A back-of-the-
envelope calculation shows that, in the U.S. (respectively, Norway), about 13% (respectively, 8%) of the
total change in the college gender gap can be attributed to the increase in the LFPR of married women
since 1950.
    What causes this asymmetric effect of mothers’ employment on their children’s educational achieve-
ment? We argue that the asymmetry comes from both the production channel and the role model chan-
nel. If the mother’s time input has higher marginal productivity in her son’s education production, then
a reduction in mother’s time input as a result of increased employment has more detrimental effect on
her son’s educational achievement. This is the asymmetric production channel.6 On the other hand, a
working mother provides a positive role model toward working for her daughter directly, which may
increase the daughter’s perceived expected return of schooling. The asymmetric role model channel
has a more positive effect on the daughter’s educational achievement. We show that both channels are
present in the data and contribute to the narrowing and the reversal of the educational gender gap.
    We present further evidence from a different perspective to support our theory. Given the asym-
metric effects of maternal employment, a well-informed, rational and altruistic mother who values her
children’s educational achievement faces the trade-off between participating in the labor market for in-
come and putting her time into her children’s education production. Using a parsimonious model we
show such a mother would be more likely to participate in the labor market if she has a higher fraction
of girls, conditional on having the same number of children, if maternal time input is more productive
for her sons’ educational production than for her daughters’. We then find empirical evidence support-
ing this prediction in both the U.S. Census data and Norwegian registry data. Specifically, we find that,
among mothers with two or more children, the mother’s labor force attachment is positively and signifi-
cantly correlated with indicators for the first two children both being girls, or the fraction of girls among
her children, in most of the U.S. Census years and in the pooled sample, as well as in the Norwegian
data.
    We also examine two plausible alternative explanations for this positive correlation between moth-
   6 Many literature also find that boys are more vulnerable to family disruption such as divorce than girls (e.g. Hetherington

et al., 1981; Amato and Keith, 1991; Amato, 2001). Bertrand and Pan (2013) find boys raised by single mothers are at higher
risk of having behavioral problems. They argue that boys are more responsive to parental inputs which decrease dramatically
among broken families. In the Swedish registry data, Weitoft et al. (2003) find boys raised in single-parent families have higher
risk of mortality from all causes including suicide, morbidity and injury than girls. However, our empirical work will not
devote more space attempting to investigate the reasons why the production function is asymmetric, but rather show that its
presence is consistent with the data.


                                                               3
ers’ labor force attachment and the fraction of girls. The first alternative hypothesis is the “differential
cost hypothesis”—it may be more expensive to raise girls, thus mothers with more girls work more be-
cause of higher financial needs. If so, however, we would also expect that families with first child being
girl should have fewer children, to the extent that children are a normal good. This prediction is con-
trary to what is seen in the U.S. data.7 The second alternative hypothesis is that mothers with sons may
have higher bargaining power in their families, at least in countries with son-biased preferences, and
therefore they are less likely to work. This “bargaining power hypothesis” can be distinguished from
our gender-asymmetric effect of mothers’ employment on children’s education production hypothesis
in terms of age-dependency. The bargaining power associated with the genders of the children is per-
manent and should not vary over the children’s ages, and therefore it predicts an age-invariant effect
of the children’s genders on mother’s labor supply. On the other hand, our hypothesis of the gender-
asymmetric effect of mother’s employment implies this effect would vary over time because both the
production channel and the role model channel are age-varying. In the pooled U.S. Census data, we
find that the positive gradient of the mother’s labor force participation rate with respect to the frac-
tion of girls increases with her youngest, oldest, or average child’s age. These results do not favor the
bargaining power hypothesis but are consistent with our hypothesis of the gender-asymmetric effect of
mothers’ employment.
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related literature on ed-
ucational gender gap, effects of maternal employment and their interaction. In Section 3 we present the
estimation of the asymmetric effects of mothers’ employment on their children’s educational achieve-
ment using the administrative Norwegian registry data. In Section 4 we present the relationship be-
tween the female LFPR and the educational gender gap at the state level in the U.S. In Section 5 we
propose a parsimonious model of mother’s labor supply, derive its empirically testable implication,
and empirically test it using both the U.S. Census data and Norwegian registry data; we also discuss
alternative explanations. Finally, in Section 6 we conclude.


2     Related Literature
   By proposing a new and complementary explanation, our paper contributes to the growing liter-
ature which documents and explains the narrowing and reversal of the educational gender gap since
1950s in the U.S. and other countries. Researchers have documented the dynamic changes of the gen-
der gaps in high school graduation and dropout (e.g., Murnane, 2013), as well as in college enrollment
and graduation (e.g., Goldin et al., 2006 and Diprete and Buchmann, 2006). Various explanations have
been explored in the literature. One strand of the literature attributes the narrowing of the educational
gender gap to higher returns to college in the labor market for females than for males since at least the
1970s (see Dougherty, 2005, for a comprehensive review).8 A second strand of the literature argues that
    7 This
       hypothesis and the evidence are studied clearly in Dahl and Moretti (2008).
    8 However,
            Hubbard (2011) finds that after controlling the top coding bias in the CPS data the difference in the college wage
premium between women and men is statistically insignificant from 1990s. Becker et al. (2010) also find that the benefits of



                                                              4
the reversal of the college gender gap is due in part to the behavioral and developmental differences
between girls and boys—girls bear lower costs to prepare and attend colleges than boys (e.g., Goldin
et al. (2006)). Girls are found to have higher non-cognitive skills (Jacob, 2002; Bertrand and Pan, 2013),
lower rates of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Cuffe et al., 2005), lower incidence of
arrests and school suspension (Goldin et al., 2006), or higher elasticity of college supply (Becker et al.,
2010).9,10 A third strand of the literature argues that higher returns to college in the marriage market for
women than for men also contribute to the changes of the educational gender gap (e.g., Chiappori et al.,
2009; Ge, 2011; Huang, 2013).
    Our paper also contributes to a large literature investigating effects of parents’ or mothers’ time on
the development of their children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Parental time input is a key in-
gredient in children’s human capital development throughout their childhood and adolescence. Cunha
et al. (2010) find that parental investments at younger ages are relatively more important than those at
older ages. Del Boca et al. (2014) find that both parents’ time investment are important in the produc-
tion function of children’s cognitive skills, and their productivities decline as the children age, while the
monetary inputs are not as important. However, Gayle et al. (2012) estimate that the return to mothers’
time investment is two thirds higher than that of fathers’, and the returns to mothers’ time investment
are significantly higher for boys than for girls. Table 1 provides a non-exhaustive summary of the studies
on the asymmetric (and/or symmetric) effects of maternal employment on children’s achievement.11,12
    The inter-generational connection between the mother’s LFPR and her children’s educational gender
gap presented in this paper is also consistent with the positive correlation between the gender difference
in PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) test scores and the contemporary female
LFPR. Guiso et al. (2008) find that the gender gap in the 2003 PISA test scores (both math and reading)
is positively and significantly correlated with the contemporary female LFPR in their own countries.
They attribute this correlation to the influence of cultures. The result is confirmed in the 2009 PISA data
by González de San Román and De La Rica (2012). They further find that having a working mother
(in the test year) significantly improves the girl’s test scores in both math and reading regardless of the
mother’s education level, while the effect is insignificant for the boy. Fathers working full time do not
have such an asymmetric effect. They call this effect as “the intergenerational transmission of gender
role attitudes within the family from mothers to daughters.” Both papers use the contemporary female
LFPR as a measure of culture or social norm.
attending college are not higher for women than for men.
    9 Becker et al. (2010) argue that women overtake men in higher education because women and men differ in their distribu-

tions of the total costs of higher education, primarily due to the difference in their distributions of noncognitive skills. They
argue that women’s distribution of costs of attending college has a higher mean but a lower variance than those of men’s,
which leads to a higher elasticity of college supply among women than among men.
   10 These gender differences might come from the fact that women mature earlier and are more patient than men, possibly

due to evolutionary selection (Silverman, 2003).
   11 For example, it does not include much research which does not mention gender difference in effects of maternal employ-

ment on children’s achievements.

3      Asymmetric Effects of Maternal Employment—Micro Evidence from Nor-
       way
    We first present micro evidence that shows a positive correlation between the mother’s employment
and her own children’s educational gender gap in Norwegian Registry data. Specifically, in both the
first-difference regression model controlling for gender specific cohort fixed effects and the difference-
in-differences regression model which further controls for family fixed effects, we find that the mother’s
employment has an additional positive and statistically significant effect on her daughter’s educational
achievement relative to the effect on her son’s.


3.1     Norwegian data

    We use the Norwegian Registry data which consists of all children born in Norway between 1967
and 1993, with 724,091 males and 690,888 females. For all these children we identify their parents and
then construct variables describing each parent’s earnings history in the period when their children are
between birth and 17 years of age.
    As a measure of labor supply or employment we calculate the number of years where one has at least
one base unit of earnings in the Norwegian social security system in a given period, e.g. from when the
child is a newborn to 5 years of age, from age 6 to age 11, and from age 12 to 17, respectively.13 During
the period up to 1993, we only observe pension accrual for these parents. Pension accrual is a simple
function of earnings such that we can use these to obtain earnings. However, earnings also include other
types of income support, such as disability benefits, paid sickness leave and unemployment insurance.
In fact part of the earnings increase over time is due to the extension of these income support programs.
Therefore in the econometric specifications we include the gender specific cohort fixed effects to control
for such policy changes over time.
    Figure 2 plots the gender gap in college achievement for cohorts born between 1967 and 1986, as well
as their mothers’ annual employment rates when they are aged between 0-5, 6-11, or 12-17, respectively.
College achievement is measured by whether or not an individual received a college degree by the age
of 25. The gender gap is calculated as the difference in the ratio of college graduates between females
and males. It has been increasing since 1967.14 There has also been a dramatic increase in mothers’
employment, from 10% in 1967 to 65% in 1993 for mothers with young children. On the other hand,
fathers’ employment rate has been rather constant, varying between 92% and 94%. Overall, Norwe-
gian data presents similar patterns as the U.S. data in Figure 1. Table 2 presents summary statistics of
Norwegian registry data used in this paper.
    13 In 2014 this base unit equals 13,300 USD. We use “labor supply” and “employment” interchangeably throughout the paper.
   14 There has been an increase in college achievement for both boys and girls, but much more so for girls. Results are similar

if other measures of educational achievement are used, for example whether or not having finished college at the age of 28 or
the total years of schooling.

3.2      Asymmetric Effects of Mother’s Employment

    In Norwegian administrative data we regress an individual’s educational achievement at the age of
25 on the mother’s employment rate at the individual’s various age stages. First, we run the following
first-difference (FD) linear probability regression model:15

                                yi = Mi0 β + gi Mi0 γ + Wi0 ξ + gi Wi0 π + Xi0 δ + ν gi ,bi + ei .                             (FD)

The dependent variable yi is a dummy which takes value 1 if individual i has a college or higher degree
by the age of 25, and 0 otherwise. Among the independent variables, gi is a dummy for girl; Mi is a
vector of variables including the mother’s employment at various stages of i’s age; Wi is a vector of
the logarithm of family earnings; Xi is a vector of other demographics including the mother’s age when
the child is born and dummies for the birth order; ν gi ,bi indicates the gender specific cohort fixed effect;
ei is the i.i.d. unobservable component which is assumed to be orthogonal to all other independent
variables.16 We include the interaction term between the girl dummy and the mother’s employment to
allow for gender specific effect of maternal employment. Similarly, the interaction term between the girl
dummy and the log of family earnings is included to allow for gender specific income effect.
    Regression results from the FD model are presented in Table 3. In the first column, the mother’s
employment is measured as the employment rate during her child’s entire childhood period, from 0 to
17-year-old. The correlation between the boy’s college achievement and the mother’s employment—the
coefficient of the mother’s employment—is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. More in-
terestingly, there is an additional positive and significant correlation between the girl’s college achieve-
ment and her mother’s employment, measured by the coefficient of the interaction term between the
mother’s employment and the girl dummy. We then separate the mother’s employment into three dif-
ferent segments according to the child’s age groups, namely when the child was aged 0-5, 6-11, and
12-17 respectively, and run three separate FD regressions. The results reported in Columns 2-4 reveal
that the additional correlation between the mother’s employment at various age groups and her own
daughter’s college achievement is all positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. In other words,
there is a positive correlation between the mother’s employment and her own children’s gender gap in
college achievement.
    When the mother’s employments from three different age groups are included in the same regres-
sion, Column 5 shows that the signs and magnitudes of the coefficients are similar as those when sep-
arately included, except when the child is aged between 6 and 11. The correlation between mother’s
employment during that age group and her son’s college achievement becomes significantly negative
while the correlation between the mother’s employment and her children’s college gender gap becomes
statistically insignificant. Table 3 also presents a positive and statistically significant correlation between
  15 We    also estimate the logit regression model and the results are very similar to those from the linear model.
  16 ν
      gi ,bi absorbs the effect of the girl dummy and therefore the independent variables do not include gi per se. The dummy
variables for the birth orders are included to control the birth order effects. Higher birth order has a significantly negative
effect on their education (e.g., Black et al., 2005), and the parents’ earning profiles typically increase over time. Therefore it is
important to include the birth order dummies.


                                                                 9
family earnings and the children’s college achievement. The correlation between family earnings and
the children’s college gender gap is also significantly positive in most cases except when the child is no
older than five-year-old where the correlation is positive but statistically insignificant.
    However, one limitation with the FD regression model is the omitted variable issue—some unob-
servable family characteristics might affect both mother’s employment and children’s college achieve-
ment.17 To control for such unobservable variables, we include a family fixed effect, η f , and conduct the
following difference-in-differences (DID) regression model:18

                             yi = Mi0 β + gi Mi0 γ + Wi0 ξ + gi Wi0 π + Xi0 δ + ν gi ,bi + η f + ei .                         (DID)

In this DID model, the identification of the effects of mother’s employment and family earnings on her
children’s college gender gap comes from the variation across children of opposite genders within the
same family.19 Therefore it is the effect of changes in the mother’s employment or family earnings rather
than the effect of employment or income level as identified in the FD model. Of course, strictly speaking,
without exogenous variation in the mother’s employment and family earnings, the results from the DID
model are still correlations.20
    The results of the DID model are presented in Table 4. After controlling for family fixed effects, the
positive correlations between mother’s employment and her son’s college achievement estimated in the
FD model become negative. It is statistically insignificant when mother’s employment is pooled across
her child’s entire childhood (Column 1), but statistically significant when the employment is measured
across the child’s different age groups (Columns 2-4). This demonstrates the endogeneity issue in the
FD model. On the other hand, the estimates of the interaction term between the mother’s employment
and the girl dummy are still positive and statistically significant at the 1% level; the magnitudes are
similar as the FD model as well. This shows that mother’s employment has a negative effect on boys,
but has a significantly positive effect on her children’s college gender gap. Overall, an additional year of
mother’s employment increases the gender gap in college by 0.002 (≈ 0.042/18) in level. The mother’s
employment increases from 5.079 years in 1967 to 11.296 years in 1986, which is correlated with an
increase of 0.0124 in the gender gap. This is about 8% of the increase in the college gender gap in
Norway, which increases from 0.0518 in 1967 to 0.2079 in 1986.
    The DID regression results show quite similar effects of mother’s employment across their children’s
different age groups (Columns 2-4). The effects for boys are all negative and statistically significant,
while the additional effects of mother’s employment on girls are all positive and statistically significant
in each of three age groups. When mother’s employments from all three age groups are included in
  17 For  instance, family environment or mother’s ability.
  18 A  family is defined by a pair of a mother and a father. Therefore a mother might be involved into two different families in
the case of divorce-and-re-marriage.
   19 Both maternal employment and family earnings are continuous variables so the difference between one boy and one girl

is sufficient for the identification. Note that the widely used twin strategy (e.g. Black et al. (2005)) is not applicable in this DID
model since there is no variation in Mi within the twin.
   20 The DID model might still have the endogeneity issue caused by omitted variables. For example, there might be some

unobservable variables which are uncorrelated with time or the child’s age or family fixed effects but affect both the change in
the mother’s employment and the children’s college gender gap, although it is not easy to find such variables.

    The dependent variable is the education achievement in college at age 25. Independent vari-
    ables include the mother’s age when the child is born, dummy variables for birth orders, the
    gender specific cohort fixed effect and the family fixed effect.

the same regression (Column 5), for boys all the effects of mother’s employment become insignificant.
On the other hand, the additional effect for girls remains to be significantly positive and has similar
magnitude as in separate cases when the children are aged 0-5 or 12-17, but it becomes statistically
insignificant when the children are aged 6-11.
     After controlling for the family fixed effect, the effect of family earnings becomes negative and sta-
tistically significant at the 10% level, which is mainly driven by the effect of family earnings when the
child is aged 12-17. Recall the income effect in this DID model refers to the effect of changes in family
earnings. In other age groups, the income effect is negative but statistically insignificant. The additional
income effects for girls are also statistically insignificant except when the child is young. When the child
is aged between 0 and 5, the additional income effect for girls is negative and statistically significant at
the 10% level. The family earnings are the pooled earnings from both parents. Therefore they overlap
with the mother’s employment to some extent. When we drop the mother’s employment and instead
include the father’s employment, all estimates of income effects become statistically insignificant. Bet-
tinger et al. (2014) also find that the effect of changes in family income is not significant in Norwegian
data.
     When we include the father’s employment instead of the family earnings, the estimates of all effects
of mother’s employment either get strengthened or stay unchanged, as shown in Table 5. In particular,
the estimate of the pooled mother’s employment on boys remains negative but becomes statistically
significant at the 1% level (Column 1). The estimates of the effects of mother’s employment in the other
specifications all have at least the same statistical significance levels and some increase in magnitude.
Interestingly, the father’s employment also has a negative effect on boys and a positive additional effect
on girls. Both effects are statistically significant when individually included.

Remark 1 We would also like to emphasize that the estimate of the additional effect of mother’s employment on
girls relative to boys, namely γ in Eq. (DID), is more reliable than those on boys and girls per se, namely β and
β + γ respectively. To the extent that there are other unobserved time-varying factors affecting both mother’s em-
ployment and her children’s education, they are not captured by family fixed effects in the DID model; therefore the
estimates of the effects of mother’s employment on her child’s educational achievement would be biased. However,
as long as those time-varying factors are symmetric for boys and girls, such bias would cancel out. In other words,
as long as the effects of those omitted variables are independent of the child’s gender, then the bias on the estimate
of the effect of mother’s employment on her children’s educational gender gap, namely γ, is likely to be limited.

    It is worth noting that in the regression results in Table 4, the overall effect of mother’s employment
on her girl’s college achievement is positive and statistically significant in the first four specifications.
Existing literature has found mixed estimates for the effect of mother’s employment on her girl’s cogni-
tive and non-cognitive outcomes. Goldberg et al. (2008) has a detailed review on this bifurcated effect
of mother’s employment on boys and girls.21

3.3   Sources of Asymmetry: Education Production and Role Model

    There are three possible different channels that the mother’s employment might affect her children’s
educational achievement, namely income, education production, and role model. In this subsection we
argue that the income effect is likely to be symmetric, while asymmetry might arise from the education
production channel and the role model channel.
    As we previously discussed, the effect of additional income is found to be mostly insignificant and
symmetric, which is also consistent with previous literature. For example, Dahl and Lochner (2012) find
the income effects on children’s math and reading achievement are higher for boys but the difference
is statistically insignificant. Bettinger et al. (2014) estimate the effect of changes in family income is not
significant in Norwegian data.
    The education production channel could be asymmetric for boys and girls. If mother’s time input
has a differential effect in her boy’s and her girl’s education production processes, then the reduction of
the mother’s time input due to increasing employment would have differential effects for the boy and
for the girl. If the marginal effect of mother’s time is higher for boys than for girls, then an increase in
mother’s employment would have more detrimental effect for boys than for girls.
    The role model channel could also be differential for boys and girls. A working mother provides a
role model for her children, which may affect the children beliefs about the expected return of their own
education. This effect is most direct and significant for girls only, as found in, for example, González de
San Román and De La Rica (2012); similar mechanism is also studied in Fernández (2013).22
    In levels, the results from the Norwegian data support the presence of both the education production
channel and the role model channel. The production channel alone indicates negative effect of maternal
employment for both sons and daughters, and the role model channel alone indicates positive effect of
maternal employment for daughters only. The negative effect of maternal employment on boys can only
be generated by the production channel. At the same time, the positive and significant effect of mothers’
employment on girls alone indicates that the role model must be in play.
    On the other hand, the asymmetry, reflected by the positive effect of mother’s employment on her
children’s college gender gap, could rise from either the asymmetric production channel, or the role
model channel, or both. It is in general difficult to separately identify these two channels, but it may
be possible to differentiate them based on the timing of when these two channels are likely to be the
strongest. The literature on education production suggests that the maternal time input is more critical
at early stage than at later stages (Desai et al., 1989; Cunha et al., 2010). On the other hand, the time
trend in the role model channel is not clear. The role model might affect children in a subconscious
way which decreases with age, and in a conscious manner which increases with age. If the conscious
effect of the role model dominates the subconscious one, it would imply that the asymmetric effect of
   22 For boys, it is possible that competition in the marriage market might generate some indirect effect from maternal em-

ployment (Fernández et al., 2004), but this effect is indirect and ambiguous in its sign. Sons of working mothers might favor
working wives, so more working mothers result in more men who favor working wives, which everything equal could incen-
tivize boys to acquire more schooling; but this effect is dampened by the fact that there are more working women available in
the next generation. Thus the equilibrium effect of mothers’ employment through role model on sons is unclear.



                                                             15
maternal employment via the role model channel widens with children’s ages. In Table 4, the estimate
of the additional effect of mother’s employment on girls is U-shaped: stronger when children are either
young (0-5) or old (12-17) than when they are in between (6-11). When mother’s employment during all
three age periods (0-5, 6-11, 12-17) are included in the same DID model, the additional effect of mother’s
employment on girls is significantly positive when children are either young (0-5) or old (12-17), and
these effects (both β and γ) are very similar for mother’s employment during these two age groups.
As long as the effect of role model varies with the child’s age, these results indicate the presence of
another source of asymmetry. Since the income effect is symmetric, it can only come from the production
channel. That is, the detrimental effect of mother’s employment in the education production channel
is smaller for girls than for boys when they are very young, and this difference decreases with age;
the role model channel for girls is small when they are young but increases when they grow up. The
combination of these two sources of asymmetry is able to reconcile the U-shaped estimates of γ.


4      Female Labor Supply and Educational Gender Gap in the U.S.
     In this section we document a positive correlation between the educational gender gap in one gen-
eration and the labor force participation rates of married women in their mothers’ generation when the
generation was still in their childhood at their birth states in the United States. This positive correlation
is statistically significant in the difference-in-differences model controlling for the cohort and state fixed
effects.


4.1      Data and Variable Constructions

     We use two large national representative data sets in the United States, the March Annual Demo-
graphic File and Income Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) data and the Census data,
both extracted from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (Ruggles et al., 2010; King et
al., 2010). We limit the sample to white females and males only.
     The educational gender gap variables are calculated from the Census data.23 Among all females, the
fraction of females having college degrees (aged between 25 and 64) is calculated at the birth state level
for each birth year cohort. This is defined as the state level college achievement for females. Similar
state level fractions are calculated for males. The educational gender gap is defined as the difference in
the college achievement between females and males at the birth state level for each cohort.
     The labor force participation rates among all married females aged 25-64 (denoted as married FLFPR),
are calculated from the CPS data since 1962 at the state level, averaging over a five-year interval.24 We
also calculate the married FLFPR for three different age groups: between 25 and 30, between 31 and
40, and between 41 and 64. Similar labor force participation rates are calculated for unmarried females
(unmarried FLFPR), and for married or unmarried males (respectively, married MLFPR or unmarried

    24 For   example, for the year of 1962 we calculate the average married FLFPR between 1962 and 1966.



                                                                16

MLFPR).
    We then merge the educational gender gap variables for each birth state and each cohort with the
LFPR variables at that state when that cohort is one-year-old. Therefore in the merged data set, for each
state and each cohort, we have the educational gender gap between females and males who were born
in that state, and the LFPR of married/unmarried females/males in that state when that cohort is aged
between one- and five-year-old. Table 6 presents summary statistics of the state level data used in this
section.25


4.2     Difference-in-Differences Analysis

      We run the following difference-in-differences (DID) regression model at the birth state level,

                                            GAPsb = LFPR0st γ + δs + db + esb ,                                                 (1)
  25 At the national level, Figure 1 shows that to some extent the trend in the college gender gap in each cohort “coincides”

with the trend in the LFPR of married women aged 25-30 when that cohort is aged between one- and five-year-old. Both of
them increased rapidly between 1950 and late 1980s, and both level off after that. The gender gap in 1960 was the same as the
gender gap in pre-1910 level, which Goldin et al. (2006) referred to as “homecoming.” The educational gender gap for cohorts
born in 1989 or later is not available yet, but based on years right before 1989 the trend seems leveling off or even decreasing, in
both the Census data and the CPS data. The pattern is similar for the gender gap in More Than High School. Moreover, similar
pattern is found in comparing the trend in the educational gender gap of each cohort and the trend in the LFPR of married
women aged 31-40 when that cohort is aged between six- and ten-year-old.




                                                                17
where GAPsb denotes the college gender gap among cohort b born in state s; LFPRst is a vector of the
LFPRs of married and unmarried women aged between 25 and 30, and for some specifications also the
LFPRs of men in the same age group, in the birth state when cohort b is aged between one- and five-year-
old; δs and db denote state and cohort fixed effects, respectively; esb is the i.i.d. unobservable component
which is assumed to be orthogonal to all other independent variables. In this difference-in-differences
regression model, the effect of LFPRst on GAPsb is identified by the variation of their co-movement
across different states. That is, the increases of the LFPR of married women and the resulting changes in
educational gender gap take place earlier in some states than in other states.26
    Panel A in Table 7 presents the DID regression results when we regress the college gender gap on
female and male labor force participation rates at the state/cohort level. When included separately,
Column 1 shows that the coefficient of the LFPR of married women (married FLFPR [25-30]) is positive
and statistically significant at the 1% level; Columns 2-3 show that the coefficient of the LFPR of un-
married women or married men is statistically insignificant; and Column 4 shows that the coefficient of
the LFPR of unmarried men is also positive and statistically significant at the 10% level. When LFPRs
of both married and unmarried women (Column 5) or all four LFPRs (Column 6) are included in the
same regression, all coefficients only change slightly and that of the LFPR of unmarried men becomes
statistically insignificant.
    Coefficient estimates in Panel A of Table 7 show that a one-percentage point increase in the married
FLFPR is associated with 0.053-0.057 percentage points reduction in the college gender gap. Note that
in our data, the married FLFPR increased from 20% in 1950 to 65% in 1985. As a back-of-the-envelope
calculation, these coefficient estimates imply that the increase in the married FLFPR can result in a
reduction of the college gender gap by about 2.4 to 2.6 percentage points. Since the gender gap in college
was about −7.5% for the 1950 cohort and about 10.5% for the 1985 cohort, the effects of the increase in
the married FLFPR can account for 13% to 14% of the narrowing and reversal of the college gender gap.
This is a bit higher than the 8% in the Norwegian data.
    If we use the average hours worked per week instead of the labor force participation rate as the
measure of labor supply, the results are very similar as shown in Panel B in Table 7. Specifically, only
the coefficient of the hours worked per week of married women is statistically significant in all model
specifications.

Remark 2 The identification of this difference-in-differences analysis comes from the fact that some states led
others in both the change in the LFPR of married women and the change in the educational gender gap. However,
if a third (unobserved) factor caused both changes but is not included in our analysis, then our estimate of the effect
of the LFPR of married women on the educational gender gap would be biased, i.e. the omitted variable bias. We
cannot completely rule out this possibility, but we argue it is not easy to find such a credible variable for at least two
reasons. First, assume that there is such a variable which causes many changes including the two of our interest.
Then it should also cause the change in the LFPR of unmarried women. This would lead to a similar correlation
  26 We take the change in the LFPR of married women as exogenously given. Various explanations for the increase have been

explored in the literature, for example Fogli and Veldkamp (2011) and Fernández and Wong (2014).

between the LFPR of unmarried women and the educational gender gap. As Table 7 shows, this correlation is not
statistically significant in all specifications. Second, some states might be likely to lead others in many frontiers,
such as the state of California or New York. In unreported regression, we find that our results stay unchanged
when we exclude these two states from the difference-in-differences analysis.


5      Children’s Gender Effect on Mother’s Labor Supply
    We have documented so far the positive correlation between the mother’s employment and the ed-
ucational gender gap of her own children in Norway or the next generation in the United States. Our
hypothesis is that this correlation is a result of the asymmetric production effect of mother’s time in-
put on boys and girls, and/or the differential role model effect of mother’s employment on girls. In
this section we first present a static model where a mother makes the labor force participation decision,
aware of the asymmetric effects of her time input with her sons and daughters. Then we empirically test
the model implication regarding a mother’s labor supply decision and the gender composition of her
children using both the U.S. data and the Norwegian data.


5.1      The Model of Mother’s Labor Supply

   Consider the labor supply decision for a mother with n g ≥ 0 girls and nb ≥ 0 boys. The mother’s
labor market option is denoted by her wage rate w > 0. Her unearned income is y0 ≥ 0, which could
be her husband’s income if she is married. Her time endowment is T, which can be allocated between
working in the labor market, t ∈ [0, T ], and maternal time input to her children’s education, T − t ≡ s.27
The total income, y0 + wt, is allocated between consumption c and the market-provided education input
k ≡ y0 + wt − c for her children’s education production. We assume that the education production
functions of girls and boys are e g (s, k ) and eb (s, k ), respectively.
   The mother solves the following maximization problem:
                                                                                                
                       max u (c) + λ n g e g ( T − t, y0 + wt − c) + nb eb ( T − t, y0 + wt − c)                           (2)
                       {t,c}


where the u (·) is the utility from consumption and the λ > 0 denotes the weight in the mother’s pref-
erence on her children’s education relative to her own consumption. Note here we assume that the
mother’s time input is a public good for all of her children’s education production. That is, we assume
that a mother cannot separately allocate her time to the education production of each of her children.28
The market-good input to the children’s education production is also assumed to be a public good to all
children within the same family.29
    27 We
        assume there is no requirement for minimum working hours. Minimum working hours do not change the results.
    28 Disciplining,
                  for example, can be observed by all children in the same family, and therefore is likely to be a public good.
  29 An equivalent assumption is that both maternal time and market-good inputs to the education production of the children

are evenly distributed among all children. The results will be identical under this assumption to those under the public good
assumption.



                                                              20
    The functions—u (·), e g (·, ·) and eb (·, ·)—are twice continuously differentiable and concave in each
argument. We make three additional assumptions about the education production functions e g (s, k )
and eb (s, k ). First, inspired by the empirical evidence of asymmetric effects of mother’s employment on
children’s educational gender gap, we assume:

Assumption 1. (Marginal Productivity of Maternal Time Input is Higher for a Boy than for a Girl):

                                                      ∂e g (s, k )  ∂e (s, k )
                                                                   < b         ∀s, k                                   (3)
                                                          ∂s           ∂s

    In other words, for any given level of mother’s employment and market input, the detrimental effect
of mother’s employment is higher for boys.30 Second, consistent with preceding empirical finding that
the income effect is either statistically insignificant or gender symmetric, we assume:

Assumption 2. (Gender Symmetric Income Effect in Education Production Functions):

                                                      ∂e g (s, k )  ∂e (s, k )
                                                                   = b         ∀s, k                                   (4)
                                                          ∂k           ∂k

    Note that Assumption 2 immediately implies:

                                                 ∂2 e g (s, k )   ∂2 eb (s, k )
                                                                =               ∀s, k                                  (5)
                                                    ∂k∂s             ∂k∂s

    Third, we assume the time input and the market good input in the education production functions
are complementary or independent:

Assumption 3. (Maternal Time Input and Market Good Inputs are Complements or Independent):

                                                   ∂2 ei (s, k )
                                                                 ≥ 0, ∀s, k; i ∈ { g, b}                               (6)
                                                      ∂s∂k

    An example of the education production function satisfying the above three assumptions is:

                   ei (s, k) = αδi f 1 (s) + β f 2 (k ) + γ f 3 (s, k) , i ∈ { g, b} ; δ g < δb ; α, β > 0; γ ≥ 0.

where f 1 (s) and f 2 (k ) are increasing and concave functions; f 3 (s, k) is increasing and concave in each
argument and has positive second-order cross derivative. In this example, time input and market input
could be independent (γ = 0) or complementary (γ > 0).
   Let N ≡ n g + nb , λ̃ ≡ λN, and let n ≡ n g /N be the fraction of girls. Then maximization problem (2)
can be rewritten as:
                                                                                                         
          max V (t, c; n) ≡ u (c) + λ̃ n · e g ( T − t, y0 + wt − c) + (1 − n) · eb ( T − t, y0 + wt − c)              (7)
           {t,c}
  30 However, note that we do not impose any restriction on the sign of the marginal productivity of mother’s time input in
either production function. The sign does not impact our analysis.


                                                                 21
      We have the following result:

Proposition 1 Fixing hλ, w, N i , the optimal labor supply t∗ that solves problem (7) is monotone non-decreasing
in the fraction of the girls, n.

Proof. Using Assumption 2, we can immediately derive that

                             ∂2 V (t, c; n)            ∂2 eb (s, k )   ∂2 e (s, k )
                                                                                     
                                            = λ̃                     −w b 2               > 0,
                                 ∂t∂c                     ∂s∂k             ∂k

where the inequality comes from Assumption 3 and concavity of the production function eb (·, ·). We
can also show that
                           ∂2 V (t, c; n)         ∂e g (s, k ) ∂eb (s, k )
                                                                          
                                          = −λ̃               −              >0
                               ∂t∂n                   ∂s          ∂s
where the inequality follows from Assumption 1. Thus V (t, c; n) is supermodular in (t, c) and has
increasing differences in (t, n). The monotone comparative statics result of Milgrom and Shannon (1994,
Theorem 5) applies and the optimal labor supply t∗ is monotone non-decreasing in n. 
    The intuition of this proposition is straightforward. A mother is more productive in her children’s
education production if she has a higher fraction of boys among her children, ceteris paribus. Thus she
would optimally choose to allocate more time at home if she has more boys.
    Proposition 1 implies that, ceteris paribus, the reservation wage—the wage above which a mother will
choose positive amount of labor supply—is a non-increasing function of the fraction of girls. In other
words, the model predicts that mothers with more girls are more likely to participate in the labor force.
Next we empirically test this model prediction using both the U.S. and Norwegian data.


5.2     Evidence: Children’s Gender Composition and Mothers’ Labor Supply

    We now test the prediction from our model in the preceding subsection by examining the relation-
ship between various measures of a mother’s labor force attachment and the gender composition of her
children. We run the following econometric specification:

                                             yi = Xi0 β + Zi0 γ + ei ,                                       (8)

where yi is a measure of i0 s mother’s labor force attachment; Xi is the vector of the mother’s and family’s
characteristics including the number of children, age, age squared, age at the first birth, and the year
dummies (in the pooled sample only); Zi is the vector of variables of interest regarding the gender of
each child, or the gender composition of all children.
    It is reasonable to assume, at least in developed economies, that a child’s gender is exogenous, but the
number of children is likely endogenous. The classic approach of using the gender composition of the
first two children as an instrumental variable for the number of children in the family as in Angrist and




                                                            22
Evans (1998) is no longer applicable to our model.31 However, the variable of our main interest is not the
number of children, but the gender composition, which is exogenous at least in developed economies
such as the United States or Norway. Reflecting on such concerns, we report results from both the
standard OLS and the IV regressions for specification (8) where we use the same gender indicator as
in Angrist and Evans (1998) as the “instrument” for the number of children. For comparison with the
results in Angrist and Evans (1998), we restrict our analysis to families with at least two children in
both regressions. For Zi , we will investigate two different specifications for our main interest. The first
specification, reported in Table 9, includes the genders of the first two children, g1 and g2 , as in Angrist
and Evans (1998). The second specification, reported in Table 10, includes the fraction of girls among all
children in the same family.


5.2.1   Evidence from U.S. Census Data

    The data is constructed from the IPUMS Census data from 1950 to 2000. We select the sample to
include only families with both biological parents present and with at least two children; we only select
white mothers though we put no such restriction on the race of the spouses; the mother’s age at the
first birth has to be between 18 and 40.32 Both parents have to be aged between 25 and 65, and all
children have to be no older than 18. The children within the same family are ranked in a descending
order according to their ages. Thus, the first child is always the oldest, while the second child is the
second oldest, etc. Table 8 presents summary statistics of the pooled Census data (1950-2000) used in this
subsection. The fraction of girls has mean 0.485 and standard deviation 0.321, which is not statistically
significantly different from 0.5, and is almost constant from 1950 to 2000.
    Table 9 reports the results for the effects of genders of the first two children on mothers’ labor force
participation status, from both the OLS regression (Panel A) and the IV regression (Panel B). Columns
1-6 have results separately for each Census year while Column 7 has that for the pooled sample. The
dependent variable is a dummy variable indicating the labor force participation status of mothers. The
independent variables, besides those reported, include mother’s age and age squared, mother’s age
at the first birth, and the year dummies (Column 7 only). In the IV regressions, the F-statistic on the
excluded instrument in the first stage is greater than 10 in all cases.33
    Results in Table 9 show that, controlling for the gender of the first two children, the number of
children has a negative effect on the mother’s labor force participation in both regressions. Angrist and
Evans (1998) report similar results, but for Census 1980 and Census 1990 only. Our results confirm theirs
   31 In Angrist and Evans (1998), the instrumental variable is a dummy variable indicating whether the first two children are

of the same gender, S AME G ENDER = g1 g2 + (1 − g1 ) (1 − g2 ), where g j = 1 if j-th child is female and g j = 0 otherwise. It is a
linear combination of g1 , g2 and g1 g2 . For S AME G ENDER to be a valid instrument for the number of children, it requires that
g1 g2 does not have direct effect on mother’s labor supply. This holds only if the total effect of g1 and g2 on the mother’s labor
supply is additively separable, which is not the case in our model.
   32 Including observations with the mother’s age at the first birth beyond this age period does not affect results materially.
   33 In unreported regressions, we found that the effects reported in Tables 9, 10 and 11 are mostly robust when we control

for mothers’ educational attainments, except in 1950 Census year. In 1950, only 20% of mothers in our sample have recorded
educational attainment information, and the effect of the fraction of girls is positive but becomes statistically insignificant in
all cases when the mothers’ educational attainments are included.

and show that this negative effect of the number of children on mothers’ labor force participation is also
present in the 1960, 1970 and 2000 Census years, as well as the pooled years. In 1950, the effect is not
statistically significant in the IV regression. Table 9 also shows, with the exception of 2000 Census year,
at least one of the effects, of the first child being a girl or the second child being a girl or both, are positive
and statistically significant on mothers’ labor force participation. These effects are almost identical in
the OLS regression and the IV regression.
    In Table 10, we report results using the fraction of girls among all children within the same family
as a measure of the gender composition of all children. The effects of the number of children in both
regressions stay essentially unchanged when compared with results in Table 9. In both the OLS and IV
regressions, the effects of the fraction of girls are positive in all columns, and statistically significant in
all Census survey years except 1960 and 2000. When we pool Census years from 1950 to 2000, the effects
of the fraction of girls are positive and statistically significant in both the OLS and IV regressions.
    In Table 11, we report the OLS results from the second regression specification as in Table 10, but
we measure mothers’ labor force attachment by whether the mother is employed or whether working
full time, instead of her labor force participation status.34 Full-time working is defined as working more
than 1,260 hours per year and is only available since 1980.35 The effect of the fraction of girls on mother’s
  34 If one is employed, then the dependent variable is defined as one; otherwise zero, which includes the cases of unemployed

and not in the labor force. Similarly, if one is working full time, then the dependent variable is defined as one; otherwise zero,
which includes the cases of working part time, unemployed and not in the labor force.
  35 The hours worked per year is calculated as the product of hours per week and weeks per year. Since these variables refer

to last year, in this specification we restrict the sample to those mothers whose youngest child is more than one-year-old at the
interview time.

        The dependent variable is a dummy with 1 indicating working and 0 otherwise. Indepen-

employment status is significantly positive except for Census year 2000 where the effect is positive but
statistically insignificantly. The effect on mother’s full time working status is significantly positive in
1980 and 1990, and insignificantly positive in 2000. Both effects are positive and statistically significant
in the pooled sample. The estimates do not change materially in the IV regression. Also note that in
Table 11 the number of children reduces mothers’ labor force attachment in all the Census years, with
almost identical estimates as in Panel A of Table 10. The results are similar as Panel B of Table 10 in the
IV regression. This is again consistent with the findings in Angrist and Evans (1998). If we run Probit
analysis with or without instrumental variable for specification (8), the results in this subsection—signs
and statistical significance—are very similar in most cases.36


5.2.2   Evidence from Norwegian Data

    Table 12 presents similar results using Norwegian registry data. Here the dependent variable is
mothers’ working status inferred from earnings history. Consistent with the U.S. data in Table 10, we
control for mother’s age, age squared, age at the first birth, and the year dummies in the regressions.
The results from both the OLS regression and the IV regression are again consistent with the prediction
summarized in proposition 1 in that, ceteris paribus, mothers are more likely to be working if they have
a higher fraction of girls among their children.
  36 The only difference is that in the probit analysis (without IV) the effect of the “Girl 2nd” is negative and statistically

significant when the dependent variable is mother’s labor force participation status. When the S AME G ENDER is used as IV for
the number of children, the results of the probit analysis are much similar as Panel B in Table 9. Probit analysis with “Fraction
of girls” yields similar results as Tables 10 and 11.




                                                               28
5.3     Alternative Explanations

  We have found that mothers with higher fractions of girls among their children have higher labor
market participation rates. In this subsection we discuss two plausible alternative explanations for such
empirical findings and evaluate their potentials and limitations.


5.3.1    Girls Are More Expensive

    If it is more financially expensive to raise girls than boys, then families with higher fractions of girls
might be more financially demanding and therefore mothers might be more likely to be forced to work
for extra income. Girls could be more expensive for several reasons. For example, traditionally the
bride’s family pays for the larger share of the wedding costs than the groom’s family.
    This explanation could potentially generate our findings, but it would also generate another impli-
cation. If girls are more expensive and children are a normal good, then families with first child being
a girl should have fewer children. This is the “differential cost hypothesis” in Dahl and Moretti (2008) and
they find the opposite in the U.S. data. Therefore this hypothesis is unlikely to be the driving force of
our findings.


5.3.2    Higher Bargaining Power of Mothers with Sons

    In countries with son preference, like the U.S. (Dahl and Moretti, 2008) and China (Li and Wu, 2011),
mothers with sons would likely have higher bargaining power within families than those with daugh-
ters. Then in a standard collective labor supply model as in Chiappori (1992) higher bargaining power
would imply less labor supply (Voena, 2015).
    In this alternative story, giving birth to a son in a family with son preference would boost a mother’s
bargaining power. This bargaining power should not fade over time as long as the son is present. In
other words, having a daughter would lower a mother’s bargaining power for a long period of time.
This implies that the effect of the child’s gender on mother’s employment should not vary with the
child’s age since the bargaining power is stable over time. On the contrary, in our model, the asymmetric
effects of mother’s employment on children’s education production vary at different age stages of her
children, as documented in Section 3.
    To see if effects of children’s genders on mother’s employment vary over time, we include an inter-
action term between the fraction of girls and children’s ages in the regression model,

                                           yi = Xi0 β + Zi0 γ + ξti + ti Zi0 π + ei ,                                      (9)

where ti measures children’s ages in the family. We use three different measures for ti : the age of the
youngest child, the age of the oldest child, and the average age of all children.37 In this specification, the
coefficient ξ represents the effect of the children’s age on the mother’s labor supply while the coefficient
  37 Whenthe age of the oldest child is included (together with the mother’s age), the age at first birth is dropped out of the
independent variables due to collinearity.


                                                              29
π represents the age trend in the gradient of the mother’s labor supply on the fraction of girls. In the
bargaining power hypothesis both ξ and π should be zero. However, the effect of the children’s age on
the mother’s labor supply might vary for other reasons, which would likely generate a positive ξ.38 But
even in this case, the effect of the bargaining power should not vary over the child’s age, and therefore
π should be zero. On the other hand, in our asymmetric effect hypothesis the π generally should not
be zero. The sign of the coefficient π tells us whether the differential effect of children’s gender on
mother’s labor supply widens (if π > 0) or shrinks (if π < 0) with the children’s age. As discussed in
Subsection 3.3 based on results from Norwegian registry data as in Table 4, the asymmetry is stronger
when a child is either young (the asymmetric production channel dominates) or old (the role model
channel dominates). For this reason, we conduct two different specifications. In the first one, we use the
children’s age for ti as described earlier. In the second one, instead of the direct measure of the age, we
include two dummy variables indicating whether this age is in the age interval of either [0,5] or [12,17].
    As previous literature finds that the U.S. is likely a country with son preference (Dahl and Moretti,
2008), we conduct the econometric specification (9) in the U.S. Census data only. The estimation results
from the pooled 1950-2000 U.S. Census data are presented in Table 13. There are several observations
worth noticing here. First, we look at the estimates of ξ only, which reflects the effect of the children’s
ages for those mothers with sons only, i.e., when the fraction of girls is zero. Results in Table 13 show
that the effects of the age of the youngest child or the oldest child or the average age of all children on
mothers’ labor force participation are all positive and statistically significant (Columns 1, 3 and 5). More
importantly for our purpose, however, is that the estimates of the interaction terms between “Fraction of
girls” and all of the three variables—“Age of the youngest child,” “Age of the oldest child” or “Average
age of children”—are also positive and statistically significant. The results are similar in the IV regres-
sions and are robust if including the mother’s educational attainment. Thus, the evidence suggests that
the positive gradient of the mother’s labor force participation rate on the fraction of girls increases with
her children’s age.
    When the age interval dummies are used as shown in Columns 2, 4 and 6, the interaction between
the fraction of girls and the dummy indicating young age is statistically insignificant in all three cases,
while the interaction with the dummy indicating old age is positive and statistically significant. This
reflects that this asymmetry stays relatively flat during a child’s first eleven years but widens when
the child reaches 12- to 17-year-old. This pattern can be explained by a combination of two forces: an
asymmetric production channel where the asymmetry does not shrink rapidly with the child’s age, and
a role model channel where older girls are impacted more significantly than younger ones.
    In summary, these evidences are consistent with our asymmetric effect theory and harder to square
with the bargaining power hypothesis.
 38 For   example, a child attending school would demand less time from the mother.

6    Conclusion
    In this paper we argue that the increasing labor force participation rate of married women since 1950
accounts for about 13% (or 8%) of the narrowing and reversal of the educational gender gap among their
children’s generation in the U.S. (or Norway). In particular, we highlight that the connection between
the mothers’ employment and their children’s educational gender gap is consistent with the asymmetric
effect of mothers’ time input in their children’s education production and the differential role model
effect.
    In the panel data from Norway, we find direct evidence for the asymmetric effects of mothers’ em-
ployment on their own children’s educational gender gap. In the cross-sectional data from the U.S.,
we find that the college gender gap in one generation is positively correlated with the labor force par-
ticipation rate of married women in their mothers’ generation during their childhood. We argue that
this correlation is a result of asymmetric effects of mothers’ employment on their children’s educational
achievement, which benefits daughters more than sons.
    We then further derive the empirically testable implication of this mechanism on a rational, well-
informed and altruistic mother’s labor supply. Specifically, in the presence of this gender-asymmetric
effect, the mother’s labor supply should be higher if she has a higher fraction of girls, after controlling for
the total number of children. We find supportive evidence for this implication in both the U.S. data and
Norwegian data. We also discuss and rule out alternative explanations about our findings. Taken col-
lectively, the weight of our evidence supports the mechanism that mothers’ employment has a gender-
specific asymmetric effect on their children’s educational achievement. As such, our results highlight a
potentially unintended consequence of the increase in mothers’ employment on the educational gender
gap of their children, which will lead to a potentially important inter-generational “feedback” loop.
    We believe that our results regarding mothers’ employment and their children’s educational gender
gap are novel and contribute to a complementary and better understanding of the causes of the narrow-
ing and reversal of the educational gender gap since 1950s. There are several interesting areas for future
research as a result of the findings in this paper. First, as we note in Figure 1, the labor force participation
rate of married women has stabilized since mid-1990s. Our theory would predict that for cohorts born
after mid-1990s the changes in the educational gender gap would slow down as well. This prediction
can be checked as new data becomes available. Second, in this paper we have taken the increase in mar-
ried women’s labor force participation rates as given and studied its effects on the educational gender
gap of their children’s generation. It will be interesting to study an overlapping-generation equilibrium
model where mothers make labor supply decisions taking into account such an asymmetric effect on
their children’s education production, at least when they are young, and their children subsequently
make college attendance decisions and labor supply decisions etc.39 Third, the effect of mothers’ em-
ployment on their children’s educational gender gap may also have implications on the fertility choice.
In countries with son preference, the increase in female labor force participation rates might reduce the
  39 See Eckstein, Keane and Lifshitz (2014) for a related attempt, though they focus on marriage, and do not consider the

impact of mothers’ employment on children’s education.
