                                       ABSTRACT
           The paper stresses the evolutionary and adaptive experience of

Latin American growth between 1950 and   1980,   and provides a synthetic view

by considering the sources of growth within a simple production framework.

Regressions use quinquennial panel data for 18 Latin American countries.

They provide an estimate of the net return to investment, of the elasticity

of output to labor and of the contribution of other variables with

influence on efficiency. The regressions show that Latin American growth

varied systematically with trade performance.

           The paper provides information on the effects of inflation upon

per capita income growth in the region. There is a negative correlation: an

inflation rate of even 20 percent reduces the per capita growth rate by 0.4

percentage point, or almost 1.5 percent of the regional mean of 3 percent

growth between 1950 and 1980. This result does not hold, however, once high

inflation observations are excluded.

           Finally we call attention to the persistent problems of income

distribution and poverty.

I. INTRODUCTION

             In the thirty years between 1950 and 1980., Latin America

experienced rapid growth. During this period, output as measured in adjusted

purchasing power tens, expanded at an annual rate of 5.8 percent, with per

capita increases averaging 3 percent a year. Table 1 provides country detail.

The clear star performer is Brazil, whose share in regional product increased

from less than a quarter to more than a third. At the other extreme are two

groups. One is   the Southern Cone, Argentina, Chile   and Uruguay, whose   1950

leading position in the region was eroded by much less than normal
performance. The other laggards include a variety of smaller countries,
several   in Central America.

            The average Latin American record, viewed from immediate post-World

War II perspective, is impressive. The target of the Alliance for Progress,

implemented in 1961, was an annual rate of 2 percent per capita. European per

capita income growth in the aftermath of the Industrial Revolution was 1.3

percent from 1850 to 1900 and 1.4 percent between 1900 and 1950. Long term

United States economic growth has been at 1.8 percent.

            Yet two factors combine to make the 1950-1980 Latin American growth

performance seem less positive. One is its, dramatic   reversal   in the 1980s.

Latin America has retrogressed in this decade, with product falling at a rate

of 1.4 percent, as recorded in table 1. This is a generalized regional

phenomenon. By 1988, with the exception of Brazil, Chile, Colombia and the
Dominican Republic, per capita CDP had fallen below its 1.980 level, At the

extreme, Venezuela, Nicaragua and El Salvador show levels below those attained

in 1960. The l980s have truly been a lost decade, and one underestimates

earlier achievement.

           The second circumstance diminishing the accomplishment from 1950 to

1980 has been the surging performance of the Asian countries. Led by the four

newly industrializing countries of South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and

Taiwan, but extending to many others, Asia has vaulted ahead in the 1980s at

                per capita rate in excess of 5 percent. This contrast has

now been widely interpreted as proving the errors of the import substitution
strategy favored by    Latin America through much    of   the post-War period. Two   of
the pillars of that strategy were emphasis upon industrialization through
governmental intervention and barriers to trade.
          Commentators have recently argued forcefully against both. Angus
(adison(1985)   contends:

   "The economic growth performance of Latin America since 1973 has been
   abysmal.. .there has.. .been a certain continuity in economic policy
   attitudes since the l930s and the liberal international order which was
   created by OECD countries and has influenced policy in Asia has left them
   virtually untouched.w

          Deepak tal's      (1985)   rejection of state intervention is another that

many now find attractive:

   "The most serious current distortions in many developing countries are not
   those flowing from the inevitable imperfections of market economy but the
   policy induced, and thus far from inevitable, distortions created by
   irrational dirizisme.

              Understanding the post-war experience is thus tmportant for policy

prescriptions that are currently being debated within Latin America. In this

paper we re-examine these three decades to provide a context for discussion of

the future. In section Il, we analyze the sources of growth, stressing the

evolutionary and adaptive experience of the region over these three decades.

In section III, we take a closer Look at the inflationary process within the

region and its determinants. In section IV, we call attention to the grave and

persistent problems of income distribution and poverty that these three

decades of overall growth failed to eliminate. Inequality           and a   significant

part of the population with inadequate nutrition, health        care and housing
reflect    another side of the failure of the Latin American development process

that has received too little attention in recent years. The last section

briefly    considers the   implications    of our conclusions for   the   present policy
discussion.



II. SOURCES OF GROWTH

             During the l9SOs, most Latin American      countries   moved toward an

import   substitution strategy) They chose this path because it seemed to fit.
After    the Great Depression of the      1930s and the disruption of the second world



I There is a vast literature on the economic development of Latin America.
See, for instance, Beer (1977), Corbo (l988), Dietz (1987), Fishlow (1972),
Foxley (1976), Hirschman (1987, 1968), Klaren (1986) and Sheehan (1987).

war, followed shortly thereafter by the Korean War boom and bust, the

international economy did not seem to be a propitious engine of growth. Nor

did the United States place economic development and Latin America high on the

agenda; the Marshall Plan instead gave priority to Europe and the Cold War.

             Latin American economic writing and practice, influenced but not

determined by a group of economists working at the Economic Commission of

Latin America in Santiago under the leadership of Raul Prebisch, emerged

against    this backdrop.   These contributions amended the orthodox view of

economic   growth through   comparative advantage and capital accumulation in

three   ways: the specification of macroeconomic       ustme, the identification
of microeconomic distortions and,     following   from the   above, a   strong role for
government intervention.
             Attention to the foreign exchange constraint rather than savings as
the determinant of growth in peripheral countries was the principal
macroeconomic novelty. In a world where the terms of trade moved against
traditional primary export products,2 domestic production would have to
substitute for non-essential imports, leaving the      foreign   exchange for the
needed inputs. Moreover, while technical progress in agriculture would leave
Labor unemployed, dynamic industry could absorb the growing population with
increasing productivity and incomes. Domestic production required protection


2 See Crilli (1988),
                                           7




against imports and deliberate bias against exports of resources that move

into industry.

           In the microeconomic sphere, there was stress on imperfections and

discontinuities, both of which impeded effective operation of price signals.

Whether in agriculture, where land concentration was notorious, or in industry

where new privileges provided shelter from market forces, the competitive

model was flawed.

           These macro- and microeconomic conditions militated in favor of a

strong state presence. Regulation and direction were needed. Development was a

consequence of policy, not a natural evolution. Conscious and comprehensive

planning was desirable; the Economic Coission of Latin America pioneered in

the application of input.output models in the region.

           Import   substitution was   a disequilibrium   development strategy. It
confronted three    limitations that increasingly impacted upon performance

toward the end of the 1950s. One was deterioration in the balance of trade,

the second was sectoral imbalance, and the third was deterioration of the

public sector accounts.

           Protection led to overvalued exchange rates and hence taxes on

exports. The consequence was an eventual reduction in export supply.

Industrialization in turn required increased inputs of capital goods and

intermediate imports. As trade deficits increased, foreign investment became a

critical requirement, not only for its modern technology but also its

provision of foreign exchange. This was an ironic and unanticipated
                                        8




consequence of a strategy deriving its strong political appeal from its

emphasis upon national productive capability.

           In sectoral tens, import substitution policies exaggerated

industrial growth at the expense of agriculture, with three consequences.

First, food prices were kept artificially low, benefiting urban incomes at the

expense of rural incomes. Second, relatively capital intensive manufactures

absorbed only a diminishing fraction of the increment in the labor force,

swelling the service sector and placing pressure on government to serve as an

employer of last resort. Third, physical targets dominated cost effectiveness

calculations; it was as though the higher shadow price of foreign exchange

justified any project.

           The third disequilibrium was fiscal. As the initial real resources

taxed away from primary exports began to give out, subsidies to industrial

investment had to come from explicit taxes. At the saSe time, government

responsibilities had increased, placing new pressures upon the budget from the

expenditure side. Monetization of the deficit was an irresistable lure and one

with nineteenth century precedent in Latin America. Inflation and need for

stabilization began to Lurk as a problem in several countries toward the end

of the l950s.

           These disequilibria were temporarily averted by the Alliance for

Progress. New inflows of official capital simultaneously helped with the

external accounts and public sector deficits, while Pt 480 imports eased

supplies of food. Governments also attempted to correct some of the policy

excesses by more realistic exchange rates and greater promotion of exports.
                                          9




             These efforts were not enough. By the mid-l960s, the Alliance was

itself faltering, the victim of changing policy perceptions in the United

States and Latin America alike. Reforms were not easy nor were resources

unlimited. More orthodox policies became the order of the day, frequently

under military tutelage, setting the stage for a new phase of economic

expansion.

             The limits of the import substitution strategy were recognized.

Important modifications to commercial policy were introduced in the l960s.

Tariffs were frequently reduced, especially in the highest categories.

Crawling   peg exchange rate systems accommodated to high domestic rates of
inflation and averted the overvaluation earlier so predominant. Explicit
concern   for inducing non-traditional exports produced special export subsidy

programs in many   countries   during the period after 1965. in the context of a

more   bouyant international   market, such   reinforcements produced positive
results   and export growth and diversification in the region increased.

             At the same time, larger private capital inflows were an option for

which several countries of the region were eligible. From the end of the 1960s

and reinforced by the oil surpluses after 1973. the Euro-dollar market was in

pursuit of new takers and found many of them in the region. Governments could

finance both more imports as well as larger public sector deficits.

             Domestic policies tended to retreat somewhat from regulation and

prices were given greater scope to direct resources. Still, the commitment to

industrialization remained. And that meant an intrusive role for the public
                                          10




sector even under the ‚Ä¢orthodox policies pursued by military governments. The

Brazilian "miracle" was a clear lineal descendant of import substitution, not

to be confused with an outward orientation. The large domestic market still

dominated production decisions.

             This period of adaptation and relatively successful adjustment of

the earlier model (growth rates showed improvement generally and not only in

Brazil) was brought to an abrupt end by the international disequilibrium

ushered in by the oil price rise in 1973.

             The post-oil shock experience in the region was substantially

conditioned by mounting indebtedness and deterioration of domestic policy in a

more difficult   external environment. This period saw   the rise of international

monetarism   as a means   of reducing inflation in the Southern Cone countries, at

the   expense of a substantial increase in external liabilities.. It saw growing
indebtedness   of oil producers based upon the new greater value of oil in the

ground. Finally, it saw Brazil labor under its progressively larger service

payments and domestic pressures to sustain its exhilarating pace of industrial

expansion. For the region as a whole, output growth slowed in the 1970s, but

remained at satisfactory levels.

             The precariousness of the Latin   American economies only became
fully   apparent when a new oil price rise, an abrupt increase in real interest

rates and an OECD. recession coincided in the early l980s. Countries of the

region had   badly   chosen their adjustment style after 1973. It was not simply

that they blindly followed the original import substitution bias of the l9SOs,
                                                      11




 as Maddison has argued. Rather it was their specially asymmetric opening to

 the world economy, featuring vast financial flows with much more limited trade

penetration. And new fiscal distortions reduced the room for maneuver. To make

growth continue in the late 1970s, government deficits were incurred that

could no longer be so easily financed. Stop-go macroeconomic responses could

be found in a much larger number of countries during this period, They were

but prelude to the stop-stop. policies that ultimately came to be necessary in

the 1980s.

               A useful, synthetic view of this period as a whole ii provided by

considering its sources of growth within a simple production framework. Table

2   starizes the regression results.                The regressions use .quinquennial panel

data   for 18 Latin American countries.3 They provide an estimate of                   the net

return to investment and the             elasticity     of output to labor as   well   as of the
contribution      of other variables with potential influence on differential

efficiency. Thus ‚Ä¢ a higber rate of increase of exports might be expected to

provide externalities over and above the direct contribution to output; that

is, of course, one of the central tenets of the argument in favor of a more

outward development strategy. The same                kind   of externalities might be   expected
from   imports in a structuralist foreign exchange constrained situation.




  All Latin American countries except Cuba and Haiti, for lack of data. The
countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cbile, Colombia. Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela.

           Two key results emerge from table 2. First, a straightforward two

factor approach, here labeled neo-classical, is markedly inferior to an

augmented definition of the production function that includes other variables

reflecting the degree of success in integration into the international

economy. Latin American growth required more than increased capital formation.

It also varied systematically with trade performance.

           Roth export expansion and the growth rate of imports clearly

mattered. Exports were significant not only for their contribution to

productive efficiency, but also because higher earnings could avert recurrent

stabilization crises with adverse effects on output growth. More novel is the

finding that availability of imports exerted an independent influence. Import

substitution, successfully pursued, required imported inputs. Countries,

unable to obtain them and forced to curtail their foreign purchases

excessively, suffered. This access to imports, both through export earnings

and foreign finance, differentiated the successes from the failures. This is

where Brazil and Mexico diverged from the Southern Cone experience

           Second, the evidence in table 2 strongly suggests that three

different sub-periods corresponding to different internal policies and

external conditions can be distinguished. The dummy variables are highly

statistically significant. The differences among these three periods are

clarified in the following three tables. Table 3 summarizes the sources of

growth for the 1950-65 period1 table 4 shows the equations for the decade

1965-75 and table S presents those for 1975-80.

              In each period, the augmented formuLation performs much better than
the   neo-classical formulation in its explanation of output growth. In each

period, the interface with the international economy provides essential

information. By contrast, sheer size of the current purchases of the public

sector - -   estimates   of its investment are included in the investment ratio - -

does not seem to matter.

              There are also differences between periods. Especially noteworthy

is the increasing contribution of export performance over time. Latin American

exports until the mid-l960s were almost exclusively primary exports. Although

world trade prospered in the l9SOs, it was newly oriented to the exchange of

manufactured products among industrial countries. Primary prices were quite

weak between 1955 and 1965: real export volume growth of S percent per year

until 1963 for all non-oil developing countries translated into growth of

purchasing power of only 2 percent per year. In the following two      periods,   and

especially after the oil, price increase in 1973, export capability played a

much greater part in determining aggregate growth.

             At the same time, successful import substitution enabled the larger

and more rapidly growing economies to compress import requirements. After

1975, policy was already consciously addressed to this objective in most

countries of the region, and new protective barriers were erected. In contrast

to the coefficient for exports, imports exhibit a decline in importance in the

last sub-period.

             The disaggregation also points to a falling significance of

investment. The estimate of the rate of return declines from not always
                                           17




productive, accumulation of capital under the impulse of increased foreign

savings. Many of the projects were longer term, moreover, and did not have a

principal impact Ln the shorter term. Later adjustment difficulties meant that

much investment never contributed.

              The statistical analysis thus confirms an important association

between the level of output growth and successful Latin American integration

into the      international economy.




III. INFLATION

             Another special feature of Latin American development is the

ubiquity of    inflation.   Table 6 presents the Latin   American record of inflation
over this 30 year period. Two inferences are direct. One is a clear
distinction among countries; the other is the tendency for price increases to
accelerate   over time.

             Some countries in the region are recurrent offenders, while others,

because   of the discipline of fixed exchange rates, have largely avoided highly
inflationary episodes. Among the former, Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay
stand out. The small countries of Central America largely fall into the latter

camp; at an extreme is Panama, without its own     currency issue. Virtually   alone

among countries of the region, Colombia has managed to avoid surges of runaway

inflation while sustaining a moderate average.

              With the oil price shock in 1973 came a new set of inflationary

pressures. Higher international prices of imports were magnified by nominal

devaluations in several countries. Despite slower growth, inflation showed a

tendency to increase. But, as Table 6 indicates, much larger effects were to

be felt after 1980. In the midst of real declines in per capita output.

inflation attained much higher levels than ever before in the post-War period.

              Monetarists and stnicturalism are the two   basic   interpretations of

inflation in Latin America and two     corresponding   programs for stabilization

are derived from them. According to monetarists, inflation is the result of

overspending:     inflation in Latin America is thus caused by large budget
deficits financed by money creation. The private sector, while crowded out,
seeks   to   sustain its position. To stop inflation, budget deficits must be cut.
             Structuralisa, the opposing view, maintains that budget deficits
are   not at the heart of the matter. The basic causes of inflation lie in
supply shortages, bottlenecks and inconsistent claims of different groups in
society trying to get a larger share of the pie. Fiscal and monetary policy
are accommodating. For structuralists, administered controls on prices and

wages become the central component of stabilization policy. This is the only

way to stop inflation.

              Both diagnoses of inflation are incomplete and thus their remedies

have consistently failed.4 From the 1950s to the l9BOs Latin America suffered




 See Cardoso (1989) for a brief summary and references.
                                       20




from the application of numerous stabilization programs.5 These three decades

have seen more inflation acceleration than successful reduction. Within this

period, the most effective deceleration was the Chilean in the l9lOs. it was,

however, associated with special political circumstances and a flawed reliance

on fixed exchange rates that helped trigger a massive decline in income in the

early l9SOs.

           The results from stabilization attempts were, in general.

unsatisfactory. Most typically, temporary reductions in inflation and external

deficits were combined with large increases in unemployment and a reduction of

the labor share in output. Pastor's (1987) empirical analysis of the

International Monetary Fund programs in Latin America in the period 1965-81

finds that Fund programs had mixed impacts on growth rates, led to rising

inflation and were associated with declines in the wage share. Equally

important, and for these reasons, the programs could not be sustained in their

implementation. Reaction against the IMP in Latin America has a long history;

it is not aerel.y a product of the debt crisis.

           The Brazilian experience in the mid-sixties is now often cited as

an example of a successful orthodox program. There are two caveats. First, it

should be recognized that the stabilization program of mid-1960s in Brazil. was

not strictly orthodox, as it did make use of price and wage policy. Real wages




  Stabilization programs were implemented, for instance, in Chile (1956-58,
1973-78), Argentina (1959-62, 1976-78), Bolivia (1956), Peru (1959, 1975-78),
Uruguay (1959-62. 1974-78), Mexico (1983) and Brazil (1964-68, 1982-83).
                                           21




were supposed to be maintained at their previous average level. Instead they

became the residual factor when inflation proved to be resistant to

application of restrictive fiscal policy. Prices were subject to some controls

as well as held in check by the incentive of favored access to credit. As a

consequence of these efforts inflation did decline between 1964 and 1966; in a

final stage, a further reduction was facilitated by renewed growth and

productivity increases.

              Second, there was a high cost borne by the wage earners whose

residual    claim on income helped to make stabilization possible. The objective
is   not only to reduce inflation, but at minimal expense. In this case, the

burden fell not so much upon output as upon      real wages and a deterioration of
the income distribution. Such wage compression was enforced1 as in Chile, by
political repression.
              In   the late l970s, in part because previous policies had not been

effective,    a new and mote radical policy direction became pop√§lar in the
Southern Cone. Restoring the role of free markets became the dominant ideology
of neoconservantism. Its strategy consisted of: 1) freeing prices, 2)
eliminating quantitative restri√†tions on trade and reducing tariffs, 3)
promoting    a domestic capital market by freeing interest rates and eliminating

controls   over the allocation of credit, 4) promoting the free entry and     exit

of   capital and 5) reducing the participation of the    public sector in

production.
                                           22




              Ramos (1986) offers an excellent guided tour through the ups and

downs of the neoconservative experience in Argentina. Chile and Uruguay.6 What

distinguishes the neoconservative programs in the Southern Cone in the lace

l9lOs from other orthodox programs is the reliance on the exchange rate to

achieve disinflation. The neoconservative approach is based on global

monetarism.      This theory maintains that a fixed exchange rate determines the
prices of tradables and becomes the central price around which price
expectations can be formed. A fixed exchange rate is thus       the   basic vehicle of
disinflation,     while fiscal discipline restricts demand   and avoids undermining
the   program.

            Theory diverges from practice because of significant lags and a

limited degree of Import competition. So long as there is inflation inertia.

non-tradable prices are not frozen and domestic tradable prices are not set by

international prices, overvaluation will occur. Overvaluation in turn implies

large current account deficits and stimulates capital flight. The accumulation

of debt, and its service, becomes so great as to force a policy reversal. An

inevitable devaluation provokes another round of inflation.

            The Argentine experience is prototypical. At the beginning of 1916

took power. Martinez de Hoz was in charge of the economic team for five years.

The first phase of the disinflation program relied on wage controls. At the

sane time, the fiscal deficit was gradually reduced. These policies brought

about favorable results on the inflation front. In December 1978, a new price-

stabilization program was instituted. The resultant reduction of inflation was

bought at the price of a huge overvaluation. By 1981, the overvaluation had

precipitated massive capital flight and external debt. The collapse of the

exchange   rate that followed brought about a new inflationary surge. Using the
exchange rate as a principal tool to combat inflation can lead to highly
unstable   outcomes.

            The most recent experiences of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico in the

1980s afford an interesting continuity despite their new dimension of a large

external debt.   They help underline the key role played in Latin American
inflation during the last thirty years by the external balance. Just as output
growth in the region must take into account external integration, so must the
circumstances of internal macro-economic disequilibrium. Easily financed
current account deficits made for relatively low inflation. Balance of
payments crises translated into higher interest rates and credit rationing as
well as inflationary pressures generated by realignment of exchange rates.

What counts is not only the size of the public deficit but the capacity to

finance it. In the l980s, one sees the salience of this point in the context

of   increasing debt service. Countries financed the purchase of foreign
exchange not through taxes but by issuing domestic debt or printing money. As
a consequence, inflation rates more than doubled in the l9BOs. (See table 6).
                                           24




             A second aspect of Latin American inflation is the prevalence of

indention. The pervasiveness of high inflation has created mechanisms of

institutional defense. All key prices in the economy -    - the   exchange rate,

interest rate and wage rate -   - tend   to have automatic adjustments in response

to price level changes. Indexing averts the large changes in relative prices

that typically occurred in the l9SOs in Latin America. It does so, however, at

the expense of building additional rigidities into inflation and making

disinflation, particularly front high levels, virtually iwpossible under

orthodox programs. Inertia matters.

             But the special kind of incomes policy established by indexing is

also far from neutral. Certain groups benefit and others lose depending upon

the choice of index and the degree to which adjustment is forward or backward

looking; a special case earlier discussed was Brazil in the aid-1960s,

lieterodox programs which take the current relative prices as equilibrium

because of high inflation can err. Return to an average real wage will, not

necessarily prove a guarantee that structural and distributional components of

inflation are eliminated. Incomes policy has to do more than coordinate the

responses of different price setters.

             table 7 provides information on the effects of inflation upon per

capita income growth in the region. The regressions use quinquennial panel

data for 17 Latin American countries.7 For the period as a whole, there is a

negative correlation. This result is replicated for each of the sub'periods,

with the coefficient bein√® largest and most statistically significant in the

interval 1950-65. The average impact is not trivial: an inflation rate of even

20 percent reduces the per capita growth rate by 0.4 percentage point, or

almost 15 percent of the regional mean of 3 percent growth between 1950 and

1980.

              This result does not hold, however, once high inflation

observations are excluded. (See lower panel of table 7). If the sample is

limited to all. 5-year averages less than 50 percent, there is no systematic

effect of inflation upon growth. And in the period 1965-75, the effect is

actually positive, reflecting the degree to which spreading indexing

facilitated   adaption to inflationary pressures of modest levels. The
appropriate conclusion, therefore, and consistent with the experience after
1980, is that moderate inflation was not a serious handicap, but that much
higher   rates exert a palpable cost. At   rates of 20 to 30 percent a month, one
cannot   avoid a high degree of variance in relative prices and attendant

uncertainty, not to speak of instability.

            Much of the empirical analysis of Latin American inflation in

recent years has been in test of the implications of rational expectations

theory for the effects of unanticipated money growth on real output growth and

the price level. Conclusions have not been uniform, but are sensitive to model

structure, country sample and period of observation. A recent study by

Canarella and Pollard (1989) explores the relation between-money, the price
                                       26




level and growth in 16 Latin American countries between 1950 and 1983. While

the empirical results conform broadly to the view chat unanticipated money

growth has positive effects on output and negative effects on the price level,

they are hardly decisive. Consistent with our emphasis upon external factors,

the coefficient on money growth is generally not of unitary elasticity as

predicted. The pattern of output response, moreover, is qutte sluggish and

highly variable across countries; the price level effect is equally far from

uniform, nor are the cumulative coeficients consistent with those in the

output equation.

           While at one time struccuralists were prone to argue in favor of a

favorable inflation-output relationship in the region, few defend such a

poeition at the exaggerated rates now being recorded in many of the countries

of the region. More sophisticated financial markets registering daily

expectations and indexing at more and more frequent intervals leave little

scope for unanticipated price increases, let alone a positive impact. The old

debate between monetarists and struccuralists has given way to generalized

recognition of the need for better macro‚Ä¢econoaic policy and return to much

lower inflation rates

IV. POVERTY AND INCOME DISTRIBUTION

             Perhaps   the   biggest limitation of   Latin American   development in the

post‚Ä¢War period has     been   its modest social achievements in the process     of
economic growth. Growth is essential for achieving social goals. But growth is

not enough. Economic growth and industrialization in Latin America blended

with   mass poverty, social     tensions, regional   imbalances, widespreadpolitical
instability   and acute injustice.8

Who are the poor?
             Altimir   <1982) develops a widely used definition of poverty for ten

Latin American   countries     in the 1970s on the basis of   available household
surveys and population censuses. His poverty lines (annual household

consumption per capita ranging frois 150 to 250 dollars of 1970) are country

specific based on the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet multiplied by two.

According to Altimir's estimate, in 1970, 40 percent of Latin American

households   were poor end had an average purchasing power from 40 to 55 percent
belowthe poverty line. Only in Argentina the income gap was as low as 25
percent. The extent of poverty was higher in rural than in urban areas in all
Latin American countries. Even in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, the most
heavily urbanized countries in the region, the extent of rural poverty was not
less   than 20 percent of rural households. In Mexico, the three bottom deciles




8 Cardoso and Helwege (1989) provide a survey of the literature on poverty in
Latin America.
                                         29




of the income distribution were entirely rural. In Brazil, 70 percent of the

lowest four deciles in the mid-1970s were rural households. The poorest are

usually landless laborers who purchase all or a large part of their food. In

the urban areas the poorest are self employed (rather than wage earners),

workers in construction (the most likely entry point for immigrants) and

persons working in public make-work programs such as those in Chile.

              In 1970, the extent of destitution (risk of severe nutritional

deficiency) varied quite substantially from 1 percent of the population in

Argentina to 45 percent in Honduras. About one fifth of all, households in

Latin America had incomes that were insufficient to pay for an adequate diet.

Xusgrove's (1985) study of nutrition in 10 Latin American cities in 1966-69

confirmed    the high levels of destitution poverty, ranging from 18 percent in
Caracas to 56 percent in Quito. Table 8 shows different estimates of the
percentage of population living in poverty in 1970 for 12 Latin American
countries,
             The basic survey data from which the indices of poverty are drawn
present many problems. These surveys undercount disproportionately poor groups
and those in surveys underreport their incomes (as shown by comparisons with
independent sources of data). One    therefore   has more confidence in the
measurement   of trends than in figures for any one year. Molina (1982)

published an update of Altimir's work, based on the assumption that poverty

lines grew at one-fourth the rate of average income i,n any country. Despite

considerable    growth in the 1970s, the consequences are disappointing. Table 9

shows only a slight drop in the percentage of the population living in poverty

in most countries in 1981 compared to 1970. with substantial progress in

Brazil and Mexico. Because of their weight in regional total, the incidence of

poverty in Latin America dropped from 39 percent to 35 percent. Nonetheless,

the numbers of poor increased.

              Although the number of poor increased, they undoubtedly saw some

improvement in their standard of living between 1950 and 1980 as health and

schooling improved. Growth of the urban population brought expanded

opportunities. Life expectancy in Latin America increased from 55 years in

1960 to 63.7 years in 1980 and infant mortality declined 107 per thousand to

69 per thousand. Access to literacy rose. The data in table 10 show a strong

positive correlation between incomes per head and life expectancy, as well as

between incomes per head and life expectancy. There is no correlation between

tncoaes per   head and infant mortality   rates.

             Aggregates may overstate. Merrick (1989), for instance, asserts the

existence of a dual population structure in Brazil. He shows a modem

demographic elite passing through the mortality transition and into controlled

natality at a pace similar to late industrializing societies. This southeast-

urban sector coexists with the northeast-rural sector where high fertility and

mortality rates correspond to the level of traditional underdeveloped

societies.

           Relative shares of income also count. They are relevant not only to

 issues of equity, but to the assessment of policies to overcome absolute

poverty. Average income per capita in most Latin American countries exceeds

 chat in the majority of African and Asian countries1 yet extreme poverty

persists as a result of unequal income distribution. In the Latin American

context it is impossible to look at poverty without considering redistribution

as a potential solution.

           Table 11 presents the share of the richest quintile as a multiple

of the poorest quintile, as well, as Cmi      indices   for 13 Latin American

countries. The levels of inequality depicted 'by these indices are striking as

they exceed those found in most other parts of the developing world. There is

little indication that the situation has much improved after 1970. Moreover1

there is reason to believe that the l980s has shown an increased share of

income going to capital and declines to labor, thereby leading to further

deterioration. While efforts to eradicate absolute poverty appear feasible in

resource cost1 although difficult to implement, relative inequality may prove

much more stubborn. From the standpoint of politics, extreme relative

inequality may create a   discontent that hampers effective economic policies.
What can_be done?

           Between the l9SOs and 1980s different strategies to attack poverty

became fashionable. From an emphasis upon economic growth, focus shifted to

the basic needs approach and now back again to the belief that only growth can

reduce poverty. But despite the limited aggregate resources needed to reduce

destitution poverty, projects have failed successfully to target the poor.

They have increased as fast as population. And the promise of growth has given

way to a lost decade of development in the 1980s.

             Peasant leaders and leftist politicians claim that land reform is

the solution to poverty and inequality in the rural areas of Latin Merica.

-History shows that it succeeded politically only when imposed by revolutionary

governments committed to breaking the power of the landed oligarchy. But in

four countries in the region where it took place (Mexico, Cuba, Peru and

Nicaragua) it achieved neither social justice nor economic efficiency. The

Bolivian outcome seems to have been somewhat more successful. Agrarian reform

has tended to recede as an option since the Alliance for Progress, in favor of

urban migration and     agricultural   credit as a solution to rural poverty.

             In the absence of a revolution (and even that     does   not appear to be

sufficient) what can be done? Glewwe and         van dat Gag (t98) divide policies
to assist the poor into three types: relative price changes, direct transfers

and changing the characteristics of the poor.

             Changing   relative prices remains the most   common strategy despite

compelling   criticism.   The costs of this policy include significant leakages as

well as large efficiency costs. Their appeal is their immediate, if only

nominal,   consequences. These are deceptive. One      valid conclusion   from the

Latin American experience is that government ordered nominal wage increases as

a tool of redistribution do not work.

             Direct transfers have a big advantage: they directly benefit the

poor. Their limitation derives from the difficulty of targeting and the
                                        37




absence of a vocal constituency. The poor are seen as undeserving of special

efforts and there is concern that no permanent gains will be realized. The

fiscal constraint faced by most Latin American governments precludes much

advance on this front. Indeed there has probably been retrogression as

expenditures in behalf of the poorest may have suffered proportionally larger

cuts.

           Changing the characteristics of the poor remains the most appealing

strategy because it removes one of the most important causes of poverty. The

most general characteristic of the poor in Latin America is an inferior

educational background in both formal schooling and skills training.

           There   are significant externalities for growth itself from
expenditures on publicly provided education and health services. Primary
education is an important means for raising productivity and hence growth.
This also holds true for health expenditures. Correa (1970) has argued that
improvements   in health and nutrition added 0.12 to 0.93 percentage points to
                                                                                 -

the rate of economic growth in nine Latin American countries between 1950-62.

Norman Hicks (1980) has estimated that a 10 year increase in life expectancy

raises per capita CD? growth rates by 1.1 percentage points and a 10

percentage points increase in literacy rates raise per capita GD? growth by

0.3 percentage point,. David Wheeler's (1980) findings indicate significant

impact on growth rates from increases in calorie intake and in literacy rates.

Robin Morris's (1982) study found that primary education enrollments had a

favorable effect on growth race, of per capita income.
                                       38




            In the end, the stark poverty and income distribution problem in

Latin America measure the failure of the post-War development process. No

exclusive strategy can work. Restored economic growth, more attention to

absolute poverty and basic needs as well as a continuing commitment to

increased capability and mobility are necessary. As significant as technical

design is the inability politically to reconcile attention to poverty and

inequality with policies that sustain macro-economic equilibrium and economic

growth.




V. CONCLUSIONS

           Latin America now faces the 1990s. The experience during the thirty

years from 1950 to 1980 provides bases both for optimis. as well as caution.

Countries in the region have demonstrated a capacity for sustained expansion

at relatively high rates over an extended period of time. In so doing, they

have also demonstrated a degree of adaptability and pragmatism. Ideology has

not dominated economic policy-making over extended periods in the face of poor

performance -

           On the debit side, countries have failed to establish a record of

credible and consistent policy. The public sector stands out as a major

weakness. Instead of a progressive strengthening, one sees accelerating

debility in many countries. Recovering the ability to lead the development

process is necessary but not easy. Several political leaders have tried

without much success, as inflation barometers sadly register.
                                        39




            Most fundamentally, poverty and   distribution   problems loon as

powerful obstacles to the reqaired increases in    investment   ratios that

virtually   all countries must undertake in order to resume growth at
satisfactory   rates. The prospects for zero-sum perspectives seem more probable

than cooperative solutions. The proliferation of capital flight creates even

more diversity of interest and unequalizing claims on wealth.

            Technocratic solutions, predominant in many countries from the mid-

l960s, do not seem to be an answer that will hold in the future. For one, in

many instances it was the technocrats that papered over the fragilities of the

1970. and provoked a much worse reaction in the 1980.. For another, the

opening of politics precludes such a reversion. Instead one will have to rely

on more limited areas of regulation and intervention and more decentralization

and use of .arket signals. Perhaps by focusing on social policy1 the great

failure of growth until now, arid by providing scope for more, but not

exclusive, private initiative, a more appropriate Latin American model will

begin to unfold.
