                                           ABSTRACT

We explore the dynamics of the agricultural ladder (the progression from laborer to cropper to renter)
in the U.S. before 1940 using individual-level data from a survey of farmers conducted in 1938 in
Jefferson County, Arkansas. Using information on each individual’s complete career history (their
tenure status at each date, in some cases as far back as 1890), their location, and a variety of their
personal and farm characteristics, we develop and test hypotheses to explain the time spent as a
tenant, sharecropper, and wage laborer. The pessimistic view of commentators who saw
sharecropping and tenancy as a trap has some merit, but individual characteristics played an
important role in mobility. In all periods, some farmers moved up the agricultural ladder quite
rapidly while others remained stuck on a rung. Ascending the ladder was an important route to
upward mobility, particularly for blacks, before large-scale migration from rural to urban places.

I.      INTRODUCTION

        Tenancy has been a prominent feature of agriculture since before the Roman Empire. Yet

we know little about the dynamics of the mobility that individuals experience as they move

among tenure classes. What makes it easier for a wage worker or sharecropper to become a

renter? How likely were renters to fall in status and become sharecroppers or laborers? And how

long did movement up the farm hierarchy take? Though we now know a great deal about tenancy

from cross-sectional studies, little is known about its role in the careers of individual farmers.

This study provides longitudinal evidence for Southern Black farmers in the early twentieth

century and offers a glimpse at the forces shaping their career paths.

        A better understanding of the forces shaping mobility in agriculture will produce several

benefits. The first is a more realistic picture of the experience of individual farmers. For

example, one of the problems associated with tenancy is inadequate attention to the long-run

viability of the land if they are short-term renters rather than long-term tenants or owners. If

tenants expect a long tenure as a residual claimant their incentive to mine the soil is reduced.1

More importantly without data on individual farmers it is impossible to account for the

unobserved characteristics of farmers (e.g. ability, entrepreneurship and willingness to work).

        A better understanding of the extent of tenure mobility can also shed light on views

toward redistributive policies. Americans may accept greater income inequality than Europeans

because of a perception in the United States that individuals are more likely than Europeans to

increase their income or otherwise improve their status over time.2 In societies where there is

little mobility up the tenurial ladder, the electorate tends to support land reform efforts and other

  We explore the issue of stasis for tenants and sharecroppers but not for owners. For owners we will explore this
issue in greater detail in future work using the 25,000 surviving schedules from the 1920 Agricultural Census in
Alston and Ferrie, “Farm Tenure.”

  On the trade-off between mobility and redistribution, see the review by Putterman, Roemer, and Sylvestre (1996).

political interventions in land markets. For example, one of the turning points in Argentine

history was imposition of rent controls in the Pampas in the 1940s (Alston and Gallo, 2004). In

short, the United States has been (and is) perceived as the “land of opportunity.” This popular

notion has much anecdotal support but it is difficult to test.3 The notion of the U.S. as a land of

opportunity came under attack in the early twentieth century as the agricultural sector suffered

through two decades of high farm failures in the 1920s and 1930s.4 We will assess the causes of

mobility in agriculture at the individual-level and how the “boom” years surrounding the First

World War, and the “bust” years of the interwar period and Great Depression affected mobility.

Our analysis will focus on black farmers, most of whom worked on plantations. To the extent

that this group of farmers experienced upward mobility during a time of extreme legal and social

discrimination, we can only infer that the “average American” fared better.

         Finally, knowing more about career mobility in farming will contribute to our

understanding of the geographic and occupational mobility of Americans more generally. Studies

of occupational mobility have focused on urban settings where movement from worse to better

occupations is easy to identify. But until 1920, more Americans lived in rural places than in

urban ones, and even as late as the 1940s agriculture accounted for nearly a quarter of the

employed labor force.5 We know little about how much improvement people could expect when

they remained in the farm sector, though that expectation no doubt shaped their decisions

regarding movement from farms to towns and cities. Though this geographic movement was

dramatic in the case of some groups (such as blacks), we know far more about the circumstances

they faced in the urban places to which they moved than about the opportunities for advancement

(or the lack of such opportunities) in the rural places they left. An understanding of the dynamics

of the agricultural ladder will tell us more about the circumstances faced at their point of origin

by the millions who abandoned farming for urban pursuits in the first decades of the twentieth

century.

        The occupational changes we observe were quantitatively important as a route to upward

mobility, before large-scale migration from rural to urban places. The mobility experienced in

agriculture compares favorably to both the extent of mobility seen in the general economy before

the Depression and the extent of mobility among males today, particularly for blacks. In the data

we describe below, 39 percent of males who were farm laborers or sharecroppers in their

twenties (almost all of whom were black) had become tenants or owners over the next ten years

– an improvement in their income and autonomy comparable to a change from unskilled to

skilled or white collar work in the non-farm population. Among unskilled males in their twenties

in 1920 in the general population, 53 percent had obtained skilled or white collar jobs by 1930

(55 percent for whites, 38 percent for blacks). Between 1971 and 1981, 44 percent of unskilled

males in their twenties rose into a skilled or white collar job (50 percent for whites, 32 percent

for blacks).6



II.     THE FARM TENANCY “PROBLEM” IN THE 20TH CENTURY U.S.

        Movement from rung to rung has been predominantly in the direction of descent rather
        than ascent…[There is] an increasing tendency for the rungs of the ladder to become
        bars—forcing imprisonment in a fixed social status from which it is increasingly difficult
        to escape.
                National Resources Committee, Report of the President’s Committee on Farm
                Tenancy (1937)


6
  Mobility from 1920 to 1930 was calculated with a random sample of 515 males age 20 to 29 in 1920 linked from
the 1920 One Percent U.S. Census of Population Public Use Sample to the manuscript schedules of the 1930 U.S.
Census of Population. Mobility from 1971 to 1981 was calculated using 793 males age 20 to 29 in 1971 drawn from
the National Longitudinal Survey Young Male cohort. See Ferrie, “Economic Mobility.”


                                                       3
        Though tenancy rates had been climbing consistently from the late nineteenth century,

the distress in the agricultural sector in the 1920s and 1930s provoked alarm among social

commentators and policymakers. They feared that the U.S. was becoming a country of absentee

farm owners. There was considerable variation across regions, with tenancy remaining low in the

Northeast while reaching 42% in the South by 1930.7 The concern over tenancy prompted

numerous reports in the 1920s by researchers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Analysts in

the 1920s generally reached sanguine conclusions regarding tenancy and the prospects for

farmers to ascend the agricultural ladder from wage worker to sharecropper (a rung only in the

South) to tenant to owner.8

        In the 1930s the reviews of tenancy were mixed. The Report of the President’s

Committee on Farm Tenancy in 1937, quoted above, was the most alarmist. The President’s

report, in turn, stimulated research on the causes of farm tenancy. Most notable among the

research efforts were: “The Growth of Farm Tenancy in the United States” (1937) by John D.

Black and R.H. Allen, and “Social Status and Farm Tenure – Attitudes and Social Conditions of

Corn Belt and Cotton Belt Farmers” (1938) by E.A. Schuler, writing under the auspices of

USDA, the Farm Security Administration, and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. Black and

Allen attributed a large part of the rise in tenancy to the increased use of croppers instead of farm

laborers in the South.9


7
  The U.S. census defined tenancy rates as the number of sharecroppers plus share and fixed rent tenants as a
percentage of the number of operators, defined as the number of sharecroppers, share and fixed renters plus owners.
The census did not include wage workers as part of farm operators. In our tenancy figures in the text we exclude
sharecroppers because of our belief that sharecroppers were more akin to wage workers than tenants. If we include
sharecroppers as tenants the percentage of tenancy in the South reached 56% in 1930. See Alston and Kauffman
(1997) for estimates of croppers in 1900 and 1910 and revised estimates of “true tenancy.”
8
  See for example the excellent studies by L.C. Gray et al. (1924) and E.A. Goldenweiser and Leon E. Truesdell
(1924).
9
  Most scholars in the 1920s and 1930s were well aware of the important distinction between croppers and tenants.
The census continued to consider croppers a subgroup of tenants, “yet nothing could be more misleading than such a
grouping.” [Brandt (1938), p. 24].


                                                         4
       Consistent with the economists in the USDA in the 1920s, both Black and Allen and

Schuler believed that to understand the tenancy issue required looking at all the rungs of the

agricultural ladder (wage laborer, cropper, tenant, and owner) and then assessing the causes of

movements up, down, and off the ladder. On the basis of census data (or at times educated

guesswork), Black and Allen reached several conclusions: 1) the rate of ascent on the

agricultural ladder was relatively constant over the first three decades of the twentieth century,

but entrants started at lower rungs over time; 2) there was considerable variation across regions

(mostly accounted for by differences in crops) in the number of farmers on each rung; 3)

prosperity (1900-1920) or depression (the 1890s and the interwar period) were major

determinants of the number of farmers on each rung; and 4) croppers were on the decline in the

1930s as a result of tractorization, relief work, and the policies of the Agricultural Adjustment

Acts. Black and Allen had to rely on their intuition for several of their conclusions because the

Census has never systematically collected data on full-time laborers. This issue has hampered

research on the agricultural ladder because changes in tenancy (including sharecroppers) could

result from either movements out of or into the wage labor category or movements into or out of

the ownership category. On these movements rest many welfare implications concerning not

only the farm sector in the historical U.S. but also in developing and transition economies.

       Schuler more systematically addressed the tenancy question through a survey in 1938 of

2,700 farmers in two of the major farming regions in the U.S., the cotton and corn belts. The

surveys produced occupational and locational histories of the farmers along with individual

characteristics of the farmers: year and place of birth, father’s tenure status, years of schooling,

age at leaving home, years and amounts of any inheritance, marital status, and relationship to the

landowner. By looking at aggregated regional averages and using bivariate ocular regression




                                                  5
techniques (i.e., eyeballing the data), Schuler reached several general conclusions: 1) there was

considerable variation across regions and between races in movements up and down the

agricultural ladder; 2) inheritance caused a substantial boost up the agricultural ladder; and 3)

education provided more of a boost for black southern farmers than for northern or southern

white farmers.

       Prior to Schuler, L. C. Gray et al. (1924) addressed the issue of farm mobility. Using data

from the 1920 Census of Agriculture, the authors found that for the U.S. as a whole, 42% of

farmers who became tenants between 1915 and 1920 had previously worked for wages, while

47% started their careers as tenants [Gray et al. (1924): 553-554]. The percentage of tenants who

never worked for wages was much higher in the South because of the census classification of

croppers as tenants. Consistent with this interpretation, Gray et al. found that the average ages at

which farm laborers became farm tenants was lowest in the South, though counting croppers as

tenants. They also found signs of falling down the agricultural ladder: in 1920 for the U.S. as a

whole, eleven percent of farm tenants had once been owners. This fraction was as high as one-

third in some of the Rocky Mountain and desert states [Gray et al. (1924): 556]. The authors

also track the length of time spent at various rungs on the agricultural ladder prior to reaching

ownership. Typically, the longer a state had been occupied, the longer it took to become an

owner. The authors caution not to attach welfare implications to the varying periods of time it

takes to reach ownership. They argued that several factors account for the increase in tenancy:

time spent in education prior to farming, different capital requirements, and different age

structures of the resident population.

III.     JEFFERSON COUNTY AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COTTON REGION


         In our own work we can better assess the determinants of movements on the agricultural

ladder than our predecessors could in the 1920s and 1930s, or our contemporaries can today.10

Our approach relies on the 227 extant manuscripts for Jefferson County, Arkansas from the

larger study produced by Schuler in 1938 for the Farm Security Administration.11 Fortunately,

we are able to reach general conclusions about tenure mobility because Jefferson County appears

quite representative of the cotton South.

         Jefferson County is located just southeast of the center of Arkansas (at 34.26° north

latitude, 91.92° west longitude. The county was established in 1829 and was, as early as the

1830s, recognized as extremely productive land for cotton cultivation.12 Figure 1 shows the

location of Melton Township, the area sampled by Schuler in Jefferson County. It lies roughly 20

miles southeast of Pine Bluff, the county seat, below the Arkansas River which bisects the

county, in alluvial lowlands, “comprised of soils and silt, etc. . . . very fertile and adaptable to

cultivation.”13

         The county as a whole, but particularly the portion of it containing Melton Township, is

quite representative of the Cotton Belt. Figures 2 through 5 compare Jefferson County’s

characteristics to those of counties in Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and

Georgia. In most respects (racial make-up, tenancy and crop value in cotton), Jefferson County


10
   The best treatment of movement on the ladder is the work of Atack (1988 and 1989) but Atack was forced to draw
inferences from cross-sectional data.
11
   The schedules are located in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division of the University of Arkansas Library at
Fayetteville, in the records of the University’s Department of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology.
12
   The county’s early agricultural and commercial histories are summarized in Betty Hollis Garman, “An Economic
History of Jefferson County, Arkansas, From Reconstruction through World War I,” Jefferson County Historical
Quarterly (1981).
13
   The county’s characteristics are described in detail in the Federal Writers Project county history available at the
Pine Bluff – Jefferson County Public Library (Jefferson County, Ark., History, compiled by the Federal Writers
Project of the Works Progress Administration for the State of Arkansas, n.d., n.p.).

lies in the same quartile of the distribution as other counties in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta and

in the Cotton Belt. Researchers in the 1920s and 1930s recognized that Jefferson County was

representative of the South’s Delta cotton plantation areas: a 1937 survey of Arkansas cotton

plantations includes several units in the portion of Jefferson County containing Melton

Township, while an examination of land tenure in Arkansas groups Jefferson County with “Delta

type” counties along the Mississippi and lower Arkansas rivers.14

        Only in the fraction of its labor force engaged in farming (Figure 2) does Jefferson

County differ substantially from these places. This reflects the presence of several industries that

provided off-farm employment. As early as 1859, Jefferson County “was one of the most

important manufacturing counties in the state,” with most of this activity occurring in Pine

Bluff.15 In June, 1935, Pine Bluff had forty-seven large manufacturing firms and thirty five

smaller industrial plants.16 These included lumber mills manufacturing oak flooring, firms

manufacturing brakes and bodies for automobiles, and cotton oil mills.17 The impact of these off-

farm employment opportunities on our analysis of mobility up and down the agricultural ladder

is likely to increase the amount of time that farmers spend in employment outside agriculture

during their careers, compared to other Cotton Belt counties. It is impossible to determine the

direction of the bias this imparts to our measures of upward and downward movement along the

agricultural ladder without knowing how agricultural and industrial employment were correlated

and whether the same individuals who did best in farming were also those with the skills to fare

best in manufacturing.

          In Table 1, we compare the characteristics of farmers in our sample to all the farms in

Jefferson County and to all the farms in Arkansas. In most respects, the sample straddles the data

for the county and the state. This is the result of the sampling strategy used by Schuler’s team: it

sought responses from tenure classes that corresponded to the shares of those classes engaged in

cotton farming.

        We can also compare our sample to the U.S. Census Public Use Samples for Jefferson

County for the period 1900 to 1920 (Table 2). Except for percent born out of state, our sample

matches up fairly well with the census data. This is important because the data in the Schuler

study were collected retrospectively, so only those still in agriculture in 1938 could have their

agricultural career histories recorded. For example, a farmer who began farming in 1910, but

who had moved out of agriculture by 1930 would not show up in Schuler's data. If the

characteristics of those in the Schuler data at census dates in the past are similar to those in the

county population generally at those dates, then we can have some confidence that the

retrospective nature of the survey is not causing us to miss farmers "falling off" the agricultural

ladder who differ systematically from those who remained on the ladder and whom we can

observe. The close correspondence between the Schuler data in 1900, 1910, and 1920 and the

population of the county's farmers at those dates suggests that this bias is not substantial.

        The cross-sectional characteristics of the Schuler data for Jefferson County are thus


                                                  12
reasonably representative of the counties in the Delta where plantation cultivation of cotton was

prevalent. The longitudinal characteristics of the Jefferson County data also point to its

representativeness. When career mobility among tenure classes in our sample data from

Jefferson County is compared in Table 3 to tenure mobility for the entire South in Schuler’s

published tables, it is clear that Jefferson County looks much like the rest of the cotton regions in

the South. For example, in both Jefferson County and in the whole South, 85 percent of those

who started their careers as owners remained owners at the end of their careers, while just under

a third of those who started as renters ended up in a higher status (as owners).

IV.     DETERMINANTS OF MOBILITY ON THE AGRICULTURAL LADDER

        For agriculture, ascension on the ladder is a good indicator of economic mobility because

as workers ascend, their incomes increase.18 For example, Blalock (1937) reports average net

income in 1934 for agricultural workers in the Arkansas River plantation region of $226 for

wage workers, $233 for sharecroppers, and $386 for tenants. These figures include adjustments

for “home use products.” The income of wage laborers and sharecroppers was thus similar, but

the step up to tenant represented an income increase of 66%. The real earnings of wage laborers

and sharecroppers compare favorably to wages received by unskilled workers in manufacturing

until 1933 when New Deal policies boosted relative manufacturing wages, though at the expense

of increased urban unemployment.19 In income terms, the step up to tenant was similar to

moving from the unskilled to the skilled category in manufacturing.

        The theoretical underpinnings of the agricultural ladder are similar (and indeed

intellectually prior) to the underpinnings of the age-earnings profile used in labor economics.

Over time workers acquire both human and physical capital enabling them to ascend the ladder,

which is akin to a promotion in pay and status. Along the career trajectory exogenous events

such as wartime prices or depressions can cause ascents or descents from one tenure category to

another. Equally important are individual characteristics such as thrift, luck or hard work. In

addition, an inheritance can quickly bounce a farmer up the ladder to tenant or owner.

18
   Incomes increase for two reasons: farmers take on more risk and hence need to be compensated; and the incentive
for landlords to monitor workers decreases and workers capture some of the decrease in monitoring costs in higher
incomes.
19
   For estimates of the earnings gap between agricultural and manufacturing laborers for 1925 to 1941, see Alston
and Hatton (1991).


                                                        14
         Rather than presenting an overarching theoretical framework for tenure mobility, we will

develop hypotheses for the dynamics of tenure mobility in the early part of the twentieth century

though our hypotheses have relevance for tenure mobility in other times and places. The

literature on agricultural tenancy broadly speaking focuses on transaction cost and risk.20

         Transaction cost determinants of contract form generally fall into the categories of

supervision and enforcement costs. Our measures for supervision costs and enforcement costs

include individual-level measures for age, education, inheritance and the cohort effects of war

and depression. Before conducting empirical tests we will flesh out the roles of supervision and

enforcement costs in tenure mobility.

Supervision Costs

         As farmers ascend the agricultural ladder, landlords have a decreasing need to supervise

the labor effort of farmers. As labor moves from wage worker to cropper to tenant and ultimately

to ownership, the share of net output going to the operator increases, which increases the

incentive for work effort. The contractual form chosen will be closely related to the incentive for

the landowner to monitor work effort. It is not only labor effort in the fields that needs to be

monitored. Individuals have an incentive to monitor the use of all assets that they bring to the

production process, though labor-monitoring costs can be considered a residual to the monitoring

of the other assets.21

         Consider the following simplified production process for cotton. Output is a function of

land (quantity and quality), physical capital (a mule or horse or tractor), human capital of the



20
   We will not directly test for the importance of risk but tangentially will do so through cohort effects. For a
discussion of the role of risk in agricultural contracts, see Allen and Lueck (1999). They find little evidence for the
role of risk in shaping tenancy arrangements.
21
   If one farmer supplies all inputs to the production process, then all costs of stinting or abuse are internalized so
monitoring costs disappear.


                                                           15
farm owner and operator, labor effort, and uncertain weather.22 We assume that the market for

inputs is competitive and endowments vary across farmers (e.g., some farmers have land and

mules and are looking to hire labor, and some laborers have farm experience and mules and are

searching for land). How do suppliers and demanders of inputs match up? This is best illustrated

with an example. Suppose a resident farm owner with considerable farming experience and a

mule is looking for a laborer. He is willing to supply all the inputs except labor effort. Given his

endowment, what would be the best match? He would search for a laborer who has no capital

and little farming experience. In this way, he would get the best return on his human and

physical capital. In this situation, the landowner has an incentive to be in the fields to monitor his

physical capital (the mule in particular) to prevent its depreciation, and to furnish directions

(human capital). Given the presence of the landlord for these reasons, the marginal cost of

monitoring labor effort is low; there are economies of scope in monitoring.23 When workers are

endowed with more physical or human capital, the landlord cannot benefit from such economies

of scope; as a result the direct costs of monitoring the labor effort of these workers is greater than

for workers with less capital. To reduce the costs of monitoring better-endowed workers,

landlords will negotiate contracts higher on the agricultural ladder. Similarly if certain crops are

more soil-depleting (e.g., row crops compared to grain crops), then owners will have an incentive

to limit output. One mechanism is to negotiate more share relative to fixed-rent contracts because

the tenant will have less incentive to maximize short-run yields at the expense of long-run soil

fertility.24


22
   In the absence of weather-related shocks that produce uncertain effects on output, landlords could presumably
measure labor effort by observing output and reward or punish workers accordingly. It is the uncertainty of the
impact of the shock on output that prevents contingent contracting.
23
   Alston and Higgs (1982) developed the hypotheses about economies of scope in monitoring. Similar to Alston and
Higgs, Eswaran and Kotwal (1985) provide an endowment model of managerial ability to explain the mix of
contracts – fixed-wage, share, and fixed-rent.
24
   Allen and Lueck (1992) found evidence consistent with this hypothesis.


                                                       16
         An important means of acquiring physical capital is an inheritance. An inheritance could

enable a worker to purchase a mule, thereby increasing the likelihood of being a tenant, or if the

inheritance is more substantial it may enable a tenant to purchase a farm and ascend to the owner

rung.

         From our data we can construct several proxies for the human and physical capital of

workers. We have the following measures of human capital: age, marital status, schooling, years

on farm, and years in the county. Workers who are older, married, better schooled, longer on

their present farm, or longer in the county or state should be at higher rungs on the agricultural

ladder. For the physical capital of workers and landlords, we have the year and amount of any

inheritances. To the extent workers possess greater capital, they should be on higher rungs.

Enforcement Costs

         Enforcement costs of labor effort result from efforts to ensure an adequate labor supply

during peak demand, which for cotton is the harvest. During peak demand, piece rates and day

wages increase giving an incentive for some workers to abandon their current employment.

Higher tenure status decreases the incentive for abandonment because higher tenure status brings

with it expected higher post-harvest remuneration. The enforcement costs to landlords increase

as labor becomes scarcer. As such, boom times (e.g., the war years), should be associated with

ascension up the agricultural ladder and conversely depression years should be associated with

movements down the ladder.25 The war years brought boom times to agriculture until prices fell

drastically, beginning in July 1920. The bust in prices brought unparalleled levels of farm

failures during subsequent inter-war years.

         Prosperity on the farm should affect all rungs of the ladder. Prosperity should enable


25
  Ideally, one would control for the independent effect of gains or losses of physical capital but we can do so only
through inheritance.


                                                          17
wage workers and croppers to accumulate the capital necessary to become tenants. On the other

hand farm distress in the form of farm foreclosures affects primarily the highest levels of the

tenure ladder. When foreclosure rates are high, we should see some of our owners fall to the

tenant rung or at times all the way to wage laborer. Correspondingly, high foreclosure rates

bring low farm prices and some of our tenants may ascend to the ownership rung. Similarly, for

tenants a bad year may entail having to sell a mule and falling to the cropper rung, while for

croppers, depressed mule prices may enable some to climb to the tenant rung. Whether falling

down or rising up the agricultural ladder dominates is an empirical question. With our sample

from Jefferson County we will be able to compare the time spent as a wage earner or cropper

compared to time as a tenant for good and bad years.26

         Another enforcement cost issue is the potential for underreporting of output. Allen and

Lueck (1999) argue that yield variability affects the ability of share tenants to cheat landlords by

underreporting the output. As such, they expect to observe more fixed-rent contracts where

yields are more variable. Though we do not dismiss this as a possible factor affecting tenure

category we will control for it by the nature of holding crop constant and combining fixed-rent

and share tenants.27 Additionally, underreporting cotton is more difficult than underreporting

other crops because of ginning at a central location.


V.        ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE AGRICULTURAL LADDER

         In our analysis, because we have too few observations on whites and owners we focus on

only black workers who started their agricultural careers as wage workers, sharecroppers, or

tenants. The Schuler sample for Jefferson County is overwhelmingly black (85%), reflecting the

26
   Alston (1981) found that wage contracts were more prevalent in regions with a more abundant supply of farm
labor.
27
   Higgs (1974) found that risk was a primary factor explaining the cross-state variation in the use of fixed-rent and
share tenant contracts.

dominance of plantation farming in Melton Township. During the period we examine, blacks in

the South faced overt social and legal discrimination.28 To the extent that we find mobility, it is

testimony to the hard work of individuals within a competitive market environment.29 Our

sample consists of individuals who have 3,627 opportunities for ascent or descent from year to

year. In Table 5 we show the yearly movements from rung to rung. Overall, stasis is the most

likely outcome. Wage workers are the most mobile with 12% moving yearly to the sharecropper

rung, 3% to tenancy, and 1% to ownership. Sharecroppers are more likely to move up than down

the ladder: 1.4% of the yearly movement is into the wage category and 5% is into tenancy or

ownership. This is somewhat surprising given that 25% of our moves are in depression years.

Though 94% of the possible movement for tenants is stasis, the downward mobility to

sharecropper or wage is about 2.5% points greater than the upward movement to ownership.

Because 44% of the possible moves for all categories are from the sharecropper rung, upward

mobility exceeded downward mobility overall.30 Stasis from year to year and particularly over

category. About 25 percent of possible moves occur during the Depression years of 1930-1937.

The boom years of the War and immediate post-war period (1917-1920) account for 16 percent

of possible moves.

Note: The sample is restricted to Blacks who were Laborers, Croppers, or Tenants at time t-1. δs are the ordered
probit regression coefficients. ∂ Pr(Lt)/ ∂ Xj is the change in the probability (evaluated at the sample means) of
becoming a Laborer at time t associated with a one unit change in the variable Xj. The marginal effects for becoming
a Cropper (C) , Tenant (T), or Owner (O) are defined analogously. The regression uses the Huber-White sandwich
estimator to adjust the variance-covariance matrix to correct for correlated responses from cluster samples (Huber,
P.J., Proc Fifth Berkeley Symposium Math Stat 1:221-33, 1967; White, H.,. Econometrica 50:1-25, 1982).

standard errors corrected for clustering.31 In order to account for the high degree of stasis shown

in Table 5, we estimate Pij(t), which is the probability that an individual i was in tenure category j

(=laborer, cropper, tenant, owner) at time t, as a function of his characteristics at time t, Xi(t), and

his tenure status at time t-1, Pij(t-1). This is a first-order Markov chain:

                                        Pij (t) = f(Pij(t-1), β′Xi(t), :i(t))

where β′ is a vector of coefficients to estimate and :i(t) is a random error term. The individual’s

previous tenure status is introduced by including interactions between dummies for having been

a laborer, cropper, or tenant at time t-1 into the ordered probit regression. To take advantage of

the panel structure of the data (with repeated observations on the same individuals over a number

of years), we correct the standard errors for clustering, allowing :i(t) to be correlated over t

within the career of any individual i.

         The marginal effects are calculated at the mean age and years in tenure status for the time

t-1 tenure class, and the omitted category for the time dummies (pre-1916). The estimates

demonstrate that agriculture provided some upward mobility for blacks in the cotton belt, though

for laborers and croppers, this mobility was not positively associated with age. In fact, a standard

deviation increase in age for black wage workers (10 years) decreased the likelihood of moving

to the cropper rung by 31 percentage points and increased the probability of remaining in the

laborer category by the same magnitude. To the extent that movement upward from laborer

occurs, it must result from unobserved individual heterogeneity (luck or hard work) or from the

impact of particular time periods. As it does for wage workers, individual variation in initiative

or good luck influences the movement of croppers. Age does not influence moving from

sharecropper to tenant or from cropper to laborer. Age does, however, result in a greater
31
  We also estimated the coefficients with an ordered probit regression controlling for random effects. The two
estimations yielded the same substantive results so we only report the estimates with the standard errors corrected
for clustering.

likelihood that tenants will become owners (and a reduced likelihood that tenants will fall to

cropper). This is consistent with the view that over time tenants accumulated physical capital to

weather a few bad years. A standard deviation increase in age for tenants (12 years) reduces the

likelihood of falling down the ladder to cropper by 11 percentage points, while raising the

likelihood of attaining ownership by 9 percentage points. Years in their current status had an

impact on subsequent status for both croppers and tenants: more time spent as a cropper reduced

the odds of moving up to tenant, while increasing the odds of remaining a cropper or falling to

laborer, and more time as a tenant increased the odds of falling to cropper and reduced the odds

of moving up to owner. A standard deviation increase in time as a cropper (9 years) made

moving up to tenant 1 percentage point less likely and made remaining a cropper 0.4 percentage

points more likely and falling to laborer 0.7 percentage points more likely.

         The Depression hit tenants the hardest. In each year of the Depression, tenants had a

seventeen percentage point increased likelihood of falling down the ladder to cropper. The

Depression also reduced the upward mobility and increased the downward mobility of croppers,

though the effect was smaller than that for tenants: croppers saw the probability of ascent and

descent fall and rise by 2% points. The war years generally reduced upward mobility for laborers

and had no substantial impact on mobility for croppers or tenants. For tenants, the likelihood of

falling down the ladder was small, which is what we expected given the high wartime prices of

cotton. The interwar years had an impact for both laborers and tenants: laborers were less likely

to move up to cropper and tenants were less likely to become owners and more like to end up as

croppers than in the years before World War I.32

        Table 8 adds two variables that measure the individual’s capital: years of schooling


32
  We find this result somewhat surprising given the high level of foreclosures. We thought that this would increase
the likelihood of tenants acquiring a farm.

   estimator to adjust the variance-covariance matrix to correct for correlated responses from cluster samples (Huber,
   P.J., Proc Fifth Berkeley Symposium Math Stat 1:221-33, 1967; White, H.,. Econometrica 50:1-25, 1982).




                                                                24
(human capital) and the dollar value of any inheritances received in year t-1 (financial capital).

Schooling was generally beneficial, promoting some upward mobility for croppers and tenants

and preventing some downward movement.33 Its impact for laborers, however, was to reduce

mobility. A standard deviation increase in schooling for laborers (2.5 years) was associated with

a greater probability of remaining a laborer (13 percentage points), and an equal decrease in the

probability of rising to sharecropper. For croppers, a standard deviation increase in schooling had

a small (0.3 percentage point) negative effect on remaining a cropper. Tenants were 2.5

percentage points more likely to become owners if they had an additional standard deviation of

schooling, and correspondingly less likely to fall to cropper.

         No one who was a tenant received an inheritance in year t-1, so the importance of

inheritances could be assessed only for those who were laborers or croppers at time t-1. The

receipt of an inheritance in year t-1 made upward movement from laborer to tenant more likely:

an increase in the inheritance of one standard deviation ($70) made a laborer 8 percentage points

more likely to rise to cropper, and 7 percentage points less likely to remain a laborer.

         When the coefficients are examined jointly, it becomes clear how individuals could

become trapped at particular rungs on the ladder. For example, for an individual who began his

career as a wage worker, each additional year of age increased the probability that the individual

would remain a wage worker by 2 percentage points. Each additional year as a wage worker

raised the probability of escaping this category by only 0.8 percentage points, so absent any other

change, the passage of time would continuously reduce the individual’s odds of moving up. The

receipt of an inheritance, however, would be to bump the wage worker up onto a more favorable

trajectory.

  This is consistent with Schuler’s overall observation that schooling was particularly beneficial for blacks in the
South.

VI.     Conclusion

        Despite the legal and social discrimination faced by blacks in the plantation South in the

early part of the twentieth century, there was some economic mobility. The mobility experienced

over the course of a decade was similar in magnitude and character to that observed for blacks in

the general population in the 1920s and even in the 1970s. Both the interwar years and the

Depression increased the likelihood of tenants falling to cropper and reduced their ability to

attain ownership status. The Depression years increased the likelihood of laborers rising to the

sharecropper level. We also find some evidence of an upward sloping age tenure profile, though

the magnitude of the effect of age is not as great as the magnitude of unobserved individual

effects. For many, a career in agriculture was akin to climbing with the aid of an escalator while

for others it was like Sisyphus pushing his rock up the mountain.34 The difference between

ascension and entrapment was individual initiative or good luck.
