Is A Great Labor Shortage Coming? Replacement Demand in the Global Economy

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the claim the the US faces an impending labor shortage due to the impending retirement
of baby boomers and slow growth of the US work force, and that the country should orient labor market
and educational policies to alleviate this prospective shortage. I find that this analysis is flawed, by
making growth of GDP the target of economic policy and by paying inadequate attention to the huge
supply of qualified low wage workers in the global economy. My analysis shows that the projections
of future demands for skills lack the reliability to guide policies on skill development, and that contrary
to the assumption implicit in the shortage analyses, demographic changes have not historically been
consistently associated with changes in labor market conditions. I argue that if there is to be a shortage,
the country should allow the competitive market to raise labor compensation rather than to adopt policies
to keep labor costs low.

       The sky is falling down, the sky is falling down ...
       I must go and tell the king ...
       A great labor shortage is coming.


       In the early 2000s, the business press and media began reporting that the US labor market

was on the verge of a major transformation. The retirement of baby boomers and slow projected

growth of the labor force were going to create a great labor shortage. Policy-makers should

forget about the sluggish real wage growth of the past three decades, the deterioration in

pensions and employer provided health care, the “jobless” recovery from the 2001 recession, and

fears of job loss from off shoring or low wage imports and focus on helping business find

workers in the coming shortage.

       The Hudson Institute’s report Beyond Workforce 2020 (Judy and D’Amico, 1997) was

one of the earliest studies to express concern about the possible future shortage of labor, due to

predicted reductions in the growth of labor supply due to the retirement of the baby boom

generation and slackened population growth. Many other groups interpreted government

projections of future labor supplies and employment in a similar manner. The National

Association of Manufacturing warned employers that a gap of 5.3 million skilled workers would

develop by 2010 and expand to 21 million by 2020 (NAM, 2003). The Chamber of Commerce’s

2006 State of American Business Report declared that “We are staring right in the face of a

severe worker shortage as 77 million baby boomers prepare to retire in the next few years— with

a fewer number of younger workers available to replace them.” (U.S. Chamber of Commerce,

2006, p 13). According to Public Power, the magazine for the electrical utility industry “The

coming labor shortage could become the most significant problem the electrical utility industry

will face. BLS estimates shortage of 12 million skilled workers by 2010 and 20 million by
                                                                                                                      2
2020” (Atkinson, Public Power, 2005). Reporting the consensus from the Aspen Institute’s

Domestic Strategy Group, David Ellwood wrote that: "CEOs, labor leaders, community leaders,

all came to the unanimous conclusion that we will have a worker gap that is a very serious one.“

(cited by Overholt, 2004)

         Time Magazine gave the projected labor shortage a positive spin for workers, calling it

The Coming Job: “The help-wanted ads may look thin — but thanks to aging baby boomers,

that'
    s about to change” (Eisenberg, Time, 2002). Going further, one pundit dismissed fears that

off shoring good US jobs overseas would harm workers: “the long term tragedy of off shoring

isn’t that it’s snatching away skilled American jobs but that it isn’t snatching enough of

them”(Kaihla, 2003). The Employment Policy Foundation worried that “if current trends

continue, the labor force will only grow to 165 million by 2030, a shortage of 35 million workers

… (with) serious consequences, slower growth in the standard of living, change in the balance of

payments, “wage-push” inflation, … Inequality, persistent structural unemployment.” (Ed Potter,

Employment Policy Foundation, 2001?). Seemingly concerned that readers would find the

claimed shortage dubious in light of their job market experiences, Fortune headlined its report on

the subject, “Believe It or Not, a Labor Shortage Is Coming” (Fisher, 2003).

         In this paper, I assess the shortage claims1 and the labor supply and demand projections

on which they are based. I conclude that there is no more reason to believe that the US faces a

great future labor shortage than that Chicken Little got it right about the sky falling down. The

retirement of baby boomers and slow growth of the US work force, on which the shortage claims

are based, will most likely have modest and hard to detect impacts on the job market. I argue

that increased supplies of skilled labor in low wage countries will impact US workers more than

slower increases in domestic labor supply. If there is to be a great labor shortage in the

  Economists try to avoid the words shortages and surpluses since in a well-functioning market, prices or wages
adjust so that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium, with no one wanting to sell or buy more. One way to interpret
the wide use of the terms is that they include changes in prices from long run equilibrium values that could have
                                                                                                        3
foreseeable future, it will come from something that the shortage soothsayers ignore – a global

pandemic that kills millions of people – whose implications would go far beyond assuring that

business obtains the labor it may seek 10 or 20 years down the road without incurring higher

wages.

         My conclusion is based on three findings

         1. The logic of labor shortage analyses is flawed. The most dramatic shortage claims

begin with the premise that labor supply should increase to maintain a fixed rate of growth of

GDP – a cart before the horse policy from the perspective of standard welfare analysis. In

addition, none of the shortage analyses pay adequate attention to the global economy, where the

supply of low wage educated workers in less developed countries creates a labor surplus

worldwide, and where other advanced countries are projected to have greater slowdowns in their

labor supplies than the US.

         2. Projections of future demands for skills lack the reliability to guide policies on skill

development. Demand for labor in detailed occupations has historically been more greatly

affected by changes in technology or unexpected changes in the composition of output among

industries than by replacement demand due to retirements. Globalization makes forecasting skill

shortages or surpluses in the US or any specific country more difficult than in the past.

         3. Contrary to the assumption implicit in the shortage analyses, demographic changes

have not historically been consistently associated with fchanges in labor market conditions, even

for the young workers whose position is most sensitive to changing market realities. The

employment and earnings of young workers depends more on macro-economic conditions, wage

setting institutions, and technological developments than on demography.

been avoided if market participants had foreseen the shifts in demand or supply better than they did.
                                                                                                        4
        The most alarmist claims that a great labor shortage is coming assume that the country

should increase total gross domestic product (GDP) in the future at a rate comparable to the

growth rate in the recent past. From 1980 to 2005, US real GDP grew by 3.1 % annually, with

1.4% due to the growth of labor supply and 1.7% to the growth of labor productivity. Given

projected declines in labor force growth to 0.7% per year, the 3.1% growth of GDP will be

unsustainable absent increases in labor productivity above historical levels.2 To maintain past

growth of GDP with 1.7% growth of labor productivity from 2005 to 2030, the US would need

200 million workers in 2030. This is 30 million workers short of the projected labor supply. The

shortfall between the projected growth of the labor force and the growth necessary for 3.1%

growth of GDP defines the coming labor shortage.

        The flaw in this mode of thinking is that it treats GDP rather than GDP per capita as the

touchstone of economic policy, contrary to virtually all analyses of social welfare. As a wealthy

country, the US can increase the rate of growth of GDP whenever it wants. All the US has to do

is to open the borders to additional immigration. Labor supply would increase as much as

desired, raising GDP and returns to capital while reducing wages. Absent an open borders

policy, maintaining a desired growth of GDP in the face of slower growth of labor supply

requires increased labor productivity, which in turn requires additional investment in physical or

human capital or R&D. Since growth of GDP depends on all factors of production, we could

just as well call the likely slower growth of GDP the coming shortage of capital or R&D and

focus policy on ways to create more capital investment and technological advance as well as

ways to increase the quality or quantity of labor.

        If macro-calculations based on maintaining a given growth rate of GDP were the sole

argument for the coming labor shortage, I doubt whether many economists or business leaders

 The data on actual changes in GDP and employment are from the Council of Economic Advisors, Economic
Report of the President 2006, tables A-2 and B-36. The projections are from table 1 of this paper.

would take the claim seriously. What gives credence to the claim are demographic projections

that the US work force will grow more slowly than in the past half century or so, with the growth

concentrated in minority groups that have historically obtained less education and skills than the

majority population, and a widespread belief that demographic changes have huge discernible

impacts on the economy. Shortage analysts fear that a falling growth rate of skilled labor, in

particular, will produce bottlenecks in production that will reduce growth of GDP per capita.

Many argue that the country could avoid these problems by preventive investment in education

and training directed at likely bottleneck or shortage areas.

        Table 1 examines the magnitude of the projected reduction in the growth of labor supply.

It shows the number of persons in the US labor force in each decade from 1950 to 2000 and the

projected labor force from 2000 to 2050; and the absolute change in labor supply from decade to

decade. From 1950 to 2000 the labor force grew by 78.7 million persons or 127%. From 2000

to 2050, the projected growth of the labor force is 50.9 million persons, or 36%. This

deceleration in the rate of growth is expected to be particularly intense from 2010 through 2030,

when just 12.4 million additional persons are expected to join the labor force. The reason for

this timing is the retirement of baby boomers (those born between 1946 and 1964).

        The rapid growth of the work force in the 1950s and 1960s came largely from increased

numbers of woman workers, primarily white women. In the 1970-1990s growth came from

immigration and a continued influx of women into the work force. In the 2000-2050 period

growth of the work force is expected to come disproportionately from Hispanics and blacks –

groups with below average education levels. The share of the US population from disadvantaged

minorities (black, Hispanic, American Indians, Alaska Natives) is projected to rise from 25% in

2000 to 37% in 2050. 3 Some analysts worry that the US work force will become less skilled

unless the country adopts new policies to help these groups improve their educational skills and

attainment. In addition, because the US population will be aging, the number of persons in the

traditional years of retirement will rise relative to the more slowly growing work force,

burdening the work force to produce sufficient output to pay the retirement income and health

costs of the aging population.

The global context

       If the US was the only country in which the growth of the potential work force was

projected to decline rapidly or if the US was a closed economic system, with little access to

workers in other countries, this focus on domestic labor supply to the exclusion of supply

developments elsewhere might be justifiable. But in the global economy, demographic

developments and labor conditions in other countries can affect the US labor market.

Globalization gives US firms access to labor overseas through foreign direct investment, off

shoring, or subcontracting and access to foreign-born labor that immigrates to the US. From this

perspective, it is incumbent to assess the claims of a coming labor shortage in a global context,

rather than to treat the US as a closed economy, dependent only on domestic labor to produce

goods and services.

       As a first step in placing the shortage projections into a global context, I have examined

the actual and projected change in the populations of young persons (those aged 18-23) and of

the 15-59 year olds that make up most of the work force in the US, Western Europe, Japan, and

China and India (See table 2). The underlying projections are from the UN, which forecasts an

aging of the world’s population through 2050, (UN, 2005) and a slowdown in population growth

in much of the world outside of Africa.

       The figures in Panel A of table 2 show a drop in the number of persons aged 18-23 in the

US from 1980 to 2005 and an expected rise in the numbers to 2030 and 2050. These figures are

consistent with the slower growth of the work force over time. But the figures also show that
                                                                                                                7
from 1980 to 2005 the number of young persons in Western Europe and Japan fell more rapidly

than in the US and will continue to drop thereafter. In 2050 the US will have 13% more persons

in this age group than in 2005, whereas Western Europe will have 13% less and Japan 30% less.

The US share of 18-23 year olds in advanced countries will continue to trend up.

        But the projected reduction in the supply of young persons is not limited to the advanced

countries. Due to the single child policy, the projections for China also show a drop in the

number of young persons, with the result that the ratio of the number of young Americans to the

number of young Chinese will increase through 2050. Even India is projected to have a

decelerated growth in the number of young people from 2005 to 2030 and a decline thereafter.

In short, panel A shows that the projected change in the US youth population does not stand out

as creating an extraordinary shortfall compared to the projected changes in the number of young

persons in the main countries with which the US is closely tied through the global economy.4

        The numbers in Panel B of table 2 for the population aged 15-59 tell a similar story. The

increase in the US population in this age bracket drops from 44 million additional persons in

1975-2000 to 20 million in 2000-2025 and 21 million in 2025 to 2050. The projected changes in

Western Europe and Japan are much greater, with the population in this age bracket predicted to

decline from 2025 to 2050. The US share of the population in advanced countries will thus keep

rising. As for the two major highly populous developing countries, China’s population aged 15-

59 is projected to rise through 2025 and then to fall through 2050 while India’s population is

expected to increase throughout the period. The ratio of the Chinese population to the US

population will barely change from 2005 to 2050. The UN projects that the proportion of the

world’s population in India, Africa, and Latin America will rise.

The doubling of the global work force

   The UN projections from which these data are based show a huge increase in the youth population in Africa,
since the UN does not anticipate a fall in birth rate in that continent to the levels elsewhere.
                                                                                                      8
       In the global economy, where firms “source” labor worldwide, where consumers buy

goods and services made in countries who are part of the world trading system, and where

immigrants move among countries, labor developments in one country are likely to affect

conditions in other countries. In the 1990s, the global labor market changed greatly when China,

India, and the ex-Soviet bloc joined the world trading system. Before then, these countries had

trade barriers, self-contained capital markets, and only limited immigration to the advanced

western countries, all of which isolated their labor markets from those in the US or in the rest of

the capitalist global world. The collapse of Soviet communism, China’s decision to marketize its

economy, and India’s rejection of autarky, changed all this and brought approximately 1.3 billion

new workers into the global capitalist system (see figure 1). Firms in advanced capitalist

countries could suddenly hire low wage workers in China, India, and the ex-Soviet bloc to do

work that might previously have been done in advanced countries or in other developing

countries. I estimate that this roughly doubled the number of workers in the world economy.

Most important, because these countries had relatively little capital, their entry into global

capitalism reduced the global capital-labor ratio by about 40%, which creates the global

opposite of the labor shortage projected for the US: an excess of labor at the wages paid in

advanced countries. This will impact labor markets in the US, in other advanced economies, and

in other developing countries. Assuming that globalization continues unabated, I expect US firms

to be able to meet potential shortfalls in domestic labor supplies for tradable goods and services

by hiring labor overseas, and to seek immigrant labor to ameliorate potential labor shortages in

the production of non-traded goods or services.

       If workers in China, India, and the ex-Soviet bloc had the same mix of skills as American

workers, it would be incontestable that they would compete with American workers and offset if

not overwhelm any future shortage of US workers. But workers in these countries do not have

the same skill set as Americans. A disproportionate number of Chinese and Indians are peasants
                                                                                                   9
with limited education and relatively have the university training of Americans. The ex-Soviet

bloc workers are better educated, but less numerous and suffer from having worked under

communist conditions. Perhaps the right way to consider these workers is as complements rather

than substitutes for American workers, who will increase US demand for educated labor relative

to less educated labor, and thus create a greater potential shortage of skills in the US.

       This was, after all, the standard assessment of the impact of globalization on the US when

the country was debating the NAFTA treaty with Mexico. Proponents of the treaty argued that

the US would gain good skilled jobs from increased trade with Mexico while exporting low

wage less skilled jobs. This pattern is consistent with the predictions of Heckscher-Ohlin trade

theory, in which comparative advantage is exogenous; and with the principal model that

economists have used to analyze trade between advanced and developing countries – the “North-

South” model in a dynamic context, where the North (=US and other advanced countries) have a

comparative advantage in high tech sectors. The natural policy recommendation from this

analysis is that US workers should invest more in human capital. The workers in China, India,

and other developing countries would never be able to catch up in skills and adversely affect

educated US workers.

       This analysis does not seem to characterize the current global labor market. Developing

countries, particularly China, are educating their work forces at a rapid pace. Table 3 shows that

the US edge in giving university training to its work force declined dramatically from the 1970s

through the 2000s. In 1970 approximately 29% of university enrollments worldwide were in the

US. By 2000, the US proportion of university enrollments worldwide had fallen to 14%.

Similarly, at the PhD level, the US share of doctorates produced around the world has fallen

from about 50% in the early 1970s to a projected level of 15% in 2010. Some of these trends are

due to the increased proportion of the world’s population in developing countries, but much is

due to the spread of mass higher education to most countries.
                                                                                                                10
        One consequence of the increase in the supply of highly educated workers around the

world is that US multinational firms “globally source for labor” in ways they could not do three

decades ago. Another consequence is that the US has been able to meet a large proportion of its

rising demands for science and engineering workers through immigration. No readily available

data set measures the increased proportion of foreign-born highly educated workers employed in

US multinational around the world, but standard government surveys document the importance

of immigration of scientists and engineers from overseas.

        During the 1990s rapid growth of the US economy, the country greatly increased its

employment of scientists and engineers. It did so despite fairly constant numbers of graduates in

these fields among citizens or permanent residents and without markedly raising the salaries of

these workers. As table 4 shows, the US was able to meet increased demands for scientists and

engineers without huge increases in salaries by “importing” foreign born specialists in these

areas. Some of the foreign born obtained their education in the US and remained to work in the

country. But most of those with BS degrees and roughly half of those with higher degrees

graduated overseas and came to fill jobs. If the US economy demands more highly skilled

workers in the period of projected slow labor force growth, it should be able to increase supplies

by admitting more immigrants in areas with rising labor demand, as it did in the 1990s.5

        Finally, while the National Center for Educational Statistics does not provide long term

projections of the number of college graduates, master’s or PhDs, the Center’s projections of the

supply of highly educated workers show continued growth in the numbers of persons through

2013 (table 5). In the 1970s-2000s, the growth of the supply of college graduates in the US was

spurred by a large increase in the proportion of women obtaining degrees. The proportion of

young minority persons who obtained bachelors and higher degrees rose as well. Thus, even

5
   From the mid 1990s through early 2000s the US doubled the budget of the National Institute of Health. This had
little positive impact on the careers of new US bio-scientists, whose pay remained among the lowest among
scientists and who had limited career prospects. One reason was the huge supply of post-docs and graduate students
                                                                                                    11
though the US edge in higher education will undoubtedly continue to diminish -- OECD data

show that the US no longer leads the world in the proportion of young persons enrolled in higher

education6 – several advanced EU countries have higher rates of enrollment than the US – but

the US will still be producing large and increasing numbers of university graduates.

occupational/skill demand forecasts

        Projections of labor shortages require analysts to project labor demands as well as labor

supplies. To be useful for education and training decisions, the projections must have some skill

or occupation dimension. How does the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) project demand for

labor? Are those projections sufficiently precise to guide economic policy?

        Every two years, the BLS’s Office of Occupational Statistics and Employment

Projections projects the growth of demand in occupations, which it publishes in the Occupational

Outlook Handbook. At the heart of the BLS’s occupational projections is an economy-wide

fixed coefficient input-output model. This model begins with a set of projections of the growth

of the major components of final demand for economic outputs; and then uses input-output tables

to translate the projected growth of final demands into growths of output in different industries.

The BLS transforms expected outputs into expected levels of employment by industry using

independent projections of productivity growth by sector. Finally, it applies coefficients relating

employment in each occupation to employment in each industry to project the future

occupational “needs” associated with the expansion or decline in employment in that industry.

The key to this step are the employment coefficients, which the BLS bases on historical data on

the employment of workers in a given occupation within an industry, which it adjusts with a

“change-factor” matrix of likely changes in the utilization of workers with different skills within

industries. The BLS gives the example of systems analysts, which it adjusted upward in its



from foreign countries willing to work at low wages in US labs.

1990s projections because these workers “would be expected to become a greater proportion of

each industry'
             s employment as the number of applications for computer use continues to

increase.”7 Finally, the BLS sums the estimates of employment in an occupation by industry

across all industries to obtain the projected occupational employment. 8

         This technique works reasonably well to forecast the growth of highly aggregated

occupations in periods when the economy does not undergo any dramatic changes and when

technological change does not greatly alter the demand for skills. It also works well for detailed

occupations where most persons work in the same industry and where productivity growth and

final demands are reasonably stable. In its assessment of the 1984-95 projections, the BLS

reports that they “captured the majority of the general trends ... (with) the most glaring

inaccuracies in the projections of detailed occupations reflect(ing) the conservative nature of

projected growth rates;”9 and that the principal source of projection error was unexpected

changes in the intra-industry utilization of different occupations. For instance, the 1984-95

projections were highly accurate for cooks in institutions or cafeterias (18.0% projected growth

of employment vs 18.1% actual growth) but under predicted the growth of child care workers,

personnel, training, and labor relations specialists, radiological technologists, and various

computer specialties, among other occupations. Unfortunately projections that are reasonably

accurate for occupations with relatively stable employment but which fail to foresee big changes

in demands for occupations that are likely to involve new skills are of limited value in assessing

future “shortages.”

        My analysis of the accuracy of BLS projections of employment, based on a regression

model that links actual changes in occupational employment to the projected changes for the

period 1988 to 2000, tell a similar story. The regression model effectively puts errors in

projecting the overall growth of employment into the constant term in the regression and thus

focuses on the ability of the projections to differentiate employment growth among occupations.

My model takes the change in the ln of actual employment as the dependent variable and the ln

difference between projected employment and actual employment as the independent variable,

which focuses on relative changes. Figure 2 summarizes the main result. It shows first that the

projected growth rates are positively related to ensuing growth of employment, though with a

wide band of variation. The estimated constant term is near zero, implying that the projections

accurately captured the overall growth of employment. The regression coefficient on the

projected ln change term is 0.93, only modestly below unity. This implies that on average an

occupation where employment is projected to grow or decline by 10% grows or declines at about

9.3%. The problem is in the fit of the equation. The R2 is just 0.26, so that 3/4s of the variation

in the growth of employment among occupations remains unaccounted for in the analysis. The

figure displays this with a wide range of actual growth rates for any predicted growth rate.

Given the variance in the growth of occupations, the standard error for the ln employment

growth predicted by the regression is a relatively high 0.30.

        There are three reasons why the projections have a high standard error. First, the industry

mix of output or employment can change in unexpected ways due to changing technology or

market conditions. In the global economy, a given demand that domestic producers once met by

hiring US workers can be met by foreign competitors, while some other domestic sector may

expand to meet foreign demands. Changes like these are not well captured in the input-output

model. Second, technical change alters the coefficients of occupational employment within

industries in ways that are difficult to predict. Third, the input-output framework ignores

substitutions in factor usage due to changes in factor prices. It does not allow for employers to

substitute against occupations with rapidly rising wages or for occupations where wages are

falling (Freeman, 1980). By focusing solely on demand adjustments, the projection model

ignores possible supply responses to market conditions that can greatly affect input coefficients

(in principle through the effect of supply on wages).

An example: computer and mathematical sciences

       Because demand for computer specialists has changed greatly (motivating the BLS’s

adjusting the input coefficients for systems analysts mentioned above) it is particularly insightful

to examine the projections of employment in this area. The BLS has published projections of

future employment in “computer and mathematical sciences” every two years between 1996 and

2002. In each projection, the BLS took as its base actual employment in the year and projected

employment ten years into the future.

       Table 6 summarizes the projections. In 1996, BLS projected that over the next decade

employment would double from 1.0 million jobs to 2 million jobs – a growth of 100,000

additional jobs per year. But at the height of the dot.com and high tech boom of the late 1990s,

labor supply increased far more rapidly than the BLS expected. By 1998, just two years after the

BLS projected a growth of employment of 100,000 per year, 1.7 million persons worked as

computer and mathematical scientists – an annual growth of 350,000 employed persons in the

area. Since universities were not graduating those numbers of specialists, the supply came from

persons from other disciplines shifting into the computer occupations in response to a booming

job market. Starting its 1998 projection at 1.7 million, the BLS projected a 92% growth of

employment to 2008 – 1.5 million additional jobs. But in 2000, national statistics showed 3

million computer and mathematical scientists – 50% more than the BLS had projected for 2006

four years earlier. Given the rapid growth of employment, the BLS raised its projected

employment to 5 million by 2010. Then came the dot.com collapse and the off shoring of

computer jobs to India and other low wage countries. The 2002 projection reduced the expected
                                                                                                     15
number a decade into the future to 4.1 million – an 18% drop in projected employment compared

to the 2000 projection for 2010.

       The wide variation in the number of workers projected in computer and mathematical

sciences reflects the difficulty in foreseeing future demands in an occupation subject to volatile

demand from different economic factors. First, there was the expansion of computer work in the

US market and the huge supply response to new job opportunities. Then came the growing

availability of qualified labor overseas, which allowed firms to offshore work. Over the entire

period employment of computer and mathematical scientists rose sharply, but the market

fluctuates so much that new graduates in some cohorts had difficulty finding work while

experienced programmers and computer specialists could not obtain the type of jobs they

expected. In 2000 programmers had an unemployment rate that was among the lowest in the

country – 1.7% compared to a rate for all workers of 3.9%. But in 2001 the rate of

unemployment of programmers tripled to 5.1% to exceed the national rate, and remained high in

succeeding years.10

Demography and replacement demand

       But the projected labor shortage in the US comes from a presumably well-determined

demographic projection based on the retirement of the baby boom generation, rather than from

detailed projections of demand for specialized workers with wide confidence band. It is natural

to think that the coming retirement of the large baby boom generation in the US will inevitably

create job openings and predictable “replacement demand” for new workers. If an occupation

has 100 55 yr olds working in 2010 and these workers retire at 65 in 2020, and if nothing else

changes employers would seek 100 new workers to replace the retirees. If there is any part of a

projection of future labor market balances that would seem likely to prove accurate, projecting

replacement demand would be it.
                                                                                                       16
        This expectation is wrong. Enough other things change, which labor market models only

imperfectly capture, to make projections of replacement demands more complicated and suspect.

Changes in retirement behavior – the move to early retirement in that latter part of the 20th

century and possible moves to delayed retirement to increase the solvency of social security –

can readily cause divergences between predictions based solely on aging and actual retirements.

        In making its projections of replacement demands for labor, the BLS differentiates

between total separations from an occupation, defined as the flow of individuals leaving an

occupation; and net separations, defined to include movements of workers into as well as out of

an occupation over a specific period. In the retirement age group, the two concepts are similar

since few workers will enter an occupation in that age group from another occupation, but they

can differ considerably for younger age groups and across occupations, some of which may

traditionally obtain experienced workers from other occupations and others of which

traditionally send workers to other occupations. An additional complication occurs between

occupations where employment is expected to rise or to fall. For occupations in which

employment has been rising, the BLS estimates net separation rates, by age, to estimate

replacement needs during the projection period, but it cannot use this procedure for occupations

where employment is expected to decline.11

         To assess the relation between replacement demand and future job availability for

workers of less than retirement age, I estimated a regression model linking employment in an

occupation in 2000 in different age groups to the number of employed persons 55 and over in

the occupation in 1990 – likely retirees over the decade – and to the number of persons in the age

group in 1990. If replacement demands were important in creating jobs for workers below

retirement age, the number of persons 55 and over working in 1990 would be positively related

to the number of workers in younger age groups in the occupation in 2000. To give equal weight

to large and smaller occupations, I scaled the variables by total employment in each occupation

in 1990, so that each variable is in a rate form. The second explanatory variable, the number of

persons in the specified age group in 1990, again scaled by employment in the occupation in

1990, is designed to deal with the likelihood that some occupations naturally have more or fewer

workers in different age groups. With this held fixed, replacement demand should show up in

additional employment in that age group.

       Table 7 gives the regression coefficients and standard errors and related statistics for this

model. The results reject the notion that the rate of likely retirement in an occupation is

associated with growth of employment for persons in younger age groups. The coefficients on

the relative number of persons in the retirement age group are essentially zero for the 16-24 year

olds and for the 45-54 year olds and are negative significant for persons in the other two age

groups. In these simple calculations, replacement demand for workers in given occupations is

negatively rather than positively related to the numbers hired. Why?

        The most plausible reason is that older workers tend to be concentrated in older

economic sectors, from which demand is shifting toward newer areas. It is this factor that

induces the BLS to give different replacement demands for growing and declining occupations.

In the 1990s there were many workers of retirement age in the railroad industry and in heavy

manufacturing, but few in the new computer software and e-economy sectors where employment

was growing. If labor economists had a model that fully accounted for changes in employment

due to all factors, replacement demand would inevitably have a positive impact on employment

of younger persons, but absent such a model, the effects of replacement demand are so dwarfed

by changes in market conditions as to produce the negative relations in table 6. The message is

that economic forecasters should not count on replacement demand for retiring baby boomers to

create a labor shortage in the occupations with lots of boomers.

demography and labor market developments

       Implicit in the fears that the US will face a great labor shortage in the next decade or two

is a belief that demographic forces have a powerful predictable impact on economic outcomes. In

the past, this has not been the case. Changes in behavior due to changing market incentives often

overwhelm demographic factors. In the 1950s and 1960s analysts projected much smaller

growth in labor supply than actually occurred because they failed to foresee the changing labor

force behavior of women in response to improved employment opportunities and wages. In the

late 1960s-early 1970s, when the baby boom generation reached the job market, the earnings and

employment of young persons worsened relative to the earnings and employment of older

workers due to the demographically driven shift in labor supplies. Indeed, this shift was an

econometrician’s dream exogenous shock for estimating the elasticity of the wages of young

persons relative to older persons to changes in relative supplies (Freeman, 1979; Welch 1979).

But when the number of young entrants fell in ensuing years, the earnings and employment of

the new smaller cohorts of young workers did not improve. The OECD, among others, expected

Western Europe’s youth unemployment problems to disappear over time as the supply of young

persons fell. Instead, other factors, such as national wage policies that affected young workers

and the state of the macro-economy dominated the youth labor market (Blanchflower and

Freeman, 2000). In the early 1970s I projected that the rapidly growing supply of graduates

would create a long run relative surplus of college graduates, albeit around cobweb fluctuations

(Freeman, 1976). Indeed, relative pay of graduates fell in the early and mid 1970s and then

picked up as the growth of supply diminished. But in the ensuing decade relative demand for

graduates began growing more rapidly than relative supply to produce a rising wage gap between

more and less educated workers.

       As a final point of caution about forecasting economic developments from supply-based

projections, consider the slow growth of the labor force in advanced Europe and Japan in the
                                                                                                    19
1990s through the mid 2000s. The demography implied that these countries would develop

major labor shortages, but they did not. The problem in EU labor markets was quite the

opposite: high unemployment and low employment to population rates. Perhaps the US

economy is so different from those of advanced Europe that the slow projected growth of labor

supply in the US will produce shortages, but perhaps not. The lesson from the historical record

is that there is a huge gap between demographic changes and ensuing economic developments.

conclusion

       If the analysis of this paper is correct and the economic sky will not fall down in the face

of a slower growth in the US work force, why have so many persons concerned with the well

being of the US economy warning about the great coming labor shortage?

       I suspect that three factors are at work.

       The first is that many of those concerned about the possible future shortage do not realize

the historically large gap between demographic developments and economic developments nor

recognize that globalization will further widen that gap.

       The second reason is that fears of a coming shortage fit with the concerns of various

groups. Future shortage or not, business will benefit from policies that increase labor supply to

drive down labor costs. Advocates of education and training see the shortage analysis as a way

to gain national support for increased spending on training that will benefit workers. Politicians

can use the shortage analysis to avoid dealing with policies like minimum wages, mandated

health care spending, labor law reform, or enforcement of labor laws, and the like, by endorsing

“win-win” education and training policies while sidestepping the fact that someone must pay for

these investments.

       The third reason that I believe the shortage analysis appeals to some is that it offers a

more optimistic framework for analyzing the economic future than the view that the biggest

problem facing US workers is competition from low wage labor overseas is. If the doubling of
                                                                                                      20
the global work force has weakened the position of workers in the US, the country has to deal

with issues regarding the rules of the global economy, ways to increase savings and the supply of

capital, ways to retain good jobs and sectors and to distribute the gains from globalization to

labor as well as capital while deterring protectionism.

       That the coming labor shortage is more myth than reality does not invalidate some of the

policies that shortage analysts endorse to help the economy progress. More and better schooling

and job training and greater provision of occupational information are potentially critical to the

nation’s preserving comparative advantage in high tech sectors under the global competition

vision of the future. There is arguably greater need for those policies if global competition

places downward pressure on US workers than if a domestic labor shortage puts them in the

catbird seat in the economy and places business under pressure to recruit more workers.

       Finally, if my analysis is wrong and the US develops a great labor shortage in the future,

I do not see why the government should intervene to prevent labor costs from rising. If firms

demand more labor than workers supply due to a reduced growth of supply, should not a country

that relies extensively on unfettered markets allow those markets to raise the price of labor, just

as it allowed them to reduce the pay of many in recent decades? There is nothing in economics

that predicts “slower growth in the standard of living, change in the balance of payments,

inequality, persistent structural unemployment,” or any other economic disasters from the normal

functioning of competitive markets in the face of a shift in the supply-demand balance. If there

is going to be a great labor shortage that raises wages and benefits for American workers, should

we not all cheer the workings of the Invisible Hand, rather than seeing this as a disaster that

policy should seek to avoid?
