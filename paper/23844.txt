This paper uses U.S. local areas as a laboratory to test whether the Great Recession depressed
2015 employment. In full-population longitudinal data, I find that exposure to a 1-percentage-
point-larger 2007-2009 local unemployment shock caused working-age individuals to be 0.4
percentage points less likely to be employed at all in 2015, evidently via labor force exit. These
shocks also increased 2015 income inequality. General human capital decay and persistently low
labor demand each rationalize the findings better than lost job-specific rents, lost firm-specific
human capital, or reduced migration. Simple extrapolation suggests the recession caused most of
the 2007-2015 age-adjusted employment decline.

1         Introduction

The U.S. unemployment rate spiked from 5.0% to 10.0% over the course of the Great Reces-
sion and then returned to 5.0% in 2015. However, the U.S. employment rate (employment-
population ratio) did not exhibit similar recovery. Figure 1A shows that the employment rate
declined 3.6 percentage points between 2007 and 2015, as millions of adults exited the labor
force.1 Population aging explains a minority of the employment rate decline: weighting 2015
ages by the 2007 age distribution reduces the decline to 2.0 percentage points, and the unad-
justed age-25-54 employment rate declined 2.6 percentage points. The decline was concentrated
among the low-skilled (Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo 2016). The decline’s persistence con-
trasts with employment rate recovery after earlier recessions—leading history-based analyses
like Fernald, Hall, Stock and Watson (2017) to doubt the possibility of employment hystere-
sis: the Great Recession having depressed long-term employment despite the unemployment
recovery.
        This paper tests whether the Great Recession and its underlying sources caused part of
the 2007-2015 age-adjusted decline in U.S. employment, or whether that decline would have
prevailed even in the absence of the Great Recession. It is typically difficult to test for long-term
employment impacts of recessions, for the simple reason that recession-independent (“secular”)
forces may also affect employment over long horizons (Ramey 2012). For example, the U.S.
employment rate rose by two percentage points from the start of the 1981-1982 recession to the
late 1980s, as women continued to enter the labor force. In the context of the Great Recession,
secular nationwide skill-biased shocks like technical or trade changes could have caused the
entire 2007-2015 employment decline, rather than the recession.
        I attempt to overcome this challenge by leveraging spatial variation in Great Recession
severity along with data that minimize selection threats. All U.S. local areas by definition
experienced the same secular nationwide shocks, but some local areas experienced more severe
Great Recession shocks than other local areas. For example: Phoenix, Arizona—America’s sixth

largest city—experienced a relatively large unemployment spike during the Great Recession
while San Antonio, Texas—America’s seventh largest city—did not. A cross-area research
design has the potential to distinguish recession impacts from secular nationwide shock impacts.
       In the first part of the paper, I show using public state-year aggregates that a cross-area
research design is indeed fertile ground for studying the labor market consequences of the
Great Recession. Defining state-level shocks as 2007-2009 employment growth forecast errors
in an autoregressive system (Blanchard and Katz 1992), I find that 2015 employment rates
remained low in the U.S. states that experienced relatively severe Great Recession shocks—even
though between-state differences in unemployment rates had returned to normal (and despite
normal between-state population reallocation). Hence, the cross-area patterns of employment,
unemployment, and labor force participation closely mirrored the aggregate cross-time patterns
of Figure 1A. The persistent cross-area employment rate difference departs from the Blanchard-
Katz finding of rapid regional convergence.
       The state-year evidence does not imply employment hysteresis from the Great Recession,
because of two potential forms of cross-area composition bias: post-2007 sorting on labor supply
and pre-2007 sorting on human capital. First, severe Great Recession local shocks caused
long-term declines in local costs of living (Beraja, Hurst and Ospina 2016) which may have
disproportionately attracted or retained those secularly out of the workforce like the disabled
and retired (Notowidigdo 2011).2 Even without such post-2007 sorting on labor supply, severe
Great Recession local shocks may have happened to hit areas with particularly large pre-existing
concentrations of individuals affected by secular nationwide shocks. For example, the Great
Recession disproportionately struck local areas that had experienced housing booms (Mian
and Sufi 2014) attracting low- and middle-skill construction labor, and low- and middle-skill
laborers have been relatively adversely affected by secular nationwide shocks in recent decades
(e.g. Katz and Murphy 1992).3 Under either type of cross-area sorting, severe Great Recession

local shocks may not have caused local residents’ 2015 nonemployment.
   I therefore turn for the second part of the paper to longitudinal linked-employer-employee
data in order to control for prominent dimensions of cross-area sorting. The longitudinal com-
ponent allows one to measure individuals’ employment over time regardless of whether and
where in the United States they migrated—directly controlling for post-2007 sorting on labor
supply. The linked-employer-employee component allows one to control for fine interactions of
age, 2006 earnings, and 2006 industry—proxies for pre-2007 human capital.
   Specifically, I draw a 2% random sample of individuals from de-identified federal income
tax records spanning 1999-2015. The main outcome of interest is employment at any point
in 2015, equal to an indicator for whether the individual had any W-2 earnings or any 1099-
MISC independent contractor earnings in 2015. The main sample restricts to those aged 30-49
(“working age”) in 2007 in order to confine the 1999-2015 employment analysis to those between
typical schooling and retirement age, and it restricts to American citizens in order to minimize
unobserved employment in foreign countries. The analysis allows for within-state variation
by using the local area concept of the Commuting Zone (CZ): 722 county groupings that
approximate local labor markets and are similar to metropolitan statistical areas but span the
entire continental United States. I use the universe of information returns to assign individuals
to their January 2007 CZ. Each individual’s Great Recession local shock equals the percentage
point change in her 2007 CZ’s unemployment rate between 2007 and 2009 as recorded in the
Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics. I obtain 2006 four-digit NAICS
industry for half of 2006 W-2 earners by linking W-2s to employers’ tax returns.
   I find that conditional on 2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects, a 1-percentage-point-
higher Great Recession local shock caused the average working-age American to be 0.39 per-
centage points less likely to be employed in 2015. The estimate is very statistically significant,
approximately linear in shock intensity, robust across numerous specifications, and large: those
living in 2007 in largest-shock-quintile CZs were 1.7 percentage points less likely to be employed
in 2015 than initially similar individuals living in 2007 in smallest-shock-quintile CZs. Placebo
tests indicate no relative downward employment trend in severely shocked areas before the

                                                3
recession, corroborating identification. Controlling for 2015 local unemployment rates suggests
that the incremental 2015 nonemployment took the form of labor force exit rather than long-
term unemployment. I similarly find impacts on 2015 wage and contractor earnings: −3.6%
(−$997) of the individual’s pre-period earnings for every 1-percentage-point-higher shock.
   One could be concerned that the foregoing within-industry analysis fails to sufficiently con-
trol for pre-2007 sorting on human capital, as jobs and therefore skill types in some industries
are geographically differentiated. Thus as a novel robustness check, I approximate a within-job
analysis using a sample of 2006 workers at retail chain firms like Walmart and Safeway that
employ workers with similar skills to perform similar tasks at similar salaries in many different
local areas. Adding firm fixed effects in the retail sample attenuates the retail-sample employ-
ment effect by 0.05 percentage points, or one half of one standard error, to −0.36 percentage
points.
   Certain comparisons suggest that the true average employment impact could be closer to
−0.30 percentage points per percentage-point unemployment rate shock. Naive extrapolation
of those −0.30-for-1 and −0.39-for-1 magnitudes would explain 58-76% of the U.S. 2007-2015
working-age annual employment rate decline as a long-term impact of the Great Recession. The
actual implied aggregate impact depends on general equilibrium amplification or dampening.
   The recession’s impacts were highly uneven within local areas. The employment and earn-
ings impacts were most negative for older individuals and those with low 2006 earnings. The
latter pattern indicates that the Great Recession induced a long-term increase in employment
and earnings inequality across skill levels, not merely within skill levels across space. Impacts
do not appear smaller among mobile subgroups like renters or the childless.
   Adjustment via migration and social insurance appears highly incomplete in replacing lost
income. I find no statistically significant impact of Great Recession local shocks on out-
migration from one’s 2007 CZ, and earnings in other CZs did not replace any lost 2015 earnings
relative to those exposed to smaller Great Recession local shocks. Great Recession local shocks
caused significantly higher unemployment insurance (UI) benefits 2008-2010 before UI bene-
fits expired and insignificantly higher Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits in

                                               4
all years. I estimate that 2015 SSDI replaced 2% of lost 2015 earnings, or up to 6% at the
95%-confidence upper bound.
   Finally, I find that most of the 2015 incrementally nonemployed in severely shocked areas
had been laid off at some point 2007-2014 and were entirely nonemployed 2013-2015. However,
higher layoff rates do not appear to explain the results, as the impacts hold within laid-off
individuals. In particular, I find equally large impacts when comparing workers who were each
displaced in a 2008-2009 mass layoff. Hence, interactions with area-level economic conditions
appear key to any full explanation of the long-term impacts—such as human capital decay
during extended nonemployment, or persistently low local labor demand.
   The paper’s findings constitute evidence of employment hysteresis from the Great Recession
(cf. Fernald, Hall, Stock and Watson 2017) and add to a large literature on the incidence of labor
market shocks. Earlier work had found long-term impacts on individuals’ earnings (Topel 1990,
Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan 1993, Neal 1995, Kahn 2010, Davis and Von Wachter 2011) and
sometimes on local areas’ employment rates (Blanchard and Katz 1992 vs. Black, Daniel and
Sanders 2002 and Autor and Duggan 2003) and individuals’ employment rates (Ruhm 1991,
Walker 2013 vs. Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song 2014, Jarosch 2015). I provide evidence of
long-term impacts of Great Recession local shocks on individuals’ employment rates, likely via
labor force exit. This evidence reinforces the view of Autor and Duggan and a large literature
dating back at least to Bowen and Finegan (1969) and Phelps (1972) that transitory adverse
aggregate shocks can have persistent negative employment impacts even after unemployment
recovers.
   The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 uses state-year data to show that
cross-area employment patterns mirrored aggregate cross-time employment patterns 2007-2015.
Section 3 details the empirical design and longitudinal linked-employer-employee data. Section
4 estimates overall impacts. Section 5 estimates impact heterogeneity. Section 6 investigates
adjustment margins. Section 7 documents layoff and nonemployment trajectories. Section 8
discusses candidate mechanisms. Section 9 concludes.

2     Local Labor Markets Mirrored the Aggregate

This paper uses cross-area variation in Great Recession severity to test whether the recession
and its underlying sources caused part of the 2007-2015 decline in the U.S. employment rate
displayed in Figure 1A. I begin by testing whether Figure 1A’s aggregate cross-time employ-
ment patterns have been mirrored across U.S. local areas: did the local areas that experienced
severe Great Recession shocks also experience persistent declines in employment and partici-
pation rates but not unemployment rates, relative to mildly shocked areas? If so, then local
labor markets may indeed serve as a fruitful laboratory for understanding sources of aggregate
employment patterns.
    A large literature has studied local labor market dynamics after local employment shocks.
The canonical analysis of Blanchard and Katz (1992) found in state-year data 1976-1990 that,
when a state experiences an adverse employment shock, its population falls relative to trend
but its unemployment, participation, and employment rates return to parity with other states
in five-to-six years. That is, local shocks leave local areas smaller but no less employed. This
conclusion has been replicated in European data (Decressin and Fatas 1995) and in a longer
U.S. state-year time series (Dao, Furceri and Loungani 2017). However, other papers have found
long-term participation and employment impacts of local shocks: Black, Daniel and Sanders
(2002), Autor and Duggan (2003), and Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) found long-term impacts
of specific types of U.S. local shocks on local disability insurance enrollment, participation,
and/or employment rates. Hence, the existing literature presents a mixed picture.
    This section documents local labor market dynamics after Great Recession local employment
shocks, with greater detail presented in Online Appendices B and C. For comparability to the
broadest line of previous work, I conduct this analysis at the state level and categorize states
into severely shocked states and mildly shocked states using unforecasted state-level changes in
2007-2009 employment, derived from the autoregressive system of Blanchard and Katz (1992).
I estimate Blanchard and Katz’s log-linear autoregressive system in state employment growth,
state unemployment rates, and state participation rates in LAUS data 1976-2007. The LAUS


                                               6
data are the annual Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics series of
employment, population, unemployment, and labor force participation counts 1976-2015 for 51
states (the 50 states plus the District of Columbia). Annual counts are calendar-year averages
across months. I then compute 2008 and 2009 employment growth forecast errors for each
state—equal to each state’s actual log employment growth minus the system’s prediction for
that state—and sum the two to obtain each state’s 2007-2009 employment shock. Roughly
speaking, each state’s shock equals the state’s 2007-2009 log employment change minus the
state’s long-run trend. Then for expositional simplicity, I group the 26 states with the most
negative shocks (e.g. Arizona) into a severely shocked category and the remaining states (e.g.
Texas) into a mildly shocked category.
   Figure 1B displays the 2003-2015 time series of unemployment, participation, and employ-
ment rate differences between severely shocked states and mildly shocked states. For each
outcome and year, the graph plots the unweighted mean among severely shocked states, mi-
nus the unweighted mean among mildly shocked states (the graph looks nearly identical when
weighting by population). Within each series, I subtract the mean pre-2008 severe-minus-mild
difference from each data point, so each plotted series has a mean of zero before 2008.
   The figure shows that the unemployment rate in severely shocked states relative to mildly
shocked states spiked in 2008, peaked in 2009-2010, and returned by 2015 to its mean pre-
recession severe-mild difference. Yet the 2015 employment and participation rates in severely
shocked states remained 1.74 percentage points below the corresponding rates in mildly shocked
states, relative to the mean pre-recession severe-mild differences. The implied 2015 cross-area
employment gap is large: 2.01 million fewer adults were employed in severely shocked states than
in mildly shocked states, relative to full recovery to the pre-recession severe-mild employment
rate difference.
   Hence, the cross-area (severe-minus-mild) patterns of unemployment, participation, and em-
ployment of Figure 1B do indeed broadly mirror the aggregate cross-time (current-minus-2007)
patterns of Figure 1A. Moreover in the same sense that the aggregate employment aftermath of
the Great Recession appears to contrast with the aftermath of the early-1980s and early-1990s

                                               7
recessions, so too does the cross-area aftermath of the Great Recession appear to contrast with
the cross-area aftermath of those earlier recessions. Figure 2A repeats the employment rate
series of Figure 1B for the aftermath of the 1980s and 1990s recessions, treating the early-1980s
recessions as a single recession. The figure shows that cross-state employment rates fully con-
verged four years after the early-1990s recession and had converged by 1.65 percentage points
(78% of the t=0 divergence) six years after the early-1980s recession. Six-year convergence after
the Great Recession was smaller in both absolute terms (0.85 percentage points) and relative
to the t=0 divergence (33%).
       Blanchard and Katz suggest that the historical convergence mechanism is rapid population
reallocation: a −1% state population change relative to trend follows every −1% employment
shock within five-to-six years.4 Therefore a natural possible explanation for local employment
rate persistence after the Great Recession is that population reallocation has slowed. Figure
2B investigates this possibility by plotting de-trended 2007-2014 population changes—equal to
each state’s 2007-2014 percent change in population minus the 2000-2007 percent change in
the state’s population—versus the state’s 2007-2009 employment shock. The graph shows that
population reallocation after the Great Recession was similar to the historical benchmark: each
−1% 2007-2009 employment shock was on average accompanied by a −1.016% (robust standard
error 0.260) de-trended population change.5 Figure 2C shows the same conclusion when using
the original Blanchard-Katz time range—1976-1990, well before the recent housing boom—to
estimate state-specific population trends in the Blanchard-Katz system. Population in severely
shocked states fell 2007-2015 relative to trend and relative to mildly shocked states as much as
in the Blanchard-Katz benchmark.
   4
     The unit elastic population response holds when re-estimating the Blanchard and Katz system on updated
data 1976-2015. The suggested causal chain is: a state (e.g. Michigan) experiences a one-time random-walk
contraction in global consumer demand for its locally produced traded good (e.g. cars), which induces a local
labor demand contraction and wage decline, which in turn induces a local labor supply (population) contraction,
which then restores the original local wage and employment rate.
   5
     When not de-trending, state population changes were largely uncorrelated with 2007-2009 employment
shocks, also shown in Mian and Sufi (2014) for the 2007-2009 period only. Blanchard and Katz find adjustment
via population changes relative to trend. Gross (out-)migration rates have declined modestly since 1980 (Molloy,
Smith and Wozniak 2011), but gross flows are still an order of magnitude larger than the net flows (population
reallocations) predicted by history in response to 2007-2009 shocks.




                                                       8
    To sum up, this section has found that aggregate 2007-2015 cross-time unemployment,
participation, and employment rate patterns have been mirrored in cross-area unemployment,
participation, and employment rate patterns over the same time period. Participation and em-
ployment rates remained persistently low in the U.S. states that experienced relatively severe
employment shocks 2007-2009, even though unemployment rates converged across space. Re-
duced population reallocation does not explain the local persistence. The cross-area aftermath
of the Great Recession departs from the broad historical findings of Blanchard and Katz (1992),
but they accord with findings of Black, Daniel and Sanders (2002), Autor and Duggan (2003),
and Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) from specific contexts. I now turn to identifying whether
Great Recession local shocks caused individuals to have lower 2015 employment.



3     Isolating Impacts of Great Recession Local Shocks

The previous section showed that local labor markets were microcosms of aggregate employment
patterns 2007-2015: 2015 employment rates remained unusually low in U.S. local areas that
experienced an especially severe 2007-2009 employment shock. However, that cross-sectional
fact does not imply that individuals were nonemployed in 2015 because of where they were
living during the Great Recession, in light of two selection threats. First, the disabled, retirees,
and others secularly out of the labor force may have disproportionately stayed in or moved to
severely shocked areas in order to enjoy low living costs while foregoing employment. Even
without selective migration on post-2007 labor supply, severely shocked areas may have been
disproportionately populated before the recession by individuals who subsequently suffered large
nationwide contractions for their skill types, like construction workers or routine laborers, that
would have occurred even in the absence of the recession. Under either selection threat, the
2015 residents of severely shocked areas might be nonemployed now regardless of geography.
    This section specifies my empirical strategy for using longitudinal linked-employer-employee
data to isolate causal effects of Great Recession local shocks on individuals’ 2015 employment.
2015 is the most recent year of data available. Additional details are listed in Online Appendices

D and E, including design foundations in potential outcomes.


3.1       Empirical Design

I adopt an empirical design that closely follows earlier work using longitudinal individual-
level data to estimate long-term impacts of labor market shocks (e.g. Jacobson, LaLonde and
Sullivan 1993, Davis and Von Wachter 2011, Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song 2014). I estimate
regressions of the form:


                              yi2015 = βSHOCKc(i2007) + θg(i2006) + i2015                               (3.1)


where y denotes an employment or related outcome; i denotes an individual; SHOCKc(i2007) is
the Great Recession shock to the individual’s 2007 local area c; θg(i2006) denotes fixed effects for
groups g of individuals defined using individual pre-2007-determined characteristics; and i2015
is a disturbance term. β is the coefficient of interest: the causal effect on one’s 2015 outcomes
of living in 2007 in a local area that experienced a one-unit-larger Great Recession shock.
       I interpret β as the causal effect of Great Recession local shocks and their underlying
sources, which are empirically indistinguishable,6 and I refer to this effect as the causal effect
of Great Recession local shocks. Alternative interpretations include β reflecting differential
pre-recession trends (e.g. a downward pre-2007 employment trend in severely shocked areas) or
independent correlated local shocks (e.g. post-2009 floods in severely shocked areas). However,
my interpretation of β is sensible because severely shocked and mildly shocked areas exhibited
relatively similar pre-recession trends in the outcomes of interest (shown below in Section 4.1)
and because post-2010 unemployment rates converged monotonically across severely shocked
and mildly shocked areas. Moreover, adverse 2010-2015 industry-based shift-share shocks are
not positively correlated with adverse Great Recession local shocks.
       Like earlier work, the identifying assumption is selection on observables: individuals were
   6
    For example if the underlying source of Great Recession local shocks was persistent local spending contrac-
tions (Mian, Rao and Sufi 2013), then 2015 employment could in principle be depressed because of layoffs during
the Great Recession or because local spending remained depressed through 2015, among other possibilities.


                                                      10
as good as randomly assigned across local areas within groups g. Also like earlier work, I aim
to satisfy this assumption using rich longitudinal data to define groups finely along dimensions
(e.g. age, pre-recession earnings, and pre-recession industry) that could be correlated with both
Great Recession local shocks and omitted secular nationwide shocks, and to restrict attention
to sub-samples in which the identifying assumption is particularly likely to hold. I will use
event study graphs to evaluate potentially confounding pre-recession trends.


3.2       Samples

I implement the paper’s empirical design using selected de-identified data from federal income
tax records spanning 1999-2015. I construct three samples as follows. All three samples are
balanced panels of individuals.
       Main Sample. The main sample comprises a 2% random sample from what I call the full
sample. The full sample comprises all American citizens aged 30-49 (“working age”) on January
1, 2007, who had not died by December 31, 2015, and who had a valid payee ZIP code on at
least one information return that indicates continental U.S. residence in January 2007.7 The
age restriction confines the 1999-2015 employment analysis to those older than schooling age
and younger than retirement age. Birth, death, and citizenship data are drawn from Social
Security Administration (SSA) records housed alongside tax records.8 Restricting attention to
those alive in 2015 excludes analysis of mortality effects, likely a conservative choice (Sullivan
and Von Wachter 2009). I describe geocoded information returns in the next subsection. I
randomly sample individuals from the full sample using the last two digits of the individual’s
masked identification number, yielding the main sample comprising 1,357,974 individuals.
       Retail Chain Sample. The retail chain sample comprises individuals in the full sample
whose main employer in 2006 was a retail chain firm and who lived outside of the local area
   7
     In other contexts, working-age sometimes refers to the age-15-65 population. My sample lies within ages
15 and 65 in all years 1999-2015. I refer to the sample as working-age mainly to communicate that it omits
individuals beyond normal retirement age.
   8
     Citizenship is recorded as of December 2016. Results are very similar when not conditioning on citizenship
status. Conditioning on citizenship reduces the possibility that 2007 residents are employed in other countries
but appear nonemployed in U.S. tax data.



                                                      11
of the retail chain firm’s headquarters. It is constructed as follows. For every individual in
the full sample with a 2006 W-2 form, I attempt to link the masked employer identification
number (EIN) on the individual’s highest-paying 2006 W-2 to at least one business return in
the universe of business income tax returns 1999-2007.9 I use the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) code on the business income tax return to restrict attention to
workers whose 2006 firms operated in the two-digit-NAICS retail trade industries (44 or 45), e.g.
Walmart and Safeway.10 I further exclude employees living in 2007 in the CZ of their employer’s
headquarters, using the workers’ payee ZIP codes across their information returns (see the next
subsection) and the filing ZIP code on business income tax returns and mapping these ZIP
codes to Commuting Zones (CZs, the local area concept defined in the next subsection). Then
to identify CZs in which the 2006 firms operated, I further restrict to firms with at least ten
2006 employees living in each of at least five CZs and restrict to the firms’ employees living in
2007 in those CZs. This procedure yields a retail chain sample of 865,954 individuals at 524
retail firms.11
       Mass Layoffs Sample. The mass layoffs sample comprises all individuals in the full sample
who separated from an employer during a mass-layoff event in either 2008 or 2009, after having
worked for the employer during the prior three calendar years inclusive of the separation year.
It is constructed as follows, closely adhering to the sampling frame of Davis and Von Wachter
(2011) except that I define an employer as an EIN-CZ pair rather than an EIN; an EIN may be
a firm or a division of a firm. Using the universe of W-2s and linking W-2 payee (residential)
ZIP codes to CZs, I compute annual employment counts at the EIN-CZ level. For an employer
to qualify as having a mass-layoff event in year t ∈ {2008, 2009}, the employer must satisfy the
following conditions: it had at least 50 employees in t−1; employment contracted by between
   9
     Many firms’ workers cannot be linked to a business income tax return; see the next subsection.
  10
     Accessed data lacked firm names. I do not know which specific firms survived the sample restrictions. These
example firms and their industry codes were found on Yahoo Finance.
  11
     As in other U.S. administrative data (e.g. Census’s Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics, see Walker
2013), specific establishments of multi-establishment firms are not directly identified in federal tax data. My
process infers firms’ CZ-level operations from workers’ residential locations. The retail chain sample is smaller
than the universe of retail chain workers for four main reasons: the age restriction, the de facto exclusion of
workers at independently owned franchises, mismatches between W-2 EIN and business return EIN (see Section
3.3.3 below), and removal of workers at firm headquarters.


                                                       12
30% and 99% from t−1 to t+1; employment in t−1 was no greater than 130% of t−2 employ-
ment; and t+2 employment was less than 90% of t−1 employment.12 The mass layoffs sample
comprises all 1,001,543 individuals in the full sample who received a W-2 with positive earnings
in years t−2 through year t from a mass-layoff employer but not in t+1.


3.3       Variable Definitions

I now define variables. Year always refers to calendar year. Variables are available 1999-2015.
       1. Outcomes. Similar to Davis and Von Wachter (2011) and Autor, Dorn, Hanson and
Song (2014), employment in a given year is an indicator for whether an individual has positive
Form W-2 earnings or Form 1099-MISC independent contractor earnings (both filed mandato-
rily by the employer) in the year. Employment is thus a measure of having been employed at
any time during the year. Note that this annual employment measure differs from the conven-
tional point-in-time (survey reference week) measure used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Although not all self-employment is reported on 1099-MISCs, transition of affected workers to
self-employment likely does not explain the results: Current Population Survey data indicate
that changes in state self-employment rates since 2007 were unrelated to changes in state formal
employment rates.
       Earnings in a given year represents labor income and equals the sum of an individual’s
Form W-2 earnings and Form 1099-MISC independent contractor earnings. All dollar values
are measured in 2015 dollars, adjusting for inflation using the headline consumer price index
(CPI-U) and are top-coded at $500,000 after inflating. DI receipt is an indicator for whether
the individual has positive Social Security Disability Insurance income (SSDI) in the year
as recorded on Form 1099-SSA information returns filed mandatorily by the Social Security
Administration. SSDI is the main U.S. disability insurance program. UI receipt is an indicator
for whether the individual has positive unemployment insurance benefit income in the year as
recorded on Form 1099-G information returns filed mandatorily by state governments.
  12
    The 99% threshold protects against EIN changes yielding erroneous mass-layoff events. The last two criteria
exclude temporary employment fluctuations. A firm that initially qualifies as having mass-layoff events in both
2008 and 2009 is assigned a 2008 event only.


                                                      13
    2. CZ and Great Recession Local Shock. Allowing for within-state variation, an
individual’s CZ is defined as her residential Commuting Zone, a local area concept used in
much recent work (Dorn 2009, Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song 2014, Chetty, Hendren, Kline
and Saez 2014). CZs are collections of adjacent counties, grouped by Tolbert and Sizer (1996)
using commuting patterns in the 1990 Census to approximate local labor markets. I calculate
based on the 2006-2010 American Community Surveys that 92.5% of U.S. workers live in the
CZ in which they work. Urban CZs are similar to metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), but
whereas MSAs exclude rural areas, every spot in the continental United States lies in exactly
one of 722 CZs.
    2007 CZ is the CZ corresponding to the payee (residential) ZIP code that appears most fre-
quently for the individual in 2006 among the approximately thirty types of information returns
(filed mandatorily by institutions on behalf of an individual, including W-2s).13 Information
returns are typically issued in January of the following year, so the ZIP code on a individual’s
2006 information return typically refers to the individual’s location as of January 2007. 2015
CZ is defined analogously to 2015 CZ, except that if an individual lacks an information return
in 2014, I impute CZ using information return ZIP code from the most recently preceding year
in which the individual received an information return. 2007 state denotes the state with most
or all of the 2007 CZ’s population.
    Each individual’s Great Recession local shock equals the percentage-point change in the
individual’s 2007 CZ’s unemployment rate from 2007 to 2009. Annual CZ unemployment rates
are computed by aggregating monthly population-weighted county-level unemployment rates
from the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics series to the
CZ-month level, then averaging evenly within CZ-years across months. Measuring local shocks
in units of the unemployment rate change permits Section 4.4’s comparison to the aggregate
shock, which can be measured in the same units. Great Recession local shocks are available on
  13
     Numerous activities trigger information returns including formal and independent contractor employment;
SSA or UI benefit receipt; mortgage interest payment; business or other capital income; retirement account
distribution; education and health savings account distribution; debt forgiveness; lottery winning; and college
attendance. A comparison to external data suggests that 98.2% of the U.S. population appeared on some income
tax or information return submitted to the IRS in 2003 (Mortenson, Cilke, Udell and Zytnick 2009).

the author’s website, along with data that can be used to approximate the paper’s main result
using publicly available data as demonstrated in Online Appendix Table 1.
       3. Covariates. Age is defined as of January 1 of the year, using date of birth from SSA
records housed alongside tax records. Female is an indicator for being recorded as female in
SSA records. Following Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song (2014), an individual had high labor
force attachment if she earned at least $10,382 in 2015 dollars—the compensation for 1,600
hours of work at the 2004 federal minimum wage in 2015 dollars—of earnings in each of the
four years 2003-2006. An individual had no labor force attachment if she had zero earnings
in any year 2003-2006. All other individuals had low labor force attachment. 1040 filer is an
indicator for whether the individual appeared as either a primary or secondary filer on a Form
1040 tax return in tax year 2006. Married is an indicator for whether the individual was either
the primary or secondary filer on a married-filing-jointly or married-filing-separately 1040 return
in tax year 2006. Number of kids equals the number of children (zero, one, or two-or-more)
living with the individual as recorded on the individual’s 2006 1040 if the individual was a 1040
filer and zero otherwise. Mortgage holder is an indicator for whether a Form 1098 information
return was issued on the individual’s behalf by a mortgage servicer in 2006.14 Birth state is
derived from SSA records and, for immigrants, equals the state of naturalization.
       2006 industry equals the four-digit NAICS industry code on the business income tax return
of an individual’s highest-paying 2006 Form W-2, whenever a match can be made between the
masked EIN on the W-2 and the masked EIN on the business income tax return. Four-digit
NAICS codes are quite narrow, distinguishing for example between restaurants and bars. As
displayed below in summary statistics and similar to recent work (Kline, Petkova, Williams
and Zidar 2017, Mogstad, Lamadon and Setzler 2017), almost half of all W-2 earners could
not be matched—likely because the employer is a government entity (which does not file an
income tax return, covering 15-20% of employment) or because the firm uses a different EIN
(e.g. a non-tax-filing subsidiary) to pay workers from the one that appears on the firm’s tax
  14
    A mortgage servicer is required to file a Form 1098 on behalf of any individual from whom the servicer
receives at least $600 in mortgage interest on any one mortgage during the calendar year.



                                                   15
return. For the construction of fixed effects, I assign individuals with missing industry to their
own exclusive industry; I assign non-W-2-earning contractors to their own exclusive industry;
and I assign the nonemployed to their own exclusive industry. I show below that results are
nearly unchanged when restricting the sample to the nonemployed and those with a valid W-2
industry, for whom the correct industry is universally observed.
       2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects are interactions between age (measured in one-year
increments), 2006 industry, and sixteen bins of the individual’s 2006 earnings (in 2015 dollars
inflated by the CPI-U) from the individual’s highest-paying employer.15 2006 firm equals the
masked EIN on the individual’s highest-paying 2006 W-2. 2006 age-earnings-firm fixed effects
are constructed analogously to 2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects. Other controls are used
only for robustness checks and are defined when used.


3.4       Summary Statistics

Table 1 reports summary statistics across the three samples. 79.1% of the main sample was
employed in 2015, with mean 2015 earnings (including zeros and top-coded at $500,000) of
$47,587. 6.2% received DI in 2015, and 25.6% received UI in at least one year 2007-2014.
49.3% of the sample is female. 62.4% had high labor force attachment 2003-2006. The average
2006 age is 39.9 years. The retail chain sample is on average more female, less attached to the
labor force, and less likely to be married. The mass layoffs sample is on average less female,
more attached to the labor force, less likely to be married, and more likely to have worked in
construction or manufacturing in 2006 than the main sample. Industry in the main sample is
observed for 51.1% of W-2 earners. The average Great Recession local shock was a 2007-2009
increase in the local unemployment rate of 4.6 percentage points, with a standard deviation of
1.5 percentage points. Each of the three samples comprises roughly one million individuals.
       Figure 3 displays a heat map of Great Recession local shocks. Familiar patterns are apparent,
  15
    The main result below is nearly identical when using Local CPI 2—the more aggressive of the Moretti (2013)
local price deflators—to locally deflate 2006 earnings before binning. Chosen to create roughly even-sized bins,
the bin minimums are: $0, $2,000, $4,000, $6,000, $8,000, $10,000, $15,000, $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000,
$40,000, $45,000, $50,000, $75,000, and $100,000.

such as severe shocks in certain manufacturing areas and California’s Central Valley but not
along California’s coast. 30.0% of the variation in Great Recession local shocks is statistically
explained by the house-price-driven percent change in household net worth 2006-2009 (Mian and
Sufi 2009, correlation 0.547). Recalling the introduction’s example, Phoenix—America’s sixth
largest city and shown in the medium-dark-shaded CZ in the middle of Arizona—experienced
a 77th percentile shock (6.0 percentage points) while San Antonio—America’s seventh largest
city and shown in the large faintly shaded land-locked CZ in the middle-bottom of Texas—
experienced a 7th percentile shock (2.6 percentage points). The empirical analysis compares
the 2015 outcomes of individuals who were living in 2007 in places like Phoenix to initially
similar individuals who were living in 2007 in places like San Antonio.



4     Overall Impacts

This section presents the paper’s main result: the estimated effect on 2015 employment of Great
Recession local shocks. I begin by presenting the main regression estimate visually and in table
form, followed by robustness and extrapolation exercises.


4.1    Preferred Estimates

Figure 4A plots the time series of estimated effects of Great Recession local shocks on employ-
ment. Each year t’s data point equals β̂ from the following version of Equation 3.1 estimated
on the main sample:


                             eit = βSHOCKc(i2007) + θg(i2006) + it ,                        (4.1)

                                                            P2006
where relative employment eit ≡ EM P LOY EDit −         8     s=1999   EM P LOY EDis is i’s change
in mean binary employment status from pre-recession years to year t, SHOCKc(i2007) denotes
the Great Recession shock to i’s 2007 CZ, and θg(i2006) denotes 2006 age-earnings-industry
fixed effects. Measuring employment outcomes relative to each individual’s pre-recession mean


                                               17
transparently allows for baseline employment rate differences, similar to the relative cumulative
earnings outcome of Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song (2014). The identifying assumption is
that Great Recession local shocks are as-good-as-randomly assigned conditional on age, initial
earnings, and initial industry. The sample and independent variable values are fixed across 4A’s
annual regressions; only the outcome varies from year to year. 95% confidence intervals are
plotted in vertical lines unadjusted for multiple hypotheses, based on standard errors clustered
by 2007 state.
   The 2015 data point shows the paper’s main result: a 1-percentage-point-higher Great Re-
cession local shock (2007-2009 spike in the CZ unemployment rate) caused the average working-
age American to be an estimated 0.393 percentage points less likely to be employed in 2015.
The 2015 impact of Great Recession local shocks is very significantly different from zero, with
a t-statistic of 4.1.
   Figure 4B supports the linear specification of Equation 4.1 by plotting the underlying condi-
tional expectation. It is constructed by regressing each individual’s Great Recession local shock
on the age-earnings-industry fixed effects, computing residuals, adding the mean shock to the
residuals, ordering and binning the residuals into twenty evenly sized bins, and plotting mean
2015 relative employment within each bin versus the bin’s mean residual. The displayed non-
parametric relationship between 2015 relative employment and Great Recession local shocks is
largely linear.
   Returning to Panel A, the pre-recession time series of estimated effects constitute placebo
tests supporting the identifying assumption that conditional on controls, Great Recession local
shocks were as good as randomly assigned. In particular, the 1999-2006 point estimates do
not display a downward pre-trend that would suggest a negative 2015 point estimate even in
the absence of Great Recession local shocks. The graph makes other statistics possible. For
example, the 1999-2006 point estimates average zero by construction, but one could prefer
to benchmark the 2015 estimate to a subset of pre-recession estimates like 1999-2001; when
subtracting the 1999-2001 mean estimate from the 2015 estimate, one obtains the still-large
effect of −0.316. When subtracting the 2004-2006 mean estimate, one obtains −0.507.

                                               18
   Table 2 displays coefficient estimates from Equation 4.1 in the main sample under various
specifications. Column 4 corresponds to Figure 4A’s 2015 data point, my preferred estimate.
Columns 1-3 replicate the analysis with coarser fixed effects and yield similar results, indicating
relatively little selection on the controlled dimensions among working-age Americans. Column
5 displays ordered effect sizes by shock quintile, indicating for example that living in 2007 in
the most-shocked quintile of CZs resulted in the average individual being −1.75pp less likely to
be employed in 2015 relative to living in 2007 in the least-shocked quintile. These effects are
large in that they are similar in magnitude to the age-adjusted U.S. employment rate decline
2007-2015.
   Full-year nonemployment indicates either long-term unemployment or labor force non-
participation (“exit”). Unemployment and participation are not observed in tax data. To
provide an indication of whether the nonemployment effects of Great Recession local shocks
reflect labor force exit, I test whether controlling for local unemployment persistence—equal to
the CZ’s 2015 unemployment rate minus its 2007 unemployment rate—in the individual’s 2007
CZ (column 6) or 2015 CZ (column 7) attenuates the main estimate. This test can be viewed
as conservative: controlling for epsilon-higher unemployment persistence in relatively severely
shocked areas could fully attenuate the main estimate without that unemployment persistence
being able to explain it quantitatively. In practice, the controls slightly and insignificantly
attenuate the main estimate from −0.393 to −0.366 and −0.364, respectively. This suggests
that most and possibly all of the 2015 nonemployment impact of Great Recession local shocks
took the form of labor force exit, consistent with cross-state patterns in Figure 1B.16
  Figure 4C repeats Figure 4A for the alternative outcome of relative earnings:

                 P
                   s=1999 EARN IN GSis . Similar to Panel A, Panel C’s coefficient estimates

exhibit no consistent trend in the pre-recession period and then fall persistently after the reces-
sion. Table 2 column 9 prints the graph’s 2015 data point which indicates that living in 2007
in a CZ that experienced a 1-pp-higher unemployment shock caused the average working-age
  16
     Local unemployment rates converged throughout 2015. When using only July-December to define local
unemployment persistence, the controls leave the estimate unchanged at −0.392 and −0.393, respectively.

size cumulates to −6, 212 over the seven-year period 2009-2015. Multiplied by the interquartile
range of Great Recession shocks, this last point estimate implies an average cumulative earnings
loss of $14,352, unconditional on layoff or nonemployment.
    Finally, traditional analyses conceive of the Great Recession as a fluctuation that inter-
rupted a long-run trend. However, it is possible that the mid-2000s period was a positive
“masking” fluctuation (Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo 2016) around a long-run secular de-
cline in manufacturing employment (Charles, Hurst and Schwartz 2018) without extremely low
unemployment rates. In that case, this section would still identify 2015 employment impacts
of the masking-ending recession, and one may then interpret 2015 employment as being in line
with a pre-masking trend.
    I test for the manufacturing-driven unmasking interpretation of this section’s results in two
ways. First, I use the 2000 County Business Patterns to compute each CZ’s manufacturing
share of employment. Column 11 repeats column 4 except that it controls for the individual’s
2007 CZ’s manufacturing share. The coefficient falls by less than one half of one standard
error to −0.364 and is still very statistically significant.18 Thus the effect of Great Recession
local shocks holds within CZs with similar manufacturing shares. Second, for columns 12-13,
I use the Mian and Sufi (2014) county-level measure of the 2006-2009 change in housing net
worth to compute each CZ’s 2006-2009 change in housing net worth. I then group individuals
into three bins according to their 2007 CZ: CZs with an above-median manufacturing share
(“Rust” since many are in rust-belt states), CZs with a below-median manufacturing share and
a below-median (i.e. especially adverse) change in housing net worth (“Sun” since many are
in sun-belt states), and Other CZs. Column 12 repeats column 4 except that it includes an
interaction of the Rust indicator and the Great Recession local shock variable, an interaction of
  17
     Figure 6B below scales this estimate by the individual’s pre-recession earnings. The earnings analysis makes
no correction for local cost-of-living changes. Measuring changes in local living costs remains contentious given
the difficulty of measuring changes in local amenities (Moretti 2013) and a historical presumption that local
amenities exactly offset apparent cross-area real income differences (Rosen 1979, Roback 1982).
  18
     The coefficient is −0.358 when controlling for a quartic in the manufacturing share.


                                                       20
the Other indicator and the shock variable, and the indicators separately. Column 13 repeats
column 12 except without the Other indicator and interaction. Both columns exhibit large and
significant main effects of the shock variable, indicating that the effect holds within Sun CZs
and is not driven only by Rust CZs. However, much room remains for manufacturing-driven
masking effects, including effects across industries and effects that pre-dated the recession or
were otherwise not mediated by Great Recession unemployment shocks.


4.2    Basic Robustness

Table 3 presents several robustness checks. Column 1 replicates the main estimate, from Table
2 column 4. Columns 2-5 control respectively for individual level characteristics that could
independently determine labor supply: gender, 2006 number of kids, 2006 marital status, and
2006 home ownership fixed effects. In case residents of large or growing CZs had different
employment trajectories, column 6 controls for the individual’s 2007 CZ size, equal to the CZ’s
total employment in 2006 as reported in Census’s County Business Patterns (CBP), while col-
umn 7 controls for the individual’s 2007 CZ’s size growth, equal to the CZ’s log change in
CBP employment from 2000 to 2006. Column 8 controls for the individual’s 2007 CZ’s share
of workers who work outside of the CZ, computed from the 2006-2010 American Community
Surveys and motivated by recent work suggesting that commuting options can attenuate local
shock incidence (Monte, Redding and Rossi-Hansberg 2015). As an early check of a policy
mechanism, column 9 controls for the individual’s 2007 state’s maximum unemployment insur-
ance duration over years 2007-2015, derived from Mueller, Rothstein and Von Wachter (2015).
Column 10 similarly controls for the individual’s 2007 state’s minimum wage change 2007-2015,
using data provided by Vaghul and Zipperer (2016) and used in Clemens and Wither (2014).
The number of kids, marriage, and pre-2007 CZ size growth controls somewhat attenuate the
main estimate while others amplify it, and all estimates remain within one half of one standard
error of the main estimate.
   Nearly half of 2006 employees could not be matched to an industry code (Section 3.3).



                                              21
Column 11 confines the sample to the 2006 employees who could be matched to an industry
code and to the 2006 nonemployed. Column 12 further omits 2006 employees in construction or
manufacturing—two industries that could have disproportionately attracted workers (e.g. non-
college-educated men) in severely shocked areas who might have experienced large employment
declines even in the absence of the recession due to secular nationwide skill-biased change.
Finally, severely shocked CZs like Phoenix had attracted many in-migrants in the decades
leading up to 2007; if those in-migrants had somehow been negatively selected on future labor
productivity or other employment determinants conditional on the main controls, the main
estimate could be confounded. Column 13 addresses this concern by instrumenting one’s Great
Recession local shock using the mean Great Recession local shock in the individual’s birth state.
None of these specifications attenuates the main point estimate.


4.3     Within-Job Robustness

The above estimates of the 2015 impact of Great Recession local shocks control for age-earnings-
industry fixed effects. Those estimates will be biased if there was secular nationwide skill-
biased change 2007-2015 and if skill differed across space within age-earnings-industry bins
in a correlated way with Great Recession local shocks. To address this possibility, Figure
5A and Table 4 attempt to better approximate within-skill estimates by controlling for age-
earnings-firm fixed effects in the retail chain sample. The motivation is that—unlike firms
in manufacturing and other industries—retail chain firms like Walmart and Starbucks employ
workers with similar skills to perform the same job at similar earnings in many local areas.19
The retail chain sample comprises working-age workers who in 2006 worked at a retail chain
firm in a local area outside the firm’s corporate headquarters. To the extent that age-earnings-
firm bins proxy for jobs across space and that skill selection into jobs is similar across space,
estimates controlling for age-earnings-firm fixed effects in the retail chain sample will mitigate
skill selection threats. I refer to such estimates as within-job estimates.
  19
    In contrast for example, Boeing employs workers with strong writing skills in Virginia in order to manage
government contracts and employs workers with strong manufacturing skills in Washington State in order to
build airplanes—possibly of the same age and at the same annual earnings.


                                                     22
       Figure 5A repeats Figure 4A in the retail chain sample and with 2006 age-earnings-firm fixed
effects.20 Figures 5A and 4A show broadly similar time series patterns and point estimates. In
the retail chain sample, I estimate that a 1-pp-higher Great Recession local shock resulted in
the average working-age American being 0.359 percentage points less likely to be employed in
2015—similar to the 0.393pp estimate in the main sample. Thus the main result is robust to
the within-job specification.
       Table 4 repeats Table 2 for the retail chain sample and with specifications using 2006 age-
earnings-firm fixed effects. Column 5 displays the 2015 point estimate from Figure 5A. Relative
to column 4’s estimate controlling only for age-earnings-industry fixed effects, one sees that the
firm fixed effects attenuate the point estimate by 11.8%, or one half of one standard error.21 If
the paper’s main estimate of −0.393 is overstated by 11.8%, then the true main-sample effect
size would be −0.347. The retail chain sample’s earnings effects are smaller than those in the
main sample, though 2015 mean earnings are also smaller in the retail chain sample. Overall,
results are similar across the main and retail chain samples.


4.4       Extrapolation

I close the section with a simple extrapolation of the 2015 employment impact of Great Re-
cession local shocks to the 2015 employment impact of the Great Recession aggregate shock.
The exercise adopts the strong “naive” assumption that the impact of the Great Recession
aggregate shock on national residents is identical to the impact of a proportionally sized Great
Recession local shock on initial local residents as in similar work (e.g. Charles, Hurst and No-
towidigdo 2015). I find that simple extrapolation suggests the Great Recession caused 76% of
the post-recession age-adjusted decline in the working-age U.S. employment rate as measured
in this paper (any annual employment of the birth cohorts aged 30-49 in 2007).
       The extrapolation estimate of 76% derives from three inputs. First, the aggregate U.S.
  20
     Table 1 showed that the main and retail chain samples differ demographically, and the next section finds
impact heterogeneity across demographic groups. I therefore reweight the retail chain sample to match the main
sample as in DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) along 2007 CZ, gender, five-year age bin, and 2006 earnings
bins as defined below in Figure 6.
  21
     Introducing firm fixed effects increased the effect magnitude in an earlier version’s specifications.


                                                     23
unemployment rate increased 4.63 percentage points from 2007 to 2009. Second, Table 2 column
4 reported that exposure to a one-percentage-point-higher local unemployment spike 2007-2009
induced a 0.393 percentage-point decline in any 2015 employment. Based on these two inputs,
simple extrapolation suggests a 1.82 (= 4.63 × 0.393) percentage-point decline in the U.S.
working-age employment rate because of the Great Recession.
    Third, the employment rate decline of these birth cohorts through 2015 of 7.23 per-
centage points (Table 2) was 2.40 percentage points larger than the decline that would
have been expected due to aging, based on analogous earlier cohorts through years 2003-
2007.    Specifically, recall that −7.23 = ∆ē2015 , where ∆ēt ≡ E[EM P LOY EDit |c(i) ∈
Ct ] − 18 t−9
         P
           s=t−16 E[EM P LOY EDis |c(i) ∈ Ct ] and Ct is the set of working-age birth cohorts

{t−58, ..., t−39}. These cohorts would have experienced an employment rate decline due to
aging even in the absence of the recession. I quantify the aging effect using employment rates
of analogous earlier working-age cohorts through years 2003-2007 as 51 2007
                                                                          P
                                                                            t=2003 ∆ēt = −4.83,

based on the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) in
lieu of tax data availability before 1999. The age-adjusted working-age employment rate decline
was therefore 2.40 (= 7.23 − 4.83) percentage points. Hence, simple extrapolation suggests that
the Great Recession caused 76% (= 1.82/2.40) of the age-adjusted decline.22
    It is important to note that the actual impact may be more or less than 76%. First, there
is statistical and specification uncertainty in the 2015 impact of Great Recession local shocks.
Sections 4.1 and 4.3 described scenarios in which one could believe that the true effect size
was closer to 0.3. When using 0.300 instead of 0.393, the share explained by the recession is
58%. Second, there is extrapolative uncertainty because of general equilibrium considerations
(Nakamura and Steinsson 2014, Beraja, Hurst and Ospina 2016). A shock to one local area can
have a larger local impact than a proportionately sized aggregate shock, for example because
production can more easily shift across local areas than across countries. Alternatively, the
  22
     Note that the age-adjusted decline of 2.40 percentage points is similar to the age-adjusted declines in headline
BLS point-in-time employment rates reported in the introduction. To account             for modest age distribution
                                                                                     P2007
differences related to the baby boom, cohorts underlying the computation of 15 t=2003 ∆ēt are reweighted to
match the working-age distribution for t=2015 as written in the printed appendix.



                                                         24
impact of an aggregate shock may exceed the impact of a proportionately sized local shock on
initial local residents, for example to the extent that initial local residents escaped or dampened
local shock impacts by migrating to other local areas (Blanchard and Katz 1992) more than to
other countries.



5     Impact Heterogeneity

This section analyzes impact heterogeneity across individuals. An active literature in labor
economics studies determinants of wage earnings inequality within (e.g. Card, Heining and
Kline 2013) and across (e.g. Autor, Katz and Kearney 2008) worker types. The previous
section found that Great Recession local shocks caused 2015 wage earnings inequality within
worker types: initially similar workers experienced different 2015 employment and earnings
outcomes after exposure to different Great Recession local shocks. Figure 6 explores effects of
Great Recession local shocks on inequality across worker types.
    Figure 6A displays employment impact heterogeneity. The figure’s first five rows plot point
estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the 2015 employment impact of Great Recession local
shocks overall in the main sample (reprinting the main estimate from Table 2 column 4) and in
each of four 2006 earnings bins, a common proxy for broad initial skill level (e.g. Autor, Dorn,
Hanson and Song 2014). I find that low initial earners bore more of the employment incidence
of Great Recession local shocks, suggesting that those shocks increased employment inequality
across workers of different initial skill levels. Low initial earners (defined as those who earned
less than $15,000 in 2006, approximately the 33rd percentile in this sample) experienced a worse
than average impact, while high initial earners (defined as those who more than $45,000 in 2006,
approximately the 67th percentile) experienced a better-than-average impact. This cross-area
finding mirrors the earlier cross-time finding that aggregate employment declines since 2007
were concentrated among the least-skilled (Hoynes, Miller and Schaller 2012, Charles, Hurst
and Notowidigdo 2016). The subsequent three rows suggest worse-than-average impacts among
individuals with less labor force attachment (Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song).


                                                25
   Panel B displays similar patterns for earnings. I analyze proportional earnings changes
in order to parallel earlier work on earnings inequality studying earnings ratios such as
the ratio of the 90th and 50th percentiles (Autor, Katz and Kearney 2008).                           Analo-
gous to Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song, the outcome in each regression is the ratio of
2015 earnings to mean annual pre-2007 earnings with no local cost-of-living adjustments:
EARN IN GSi2015 / 18 2006                  23
                    P
                      s=1999 EARN IN GSis .   The overall estimate indicates a large impact of
Great Recession local shocks on proportional earnings: a 1-percentage-point-higher Great Re-
cession local shock reduced the average individual’s 2015 earnings by 3.55% of her pre-recession
earnings. The subgroup analysis reveals relatively similar proportional earnings declines across
subgroups except by initial earnings and labor force attachment subgroups, where low initial
earners and less-attached individuals experienced larger declines. Hence, both the employment
and earnings analyses suggest that Great Recession local shocks increased inequality across
workers of different initial skill levels.
   The remaining rows of Figure 6 display impact heterogeneity by gender, 2007 age group,
2006 marital status, 2006 number of kids, and 2006 mortgage holding status. I find larger
employment effects among older individuals than among younger individuals—consistent with
previous work suggesting the older workers are less resilient to labor market shocks (Jacobson,
LaLonde and Sullivan 1993).
   Finally, one may expect that migration rate heterogeneity explains impact heterogeneity,
in light of the lesson from Blanchard and Katz (1992) that population reallocation equilibrates
U.S. local labor markets. Figure 6 lists migration rates—defined as the share of individuals
with a 2015 CZ different from their 2007 CZ—for each subgroup of individuals to the right
of the subgroup-specific impacts. There is no consistent correlation between migration rates
and estimated Great Recession local shock impacts. For example, non-mortgage-holders had
an 18% migration rate while mortgage-holders had a 13% migration rate, yet if anything non-
mortgage-holders appear to have experienced larger impacts. The next section further explores
  23
     This quantity is very right-skewed and therefore top-coded at the 99th percentile. Individuals with zero
1999-2006 earnings are assigned the top code if 2015 earnings were positive and assigned 0 otherwise.



                                                     26
adjustment via out-migration.



6     Adjustment Margins

This paper’s rich administrative data allow me not only to estimate long-term employment
and earnings impacts but also to estimate year-by-year adjustments across space and onto
social insurance programs. Table 5 analyzes year-by-year adjustment margins. Each cell lists
the coefficient and standard error on the Great Recession local shock variable from a separate
regression in the main analysis sample with the main controls (2006-age-earnings-industry fixed
effects), varying only the outcome. Column 1 reproduces the 2007-2015 employment estimates
plotted in Figure 4A. Column 2 analyzes migration, using a binary outcome equal to one if
and only if an individual’s residential CZ in the year was different from her 2007 CZ. The
estimates indicate that individuals who experienced more severe Great Recession local shocks
were insignificantly 0.073 percentage points more likely to have moved after 2007 relative to
the overall migration rate of 16%, suggesting that out-migration was not a major adjustment
margin.
    Columns 3 and 4 further support that conclusion by disaggregating the annual employment
results of column 1 into two types of annual employment: employment inside the individual’s
2007 CZ and employment outside the individual’s 2007 CZ, similar to Autor, Dorn, Hanson
and Song (2014).24 Unsurprisingly given the main effect of column 1, column 3 shows that
individuals subject to more severe Great Recession local shocks were significantly less likely
to be employed in their 2007 CZs in 2015. But column 4 shows that these individuals were
insignificantly less likely to be employed outside of their 2007 CZs as well. Columns 5-7 show
analogous results for earnings. Column 7 shows a marginally significant negative effect of Great
Recession local shocks on out-of-2007-CZ earnings in 2015, implying no replacement of lost 2015
within-initial-CZ earnings with earnings in other CZs at the 95% confidence upper bound.

otherwise. The column 4 outcome for a year t equals M OV EDit ∗EM P LOY EDit − 8 s=1999 EM P LOY EDis .



                                                    27
       The lack of an out-migration response may be surprising given the finding of Section 2 that
population fell relative to trend in severely shocked states and by the same large magnitude
predicted by Blanchard and Katz (1992). However, population reallocation is consistent with
substantially reduced in-migration rather than substantially increased out-migration (Monras
2015). Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song similarly find that out-migration was not a major
margin of adjustment to import competition. I leave to other work why more individuals did
not out-migrate, or where they migrated (Yagan 2014).
       Columns 8 and 9 study adjustment via social insurance transfer payments: unemployment
insurance (UI) benefits and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.25 Unsurpris-
ingly, individuals exposed to larger Great Recession local shocks received significantly higher
mean UI benefits 2008-2010 than those exposed to smaller local shocks. However, Great Reces-
sion UI benefits soon expired, and these individuals’ higher mean UI benefits declined after 2010
to insignificantly lower UI benefits by 2015. Column 9 shows that individuals subject to Great
Recession local shocks accumulated rising though insignificantly higher SSDI benefits relative
to those subject to smaller Great Recession local shocks. Comparing the sum of the 2007-2015
UI and SSDI income coefficients to the sum of the column 5 earnings coefficients, one estimates
that elevated UI and SSDI transfer payments replaced 5.1% of lost earnings: 4.2% from UI and
0.9% from SSDI. Focusing only on 2015 SSDI, one estimates that 2015 SSDI replaced 2.0%
(= 19.6/997) of lost 2015 earnings, rising to 5.6% at the 95% confidence upper bound.26 Thus
observed transfer payments far from fully compensated for the negative earnings effects.27
       SSDI has been found to be an important margin of adjustment to labor market shocks
(Autor and Duggan 2003, Autor, Dorn and Hanson 2013, Autor, Dorn, Hanson and Song
  25
     UI provides temporary cash benefits to laid-off workers who had earned above a minimum threshold in the
quarters preceding layoff. SSDI provides typically permanent (until retirement age) cash and medical benefits
to individuals with at least five years of work history in the ten years prior to the individual developing a
long-lasting medical condition deemed to prevent substantial employment.
  26
     To estimate the upper bound, I regress 2015 SSDI on 2015 relative earnings instrumented with Great
Recession local shocks, controlling for 2006-age-earnings-industry fixed effects and clustering on 2007 state.
The coefficient on 2015 relative earnings is −0.020 with a standard error of 0.018.
  27
     Spousal labor supply was likely also a very incomplete adjustment margin: the shocks studied here are
measured as CZ-wide shocks, both genders and marital statuses suffered large impacts (Figure 6), and earlier
work in similar data showed that wives replaced only 5.6% of males’ lost income after layoff (Hilger 2014).



                                                     28
2014). Expanding on Table 5’s null SSDI results, Table 6 column 1 replicates the paper’s main
specification for the binary outcome of SSDI receipt in 2015. I find a moderate and insignificant
estimated impact, though with substantial uncertainty: a point estimate of 0.071 and standard
error of 0.145 percentage points, relative to the employment impact of −0.393 percentage points.
      More thoroughly, one can estimate the share of the incrementally nonemployed in severely
shocked areas who were on SSDI in 2015. Table 6 column 2 estimates the effect of Great
Recession local shocks on a new outcome similar to Lee (2009): an indicator for the whether
the worker was employed in 2015 or received SSDI in 2015, minus mean employment 1999-
2006.28 Table 6 column 2 reports that Great Recession local shocks had a significant negative
effect −0.265 percentage points on the employed-or-SSDI outcome, suggesting that 32.6% (=
1−−0.265/−0.393) of the incrementally nonemployed received SSDI in 2015. However, standard
errors are substantial.
      The potentially modest role of SSDI in absorbing individuals after Great Recession local
shocks is consistent with aggregate patterns. The share of age-16-65 Americans on SSDI rose
for three decades before decelerating after 2010 and declining absolutely in both 2014 and 2015.
Aggregate SSDI applications spiked after the Great Recession as they have after previous reces-
sions, but Maestas, Mullen and Strand (2015) use data through 2012 to estimate that virtually
all of the Great-Recession-induced applications were initially declined. SSDI application is not
observed in this paper’s data.



7       Layoffs and Nonemployment Trajectories

Table 5 showed that statistically significant nonemployment effects began in 2009 and that there
were statistically significant effects on unemployment insurance (UI) benefits 2008-2010. A large
literature connects layoffs and long-term earnings losses (Topel 1990, Ruhm 1991, Jacobson,
LaLonde and Sullivan 1993, Neal 1995, Kahn 2010, Davis and Von Wachter 2011). I therefore
provide additional evidence on layoffs and long-term employment losses.
 28                                                                   1
                                                                          P2006
   That is, the outcome equals max{EM P LOY EDi2015 , SSDIi2015 } −   8    s=1999   EM P LOY EDis where
SSDIi2015 equals one if i received SSDI in 2015 and zero otherwise.

                                               29
    Table 6 column 6 replicates the main specification for the binary outcome of ever having
received UI 2007-2014—a good proxy for ever having been laid off 2007-2014.29 The column
indicates that a one-percentage-point higher Great Recession local shock induced individuals
to be 1.43 percentage points more likely to receive UI 2007-2014, with a t-statistic over three
and relative to the sample mean of 25.6%.
    The substantial 2007-2014 layoff effect relative to the 2015 employment effect suggests that
most of the incrementally nonemployed from severely shocked areas may have been laid off.
Column 7 confirms that suggestion. Analogous to column 2’s employed-or-on-SSDI analysis,
column 7 replicates the main specification on a new outcome: an indicator for the whether the
individual was employed in 2015 or received UI at some point 2007-2014, minus the individual’s
mean employment status 1999-2006. The column 7 estimate is nearly zero and indicates that
Great Recession local shocks had no statistically significant impact on the employed-or-UI
outcome. Hence, most of the incrementally nonemployed from severely shocked areas had been
laid off.
    The preceding findings may suggest that the initial residents of severely shocked areas
suffered higher rates of 2015 nonemployment purely because those residents were laid off from
their initial jobs at higher rates. Two pieces of evidence suggest that that is not the case. First,
column 8 replicates the main specification while controlling for the indicator of ever receiving
UI 2007-2014. The Great Recession local shock coefficient is barely attenuated, indicating that
effects hold within layoff status. It is easy to see why quantitatively: multiplying the coefficient
on UI receipt (−2.73) by the higher rate of UI receipt (1.43) yields the 0.04pp attenuation in the
main estimate. Layoff status is endogenous, but with homogeneous layoff effects and under the
mild monotonicity condition that the marginally laid-off in severely shocked areas had weakly
better unobservables (Gibbons and Katz 1991), this result suggests that layoff effects are not
nearly large enough for a 1.43pp-higher layoff rate to explain the 2015 employment effect.30
  29
     Kawano and LaLumia (2017) show that UI-tax-data-based unemployment rates are close in both level and
trend to official Bureau-of-Labor-Statistics unemployment rates 1999-2011 (correlation 0.94). Earlier papers
typically proxy for layoff using firm separation during a firm’s large downsizing; my measure here is not limited
to large downsizings.
  30
     Under homogenous layoff effects and the monotonicity condition, the UI receipt coefficient weakly overstates


                                                       30
    More simply, Figure 5B replicates Figure 4A in the mass layoffs sample—thereby comparing
the employment rates of workers who were displaced in 2008-2009 mass layoff events at the
same age and in the same initial earnings bin and in the same initial industry, but in different
local areas. If layoff effects were homogenous across space and severely shocked areas simply
experienced more layoffs—and if the incrementally displaced in severely shocked areas were
no worse on unobservables (Gibbons and Katz)—then one would not find a negative 2015
employment effect in the mass layoffs sample. Yet Figure 5B shows that individuals in the
mass layoffs sample were 0.577 percentage points less likely to be employed in 2015 for every
1-percentage-point higher Great Recession local shock. This result (also reported in Table 6
column 3) is robust to restricting the sample to mass-layoff firms with valid industry codes,
including those outside manufacturing and construction (columns 4-5). This evidence suggests
that this paper’s 2015 nonemployment effects are not explained purely by higher layoff rates
and parallels work on larger earnings impacts in weak local (Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan
1993) and aggregate (Davis and Von Wachter 2011) labor markets.
    Table 6 columns 9-11 return to the main sample to document continuous nonemployment
trajectories. Column 9 replicates the main specification for the outcome of an indicator for
whether the individual was nonemployed for any year 2007-2014, minus an indicator for whether
the individual was nonemployed for any year 1999-2006. The estimated coefficient implies
that Great Recession local shocks resulted in the average working-age American being 0.487
percentage points more likely to experience a full year of nonemployment 2007-2014. Column
10 shows that pre-2015 nonemployment statistically explains 2015 nonemployment: there is
no statistically significant correlation between Great Recession local shocks and 2015 relative
employment once one controls additively for indicators of employment in each year 2007-2012.
Column 11 replicates the main specification for the outcome of an indicator for whether the
individual was employed in any year 2013-2015, minus the individual’s mean employment 1999-
2006. The estimate is −0.285 with a t-statistic of 2.8. Thus the point estimates in columns
the layoff effect for workers from severely shocked areas, suggesting that the magnitude of the shock coefficient
is a lower bound on the true effect net of the layoff effect.

2007-2012 and constituted a third consecutive year of nonemployment impacts.



8       Discussion of Mechanisms

The previous section found that one candidate channel—higher layoff rates with homogenous
layoff effects—likely does not explain the paper’s results. I close with brief further discussion
of six candidate mechanisms: reduced migration, higher reservation wages on Social Security
Disability Insurance (SSDI), lost job-specific rents, lost firm-specific human capital, general
human capital decay, and persistently low labor demand. Higher reservation wages on SSDI
could explain a sizable portion of the impact. General human capital decay and persistently
low labor demand could explain the full impact.
      Reduced migration could in principle explain long-term impacts of Great Recession local
shocks relative to other local shocks but does not appear to do so. First and despite the
possibility of negative equity mortgages impeding homeowner out-migration (Ferreira, Gyourko
and Tracy 2010, 2011), several papers have argued that the Great Recession did not impede
migration (Farber 2012, Schulhofer-Wohl 2012, Valletta 2013, Sahin, Song, Topa and Violante
2014). Second, Section 2 found that 2007-2015 population reallocation was in line with historical
responses. Third, Figure 6 found that impact heterogeneity across demographic groups was not
systematically correlated with group migration rates—consistent with, though not dispositive
of, a hypotehtically higher out-migration rate attenuating little incidence.
      The Great Recession could have induced individuals to supplement their income with SSDI—
a costly-to-obtain but typically-permanent location-independent income stream—thereby rais-
ing their reservation wages and potentially reducing their employment (Autor and Duggan
2003, Maestas, Mullen and Strand 2013).31 Reservation wages are not observed, but the SSDI
channel appears to explain a minority of the results. Table 6 column 1 estimated that Great
Recession local shocks caused insignificantly higher 2015 SSDI enrollment, with a point estimate
 31
      Recipients forfeit their income streams if they return to substantial work.



                                                        32
equal to one-fifth of the main employment effect, while column 2 estimated that one-third of
the incrementally nonemployed were on SSDI in 2015, though with substantial standard errors.
An important caveat is that applying for SSDI effectively requires nonemployment, so the data
are consistent with strategic labor force exit in order to apply for benefits, even if strategic
application was unsuccessful through 2015.
    Laid-off workers will choose to remain nonemployed after losing a high-paying rent-sharing
job if subsequent wage offers lie below the worker’s reservation wage.32 Lost job-specific rents
do not appear to explain the results. First, the 2015 impact of Great Recession local shocks
is large not only in the main sample but also in the retail chain sample—even though retail is
a canonical low-rent industry (Gibbons and Katz 1991, Krueger and Summers 1988, Katz and
Summers 1989, Murphy and Topel 1990). Second, Figure 6 showed that the largest impacts
were suffered by those with the lowest initial earnings, where the scope for rents was likely low.
Third and most simply, the same figure shows that the estimated 2015 nonemployment impact
appears large for those who had no earnings at all in 2006 and thus certainly had been earning
no rents.
    A worker losing a job for which she had firm-specific human capital will choose to remain
nonemployed if the worker’s marginal product and thus wage at the next-best firm lies below
her reservation wage (Topel 1990, Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan 1993). Lost firm-specific
human capital at layoff does not appear to explain the results, as the quantitative results
remain essentially in tact within displaced individuals (Table 6 columns 5-8 and Figure 5B).
The incrementally laid off in severely shocked areas seem likely to have had weakly better
unobservables, as employers may lay off the unobservably worst workers first (Gibbons and
Katz 1991). Hence, heterogeneous layoff effects—with the incrementally laid off being less
resilient to their loss of firm-specific human capital—appear necessary for the firm-specific
human capital channel to explain the results.
  32
     Motivated by the union wage premium (e.g. Lewis 1963, Farber 1986), some empirical commentary has
interpreted post-layoff earnings losses as reflecting workers’ loss of rents in an initial job that paid above the
worker’s marginal product (e.g. Hall 2011). Pre-existing contrary evidence includes that post-layoff earnings
losses are large and significant across both high-apparent-rent and low-apparent-rent industries (Jacobson,
LaLonde and Sullivan 1993).


                                                       33
       The results appear consistent with general human capital decay and persistently low labor
demand. Severe recessions generate relatively long nonemployment spells, and general human
capital can decay during such spells (Phelps 1972) leading to persistent nonemployment (Pis-
sarides 1992) such as via job ladders with serially correlated unemployment spells (Jarosch
2015). For example, workers may fail to keep up with new technologies or preserve good habits
like punctuality and then may choose non-participation over lower-wage employment (Juhn,
Murphy and Topel 1991, 2002). Consistent with general human capital decay, Table 6 columns
1 and 9-11 found that incremental 2015 nonemployment typically followed a layoff and multiple
years of nonemployment 2007-2014. General human capital decay after a prolonged nonemploy-
ment spell is also consistent with earlier findings of reduced long-term earnings after mass layoffs
in weak local (Jacobson, LaLonde and Sullivan 1993) and aggregate (Davis and Von Wachter
2011) labor markets.
       Alternatively, severely shocked areas may have experienced persistently low labor demand,
and mobility frictions may have resulted in initial residents bearing the incidence (Kline 2010,
Moretti 2011).33 First, local Great Recession driving processes (e.g. spending contractions or
productivity shocks) could have been persistent, causing wages to fall below reservation wages
(Hall 1992, Kline and Moretti 2014).34 Second, transitory Great Recession local shocks may
have reduced the opportunity costs for agents to respond to exogenous nationwide skill-biased
or routine-biased technical progress (Jaimovich and Siu 2013, with recent empirical support
from Hershbein and Kahn 2016)—accelerating wage declines below reservation wages. Third,
transitory Great Recession local shocks may have moved local areas to low-employment equilib-
ria (Diamond 1982, Blanchard and Summers 1986, Benhabib and Farmer 1994, Christiano and
Harrison 1999, Eggertsson and Krugman 2012, Kaplan and Menzio 2014) where neither workers
nor firms search for job matches even though both would gain from trade at the prevailing wage.
  33
     Every decennial census shows that over two-thirds of adults live in their birth state (Molloy, Smith and
Wozniak 2011). The Health and Retirement Study shows that half of adults live within eighteen miles of their
mothers (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/24/upshot/24up-family.html).
  34
     For example with only non-tradable production, net worth contractions (Mian and Sufi 2014) could have
permanently caused residents to shift to home production (Benhabib, Rogerson and Wright 1991, Aguiar and
Hurst 2005), reducing per-capita local labor demand and equilibrium wages below reservation wages.



                                                     34
To the extent the first and last cases are reversible, they are consistent with “hidden slack”
among labor force non-participants. All three cases are consistent with the results, including
the result that most of the incrementally nonemployed had been laid off. Laid-off workers may
be exactly those individuals whose wages fell below reservation wages, or layoffs may have de-
termined which specific workers lost out in the new equilibrium without determining how many
did.
       General human capital decay leaves individuals changed (“scarred”) while persistently low
labor demand leaves local areas changed. Thus unique to the persistently low labor demand
mechanism, exogenously moving individuals in 2015 from severely shocked to mildly shocked
areas may increase their employment rate. Future work could therefore distinguish between
these mechanisms with strong migration instruments that generate quasi-experimental variation
in individuals’ 2015 local areas.35
  35
    In addition, there are other potential mechanisms. For example, workers may have made costly investments,
such as moving in with one’s parents (Kaplan 2012) or honing leisure skills (Aguiar, Bils, Charles and Hurst
2017) during nonemployment spells that then induced labor supply contraction. However, nominal and real
hourly wages declined rather than rose in severely shocked areas (Beraja, Hurst and Ospina 2016). Employers
may have inferred low unobserved productivity from long nonemployment spells, though such inference was
smallest in severely shocked areas (Kroft, Lange and Notowidigdo 2013).

9     Conclusion

This paper used local labor markets as a laboratory to test for long-term employment impacts
of the Great Recession. The central finding is that exposure to a severe local Great Recession
caused working-age Americans to be substantially less likely to be employed at all in 2015,
despite recovery in the local unemployment rate. This finding contrasts with the conventional
view that a business cycle’s employment impacts cease once unemployment recovers. Instead,
the Great Recession altered unemployment-constant (“trend”) employment.36
    The paper highlights five areas for future work. First, the results suggest the importance of
allowing for labor force exit in models of macroeconomic fluctuations (Mortensen and Pissarides
1999).37 Such models have the potential to show countercyclical policies to be relatively fiscally
inexpensive or even self-financing, to the extent that they persistently increase employment and
earnings and thereby tax revenue (DeLong and Summers 2012). Second, higher layoff rates do
not appear to explain the results as the impacts hold within laid-off individuals, pointing instead
to interactions with area-level economic conditions. Future analyses could further test among
mechanisms. Third, new work could investigate whether previous recessions also depressed
long-term employment.
    Fourth, naive extrapolation of the paper’s local-shock-based estimate to the aggregate would
suggest that the Great Recession caused over half of the 2007-2015 age-adjusted decline in U.S.
working-age employment. Subsequent analysis could determine whether the true aggregate
impact was less or more. Finally, hysteresis through 2015 does not imply hysteresis forever,
and it will be valuable to estimate and explain subsequent dynamics. For example, the age-
25-54 U.S. headline employment rate rose 1.6 percentage points from the beginning of 2016
to the end of 2017, primarily via labor force entry. This upward 2016-2017 employment trend
could reflect continued cyclical recovery, with there having been “hidden slack” among labor
   36
      This conclusion includes the possibility that the recession ended a period of unsustainable unemployment-
constant employment, returning the economy to its pre-2000s trend (Charles, Hurst and Notowidigdo 2016).
   37
      From Mortensen and Pissarides: “Despite a flurry of activity [in search and matching theory] since [the
early 1980s], there are still many important questions that are unexplored. One such question is the dynamics
of worker movement in and out of the labor force...Virtually all search equilibrium models assume an exogenous
labor force.” Pissarides (1992) models search intensity that declines with unemployment duration.


                                                      36
force non-participants who subsequently reentered the labor force 2016-2017. The hidden-slack
explanation is consistent with low wage growth 2016-2017 and would indicate that the Great
Recession’s recovery extended anomalously long relative to previous cycles (cf. Fernald, Hall,
Stock and Watson 2017). Alternatively, it is possible that the recent upward employment trend
reflects up-skilling, a new positive aggregate shock, or another force.

Notes: Panel A plots the official seasonally adjusted Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. labor force statistics
from January 2007 through December 2015. The data are monthly and refer to the adult (16+) civilian non-
institutional population. The vertical black line denotes November 2007, the last month before the Great
Recession. For each outcome and month, the graph plots the current value minus the November 2007 value,
so each data point in these series denotes a percentage-point change relative to November 2007. See Online
Appendix Figure A.1 for age-adjusted versions and versions restricted to 25-54-year-olds. Panel B divides
U.S. states into severely (below-median) and mildly (above-median) shocked states based on 2007-2009 state-
level employment growth forecast errors in the autoregressive system of Blanchard and Katz (1992) estimated
on 1976-2007 Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) state-year labor force
statistics. For each outcome and year, the graph uses LAUS to plot the unweighted mean in severely shocked
states, minus the same mean in mildly shocked states. Each series is demeaned relative to its pre-2008 mean.
See Online Appendices A and B for more details.

Notes: Panel A divides states into severely (below-median) and mildly (above-median) shocked states based on
the sum of 2008 and 2009 employment growth forecast errors as described in Figure 1B and repeats the process
for the early-1980s recessions (1980-1982, treated as a single recession) and the early-1990s (1990-1991) recession.
Then for each recession and year relative to the recession, it plots the unweighted mean LAUS employment rate
in severely shocked states, minus the same mean in mildly shocked states. Each series is demeaned relative to its
pre-recession mean. For comparability across recessions, year 0 denotes the last recession year (1982, 1991, or
2009) while year −1 denotes the last pre-recession year (1979, 1989, or 2007); intervening years are not plotted.
Appendix Figure A.5 plots analogous graphs for labor force participation, unemployment, employment growth,
and population growth. Not shown, the post-2001-recession experience exhibited incomplete convergence before
being interrupted by positively correlated 2007-2009 shocks. Panel B uses LAUS data to plot de-trended 2007-
2014 population changes—equal to each state’s 2007-2014 percent change in population minus its 2000-2007
percent change in population—versus the state’s 2007-2009 employment shock. Overlaid is the unweighted
best-fit line with a slope of 1.016 (robust standard error of 0.260). The dotted lines of Panel C plot Blanchard-
Katz (1992) history-based predictions for state-level responses to a −1% 2007-2009 state-level employment
shock, based on feeding the 1976-1990-estimated Blanchard-Katz system a −.41% employment shock followed
by a −.59% employment shock. The solid lines plot mean actual state-level responses based on reduced-form
regressions of 2008-2014 state-level outcomes on 2007-2009 state-level shocks. See Online Appendix B for more
details.

Notes: This map depicts unweighted octiles (divisions by increments of 12.5 percentiles) of Great Recession
local shocks across Commuting Zones (CZs). CZs span the entire United States and are collections of counties
that share strong commuting ties. Each CZ’s shock equals the CZ’s 2009 LAUS unemployment rate minus the
CZ’s 2007 LAUS unemployment rate. In the individual-level analysis, I assign each individual to the Great
Recession local shock of the individual’s January 2007 CZ.

Notes: Panel A plots regression estimates of the effect of Great Recession local shocks on relative employment
controlling for 2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects in the main sample. Each year t’s outcome is year-
t relative employment: the individual’s year-t employment (indicator for any employment in t) minus the
individual’s mean 1999-2006 employment. 95% confidence intervals are plotted around estimates, clustering on
2007 state. For reference, the 2015 data point (the paper’s main estimate) implies that a 1-percentage-point
higher Great Recession local shock caused individuals to be 0.393 percentage points less likely to be employed
in 2015. Panel B non-parametrically depicts the relationship underlying the main estimate. It is produced
by regressing Great Recession local shocks on 2006 age-earnings-industry fixed effects, computing residuals,
adding back the mean shock level for interpretation, and plotting means of 2015 relative employment within
twenty equal-sized bins of the shock residuals. Overlaid is the best-fit line, whose slope equals −0.393. Panel C
replicates Panel A for the outcome of relative earnings: the individual’s year-t earnings minus the individual’s
mean 1999-2006 earnings.

Notes: Panel A replicates Figure 4A in the retail chain sample (all year-2006 non-headquarters workers for
identifiable retail chain firms) with 2006 age-earnings-firm fixed effects instead of 2006 age-earnings-industry
fixed effects. The retail chain sample is reweighted to match the main sample as in DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux
(1996) along 2007 CZ, gender, five-year age bin, and 2006 earnings bin as defined below in Figure 6. Each fully
interacted cell with overlap in both samples receives the same total weight in the retail sample as in the main
sample; the 0.02% of retail chain sample observations with no overlap receive zero weight. Reweighting nearly
halves the impact of firm fixed effects (the difference between Table 4 columns 4 and 5) and negligibly affects
the final point estimate. Panel B replicates Figure 4A in the mass layoffs sample (all workers who separated
from a firm in a 2008 or 2009 mass layoff), also reweighted to match the main sample as above with a negligible
effect on the final point estimate. See the notes to Figure 4A for specification details.

Notes: Panel A plots coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (clustering by 2007 state) of the impact of Great Recession local
shocks on 2015 relative employment—overall and by subgroup. All estimates derive from the specification underlying Figure 4A’s
2015 data point, corresponding here to the overall row. Subgroup estimates restrict the sample to the specified subgroup defined
by 2006 earnings, 2003-2006 labor force attachment, 2007 age, gender, 2006 marital status, 2006 number of kids, or 2006 mortgage
holding. Non-1040-filers are classified here as single and childless. Subgroup migration rates are superimposed on the right.
Migration is defined as one’s 2015 CZ being different from one’s 2007 CZ. Panel B replicates panel A for 2015 earnings expressed in
multiples of mean annual earnings 1999-2006: 2015 earnings divided by mean annual 1999-2006 earnings. This quantity is top-coded
at the 99th percentile, and individuals with zero 1999-2006 earnings are assigned the top code if 2015 earnings were positive and
assigned 0 otherwise. The overall estimate is -3.55 (standard error 0.94), implying that a 1-percentage-point-higher Great Recession
local shock reduced the average individual’s 2015 earnings by 3.55% of her pre-recession earnings.

Notes - This table lists summary statistics for the paper's three tax-data-based samples: the main sample (a 2% random sample), the retail chain sample (all year-
2006 non-headquarters workers for identifiable retail chain firms), and the mass layoffs sample (all workers who separated from a firm in a 2008 or 2009 mass
layoff). All samples are restricted to American citizens aged 30-49 on January 1, 2007, who had not died by December 31, 2015 and who had a continental United
States ZIP code in January 2007. Earnings is the sum of W-2 wage earnings and 1099-MISC independent contractor earnings in the calendar year, in 2015 dollars
and top-coded at $500,000. Employed is an indicator for having positive earnings. UI receipt sometime 2007-2014 is an indicator for having positive 1099-G
unemployment insurance benefit income at some point 2007-2014. DI receipt is an indicator for having positive 1099-SSA disability insurance income in the
calendar year. Age is measured on January 1, 2007. Labor force attachment is high if the individual had in every year 2003-2006 earnings above 1600 hours times
the federal minimum wage, is zero if the individual was nonemployed in any year 2003-2006, and low otherwise. Married is an indicator for filing a married-filing-
jointly or married-filing-separately 1040 for tax year 2006. Number of kids is the number of current dependent kids currently living with the individual as listed on the
filed 1040. 1040 filer is an indicator for having appeared as a primary or secondary filer on a 1040 for tax year 2006. Displayed marriage and number of kids
statistics are restricted to 1040 filers; in regressions controlling for marriage or number of kids fixed effects, non-1040-filers are included as a separate group.
Mortgage holder is an indicator for having positive mortgage payment listed on a 1098 in 2006 (mortgages held only in the name of a worker's spouse or other third
party are not included here). Industry categories are based on the North American Industrial Classification System code on the business income tax return matched
to the individual's highest-paying 2006 W-2. Nearly half of W-2 earners could not be matched and individuals who had only 1099-MISC independent contractor
earnings are not matched; in fixed effect regressions, unmatched 2006 W-2 earners, contractors, and the nonemployed are assigned to three separate industries.
2007 CZ derives from the individual's January 2007 residential ZIP code as reflected most commonly on her 2006 information returns. Great Recession local shock
equals the 2009 unemployment rate in the individual's 2007 CZ minus the 2007 unemployment rate in that CZ as reported in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Local
Area Unemployment Statistics.

Notes – All columns except column 5 report coefficient estimates of the effect of Great Recession local shocks on post-recession outcomes in the main sample. Column 5 divides
indviduals into quintiles based on their Great Recession local shocks and reports coefficients on indicators of shock quintiles, relative to the least shocked quintile. Age fixed effects
are birth year indicators. Earnings fixed effects are indicators for sixteen bins in the individual's 2006 earnings. Industry fixed effects are indicators for the individual's 2006 four-digit
NAICS industry. Local unemployment persistence equals the 2015 LAUS unemployment rate minus the 2007 LAUS unemployment rate in either the individual's 2007 CZ or the
individual's 2015 CZ. The columns-1-7 outcome is 2015 relative employment: the individual's 2015 employment (indicator for any employment in 2015) minus the individual's mean
1999-2006 employment. The column 8 outcome equals the sum of the individual's 2009-2015 employment minus seven times the individual's mean 1999-2006 employment. The
column 9 outcome equals the individual's 2015 earnings minus the individual's mean 1999-2006 earnings. The column 10 outcome equals the sum of the individual's 2009-2015
earnings minus seven times the individual's mean 1999-2006 earnings. Column 11 controls for the 2000 manufacturing share of employment in the individual's 2007 CZ, computed in
County Business Patterns. Columns 11 and 12 control for indicators (not shown) and interactions of a rust-CZ indicator and an other-CZ indicator, based on the individual's 2007 CZ.
A rust CZ is a CZ with an above-median manufacturing share; an other CZ is a CZ with a below-median manufacturing share and an above median 2006-2009 change in housing net
worth from Mian and Sufi (2014). The absolute outcome mean equals the outcome mean before subtracting the pre-recession mean. Standard errors are clustered by 2007 state. For
reference, column 4 (the paper's main specification) indicates that a 1-percentage-point higher Great Recession local shock caused individuals to be 0.393 percentage points less
likely to be employed in 2015.

Notes – This table adds controls, sample restrictions, or instruments to the specification underlying Table 2 column 4, reprinted here in column 1. Column 2 controls for the individual's gender. Column 3 controls for the individual's 2006
number of kids (fixed effets for 0, 1, or 2+ kids). Column 4 controls for the individual's 2006 marital status. Column 5 controls for individual's 2006 home ownership status. Colums 6-10 control for CZ-level characteristics. Column 6 controls
for the individual's 2007 CZ's size, equal to the CZ's total employment in 2006 as reported in Census's County Business Patterns (CBP). Column 7 controls for the individual's 2007 CZ's size growth, equal to the CZ's log change in CBP
employment from 2000 to 2006. Column 8 controls for the individual's 2007 CZ's share of workers who work outside of the CZ, computed from the 2006-2010 American Community Surveys. Column 9 controls for the individual's 2007
state's maximum unemployment insurance duration over years 2007-2015. Column 10 controls for the individual’s 2007 state’s 2015 minimum wage minus that state’s 2007 minimum wage. Column 11 excludes 2006 W-2 earners without
an industry code and 2006 contractors and thus restricts the sample to those for whom 2006 industry is correctly measured: 2006 W-2 earners with a valid industry code and the 2006 nonemployed. Column 12 further excludes individuals
employed in construction or manufacturing in 2006. Column 13 instruments the individual's Great Recession local shock using the mean of the Great Recession local shock in the individual's birth state. Standard errors are clustered by
2007 state.

Notes – This table expands on the specifications of Table 2 column 4 and column 9, whose results are reprinted here in the bottom rows of columns 1 and 5. Each cell
reports the coefficient on the Great Recession local shock variable from a separate regression in which the outcome uses the post-recession year indicated in the row,
instead of exclusively using 2015 as in Table 2. Every regression uses the same 1,357,974 observations underlying Table 2. The column 1 outcome of relative employment is
defined in Table 2, varying the post-recession year between 2007 and 2015. The column 2 outcome is an indicator for out-migration, equal to the individual's year-t CZ being
different from her 2007 CZ. Columns 3 and 4 separate the column 1 outcome for year t into two outcomes: employment in year t in the individual's 2007 CZ and employment
in year t outside the individual's 2007 CZ, each minus mean 1999-2006 employment. The column 5 outcome is defined in Table 2. Columns 7 and 8 separate the column 5
outcome analogously to columns 3-4. The column 8 outcome is the individual's unemployment insurance benefits in year t . The column 9 outcome is the individual's Social
Security Disability Insurance benefits in year t . Standard errors are clustered by 2007 state. See Online Appendix Table 2 for pre-trends.

Notes – The table reports estimates of the specification in Table 11 column 4 with alternative outcomes, samples, and/or controls. Column 1 replicates the
main specification using the outcome of an indicator for 2015 receipt of Social Security Disability Insurance. Column 2 replicates the main specification using
the outcome of an indicator for 2015 employment or 2015 SSDI receipt, minus the individual's mean employment 1999-2006. Column 3 replicates the main
specification and columns 4-5 replicate Table 13 columns 11-12 in the mass layoffs sample. Column 6 replicates the main specification using the outcome of
an indicator for unemployment insurance (UI) benefit receipt at some point 2007-2014. Column 7 replicates column 2 but uses UI receipt 2007-2014 in place
of 2015 SSDI receipt. Column 8 replicates the main specification, controlling for UI receipt sometime 2007-2014. Column 9 replicates the main specification
using the outcome of an indicator for having any year of nonemployment 2007-2014, minus an indicator for having any year of nonemployment 1999-2006.
Column 10 replicates the main specification while controlling for indicators of employment in each year 2007-2012. Column 11 replicates the main
specification using the outcome of an indicator for employment in any year 2013-2015, minus the individual's mean employment 1999-2006. Standard errors
are clustered by 2007 state.

Online Appendix A: Age-Adjusted U.S. Labor Force
Statistics
Online Appendix Figure A.1 uses monthly Current Population Surveys (CPS) to plot un-
adjusted and non-parametrically age-adjusted annual U.S. employment rates (employment-
population ratios), labor force participation rates, and unemployment rates 2007-2015. The
figure’s unadjusted statistics are essentially equal to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics
U.S. labor force statistics. They are constructed as follows using the civilian non-institutional
population, first for the age-16+ population and then separately for the age-25-54 population.
For each age-year and top-coding age at 79, I compute the population-weighted mean across
CPS months of total unemployed, labor force, and population counts. Then to construct the
unadjusted year-t data points, I sum year-t’s unemployed, labor force, and population counts
across ages and use those totals to compute the plotted rates. To construct each age-adjusted
year-t data point, I first reweight year-t’s age-specific counts by the age’s 2007 population share
as in DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996):
                                                       P

                                              a Pa2007   Pat

where a denotes age, X denotes an unemployed, labor     P
                                                             force, or population (P ) count, and X̂at
                                               Pa2007    a Pat
denotes a reweighted count. The weight       P                 ranges empirically from 0.63 to 1.25,
                                               a Pa2007  Pat
depending on whether the age’s population share rose or fell between 2007 and t. I then sum
the reweighted unemployed, labor force, and population counts across ages and use those totals
to compute the plotted age-adjusted rates.
    The results displayed in Online Appendix Figure A.1 reveal that the demographic compo-
sitional change of population aging explains a minority (1.6 percentage points) of the overall
employment rate decline (3.6 percentage points) 2007-2015. The figure also shows that popu-
lation aging explains essentially none (0.1 percentage points) of the age-25-54 employment rate
decline (2.6 percentage points).
    These results closely match the results of Shimer (2014). Shimer analyzes data through 2014
and finds, like I do, that aging through 2014 explains a minority of the age-16+ employment
rate decline and essentially none of the age-25-54 decline. He also finds that adding other
demographic controls actually deepens the employment rate decline. Eppsteiner, Furman and
Powell (2017) similarly find that either just under or just over half of the 2007-2015 age-16+
employment rate decline is explained by aging, depending on the measurement point in 2015.
    To further discuss related literature, the recent and transparent contribution of Krueger
(2017) illuminates the uncertainty in projecting pre-recession trends rather than just control-
ling for demographic compositional changes like population aging. He finds that if one projects
the downward trends in labor force participation during the 1997-2006 period forward to 2017,
one can explain the entire decline in labor force participation through 2017 (though 2015 partici-
pation was still unusually low). However, 1997 was the peak in the U.S. labor force participation
rate, so 1997-2006 participation trends were negative. Krueger reports that if one instead uses
the 1992 -2006 period to estimate pre-recession trends, those trends are mostly flat. Thus the
explanatory power of pre-recession trends depends substantially on the choice of the trend
estimation period.


                                                 58
    In a simultaneous equation system with many variables, Aaronson, Cajner, Fallick, Galbis-
Reig, Smith and Wascher (2014) find, like Krueger’s 1997-2006-based projection, that most
of the age-adjusted labor force participation rate decline can be explained by projecting pre-
recession trends. However, Hall (2014) suggests that the ACFGSW specification is likely to
be sensitive to reasonable amendments, and at least two projections have proven too aggres-
sive. The earlier similar analysis of Aaronson, Fallick, Figura, Pingle and Wascher (2006)
projected such a large labor force participation rate decline that the actual U.S. participation
rate exceeded their projection after 2014 (ACFGSW Figure 1). Similarly, ACFGSW projected
continued and substantial age-16+ labor force participation declines after the second quarter
of 2014 (their Table 6) while the actual age-16+ participation rate remained constant between
then and the time of this writing (the second quarter of 2017).
    All told, this appendix’s analysis finds that the demographic compositional change of popu-
lation aging explains a minority of the overall employment rate decline 2007-2015 and essentially
none of the age-25-54 decline. A review of other work suggests that the explanatory power and
accuracy of pre-recession trends depend substantially on the trend estimation specification.
This paper’s main finding supports the view that 2015 employment rates would have been
higher in lieu of the Great Recession.


Online Appendix B: State-Level Shocks
This online appendix extensively details the autoregressive system of Blanchard and Katz (1992,
BK) used to define state-level Great Recession shocks in Section 2 and elaborates on Figure 2’s
historical comparisons of state-level shock adjustment. The online replication kit contains data
and code that generate the results.
     Section 2 estimates state-level adjustment using the updated data used in BK: the annual
Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) series of employment, population, unemploy-
ment, and labor force participation counts 1976-2015 for 51 states (the 50 states plus the
District of Columbia) produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).38 Variable defini-
tions are standard and pertain to the age-16-and-over civilian noninstitutional population.39
BLS compiles LAUS counts from the Current Population Survey (CPS), Current Employment
Statistics (CES) survey, and state administrative unemployment insurance counts—blended to
filter maximal signal from noise using empirical Bayes techniques.40 Online Appendix Table 3
displays summary statistics.
     I employ BK’s canonical empirical model of state labor market outcomes to compute Great
  38
      LAUS are the official data used to allocate federal transfers across states. The series is limited historically
by the lack of Current Population Survey participation statistics for most states prior to 1976.
   39
      Age is defined at the time of survey; LAUS figures effectively evenly weight underlying monthly surveys. See
http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm for full definitions of labor force status. Employment is roughly defined as
working for pay or being temporarily absent from regular work at any point in the reference week. Unemployment
is roughly defined as having had no employment in the reference week but being available for work and having
looked for work in the preceding month. Labor force equals employment plus unemployment.
   40
      Since LAUS had not yet been produced, BK effectively constructed their own version of LAUS 1976-
1990 using the Geographic Profile of Employment (comprising CPS unemployment and population counts),
employment counts from the CES (comprising formal employment counts), and an ad-hoc CPS-based imputation
for self-employment (population was implied). LAUS-based results on the original BK time series are essentially
identical to BK’s published results.

Recession employment shocks for each state. BK imagine a simple spatial equilibrium in which
U.S. states experience one-time random-walk shocks to global demand for their locally produced
and freely traded goods. Those shocks induce endogenous migration responses of workers and
firms via transitory wage changes until state employment rates return to their steady states.
BK aimed to estimate the nature and speed of those responses: do workers move out or do
jobs move in, and over what horizon? To guide their implementation, BK observe empirically
that states differ in long-run employment and population growth rates (e.g. perhaps partly due
to steady improvements in air conditioning that made the Sun Belt steadily more attractive)
and in long-run unemployment rates and participation rates (e.g. due to industrial mix and
retiree population differences) relative to the national aggregate. Thus an attractive model
of the evolution of state labor market outcomes may feature stationary employment growth,
a stationary unemployment rate, and a stationary participation rate (and thus a stationary
employment rate) for each state relative to the corresponding national aggregates.
    BK implement such a model. They characterize state adjustment to idiosyncratic state-level
labor demand shocks by estimating the following log-linear autoregressive system in relative
state employment growth, unemployment rates, and participation rates:

        ∆g
         ln E st = αs10 + α11 (2) ∆g
                                   ln E s,t−1 + α12 (2) lng                    L/P s,t−1 + εE
                                                          E/Ls,t−1 + α13 (2) lng            st
                                                                                       E/L
       lng
         E/Lst = αs20 + α21 (2) ∆g
                                 ln E st + α22 (2) lng
                                                     E/Ls,t−1 + α23 (2) lng
                                                                          L/P s,t−1 + εst
                                                                                        L/P
       lng
         L/P st = αs30 + α31 (2) ∆g
                                  ln E st + α32 (2) lng
                                                      E/Ls,t−1 + α33 (2) lng
                                                                           L/P s,t−1 + εst

where E, L, and P denote levels of employment, the labor force, and population in state s in
year t; where ∆ denotes a first difference (year t’s value minus year t−1’s value); where e denotes
a difference relative to the year’s national aggregate value; and where (2) denotes a vector of
two lags. Thus the first dependent variable (“relative state employment”) is the first difference
of log state employment minus the first difference of log aggregate employment. The second
(“relative state unemployment”) is the log of one minus the state unemployment rate minus the
log of one minus the aggregate unemployment rate. The third (“relative state participation”)
is the log of the state participation rate minus the log of the aggregate participation rate.
Relative state population is the implied residual. Each equation includes a state fixed effect.
I follow BK in weighting states equally rather than by population. Under these assumptions,
the autoregressive coefficients characterize the speed of the average state’s convergence to its
steady state following an unforecasted change in state labor demand: coefficients close to one
imply slow convergence while coefficients close to zero imply fast convergence.41
  41
    The BK system embodies four substantive assumptions. First, unforecasted changes in relative state em-
ployment growth εE st affect contemporaneous relative employment growth, relative unemployment, and relative
participation, but unforecasted changes in relative state unemployment and participation do not effect con-
temporaneous values of the other outcomes. This feature allows the system to be estimated independently via
ordinary least squares. It reflects the assumption that εE   st primarily reflects changes in labor demand rather
than supply—supported in the data by negative values of εE      st typically being followed by state wage declines
rather than increases. Second, each state-year outcome is differenced by the year’s aggregate value, so the
behavior of the system is assumed to be independent of aggregate levels. Third, serial correlation is assumed
to be affine in two lags, which limits the estimation sample to years 1978 and beyond (three and four lags
deliver similar results). Fourth, outcomes are assumed to be stationary, i.e. to converge in the long run to
time-invariant state-specific steady-state values relative to national aggregates. State fixed effects are motivated
by cross-decadal persistence in the outcomes. Formal stationarity tests are underpowered and inconclusive in


                                                        60
    For each state, I estimate a 2008 and a 2009 employment growth forecast error within the
BK system and refer to their sum as its Great Recession employment shock. Specifically, I
first estimate the BK system coefficients using sample years 1978-2007 (i.e. using years 1976-
2007 with two lags). I then compute each state’s 2008 employment shock εE                  s,2008 , equal to the
                                                                                           d
state’s actual relative employment growth ∆g           ln E s,2008 minus the relative employment growth
predicted by the state’s actual data through 2007 and the estimated coefficients. For example,
a state that experienced 2008 relative employment growth equal to the system forecast based
on its history through 2007 would have a 2008 shock equal to zero. I similarly compute each
state’s 2009 employment shock εE        s,2009 , equal to the state’s actual relative employment growth
                                        d
∆g ln E s,2009 minus the relative employment growth predicted by the state’s actual data through
2008 and the estimated coefficients. I refer to each state’s vector {εE        d Ed
                                                                               s,2008 , εs,2009 } as the state’s
Great Recession employment shocks and to the sum of the vector’s elements as the state’s Great
Recession employment shock.
    To understand these shocks empirically, Online Appendix Table 4 lists each state’s Great
Recession employment shock. The standard deviation of state-level shocks over the Great
Recession (2.74) was similar to the standard deviation of state-level shocks over the early-1980s
(1980-1982) recession (2.73) computed similarly (detailed below).42 Recall that shocks are
effectively defined as 2007-2009 employment level changes relative to the state’s own trend and
the national aggregate. Thus a state can have a negative Great Recession employment shock
either because its employment growth relative to the aggregate became moderately negative
after a history of fast growth (e.g. Arizona) or because employment growth became very
negative after a history of slow growth (e.g. Michigan). Furthermore, just over half of states
naturally experienced a positive Great Recession shock, since shocks are measured relative
to the aggregate. The table displays patterns familiar from popular news accounts and earlier
economics work: Sun Belt states like Arizona, California, and Florida as well as Rust Belt states
like Michigan and Indiana experienced severe Great Recession shocks relative to other states.
As two focal examples, Arizona’s shock equals −2.24% while Texas’s shock equals +1.30%.
    Online Appendix Figures A.4A-B plot actual mean responses (solid lines) of state labor
market outcomes to 2007-2009 shocks versus mean historical benchmark responses (dotted
lines) to a −1% shock, following BK’s exposition. Forty-one percent of the average state’s
2007-2009 shock arrived in 2008 while 59% arrived in 2009. To generate historical bench-
mark predicted responses 2008-2015, I therefore feed the BK system the employment resid-
ual vector {εE  d Ed
                s,2008 , εs,2009 } = {−.41, −.59} and—for maximum comparability to BK’s original
benchmarks—use coefficients estimated on the original sample years 1978-1990; panel C plots
updated benchmarks.43 Note that by construction in the BK system, the predicted mean
response to a −1% shock is the negative of the predicted mean response to a +1% shock.44
short time series (BK). Stationarity here is best motivated by spatial arbitrage priors, no rise in the standard
deviation of outcomes before 2007, and employment rate stationarity after previous recessions (Figure 2A).
   42
      The standard deviation of shocks is smaller outside aggregate recession years.
   43
      Strictly speaking, I feed the system the vector {−.41, −.59} shrunk multiplicatively by a constant such that
the 2007-2009 change in relative employment is −1% after system feedback effects.
   44
      Online Appendix Figures A.4A-B correspond closely to BK’s Figure 7, with year 2009 corresponding to year
negative one in BK’s Figure 7. The graphs differ in that the −1% shock in Online Appendix Figures A.4A-B
is spread out over two years instead of one and in that Online Appendix Figures A.4A-B use the official LAUS
series that was released after BK.



                                                       61
    Panel A’s benchmark predictions depict BK’s core lesson: in response to a −1% change
in a state’s employment relative to the state’s trend and the national aggregate, the 1978-
1990 experience predicts that the state’s population would rapidly fall by 1% relative to the
state’s trend and the national aggregate—such that the state’s employment rate returns to its
steady-state level relative to the aggregate in five years. Colloquially, residents move out and
others stop moving in, rather than jobs moving in or residents remaining nonemployed—and
the adjustment completes quickly. Economically, the adjustment process has been understood
to embody a simple mechanism: a state (e.g. Michigan) experiences a one-time random-walk
contraction in global consumer demand for its locally produced traded good (e.g. cars), which
induces a local labor demand contraction and wage decline, which in turn induces a local labor
supply (population) contraction, which then restores the original local wage and employment
rate.
    The mean actual response series equals the estimated mean responses of outcomes across
states within each year. To construct the series, I first compute forecast errors for each year
2008-2015 and for each system outcome, using actual data through 2007 and the coefficients
from the 1978-2007-estimated system.45 Denote these forecast errors for each variable-state-
        E    E/L L/P
year {ηst , ηst , ηst }. I then regress these forecast errors on 2007-2009 shocks in year-by-year
regressions:46
                                      E      d E         d E
                                     ηst = εE            E
                                            s,2008 δt + εs,2009 ζt , ∀t
                                    E/L      d E/L + εEd ζ E/L , ∀t
                                  ηst = εE  s,2008 δt       s,2009 t
                                    L/P             L/P             L/P
                                  ηst    = εEd δ
                                            s,2008 t    + εEd ζ
                                                            s,2009 t    , ∀t

This specification is flexible in that it allows for the 2008 and 2009 employment shocks to have
arbitrary additive effects on each subsequent year’s outcomes. The δ and ζ coefficients are mean
actual responses of each outcome in each year to 2007-2009 shocks. I multiply these coefficients
by the −1% 2007-2009 shock {εE     d Ed
                                   s,2008 , εs,2009 } = {−.41, −.59} to obtain the plotted mean actual
response series.
    Panel A shows that on a slight lag, mean actual relative population responded identically
to Great Recession shocks as in the historical benchmark—falling by 1% between 2007 and
2014, matching the initial 1% employment decline. However, actual relative employment kept
declining such that employment rates remained diverged across space at nearly their 2009 levels:
for every −1% decline in relative state employment 2007-2009, the relative state employment
rate was 0.45 percentage points lower in 2015 than it was in 2007. This 0.45 percentage-point
employment rate deficit is similar to the 0.48 percentage-point deficit that prevailed in 2009.
Hence, employment rates had far from converged across space by 2015, contrary to history-
based predictions. Panel B separates the employment rate response into the unemployment
rate response and the labor force participation rate response. The graph shows that actual
relative unemployment rates converged across space as in the historical benchmark, while actual
participation rates remained diverged in a stark departure from the historical benchmark.
    Online Appendix Figure A.4C shows that updating the historical benchmark to more recent
  45
     That is, I compute 2008-2015 baseline predictions for how each state’s outcomes would have evolved in
the absence of 2007-2009 shocks based on data through 2007 and the estimated coefficients, and then subtract
predictions those 2008-2015 baseline predictions from actual 2008-2015 values.
  46
     For 2008, only the 2008 employment shock is included as a regressor.


                                                       62
data does not alter the conclusion that post-2007 employment rate convergence was unusually
slow and incomplete. The figure plots the estimated response of the average state’s employment
rate to a −1% employment shock, based on estimating the BK system on three different LAUS
sample ranges: 1978-1990 (the original BK time range, reprinted from panels A-B), 1991-
2007, and 1978-2015.47 Both the 1978-1990- and 1991-2007-based predictions exhibit five-
year convergence of the state’s employment rate to its steady-state level relative to the the
aggregate. The 1978-2015-based prediction exhibits substantially slower convergence but still
exhibits majority employment rate convergence 2009-2015, in contrast to reality.48 Hence, the
2007-2015 employment rate divergence is exceptional even relative to fully-updated convergence
predictions.
    Finally, Figure 2A (documented in the main text) shows that the slow convergence after
Great Recession shocks was unusual not merely relative to average historical responses but also
relative to the aftermath of the two previous recessions for which a long post-recession time
series is available.49 Online Appendix Figure A.5 repeats Figure 2A for the labor force participa-
tion rate, unemployment rate, employment growth, and population growth. The participation
and unemployment graphs are constructed exactly as the employment rate graph in Figure
2A. To create the employment growth graph, I first compute each state’s steady state value
for relative employment growth by using the 1978-2007-estimated BK coefficients and solving
the BK system assuming all variables are constant. Then, for each state-year around each re-
cession, I compute actual relative employment growth minus steady state relative employment
growth, cumulate this value beginning in year −5 (year −3 for the early-1980s recession, the
first year available), and proceed to construct the graph exactly as done for employment rates.
The population employment graph is constructed similarly. The graphs show that the unem-
ployment rate and population growth adjustments to Great Recession employment shocks were
broadly similar to those after previous recessions’ shocks. However, the participation rate and
employment growth in severely shocked states exhibited no recovery from 2009 levels relative
to mildly shocked states, in stark contrast to the aftermath of the early-1980s and early-1990s
recessions.


Online Appendix C: Cross-State Employment Gap
This online appendix documents the computation of the 2.01 million cross-state employment
gap statistic reported in Section 2. The employment gap is defined as total 2015 employment
in severely shocked states minus total 2015 employment in mildly shocked states—minus the
difference that would have prevailed if the pre-recession severe-mild employment rate difference
had prevailed in 2015 at 2015 state populations. 2.01 ≈ .01635/2 × 250.5 = 2.05, where 1.635
percentage points is the population-weighted equivalent to the 1.736-percentage-point severe-
mild 2015 employment rate deficit plotted in Figure 1B and where 250.5 million was 2015
total population. This formula is not exact because population was not exactly evenly divided
  47
     See Beyer and Smets (2014) for an earlier re-estimation of the BK system augmented with multi-level factor
modeling to compare U.S. and Europe population responses. See Dao, Furceri and Loungani (2017) for an earlier
re-estimation augmented with instruments to find stronger population responses during aggregate recessions.
  48
     Slower convergence likely derives from unique divergence after 2007 as well as from alleviated small-sample
stationarity bias in a larger sample (e.g. Hurwicz 1950).
  49
     The post-2001-recession experience exhibited incomplete convergence before being interrupted by positively
correlated 2007-2009 shocks.

                                                      63
between the two state groups, since the unweighted shock median was used to define the groups.
For reference, the exact 2.01 figure is computed as follows.
    On average 2002-2007, the population-weighted employment rate in severely shocked states
minus that in mildly shocked states equaled −0.885 percentage points. In 2015, severely
shocked states had an adult civilian noninstitutional population of 142.0 million with a 58.25%
population-weighted employment rate while mildly shocked states had an adult civilian non-
institutional population of 108.5 million with a 60.77% population-weighted employment rate
(note that 58.25 − 60.77 + 0.885 = −1.635). Then the full-convergence employment rate in
severely shocked states (e∗S ) and in mildly shocked states (e∗M ) solve:

                                    e∗S − e∗M = −.00885
                   142.0 × e∗S + 108.5 × e∗M = 142.0 × .5825 + 108.5 × .6077

where the first equation imposes full employment rate convergence between severely shocked
and mildly shocked states to the pre-2007 difference and the second equation imposes equal-
ity between the full-convergence aggregate employment level (and rate) and the actual 2015
aggregate employment level (and rate).
    The solution is e∗S = 58.96% and e∗M = 59.84%. This implies that 1.005 (= 141.99 ×
(.58959 − .58251)) million fewer residents of severely shocked states in 2015 were employed than
there would have been had state employment rates returned to their pre-2007 differences at
actual 2015 populations and the actual 2015 aggregate employment rate. Likewise, 1.006 (=
108.52×(.60771−.59844)) million more residents of mildly shocked states in 2015 were employed
than there would have been had state employment rates returned to their pre-2007 differences
around the actual 2015 aggregate employment rate. Hence relative to the counterfactual of full
convergence of state employment rates to their pre-2007 differences at actual 2015 populations,
a 2.01-million-person employment gap between severely shocked and mildly shocked states
remained in 2015.


Online Appendix D: Empirical Design in Potential Out-
comes
This online appendix details a binary version of the paper’s empirical design in potential out-
comes. Consider identical local areas c that experienced in 2007-2009 a binary Great Reces-
sion local shock—severe or mild—and no other 2007-2009 shocks. Denote these areas severely
shocked or mildly shocked. SEV EREc(i2007) ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether an individual i lived
in 2007 in a severely shocked area. EM P LOY EDi2015 (1) ∈ {0, 1} indicates i’s potential 2015
employment if her 2007 local area was severely shocked, and EM P LOY EDi2015 (0) ∈ {0, 1}
indicates i’s potential 2015 employment if her 2007 local area was mildly shocked. To align
notation simply with the text’s main outcome, assume that all individuals were employed in
every year 1999-2006.
    Define the causal effect βi of i’s 2007 CZ’s Great Recession local shock on i’s 2015 employ-
ment as the difference in the worker’s potential employment: βi ≡ EM P LOY EDi2015 (1) −
EM P LOY EDi2015 (0). Note that βi could be zero for some skill types and negative for oth-
ers, for example if only construction or routine workers are affected by a severe local shock
(Jaimovich and Siu 2013, Hershbein and Kahn 2016). But βi excludes all nationwide changes

                                              64
that do not vary with local shock severity. The mean E[βi ] ≡ β in a relevant sample of workers
is my causal effect of interest, which I refer to as the causal effect of Great Recession local
shocks.
    If workers were randomly assigned in 2007 across local areas, then one could consistently
estimate β as the unconditional observed employment rate difference in longitudinal data
as: E[EM P LOY EDi2015 |SEV EREc(i2007) = 1] − E[EM P LOY EDi2015 |SEV EREc(i2007) = 0].
Lacking random assignment, I assume empirically that workers were as good as randomly as-
signed conditional on a rich observed vector of pre-2007 characteristics Xi2006 :
                                                    
        EM P LOY EDi2015 (0), EM P LOY EDi2015 (1) ⊥ SEV EREc(i2007) | Xi2007c(i2007)

Then β can be consistently estimated as the conditional observed employment rate difference
in longitudinal data:

                  E[EM P LOY EDi2015 |SEV EREc(i2007) = 1, Xi2007c(i2007) ] −
                  E[EM P LOY EDi2015 |SEV EREc(i2007) = 0, Xi2007c(i2007) ] −
                      = E[EM P LOY EDi2015 (1) − EM P LOY EDi2015 (0)].

    Two appendix graphs help to justify the interpretation of β presented in Section 3.1. My
interpretation of β is sensible because severely shocked and mildly shocked areas exhibited rela-
tively similar pre-recession trends in the outcomes of interest (shown in Section 4.1) and because
post-2010 unemployment rates converged monotonically across severely shocked and mildly
shocked areas (Figure 2A and Online Appendix Figure A.2A). Moreover, adverse 2010-2015
industry-based shift-share shocks are not positively correlated with adverse Great Recession
local shocks (Online Appendix Figure A.2B).


Online Appendix E: Longitudinal Data
This online appendix provides additional details on the longitudinal linked-employer-employee
data described in Section 3.
    First, the universe of business tax returns used is the universe of C-corporate (Form 1120),
S-corporate (Form 1120S), and partnership (Form 1065) tax returns. Businesses that file other
types of tax returns employ a small share of U.S. workers.
    Second, Form 1099-MISC data on independent contractor employment are missing in 1999.
Results are very similar when omitting 1999 data.
    Third, many retail chain firms are missing from the retail chain sample, both because of
subsidiaries and franchises as described in Section 3 and also because a (likely small) number of
firms outsource their W-2 administration to third-party payroll administration firms that list
their own EINs on W-2s. Nevertheless, the retail chain sample includes very large nationwide
chains.
    Fourth and also specific to the retail chain sample, the filing ZIP code on a firm’s busi-
ness income tax return typically but not always refer to the business’s headquarters ZIP code.
Excluding workers at the business’s headquarters is useful because headquarters workers may
perform systematically different tasks than workers at other establishments and thus may pos-
sess different human capital even conditional on baseline earnings. I therefore conservatively

                                               65
exclude firms’ workers living in the CZ with the largest number of the firm’s workers living
there, as well as the CZ with the largest number of the firm’s workers living there as a share of
the total number of workers living there.
    Fifth and also specific to the retail chain sample, I consider a firm to have operated in a
CZ in 2006 if it employed at least ten stably located workers who lived in the CZ—defined as
individuals of any age and citizenship with a W-2 from the firm in all years 2005-2007 and the
same residential CZ in all years 2005-2007 based on those W-2s’ payee (residential) ZIP codes.
It is necessary to define CZ operations using more than one year of W-2 data because W-2
payee ZIP code refers to the worker’s ZIP code in January of the year after employment. That
feature implies that almost all firms would appear to have operations in every large CZ if one
were to use only 2006 W-2s to identify CZ operations, since many workers move to large cities.
    In Section 3.3, I noted that transition of affected workers to self-employment likely does not
explain the results. An appendix graph helps to justify that conclusion: Current Population
Survey data indicate that changes in state self-employment rates since 2007 were unrelated to
changes in state formal employment rates (Online Appendix Figure A.3).

Notes: This figure uses monthly Current Population Surveys (CPS) to plot unadjusted and non-parametrically
age-adjusted annual U.S. employment rates (employment-population ratios), labor force participation rates,
and unemployment rates 2007-2015 for the civilian non-institutional population. The unadjusted statistics
are essentially equal to the official Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. labor force statistics. The age-adjusted
statistics reweight each age-year’s annual total unemployment, labor force, and population by the age group’s
2007 population share as in DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux (1996) before summing across ages and computing
the displayed rates. See Online Appendix A for details.

Notes: Panel A uses LAUS county-level data, aggregated to the CZ-level, to plot monthly mean unemployment
rates 2007-2015 in severely shocked CZs (those with above median Great Recession local shocks) and mildly
shocked CZs (all other CZs). Data points are weighted by CZ population. The post-2001-recession experience
exhibited incomplete convergence before being interrupted by positively correlated 2007-2009 shocks. Panel
B plots 2010-2015 CZ-level shift-share shocks versus Great Recession local shocks. The shift-share shocks are
constructed analogously to Bartik (1991) using County Business Patterns data as follows. Each CZ’s shift-share
shock equals the projected 2010-2015 percentage change in the CZ’s employment based on leave-one-CZ-out
nationwide changes in employment by three-digit      NAICS industry   P       categories.  P That is,         a CZ c’s shift-share

three-digit industry and Ejct denotes total employment in industry j in CZ c in year t. The graph bins CZs into
ventiles (five-percentile-point bins) by their Great Recession local shock and then plots the 2007-population-
weighted mean of the 2010-2015 shift share shock within each bin. If CZs that were severely shocked during
the Great Recession had subsequently experienced additional adverse shift-share shocks 2010-2015 related to
the CZs’ industrial compositions, Panel B would have exhibited a negative relationship instead of the displayed

Notes: This graph uses the 2007 and 2015 monthly Current Population Surveys to plot 2007-2015 self-
employment rate changes versus 2007-2015 formal employment rate changes for the adult (16+) civilian non-
institutionalized population. The formal employment rate equals the number of formally employed individuals
(workers for wages or salary in private or government sector) divided by the population. The self-employment
rate equals the number of self-employed individuals (including independent contractors) divided by the popu-
lation. Individuals are classified according to the job in which they worked the most hours. Each year’s rate
equals the monthly rate averaged across the year’s twelve months. Overlaid is the unweighted best-fit line.

Notes: The dotted lines of panels A-B plot benchmark history-based predictions for state-level responses to
a −1% 2007-2009 state-level employment shock, based on estimating Blanchard-Katz’s (1992) autoregressive
system of state labor market outcomes using LAUS data on the original sample range 1978-1990. The solid
lines plot mean actual state-level responses based on reduced-form regressions of 2008-2014 state-level outcomes
on 2007-2009 state-level shocks. Panel C plots the mean actual employment rate response series from panels
A-B alongside predicted employment rate series based on three estimation time ranges: 1978-1990 (as in panels
A-B), 1991-2007, and 1978-2014. See Online Appendix B for more details.

Notes: Panels A-B replicate Figure 2A for the labor force participation rate and unemployment rate. Panels
C-D display analogous graphs for employment growth and population growth. These latter panels require that
each state’s estimated steady state annual growth rate is subtracted from its actual annual growth, before
constructing the graphs exactly as in Panels A-B. See Online Appendix B and the notes to Figure 2.

Notes – This table shows that the paper's main estimate of the 2015 employment impact of Great Recession local shocks—which uses the main
sample's non-public individual-level data—can be well-approximated in CZ-level data published alongside this paper. Column 1 reprints the main
specification and estimate from Table 2 column 4. Columns 2-3 report coefficients from univariate CZ-level regressions weighted by the CZ's 2007
population as reported in Census's Annual County Resident Population Estimates of the total adult (16+) population, aggregated to the CZ level. The
column 2 outcome equals the estiamated coefficients on a vector of CZ fixed effects from estimating the main specification with Great Recession local
shock variable replaced by a vector of CZ fixed effects. Online Appendix Table 2 lists these estimated coefficients for the hundred largest CZs. The
column 3 outcome variable equals the CZ's 2015 adult employment rate minus the CZ's mean 1999-2007 employment rate, based on Census data and
Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Statistics data: LAUS county-level 16+ civilian non-institutional employment aggregated to the CZ
level, divided by Census's CZ population estimate. Column 3 is restricted to the CZs available for column 2. Standard errors are clustered in column 1
by the individual's 2007 state and in columns 2-3 by the CZ's state. See the paper's Online Data Codebook and Online Data Tables for additional
details and published variables on the author's website.

Notes - This table lists estimated effects of living in 2007 in each of the hundred largest CZs on 2015 employment, drawn
from the complete data published online. The paper's main specification (Table 2 column 4) regresses 2015 relative
employment (2015 employment minus mean 1999-2006 employment) on Great Recession local shocks and 2006-age-
earnings-industry fixed effects. To generate this table, I repeat the main specification except that I replace the Great
Recession local shock variable with a vector of CZ fixed effects. I then de-mean the 2007-population-weighted fixed
effects and list the fixed effects of the hundred largest CZ's by 2007 population. 2007 population is drawn from Census's
Annual County Resident Population Estimates of the total 16+ population aggregated to the CZ level. See Online Data
Table 1 on the author's website for the full list of CZ-level effects and other CZ-level statistics. Online Appendix Table 1
column 2 shows that the published CZ-level data can be used to approximate the paper's main individual-level regression
result.
