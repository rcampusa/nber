                                         ABSTRACT

To assess age-specific infection fatality rates (IFRs) for COVID-19, we have conducted a
systematic review of seroprevalence studies as well as countries with comprehensive tracing
programs. Age-specific IFRs were computed using the prevalence data in conjunction with
reported fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of each study, reflecting typical lags in
fatalities and reporting. Using metaregression procedures, we find a highly significant log-linear
relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19. The estimated age-specific IFRs are very low
for children and younger adults but increase progressively to 0.4% at age 55, 1.3% at age 65,
4.2% at age 75, and 14% at age 85. About 90% of the geographical variation in population IFR is
explained by differences in age composition of the population and age-specific prevalence. These
results indicate that COVID-19 is hazardous not only for the elderly but also for middle-aged
adults. Moreover, the population IFR for COVID-19 should not be viewed as a fixed parameter
but as intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health
measures to protect vulnerable age groups could substantially decrease total deaths.

Introduction
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in winter 2020, it has been evident that the severity
of the disease varies markedly across infected individuals.[1, 2] Some remain asymptomatic
throughout the course of infection or experience only mild symptoms such as headache or
ageusia, whereas others experience much more severe illness, hospitalization, or even death.
Thus, official case reporting may tend to encompass a high fraction of severe cases but only a
small fraction of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Moreover, the availability of live
virus tests has varied significantly across locations and over time, and the deployment of such
tests may differ markedly across demographic groups.

Consequently, assessments of the case fatality rate (CFR), the ratio of deaths to reported cases,
are fraught with pitfalls in gauging the severity of COVID-19. For example, early case reports
from Wuhan noted a preponderance of older people among hospital admissions and a high CFR.
Subsequent studies have documented that children and young adults tend to exhibit fewer and
milder symptoms and a far lower CFR. Nonetheless, the link between age and severity of
COVID-19 infections has remained unclear for the reasons noted above.

To provide more accurate assessments of the spread of COVID-19, researchers have conducted
seroprevalence studies in numerous locations. Such studies analyze samples of serum to detect
antibodies in those infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Seroprevalence
results can be used to estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR), the ratio of fatalities to total
infections, thereby facilitating the identification of vulnerable segments of the population and
informing key policy decisions aimed at mitigating the consequences of the pandemic.

For example, as shown in Table 1, the New York Department of Health conducted a large-scale
seroprevalence study and estimated about 1·6 million SARS-CoV-2 infections among the 8
million residents of New York City.[3] However, only one-tenth of those infections were
captured in reported COVID-19 cases, about one-fourth of which required hospitalization, and a
substantial fraction of cases had fatal outcomes.[4] All told, COVID-19 fatalities in NYC
represented a tenth of reported cases but only one-hundredth of all SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Nonetheless, divergences in study design and reporting have hampered comparisons of
seroprevalence and IFRs across locations and demographic groups. For example, a number of
studies have analyzed a representative sample of the general population, while other studies have
made use of “convenience samples” of residual sera collected for other purposes (such as
laboratory tests or blood donations). Some studies have simply reported results for raw
prevalence (the fraction of seropositive results), whereas other studies have reported results
adjusted for antibody test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity).

While the NYC data indicate an IFR of about 1%, seroprevalence estimates from other locations
have yielded a wide array of IFR estimates, ranging from about 0·6% in Geneva to levels
exceeding 2% in northern Italy. Such estimates have fueled intense controversy about the
                                                 2


severity of COVID-19 and the appropriate design of public health measures to contain it, which
in turn hinges on whether the hazards of this disease are mostly limited to the elderly and infirm.
Indeed, a recent meta-analysis noted the high degree of heterogeneity across aggregate estimates
of IFR and concluded that research on age-stratified IFR is “urgently needed to inform
policymaking.”[5]

This paper reports on a systematic review and meta-analysis of age-specific IFRs for COVID-19.
We specifically consider the hypothesis that the observed variation in IFR across locations may
primarily reflect the age specificity of COVID-19 infections and fatalities. Based on these
findings, we are able to assess and contextualize the severity of COVID-19 and examine how
age-specific prevalence affects the population IFR and the total incidence of fatalities.

Methodology
To perform the present meta-analysis, we collected published papers and preprints on the
seroprevalence and/or infection fatality rate of COVID-19 that were publicly disseminated prior
to 17 September 2020. As described in Supplementary Appendix B, we systematically performed
online searches in MedRxiv, Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE, and we
identified other studies listed in reports by government institutions such as the U.K. Parliament
Office.[6] Data was extracted from studies by three authors and verified prior to inclusion.

We restricted our meta-analysis to studies of advanced economies, based on current membership
in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), in light of the distinct
challenges of health care provision and reporting of fatalities in developing economies.[7] We
also excluded studies aimed at measuring prevalence in specific groups such as health care
workers.

Our meta-analysis encompasses two distinct approaches for assessing the prevalence of
COVID-19: (1) seroprevalence studies that test for antibodies produced in response to the virus,
and (2) comprehensive tracing programs using extensive live-virus testing of everyone who has
had contact with a potentially infected individual. Seroprevalence estimates are associated with
uncertainty related to the sensitivity and specificity of the test method and the extent to which the
sampling frame provides an accurate representation of prevalence in the general population; see
Supplementary Appendix C. Prevalence measures from comprehensive tracing programs are
associated with uncertainty about the extent of inclusion of infected individuals, especially those
who are asymptomatic.

Sampling frame

To assess prevalence in the general population, a study should be specifically designed to utilize
a random sample using standard survey procedures such as stratification and weighting by
demographic characteristics. Other sampling frames may be useful for specific purposes such as
                                                 3


sentinel surveillance but not well-suited for assessing prevalence due to substantial risk of
systemic bias. Consequently, our meta-analysis excludes the following types of studies:

   •   Blood Donors. Only a small fraction of blood donors are ages 60 and above—a
       fundamental limitation in assessing COVID-19 prevalence and IFRs for older age
       groups—and the social behavior of blood donors may be systematically different from
       their peers.[8, 9] These concerns can be directly investigated by comparing alternative
       seroprevalence surveys of the same geographical location. As of early June, Public
       Health England (PHE) reported seroprevalence of 8·5% based on specimens from blood
       donors, whereas the U.K. Office of National Statistics (ONS) reported markedly lower
       seroprevalence of 5·4% (CI: 4·3–6·5%) based on its monitoring of a representative
       sample of the English population.[10, 11]

   •   Dialysis Centers. Assessing seroprevalence of dialysis patients using residual sera
       collected at dialysis centers is crucial for gauging the infection risks faced by these
       individuals, of which a disproportionately high fraction tend to be underrepresented
       minorities. Nonetheless, the seroprevalence within this group may be markedly different
       from that of the general population. For example, a study of U.K. dialysis patients found
       seroprevalence of about 36%, several times higher than that obtained using a very large
       random sample of the English population.[12, 13] Similarly, a recent U.S. study found a
       seropositive rate of 34% for dialysis patients in New York state that was more than twice
       as high as the seroprevalence in a random sample of New York residents.[3, 14]

   •   Hospitals and Urgent Care Clinics. Estimates of seroprevalence among current medical
       patients are subject to substantial bias, as evident from a pair of studies conducted in
       Tokyo, Japan: One study found 41 positive cases among 1071 urgent care clinic patients,
       whereas the other study found only two confirmed positive results in a random sample of
       nearly 2000 Tokyo residents (seroprevalence estimates of 3·8% vs. 0·1%).[15, 16]

   •   Active Recruitment. Soliciting participants is particularly problematic in contexts of low
       prevalence, because seroprevalence can be markedly affected by a few individuals who
       volunteer due to concerns about prior exposure. For example, a Luxembourg study
       obtained positive antibody results for 35 out of 1,807 participants, but nearly half of those
       individuals (15 of 35) had previously had a positive live virus test, were residing in a
       household with someone who had a confirmed positive test, or had direct contact with
       someone else who had been infected.[17]

Our critical review has also underscored the pitfalls of seroprevalence studies based on
“convenience samples” of residual sera collected for other purposes. For example, two studies
assessed seroprevalence of Utah residents during spring 2020. The first study analyzed residual
sera from two commercial laboratories and obtained a prevalence estimate of 2·2% (CI: 1·2–
3·4%), whereas the second study collected specimens from a representative sample and obtained
                                                 4


a markedly lower prevalence estimate of 0·96% (CI: 0·4–1·8%).[18, 19] In light of these issues,
our meta-analysis includes residual serum studies but we flag such studies as having an elevated
risk of bias.

Comprehensive Tracing Programs

Our meta-analysis incorporates data on COVID-19 prevalence and fatalities in countries that
have consistently maintained comprehensive tracing programs since the early stages of the
pandemic. Such a program was only feasible in places where public health officials could
conduct repeated tests of potentially infected individuals and trace those whom they had direct
contact. We identify such countries using a threshold of 300 for the ratio of cumulative tests to
reported cases as of 30 April 2020, based on comparisons of prevalence estimates and reported
cases in Czech Republic, Korea, and Iceland; see Supplementary Appendices D and E.[20]
Studies of Iceland and Korea found that estimated prevalence was moderately higher than the
number of reported cases, especially for younger age groups; hence we make corresponding
adjustments for other countries with comprehensive tracing programs, and we identify these
estimates as subject to an elevated risk of bias.[21-23]

Measurement of fatalities

Accurately measuring total deaths is a substantial issue in assessing IFR due to time lags from
onset of symptoms to death and from death to official reporting. Symptoms typically develop
within 6 days after exposure but may develop as early as 2 days or as late as 14 days.[1, 24]
More than 95% of symptomatic COVID patients have positive antibody (IgG) titres within 17-19
days of symptom onset, and those antibodies remain elevated over a sustained period.[25-28]
The mean time interval from symptom onset to death is 15 days for ages 18–64 and 12 days for
ages 65+, with interquartile ranges of 9–24 days and 7–19 days, respectively, while the mean
interval from date of death to the reporting of that person’s death is about 7 days with an IQR of
2–19 days; thus, the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval between symptom onset and
reporting of fatalities is about six weeks (41 days).[29]

Figure 1 illustrates these findings in a hypothetical scenario where the pandemic was curtailed
two weeks prior to the date of the seroprevalence study. This figure shows the results of a
simulation calibrated to reflect the estimated distribution for time lags between symptom onset,
death, and inclusion in official fatality reports. The histogram shows the frequency of deaths
and reported fatalities associated with the infections that occurred on the last day prior to full
containment. Consistent with the confidence intervals noted above, 95% of cumulative fatalities
are reported within roughly four weeks of the date of the seroprevalence study.

As shown in Table 2, the precise timing of the count of cumulative fatalities is relatively
innocuous in locations where the outbreak had been contained for more than a month prior to the
date of the seroprevalence study. By contrast, in instances where the outbreak had only recently
                                                 5


been contained, the death count continued rising markedly for several more weeks after the
midpoint of the seroprevalence study.

Therefore, we construct age-specific IFRs using the seroprevalence data in conjunction with
cumulative fatalities four weeks after the midpoint date of each study; see Supplementary
Appendix F. We have also conducted sensitivity analysis using cumulative fatalities five weeks
after the midpoint date, and we flag studies as having an elevated risk of bias if the change in
cumulative fatalities between weeks 4 and 5 exceeds 10%.

By contrast, matching prevalence estimates with subsequent fatalities is not feasible if a
seroprevalence study was conducted in the midst of an accelerating outbreak. Therefore, our
meta-analysis excludes seroprevalence studies for which the change in cumulative fatalities from
week 0 to week 4 exceeds 200%.

Metaregression procedure
To analyze IFR by age, we use meta-regression with random effects, using the meta regress
procedure in Stata v16.[30, 31] We used a random-effects procedures to allow for residual
heterogeneity between studies and across age groups by assuming that these divergences are
drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression and
the trim-and-fill method. See Supplementary Appendix G for further details.
Role of the funding source
No funding was received for conducting this study.

Results
After an initial screening of 1149 studies, we reviewed the full texts of 116 studies, of which
51 studies were excluded due to lack of age-specific data on COVID-19 prevalence or
fatalities.[11, 15, 16, 28, 32-78] Seroprevalence estimates for two locations were excluded
because the outbreak was still accelerating during the period when the specimens were being
collected and from two other locations for which age-specific seroprevalence was not
distinguishable from zero.[18, 79-81] Studies of non-representative samples were excluded as
follows: 13 studies of blood donors; 5 studies of patients of hospitals, outpatient clinics, and
dialysis centers; 4 studies with active recruitment of participants, and 6 narrow sample groups
such as elementary schools.[10, 14, 16, 17, 79, 82-104] Supplementary Appendix H lists all
excluded studies.

Consequently, our meta-analysis encompasses 33 studies, of which 28 are included in our
metaregression and 5 are used for out-of-sample analysis. The metaregression studies can
be categorized into three distinct groups:
                                                  6


   •   Representative samples from studies of England, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
       Spain, Geneva (Switzerland), and four U.S. locations (Atlanta, Indiana, New York,
       and Salt Lake City).[3, 13, 19, 105-113]

   •   Convenience samples from studies of Belgium, France, Sweden, Ontario (Canada),
       and eight U.S. locations (Connecticut, Louisiana, Miami, Minneapolis, Missouri,
       Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Seattle).[18, 114-116]

   •   Comprehensive tracing programs for Australia, Iceland, Korea, Lithuania, and
       New Zealand.[117-121]

The metaregression includes results from the very large REACT-2 seroprevalence study of the
English population.[13] Thus, to avoid pitfalls of nested or overlapping samples, two other
somewhat smaller studies conducted by U.K. Biobank and the U.K. Office of National Statistics
are not included in the metaregression but are instead used in out-of-sample analysis of the
metaregression results.[11, 122] Similarly, the metaregression includes a large representative
sample from Salt Lake City, and hence a smaller convenience sample of Utah residents is
included in the out-of-sample analysis along with two other small-scale studies.[18, 19, 123,
124] Data taken from included studies is shown in Supplementary Appendix I. Supplementary
Appendix J assesses the risk of bias for each individual study. As indicated in Supplementary
Appendix K, no publication bias was found using Egger’s test (p > 0.10), and the trim-and-fill
method produced the same estimate as the metaregression.
We obtain the following metaregression results:
                           𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼) = −7.53     + 0.119 ∗ 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎
                                             (0.18)       (0.003)

where the standard error for each estimated coefficient is given in parentheses. These estimates
are highly significant with t-statistics of -42·9 and 38·5, respectively, and p-values below
0·0001. The residual heterogeneity τ2 = 0·432 (p-value < 0.0001) and I2 = 97·0, confirming that
the random effects are essential for capturing unexplained variations across studies and age
groups. The adjusted R2 is 94·2%.
As noted above, the validity of this metaregression rests on the condition that the data are
consistent with a Gaussian distribution. The validity of that assumption is evident in Figure 3:
Nearly all of the observations fall within the 95% prediction interval of the metaregression, and
the remainder are moderate outliers.
This specification of the metaregression also assumes that the intercept and slope parameters are
stable across the entire age distribution. We have confirmed the validity of that assumption by
estimating alternative specifications in which the parameters are allowed to differ between three
distinct age categories (ages 0–34, 35–59, and 60+ years). The estimated parameters are similar
across all three age categories, and the null hypothesis of parameter constancy is consistent with
the metaregression data (see Supplementary Appendix L).
                                                 7


Figure 4 depicts the exponential relationship between age and the level of IFR in percent, and
Figure 5 shows the corresponding forest plot. Evidently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a
substantial mortality risk for middle-aged adults and even higher risks for elderly people: The
IFR is very low for children and young adults but rises to 0·4% at age 55, 1·3% at age 65,
4·2% at age 75, 14% at age 85, and exceeds 25% for ages 90 and above. These metaregression
predictions are well aligned with the out-of-sample IFRs; see Supplementary Appendix M.
As shown in Figure 6, the metaregression explains nearly 90% of the geographical variation in
population IFR, which ranges from about 0·5% in Salt Lake City and Geneva to 1·5% in
Australia and England and 2·7% in Italy. The metaregression explains this variation in terms of
differences in the age structure of the population and age-specific prevalence of COVID-19.


Discussion
The IFR is central to our understanding of the public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
and the appropriate policies for mitigating those consequences. In the absence of effective
therapies or vaccines, such policies will primarily involve non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs). NPIs may include relatively mild measures (such as prohibitions on large gatherings) or
more draconian restrictions such as shelter-in-place edicts, popularly known as “lockdowns.”

Unfortunately, public debate on these issues has been hampered by diverging assessments of the
severity of COVID-19. For example, some early seroprevalence studies (using relatively small
and non-representative samples, often in areas of low prevalence) yielded miniscule estimates of
population IFR similar to those of seasonal influenza. Such estimates implied that strict NPIs
would be completely irrational given the limited benefits and severe economic and social costs.
With the dissemination of many more seroprevalence studies over recent months, a wide array of
hypotheses have been mooted to explain the diverging implications for IFR, including regional
variations in the quality of treatment or the extent of T-cell immunity to other betacoronaviruses.

By contrast, our critical review identifies the key characteristics of seroprevalence studies that
can be used to provide reliable assessments of IFR. Indeed, once we focus on this group of
studies (which includes nine national seroprevalence studies), our metaregression reveals a
remarkably high degree of consistency in the implications for age-specific IFR. Moreover, our
results indicate that most of the variation in population IFR across locations reflects differences
in the extent to which vulnerable age groups were exposed to the virus.

One key implication of our findings is that the incidence of fatalities from a COVID-19 outbreak
depends crucially on the age groups that are infected, which in turn reflects the age structure of
that population and the extent to which public health measures limit the incidence of infections
among vulnerable age groups. Indeed, even if an outbreak is mainly concentrated among
younger people, it may be very difficult to prevent the virus from spreading among older adults.
                                                 8


To illustrate the benefits of age-stratified public health strategies for COVID-19, we have
constructed a set of three scenarios for the U.S. trajectory of infections and fatalities (see
Supplementary Appendix N). Each scenario assumes that U.S. prevalence rises to a plateau of
around 20% but with different patterns of age-specific prevalence. In particular, if prevalence
becomes uniform across age groups, this analysis projects that total U.S. fatalities would exceed
500 thousand and that population IFR would converge to around 0·8%. By contrast, a scenario
with relatively low incidence of new infections among vulnerable age groups would be
associated with less than half as many deaths and a much lower population IFR of about 0·3%.

A further implication of our results is that the risks of infection to the middle aged cannot be
neglected. This is important for pandemic management strategies that aim to avoid large influxes
of patients to healthcare. Indeed, it is likely that an unmitigated outbreak among adults over 35
years old could have severe consequences on the healthcare system. Table 3 contextualizes this
issue by comparing the age-specific IFRs from our meta-regression analysis to the annualized
risks of fatal automobile accidents or other unintentional injuries in England and in the United
States.[125, 126] For example, an English person aged 55–64 years who gets infected with
SARS-CoV-2 faces a fatality risk that is more than 200 times higher than the annual risk of
dying in a fatal car accident. These results also confirm that COVID-19 is far more deadly than
seasonal flu, for which the population IFR is about 0·05% (see Supplementary Appendix O).
Moreover, seasonal influenza outbreaks are limited by prior immunity, whereas that is not the
case for SARS-CoV-2.

Our critical review highlights the benefits of assessing prevalence using large-scale studies of
representative samples of the general population rather than convenience samples of blood
donors or medical patients. Conducting such studies on an ongoing basis will enable public
health officials to monitor changes in prevalence among vulnerable age groups and gauge the
efficacy of public policy measures. Moreover, such studies enable researchers to assess the
extent to which antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may gradually diminish over time as well as the
extent to which advances in treatment facilitate the reduction of age-specific IFRs.

Our critical review also underscores the importance of methodological issues in assessing IFR.
For example, the raw prevalence results reported by a national study of Italy would imply a
population IFR of about 2·3%, whereas test-adjusted prevalence implies a substantially higher
IFR of 2·7%. Likewise, a few recent studies have excluded all deaths occurring in nursing homes
and retirement communities and have obtained estimates of population IFR that are markedly
lower than our estimates based on all confirmed COVID-19 fatalities, whereas assessments of
IFR based on measures of excess mortality are broadly similar to our estimates.[107, 127-129]
See Supplementary Appendix P for further discussion.

Our metaregression results are broadly consistent with the study of Verity et al. (2020), which
was completed at a very early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and characterized an
exponential pattern of age-specific IFRs (see Supplementary Appendix Q).[130] Our results are
                                                  9


also well-aligned with a more recent meta-analysis of population IFR; indeed, our age-specific
analysis explains a very high proportion of the dispersion in population IFRs highlighted by that
study.[5] In contrast, our findings are markedly different from those of an earlier review of
population IFR, mostly due to differences in selection criteria.[131] Finally, the exponential
pattern of our age-specific IFR estimates is qualitatively similar to that of age-specific CFRs but
the magnitudes are systematically different (see Supplementary Appendix R).

A limitation of our work is that we have not considered factors apart from age that affect the IFR
of COVID-19. For example, a recent U.K. study found that mortality outcomes are strongly
linked to specific comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity but did not resolve the question of
whether those links reflect differences in prevalence or causal effects on IFR.[132]
See Supplementary Appendix S for additional evidence. Likewise, we have not considered the
extent to which IFRs may vary with other demographic factors such as race and ethnicity or
potential causal interactions between these factors.[32, 61] Further research on these issues is
clearly warranted.

It should also be noted that our analysis has focused exclusively on the incidence of fatalities but
has not captured the full spectrum of adverse health consequences of COVID-19, some of which
may be severe and persistent. Further research is needed to assess age-stratified rates of
hospitalization as well as longer-term sequelae attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections. These
factors are likely to be particularly important in quantifying risks to health care.

In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrates that COVID-19 is not only dangerous for the
elderly and infirm but also for healthy middle-aged adults. The metaregression explains nearly
90% of the geographical variation in population IFR, indicating that the population IFR is
intrinsically linked to the age-specific pattern of infections. Consequently, public health
measures to protect vulnerable age groups could substantially reduce the incidence of mortality.

Supplementary Appendix B: Meta-analysis search procedure

To perform the present meta-analysis, we collected published papers and preprints regarding the seroprevalence
and/or infection fatality rate of COVID-19. To identify these studies, we systematically performed online searches in
MedRxiv, Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar using the criterion ((“infection fatality rate” or “IFR” or
“seroprevalence” or “antibodies”) and (“COVID-19” or “SARS-Cov-2”)). We also used a search tool created by
the University of Zurich for searching EMBASE using the same search criterion.[134] We identified other studies
listed in reports by government institutions such as the U.K. Parliament Office.[6] Finally, we confirmed the
coverage of our search by referring to two recent meta-analysis studies of the overall IFR for COVID-19, a recent
meta-analysis of the ratio of measured seroprevalence to reported cases, and the SeroTracker global dashboard of
SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies.[5, 131, 135, 136] Our search encompassed studies that were publicly
disseminated prior to September 17, 2020. For cases in which a study was identified by the aforementioned search
but age-specific seroprevalence was not found, an expanded search was performed to obtain those details using
additional keywords (e.g., the location of the study). Data was extracted from studies by three authors and verified
prior to inclusion.
                                                                         S5


Supplementary Appendix C: Seroprevalence adjustments for test characteristics
Studies of COVID-19 seroprevalence have utilized a variety of distinct test procedures. Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA) proceed by tagging antibody-antigen interactions with a reporter protein.
Chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLA) work similarly by tagging the antigen-antibody interaction with a
fluorescent protein. Lateral Flow Assays (LFA), also known as rapid diagnostic tests (RDT), produce a colored band
upon antigen-antibody interaction. Microneutralization tests (MNT), recombinant immunofluorescent assays (RIA),
and plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT) can be performed in laboratories and provide extremely accurate
assessments.

Recognizing that SARS-Cov-2 is both novel and hazardous, public regulatory agencies have issued “emergency use
authorizations” (EUA) to facilitate the rapid deployment of test kits. Subsequent studies by independent laboratories
have reassessed the characteristics of these test kits, in many cases finding markedly different results than those of
the manufacturer. Such differences reflect (a) the extent to which test results may be affected by seemingly trivial
differences in its implementation, and (b) the extent to which serological properties may vary across different
segments of the population. For example, a significant challenge in producing accurate tests is to distinguish
COVID-19 antibodies from those associated with other coronaviruses (including the common cold). Consequently,
the assessment of test characteristics may vary with seemingly innocuous factors such as the season of the year in
which the blood samples were collected.

The reliability of a seroprevalence test depends on its sensitivity (the likelihood that the test correctly detects the
virus in an infected person) and specificity (the likelihood that the test has a negative result for a uninfected person)
as well as the true prevalence of the disease. For example, in a population where the true prevalence is low, a test
with sensitivity below 100% will yield a substantial fraction of false positive results.

Some seroprevalence studies have reported results for raw prevalence, that is, the ratio P / N, where P denotes the
number of positive test results and N denotes the number of individuals who were tested, with confidence intervals
that solely reflect sampling uncertainty (i.e., variations associated with drawing a finite sample of N observations).
However, such estimates and confidence intervals may be misleading in the absence of adjustments that reflect the
sensivity and specificity of the test method (except in the case of “gold standard” methods with 100% specificity and
100% sensitivity). Indeed, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found very substantial divergences in
sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 serological tests.[137]

If the sensitivity and specificity of the test are assumed to be known with certainty, then the test-adjusted prevalence
can be computed using the Gladen-Rogan formula[138] as follows:

                                                                    𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 + 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 – 1
                          𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 =
                                                                        𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 – 1

 Likewise, the test-adjusted confidence interval can be computed by multiplying the raw confidence interval by the
factor 1/(sensitivity + specificity – 1).

Some recent seroprevalence studies have reported test-adjusted results using the Gladen-Rogan formula.[3, 11, 13,
18, 139, 140] However, a number of other seroprevalence studies have only reported raw prevalence results.[80,
106, 110, 111, 139, 141] To facilitate the consistency of our meta-analysis, we follow the same approach of
adjusting those raw prevalence results using the Gladen-Rogan formula, as reported in the table below.

Nonetheless, the sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19 antibody test kits should generally not be treated as
parameters known with certainty. Indeed, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports 95% confidence intervals
for each of these test properties in its information sheet for all EUA test kits.[142] In particular, following the
approach of Gelman and Carpenter (2020), we use a Bayesian procedure to compute seroprevalence estimates and
confidence intervals that incorporate uncertainty about the sensitivity and specificity of the test kit used in each of
these seroprevalence studies.[143, 144] As shown in Table C1, the contrast between the Gladen-Rogan vs. Bayesian
results are most striking for study observations obtained using a relatively small sample size in a context of low
prevalence. In some cases, the Bayesian confidence interval indicates that the level of seroprevalence cannot be
distinguished from zero, and hence those observations are excluded from our metaregression (see Appendix X).

Note: This table reports data for all OECD countries as of 30 April except Lithuania (28 April) and Poland (5 May);
data on tests per confirmed case was not available for France and Sweden.[20] A national seroprevalence study of
the Czech Republic found that infections exceeded confirmed cases by a factor of 5, suggesting that comprehensive
tracing requires substantially more than 100 tests per confirmed case. By contrast, a seroprevalence study of Iceland
indicates that its tracing program was effective in identifying a high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections.[145] For
example, the Korea Center for Disease Control analyzed a total of 2995 serum samples collected for the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 21 April and 13 August, and only one of those specimens tested
positive for antibodies and neutralizing antibodies.[146] Similarly, a seroprevalence study of 1500 outpatients in
Seoul found only one positive result.[147]

Sources: Cases are reported by Iceland Directorate of Health as of 14 June 2020, when Iceland had 1796 recovered
cases, 10 fatalities, and 4 individuals in isolation (none hospitalized).[118] Estimated infections and 95% confidence
intervals are taken from the prevalence study of Gudbjartsson et al. (2020), which conducted tests of a random
sample of the general population on 16–31 March 2020.[21] As of 21 April 2020 (three weeks after the conclusion
of that study), there were 1785 reported cases (98·6% of the total reported cases as of 14 June 2020).

Notes: Spain had a total of 29137 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 fatalities as of 15 July 2020, including 9909
deaths in nursing homes. Age-specific fatalities outside of nursing homes are reported by Pastor-Barriuso et al.
(2020).[107] Abellán et al. (2020) estimated that 4% of Spanish nursing home residents were aged 65-69 while the
remaining 96% were aged 70+.[150] We used those proportions to allocate the 9909 nursing home deaths to the
corresponding age groups.

Notes: France had a total of 28802 confirmed COVID-19 fatalities as of 31 May 2020, including 18475 deaths in
hospitals and 10327 deaths in other medical and social institutions; France does not have real-time reporting of
deaths in personal homes.[152] Age-specific COVID-19 fatalities are only reported for hospitals; therefore, age-
specific COVID-19 fatalities for other medical and social institutions are allocated proportionally for ages 70–79
and 80+ based on the relative incidence of overall excess mortality during weeks 10 to 22 for those two age groups
as reported by Eurostat (which collects that data daily from France Santé Publique).[151]

Note: Some seroprevalence age brackets were adjusted (+/- 5 years) to match the age structure of that location’s
COVID-19 fatality report. For Pennsylvania and Utah, county-level data as of May 17 is available for total fatalities
but not reported by age group; consequently, the statewide age distribution of fatalities was used to allocate county-
level fatalities by age for each of those locations.

70 reported fatalities; thus, the six subsequent fatalities through 22 June 2020 were assumed to have the same age
distribution as the fatalities through 01 June 2020.
                                                                   S13


Supplementary Appendix G: Metaregression methodology

To analyze IFR by age, we use meta-regression with random effects, using the meta regress procedure in Stata
v16.[30, 31] We used a random-effects procedures to allow for residual heterogeneity between studies and across
age groups by assuming that these divergences are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. The procedure provides
reasonable results even if the errors are not strictly normal but may be unsatisfactory if the sample includes large
outliers or the distribution of groups is not unimodal. In analytical terms, this framework can be expressed as
follows:

                                        𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 ∗ 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

                                           where 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~ 𝑁𝑁(0, 𝜏𝜏 2 ) and 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~ 𝑁𝑁�0, 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 �

In this specification, 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the estimated IFR in study i for age group j, 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes
the median age of that group, 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the source of idiosyncratic variations for that
particular location and age group, and 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denotes the random effects that characterize
any systematic deviations in outcomes across locations and age groups. Under the maintained assumption that each
idiosyncratic term 𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 has a normal distribution, the idiosyncratic variance is 𝜎𝜎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2 = ((𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 )/3.96)2 , where 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
and 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 denote the upper and lower bounds of the
95% confidence interval for that study-age group. The random effects 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 are assumed to be drawn from a
homogeneous distribution with zero mean and variance 𝜏𝜏 2 . The null hypothesis
of 𝜏𝜏 2 = 0 characterizes the case in which there are no systematic deviations across studies or
age groups. If that null hypothesis is rejected, then the estimated value of 𝜏𝜏 2 encapsulates the magnitude of those
systematic deviations.

Under our baseline specification, the infection fatality rate increases exponentially with age—a pattern that has been
evident in prior studies of age-specific case fatality rates.[168, 169] Consequently, our meta-regression is specified
in logarithmic terms, with the slope coefficient 𝛽𝛽 encapsulating the impact of higher age on log(IFR). Consequently,
the null hypothesis that IFR is unrelated to age can be evaluated by testing whether the value of 𝛽𝛽 is significantly
different from zero. If that null hypothesis is rejected, then the estimated values of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 characterize the
estimated relationship between log(IFR) and age. Consequently, the predicted relationship between IFR and age can
be expressed as follows:

                                                         𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 = 𝑒𝑒 𝛼𝛼 +   𝛽𝛽∗𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


The 95% confidence interval for this prediction can obtained using the delta method. In particular, let 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 denote
the infection fatality rate for age a, and let 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 denote the standard error of the meta-regression estimate of log(𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 ).
If 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 has a non-zero value, then the delta method indicates that its standard error equals 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 / 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 , and this
standard error is used to construct the confidence interval for 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 at each age a. Likewise, the prediction interval
for log(𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 ) is computed using a standard error of 𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 + 𝜏𝜏 that incorporates the systematic variation in the random
effects across studies and age groups, and hence the corresponding prediction interval for 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 is computed using a
standard error of (𝜎𝜎𝑐𝑐 + 𝜏𝜏)/𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑎𝑎 .

In estimating this metaregression, we exclude observations for which the lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval for seroprevalence of that particular age group equals zero, and hence the upper bound of that age-specific
IFR is not well defined. Similarly, we exclude observations for which the lower bound of the 95% confidence
interval for seroprevalence is less than the observed COVID-19 mortality rate for that age group, since such
observations would imply
an upper bound for the IFR that exceeds 100%. Finally, we exclude observations for which
no COVID-19 fatalities were recorded for a given age group and hence the implied value of
the infection fatality rate is at its lower bound of zero and the corresponding confidence interval cannot be precisely
determined.

                                           This seroprevalence study collected specimens in late May from 13444 individuals
        Ariano Irpino,
                                             (about 75% of municipality residents) and found a raw prevalence of 4·83%.

                                   This study analyzed specimens from 2991 individuals undergoing elective surgery during May–June
                                  2020 and found test-adjusted seroprevalence of 0·28% (CI: 0–0·71%). No age-specific seroprevalence
        Australia[72]            results were reported. Although the sample of patients may not be fully representative of the Australian
                                population, these results confirm that prevalence in Australia was indistinguishable from zero at the time
                                    of the study, as expected for a comprehensive tracing program (see Supplementary Appendix C).

                                    Statistik Austria conducted an experimental study in which specimens were collected from 269
         Austria[63]                                     individuals ages 16+. The test-adjusted seroprevalence
                                                 was 4·71% (CI: 1·36–7·97%). No age-specific results were reported.

        Bad Feilnbach,          This study collected specimens from a random sample of 2153 adults between 23 June and 4 July 2020
        Germany[170]              and found raw seroprevalence of 6·0%. No age-specific results were reported as of September 17.

       Baton Rouge,               This study analyzed specimens from a random sample of 2138 individuals between July 15–31 and
     Louisiana, USA[71]                  found seroprevalence of 3·6%. No age-specific seroprevalence results were reported.

                                             This study collected specimens from 972 individuals on May 4-19 and found
        Blaine County,                        an IgG prevalence of 22·7% (CI: 20–25·5%). The authors concluded that
       Idaho, USA[39]            “the small number of county deaths (n=5) makes estimating the infection fatality rate unreliable.” No
                                                     age-specific fatality data is publicly available for this county.

                                     This study collected specimens from a random sample of 1312 confirmed residents of Bolinas
            Bolinas,
                                    on April 20-24. The test-adjusted seroprevalence was 0·16% (CI: 0·02–0·46%). No age-specific

                                 This study analyzed specimens from 4771 individuals participating in the Rhineland Study, an ongoing
                                 community-based prospective cohort study of Bonn residents ages 30 years and older. Specimens were
                                  collected between 24 April and 30 June 2020 and analyzed using a combination of ELISA, RIA, and
     Bonn, Germany[101]
                                   PRNT methods. The ELISA assay found 46 positive results and indicated seroprevalence of 0·97%
                                 (CI 0·72–1·30%). By contrast, the PRNT assay found only 17 positive results and indicated a markedly
                                lower seroprevalence of 0·36% (CI: 0·21–0·61%). No age-specific seroprevalence results were reported.

                                                 This study analyzed 885 laboratory specimens from outpatient clinics
 British Columbia, Canada[51]                    for the period May 15-27 and found only four positive cases (0·6%).
                                                             No age-specific seroprevalence was reported.

                                This study analyzed specimens from 454 primary care patients at a Level 1 medical center in Burlington
         Burlington,               on 25–28 June 2020 and found 10 positive results using a two-step serologic assay and found raw
      Vermont, USA[75]            prevalence of 2·2 percent (CI: 0·8–3·6%). The median age of individuals with positive vs. negative
                                                          results were nearly identical (51·9 vs. 51·4 years).

       Caldari Ortona,                           This study collected specimens from 640 residents on April 18-19 and
          Italy[65]                              found raw prevalence of 12%. No age-specific results were reported.

         Chelsea,                   This study collected specimens from 200 pedestrians and found a raw seroprevalence of 22·5%
   Massachusetts, USA[77]                              using an IgG LFA. No age-specific results were reported.

                                            This study analyzed specimens from a random sample of 505 adults residing
                              in non-congregate settings. The sample design reflected the assumption of statewide prevalence of 10%
                                (roughly similar to that of the neighboring state of New York) with the aim of obtaining prevalence
       Connecticut,
                              estimates with precision of 2% at a confidence level of 90%. However, the study obtained a much lower
        USA[38]
                                     estimated prevalence of 3·1% (95% CI: 1·1–5·1%). Consequently, the sample size proved
                                            to be insufficient to provide reliable age-specific results; the margin of error
                                              exceeds the estimated prevalence for all age groups reported in the study.

                                 The Czech Ministry of Health conducted a large-scale seroprevalence survey on April 23-May 1,
                              collecting specimens from a random sample of 22316 residents and testing for IgG antibodies using the
          Czech                Wantai test kit. Only 107 positive cases were identified (raw prevalence = 0·4%), and hence the test-
       Republic[33]           adjusted confidence intervals include the lower bound of zero prevalence. That result is consistent with
                              the very low number of reported cases in the Czech Republic as of early May; for example, Prague had
                                                     only 1,638 reported cases for a population of 1·3 million.
                               This study analyzed specimens from a random sample of 2427 individuals in early June and identified
       Denmark[34]             34 positive cases, yielding a test-adjusted prevalence of 1·2% (CI: 0·7–1·7%). Age-specific estimates
                                                                were not reported as of September 17.

       Faroe Islands
                                            during late April and obtained 6 positive results; the test-adjusted prevalence
       Denmark[46]
                                                 was 0·7% (CI: 0·3–1·3%). No age-specific results were reported.

                                    Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare has been conducting an ongoing study of
                                 seroprevalence using random sampling of the population. Each specimen is initially screened for
                                antibodies using a rapid test, and all specimens with positive screening results are analyzed using a
        Finland[66]              microneutralization test (MNT) with confirmed specificity of 100%. As of August 8, this process
                               screened 3155 specimens and obtained 8 positive MNT results (0.25%). No age-specific results were

                                This study analyzed specimens from a random sample of 919 participants from the municipality of
                                                   Gangelt (population 12,597) on March 31 to April 6 and obtained
         Gangelt,                 a test-adjusted prevalence of 15·5% (CI: 12·3–19·0%). Official government reports indicate that
       Germany[55]                                    Gangelt had 7 COVID-19 fatalities at the time of the study
                              but the death toll rose to 12 by late June, indicating an overall IFR of about 0·6%, similar to the IFR for
                                                  Geneva. Age-specific fatalities have not been reported for Gangelt.

                               This study analyzed residual serum specimens from 6586 individuals collected during March and April
                                 and found 24 positive results. The test-adjusted prevalence was 0% (CI: 0–0·23%). Prevalence was

                               This study analyzed specimens from 184 adults in Ischgl (an Austrian municipality of 1,604 residents)
                                and obtained 85 positive results, i.e., prevalence of 46·2%. The study reported the fraction of positive

        Austria[76]
                                  2 adults ages 75+) but did not report test-adjusted estimates or confidence intervals by age group.
                                                      Ischgl had only 2 reported COVID-19 fatalities as of July 1.

                               Israel Health Ministry initiated a large-scale seroprevalence study in May. Subsequent media reports
         Israel[68]           indicated that initial tests of 70000 Israelis indicated that prevalence varied significantly across regions
                                      and health organizations. No age-specific results had been released as of September 17.

                               This study performed PCR tests on 565 Japanese citizens expatriated from Wuhan, China. There were
   Japanese Evacuees[41]       eight positive tests, indicating a raw prevalence of 1·4%, but assessment of age-specific prevalence or
                                  IFRs is not feasible given the small sample, low prevalence, and lack of data on case outcomes.

                                   This study collected samples from 629 households comprising 1,062 individuals and estimated
                                  seroprevalence at 4·2% (CI 2·9 to 5·5%), indicating that about 3,300 Jersey residents have been

   United Kingdom[36]
                                   (similar to that of NYC). However, the seroprevalence sample is too small to facilitate accurate

                                             very low (22 out of 3,953) and hence too small for assessing age-specific IFRs.

H.3.2 Studies of hospitals, urgent care clinics, and dialysis centers

          Brooklyn,             This study used samples from an outpatient clinic and yielded a much higher infection rate than other
      New York, USA[79]                             seroprevalence studies of the New York metropolitan area.

                               This study tested for IgG antibodies in 1,000 specimens from an outpatient clinic and found 33 positive
                                 cases. However, the study did not screen out samples from patients who were seeking treatment for
                               COVID-related symptoms. Moreover, the study reported raw prevalence and confidence interval but did
                               not report statistics adjusted for test characteristics. The manufacturer (ADS Biotec / Kurabo Japan) has
       Kobe, Japan[96]
                               indicated that this test has specificity of 100%, based on a sample of 14 pre-COVID specimens, but that
                                  specificity has not been evaluated by any independent study. The authors concluded by noting the
                               selection bias and recommended that “further serological studies targeting randomly selected people in
                                                             Kobe City could clarify this potential limitation.”

                                The authors of this study specifically cautioned against interpreting their results as representative of the
                                general population. In particular, the sample of 1,071 participants included 175 healthcare workers, 332
     Tokyo, Japan[16, 179]    individuals who had experienced a fever in the past four months, 45 individuals who had previously taken
                              a PCR test, and 9 people living with a COVID-positive cohabitant. The study obtained a raw infection rate
                                                  of 3·8%, but the rate is only 0·8% if those subgroups are excluded.

                               This study analyzed residual plasma of 28503 randomly selected adult patients receiving dialysis in July
                               2020. Seroprevalence for the tested sample was 8·0% (CI: 7·7–8·4%), However, prevalence of dialysis
       United States[14]          patients can diverge markedly from that of the general population; for example, this sudy finds a
                                 seropositive rate of 34% for patients residing in New York state, nearly three times higher than the
                                              14% seroprevalence rate obtained using a random sample of that state.[3]

                              This study analyzed two distinct set of samples: (i) blood donors and (ii) hospital patients. Nearly all blood
                                donors were ages 20 to 55, so that sample is not useful for assessing age-specific IFRs for older adults.
            Zurich,            The sample of hospital patients was not screened to eliminate cases directly related to COVID-19, so that
        Switzerland[97]           sample may not be representative of the broader population, e.g., inhabitants of the city of Zurich
                                constituted a relatively large fraction of seropositive results compared to residents from the rest of the
                                         canton of Zurich. The study found an overall IFR of 0·5% similar to that of Geneva.

         England[10]              healthy adult blood donors. For example, in 7694 samples tested during May (weeks 18-21), the test-
                                                             adjusted prevalence was 8·5% (CI: 6·9–10%).
                                 This study assessed residue sera from 3186 regular blood donors collected during March 9–June 3 and
                                obtained 29 positive results (raw prevalence 0·9%). The authors stated: “It should be emphasized that the
         Germany[87]
                                preselection of blood donors as a study cohort is accompanied by limitations regarding representation of

                                This study assessed specimens from 390 blood donors residing in the Lodi red zone collected on April 6
     Lombardy, Italy[92]
                                                            and found a raw seroprevalence rate of 23%.

                                               This study assessed specimens from a random sample of 789 blood donors
        Milan, Italy[95]
                                                over the period from February 24 (at the start of the outbreak) to April 8.
                                                      This study assessed specimens from 7361 adult blood donors

                                                       collected on April 1-15 and found seroprevalence of 2·7%.
         Rhode Island,                          This study assessed specimens from 2008 blood donors collected during
           USA[90]                                       April 27–May 11 and found seroprevalence of 0·6%.

                                   This study assessed specimens from 3500 blood donors collected between March 17 and May 19.
                                   The authors noted that the resulting estimates of seroprevalence “are complicated by non-uniform
         Scotland[94]
                                  sampling...based on the locations where weekly donations took place...[and] further confounded by
                                          the absence of samples from individuals below age 18 and individuals over age 75.”

                               This study analyzed specimen samples from students and teachers at thirteen secondary schools in eastern
     Saxony, Germany[82]
                                                         Saxony and found very low seroprevalence (0·6%).

                                This study analyzed specimens from 2482 children (ages 1–10 years) and one of their parents collected
    Southwest Germany[101]      between 22 April and 15 May 2020. Seroprevalence for children was 0·6% (CI: 0·3–1·0%), while the

                                 This study analyzed specimens for 50130 consecutive life insurance applicants whose blood samples
                                were collected for insurance underwriting purposes between 12 May and 25 June 2020. The study found
       United States[100]
                               1520 positive results, that is, raw seroprevalence of 3·0%. The study did not find significant differences in
                                                 prevalence across three age groups (18–40, 41–60, and 61–85 years).

                                  This study used a database of 62881 contacts of COVID-19 cases and conducted RT-PCR tests and
          Lombardy,
                                  antibody screening on 5484 individuals. The study reported that 2824 individuals had positive tests
           Italy[99]
                                    (51·5% of the sample), of which 62 individuals subsequently died with a COVID-19 diagnosis.




H.4 Exclusion of observations with seroprevalence indistinguishable from zero
Note: The metaregression analysis excludes observations for which either (a) the lower bound of the
95% confidence interval equals zero, and hence the upper bound of the IFR is not well defined; or (b) the lower
bound of the 95% confidence interval is less than the observed COVID-19 mortality rate for that age group,
implying an upper bound for the IFR that exceeds 100%.

             Study                                                              Description


                                       This study assessed seroprevalence in a random sample of 509 residents of the municipality of
                                   Castiglione d’Adda, the location of the first COVID-related fatality in Italy. Specimens were collected
 Castiglione d’Adda, Italy[183]     on May 18–25. Seroprevalence was estimated at 22·6% (CI: 17·2–29·1%). This study is included in
                                   our meta-analysis but not in our metaregression because this municipality is covered by a nationwide
                                                                    seroprevalence study of Italy.[106]




                                   This ship was carrying 3,711 passengers and crew; its demographic composition was not necessarily
                                   representative of any specific geographical location. RT-PCR tests indicated that 619 individuals had
       Diamond Princess
                                   been infected prior to the ship’s debarkation on March 7, and 14 individuals subsequently died due to
       Cruise Ship[123]
                                  COVID-related causes. The IFR was 0·5% for ages 60-69, 2·9% for ages 70-79, and 7·9% for ages 80+,
                                                      broadly consistent with the metaregression results of this study.




                                  This study assessed seroprevalence using specimens collected from a demographically balanced panel of
                                  17,776 participants on May 27 to July 6. Our metaregression includes a much larger seroprevalence study
      U.K. Biobank[122]
                                     of the English population.[184] Consequently, this study is included in our meta-analysis but not in
                                                    our metaregression to avoid pitfalls of nested or overlapping samples.




                                      The U.K. Office for National Statistics (ONS) regularly reports estimates of seroprevalence from
                                     specimens provided for routine testing using an IgG ELISA test conducted by research staff at the
        U.K. Office of
                                   University of Oxford. On August 18 the ONS reported age-specific results for the cumulative sample of
     National Statistics[11]
                                  4840 specimens received from 26 April to 26 July and indicated that these results were broadly consistent
                                             with the findings of the UK REACT-2 study (which utilized a much larger sample).




                                   This study analyzed commercial lab specimens from 1132 individuals collected during April 20–May 3.
                                     This study is not included in our meta-analysis because a subsequent study analyzed a much larger
        Utah, USA[18]
                                  randomized sample of 6527 residents of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area during May 4–June 10.[19]
                                          As of May, that metro area accounted for nearly 90% of COVID-related fatalities in Utah.

Supplementary Appendix O: Infection fatality rate for seasonal influenza
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention provides annual estimates of the U.S. impact of seasonal
influenza based on reporting from state and local public health laboratories and other sources. For the winter season
of 2018-2019, its preliminary estimate is 35·5 million symptomatic cases and 34 thousand fatalities.[185] A
systematic review and meta-analysis of 55 studies found that 25·4% to 61·8% of influenza infections were
subclinical, i.e., did not meet the criteria for acute respiratory illness.[186] Using the midpoint of that interval, we
estimate that the total U.S. incidence of seasonal influenza during winter 2018-19 was about 63 million and hence
that the infection fatality rate was about 0.05%.


Supplementary Appendix P: Excess mortality
In some locations, reported deaths may not fully capture all fatalities resulting from COVID-19 infections,
especially when a large fraction of such deaths occurs outside of medical institutions. In the absence of accurate
COVID-19 death counts, excess mortality can be computed by comparing the number of deaths for a given time
period in 2020 to the average number of deaths over the comparable time period in prior calendar years, e.g., 2015
to 2019. This approach has been used to conduct systematic analysis of excess mortality in European countries.[187]
For example, the Belgian study used in our metaregression computed age-specific IFRs using seroprevalence
findings in conjunction with data on excess mortality in Belgium; the authors noted that Belgian excess mortality
over the period from March to May coincided almost exactly with Belgium’s tally of reported COVID-19
cases.[114]

Supplementary Appendix S: Comorbidities and Demographic Factors

While age and fatality risk are closely related, differences in the age structure of the population and age-specific
infection rates surely cannot explain all deviations in IFR across regions and populations. Consequently, the role of
co-morbidities and other demographic and socioeconomic factors merits further research that carefully distinguishes
between infection risk and IFR.

A recent U.K. study has shown that COVID-19 mortality outcomes are strongly linked to comorbidities such as
chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and obesity.[132] However, that study specifically warns against drawing
causal conclusions from those findings, which may reflect a higher incidence of COVID-19 rather than a higher IFR
for individuals with those comorbidities. Indeed, as shown in Table S1, a study of hospitalized U.K. COVID-19
patients found that patient age was far more important than any specific comorbidity in determining mortality
risk.[169] For example, the COVID-19 fatality risk for an obese 40-year-old hospital patient was found to be
moderately higher than for a non-obese individual of the same cohort but only one-tenth the fatality risk for a non-
obese 75-year-old hospital patient.

The high prevalence of comorbidities among COVID-19 patients has been well documented but not compared
systematically to the prevalence of such comorbidities in the general population. For example, one recent study of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York City (NYC) reported that 94% of those patients had at least one
chronic health condition.[188] However, as shown in Table S2, that finding is not particularly surprising given the
prevalence of comorbidities among middle-aged and elderly NYC residents. For example, nearly 30% of older NYC
adults (ages 60+) are diabetic, while 23% have cardiovascular disease (including hypertension), and 8% have
chronic pulmonary diseases—practically identical to the incidence of those comorbidities in the sample of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Indeed, obesity was the only comorbidity that was much more prevalent among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients than in the general population of older NYC adults. Nonetheless, obesity is also
much more prevalent among lower-income groups who are more likely to live in high-density neighborhoods and
work in high-exposure jobs, and hence such data clearly cannot be used to distinguish prevalence vs. severity of
COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis has not directly considered the extent to which IFRs may vary with other demographic factors,
including race and ethnicity. Fortunately, valuable insights can be garnered from other recent studies. In particular,
one recent seroprevalence study of residents of two urban locations in Louisiana found no significant difference in
IFRs between whites and Blacks.[61]

Nonetheless, the incidence of COVID-19 mortality among people of color is extraordinarily high due to markedly
different infection rates that reflect systematic racial and ethnic disparities in housing and employment. For example,
a recent infection study of a San Francisco neighborhood found that 80% of positive cases were Latinx – far higher
than the proportion of Latinx residents in that neighborhood.[32] That study concluded as follows: “Risk factors for
recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work,
unemployment, and household income less than $50,000 per year.”

Other researchers have reached similar conclusions, attributing elevated infection rates among Blacks and Hispanics
to dense housing of multi-generational families, increased employment in high-contact service jobs, high incidence
of chronic health conditions, and lower quality of health care.[189]

In summary, while our meta-analysis has investigated the effects of age on IFR for COVID-19, further research
needs to be done on how infection and fatality rates for this disease are affected by comorbidities as well as
demographic and socioeconomic factors.
