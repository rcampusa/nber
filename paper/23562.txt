                                          ABSTRACT

This paper highlights some of the theoretical and practical implications for monetary policy and
exchange rates that derive specifically from the presence of a global general equilibrium factor
embedded in neutral real policy rates in open economies. Using a standard two country DSGE
model, we derive a structural decomposition in which the nominal exchange rate is a function of
the expected present value of future neutral real interest rate differentials plus a business cycle
factor and a PPP factor. Country specific “r*” shocks in general require optimal monetary policy
to pass these through to the policy rate, but such shocks will also have exchange rate
implications, with an expected decline in the path of the real neutral policy rate reflected in a
depreciation of the nominal exchange rate. We document a novel empirical regularity between
the equilibrium error in the VECM representation of the empirical Holston Laubach Williams
(2017) four country r* model and the value of the nominal trade weighted dollar. In fact, the
correlation between the dollar and the 12 quarter lag of the HLW equilibrium error is estimated to
be 0.7. Global shocks to r* under optimal policy require no exchange rate adjustment because
passing though r* shocks to policy rates ‘does all the work’ of maintaining global equilibrium.
We also study a richer model with international spill overs so that in theory there can be gains to
international policy cooperation. In this richer model we obtain a similar decomposition for the
nominal exchange rate, but with the added feature that r* in each country is a function global
productivity and business cycle factors even if these factors are themselves independent across
countries. We argue that in practice, there could well be significant costs to central bank
communication and credibility under a regime formal policy cooperation, but that gains to policy
coordination could be substantial given that r*’s are unobserved but are correlated across
countries.

           Some Implications for Exchange Rates, Monetary Policy, and Policy Coordination

                                               Richard Clarida

I. Introduction

        Over the past 25 years, best practice monetary policy has been implemented with reference - if

not with mechanical adherence - to interest rate feedback rules that Include as inputs estimates of both

potential output as well as the real policy rate - often referred to the "neutral" real policy rate and

denoted as r* - consistent with potential output and price stability as defined by the central bank's

inflation target. Before the global financial crisis and reflecting the justly deserved influence of Taylor

(1993), it was common in policy simulations (Henderson and McKibbin (1993)) and in empirical work

(Clarida, Gali, Gertler (1998;2000)) to make the simplifying assumption that r* is constant. However, it

has long been appreciated ( Wicksell (1898) ; Friedman (1968)) that r* can be time varying and in

particular, the theoretical analysis of monetary policy rules in Woodford (2003) and Clarida , Gali,

Gertler (1999;2002) - among many others - has emphasized that shocks to r* should be reflected in policy

rates set by central banks seeking to keep the economy as close as possible to the benchmark of a flexible

price equilibrium. Since the global financial crisis , estimated and projected future declines in neutral

real policy rates (Laubach and Williams (2003); Holston, Laubach, Williams (2017)) ; Hamilton , et. al.

(2015)) relative to the pre-crisis experience have become an important consideration in the conduct of

monetary policy and the communication of forward guidance at the Fed and some other major central

banks ( Yellen (2017); Haldane (2015)).

        One obvious and significant implication of a persistent decline in the neutral real policy rate in

any given country is that such a decline makes it more likely that a central bank will hit the effective -

perhaps somewhat less than zero - lower bound for any given inflation target and distribution of shocks .

While these lower - bound and choice-of -inflation- target topics are important (and have recently been



                                                                                                              2
studied in the open economy context by Cook and Devereux (2013)), they are not the focus of this paper.

Instead, the focus of this paper is on highlighting some of the theoretical and practical implications for

monetary policy and foreign exchange rates that derive specifically from the presence of a global

general equilibrium factor - predicted in theory and estimated in practice - embedded in neutral real

policy rates in open economies. Empirically, as shown in a recent study by Ferrari, Kearns, and Schrimpf

(2017) the exchange rate impact of monetary policy shocks has been growing significantly this appears to

be related – and is certainly contemporaneous with – the observed decline in neutral policy rates (see also

Gali (2017) for a model of forward guidance and exchange rates).

        After reviewing in Section II some of the existing empirical evidence on the presence of a global

factor in neutral policy rates, we present in Section III a simple two country model (based on Gali-

Monacelli (2005) and Clarida (2014)) to help illustrate several points about how shocks to neutral policy

rates might impact monetary policy and exchange rates. We show that in this model, the neutral real

policy rate in each country will be a function of expected productivity growth in that country, so that if

there is a common factor across countries in productivity growth, there will be a common factor in

neutral policy rates. If countries are adjusting policy in response to common , global neutral real rate

shocks, this will obviously impart a positive correlation in policy even in the absence policy cooperation

or coordination. In this particular model given the assumption on parameters, there is no gain to

monetary policy cooperation; the Nash best response policy rules - which in this model take the form of

Taylor type rules - lead to the maximum level of global welfare that can be obtained in the absence of a

commitment device outside the model. As for exchange rates, we derive a decomposition for the (log)

nominal exchange rate as the sum of a price level term, and business cycle term, and a term which is the

present value of expected future neutral real policy rate differentials, with a decline in the expected future

neutral policy rate below its long run level associated with a depreciation of the exchange rate today. In

this model, exchange rate depreciation in the face of a country specific r* shocks is not the outcome a


                                                                                                             3
‘beggar thy neighbor’ policy in either motive or realization, as trade is balanced period by period so that

the exchange rate adjustment that occurs is required to maintain trade balance. Intuitively, if the country

specific component of productivity is stationary, a positive shock to home productivity today sets up the

expectation of future declines in productivity - and thus future declines in the neutral real interest rate -

in the future. The rise in productivity today requires the home real interest rate to fall to boost aggregate

demand at home but is also requires the nominal exchange rate to depreciate to adjust the terms of trade

so that foreign demand rises to absorb some of the rise in home supply. By contrast, in this model

exchange rates do not need adjust to the global component in neutral policy rates, realized or expected.

In response to a global shock, a common global decline in real policy rates can ‘do all the work’ to

generate global aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply. This may look like, but is not in this

model a globally inefficient ‘currency war’ defined as a ‘race to the bottom’ in policy rates as countries

seek to avoid rate differentials and home currency appreciation as other countries cut interest rates.

        In Section IV, we study a more general specification (based on CGG (2002)) of the two country

model in which there are international spillovers that can lead, in theory, gains to international policy

cooperation We argue however, that in practice, cooperation may be difficult to implement and

communicate because in this model it would bind countries to set local policy rates based on an index of

global inflation. Moreover, in this model with international spillovers, the neutral real policy rate in each

country will depend on expected productivity growth in all countries (and potentially also global

business cycle factors) even if there is no common factor in country productivity growth. As a result,

there may be significant gains to policy coordination which are achievable in practice in the non-

cooperative equilibrium where again optimal policy can be written as a Taylor type rule.

        Section V provides some concluding remarks.




                                                                                                                4
II. A Quick Review of the Empirical Evidence

           As the motivation for this paper is the phenomenon of a time varying global factor in neutral real

interest rates, it seems worthwhile at the outset to provide some evidence that these rates are time

varying and that they appear correlated across countries. Similar to another input to monetary policy

analysis – potential output - the neutral real policy rate is both time varying and unobservable and thus

must be inferred from data. Laubach and Williams (2003) and more recently Holston, Laubach, and

Williams (2017) have developed and implemented a widely cited methodology for estimating neutral real

policy rates. The latter paper is especially useful for our purpose because it consistently applies the a

common LW methodology to estimate neutral real policy rates in the US, UK, Canada, and Eurozone.

Other papers – for example Hamilton, et al. (2015), King and Low (2014), Lucasz and Smith (2015), IMF

(2013) – provide estimates that are also consistent with the presence of a global factor in time varying

neutral real interest rates.

        Figure 1 displays the HLW estimates of r*t for the US, UK, Europe, and Canada as of July 2016.

For all four countries, estimates for recent years are well below those in the 1990s and in the years

preceding the Global Financial Crisis. It is also interesting to note that for all countries, in the decade or

so before the GFC, the estimates are clustered around 2% which of course is the assumed constant value

for r* in the original Taylor Rule. Figure 2, compares the HLW estimates of the US r* with the 1 year TIPS

yield 4 years forward as calculated by the Federal Reserve.

As the HLW econometric approach uses no data on TIPS yields or forwards so, the alignment between

the two series is noteworthy. That said, as shown in Figure 3, there is a much looser relationship between

forward real yields in the UK (as calculated by the Bank of England) and the HLW estimates of r* for the

UK.

        Finally, to get a sense of the co movement among the four neutral real policy rates, we plot the

estimated r*t for the US versus a weighted average of the r*t estimates for the other three countries, with

the weights equal to (minus) the estimated co integrating vector coefficients reported in HLW (2017)

Table 3. The difference between these two series is the equilibrium error the VECM representation of the

HLW system (since HLW normalize the US coefficient in the co-integrating vector to unity).

III. A Simple Model of Optimal Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Determination with r* Shocks

        We begin with a tractable two country version of the Gail–Monacelli (2005) and Clarida (2014)

DSGE model of optimal monetary policy and exchange rate determination extended to allow for global as

well as country specific stocks to r*t . In this model,        r*t shocks are driven by common as well as country

specific shocks to home and foreign expected productivity growth.                      To focus on the main points, and

without loss of generality, we assume in this section the ‘foreign’ country operates always at its supply

determined level of output       YF t = AF t = Yt F and that foreign monetary policy is such that the price of

foreign output is constant and equal to 1. By contrast, in the home country, ‘cost push’ shocks in the

presence of nominal rigidities can cause output to deviate from its flexible price supply determined level

of output so that   Yt = AFt At Xt = Yt X t . In this model, aggregate home productivity is the product of a

common global factor AF t and a home-country specific factor At . The home ‘output gap’ , denoted X t, is

endogenous and will be solved for as a function of shocks and the monetary policy rule. An overstrike

over a variable indicates its level in a flexible price equilibrium. In the model of this section, with our

parameter choices, the flexible price level of output in each country is just equal to the exogenous level of

productivity in that country.

                                                                                                          1

(CH,t)b (CF,t)1-b and N   t   is home labor supply and b ≥ 0.5. These preference feature an intertemporal

elasticity of substitution 1/σ equal to 1 and a Cobb-Douglass aggregator for consumption. Households

maximizes a discounted sum of expected utility subject to a sequence of budget constraints

where Mt,t+1 is a nominal stochastic discount factor, W t is the money wage, D t is the distribution paid on

securities brought into date t, Tt is lump sum tax collection, and Г t is the distribution of profits earned by

producers of intermediate inputs. Foreign preferences and budget constrains are symmetric.

                                                                                                                        8
        Up to log linearization, an Euler equation will characterize the equilibrium relationship between

With our assumptions on preferences, trade will be balanced period by period (Cole Obstfeld (1991)) and

goods market equilibrium will imply bAFtAtXt +(1-b)StAFt = AFtAt Xt where St is the equilibrium terms of

trade (home good price of foreign good) and b ≥ ½ is the expenditure share on locally produced output.

This implies St = At Xt or in logs st = at + xt so that the log of the equilibrium terms of trade is equal to the

home country specific factor in productivity at plus the log of the home ‘output gap’ x t. We assume the

law of one price and producer currency pricing so that the log nominal exchange rate satisfies e t = st + p t

where p t is the log of the price of home output. We have πcpit+1 = πt+1+(1-b)Δst+1 with πt+1 = pt+1 – pt.

        From balanced trade and goods market equilibrium Ct=(b)b(1-b)1-bAFtAtXtSb-1t Substituting out for

c t and using the definition of CPI and the equilibrium condition for the terms of trade, we obtain an

Euler equation in terms of the domestic output gap and the neutral real interest rate

(1)                               xt = Et xt+1 – {R t – Et (pt+1-pt) – r*t}

where r*t = Et Δ aF t+1 + Et Δ a t+1 is the ex-ante real interest rate in the home country that maintains the home

output gap at zero. We have rF*t = Et Δ aF t+1 period by period , πFt = 0 period by period, RFt = rF*t period by

period, and YF t = AF t period by period. We assume that at is an auto correlated deviation of the log level

of home productivity from the log level of global productivity aF t which may itself possess a unit root.

Note that under this stationarity assumption at + Et Σi=1,∞Δat+i=0 if the unconditional mean of at is 0.




                                                                                                                9
        Home firms will set prices as a markup over marginal cost – which is proportional to the real

product wage scaled by productivity - in a staggered fashion a la Calvo. With our assumption on

preferences, and letting δ=(1-F)(1-βF)/F with (1-F) the fraction of firms that reset prices each period,

inflation in the price of home goods will be given by

(2)                                 p t  p t 1   E t ( p t 1  p t )  x t  u t

where ut is a - possibly auto correlated - shock to the wage mark-up and λ= (1+φ)δ.

        The nominal exchange rate must be consistent with asset market equilibrium, goods market

equilibrium, and long run purchasing power parity (which will hold in this model in expectation in the

long run under our assumptions on productivity and preferences ).                        A structural equation which

characterizes the equilibrium exchange rate in terms of endogenous variables can be written as

                                                            

                                                           i 0


where rt * - rF*t = Et Δ at+1 is the neutral real rate differential between the home country and the foreign

country . Thus the log nominal exchange rate can be decomposed into the sum of a PPP component, a

business cycle component, and a (forward looking) r* component. Equivalently, persistent but transitory

deviations from PPP are the sum of a business cycle component and an r* component.             The nominal exchange

rate today will reflect the entire expected future time path of the country specific component in the

neutral real interest rate but in equilibrium does not adjust to the global component in the neutral policy rate. In

particular, if today the neutral real rate at home is expected in the future to lie below the neutral real rate

abroad, the nominal exchange rate today must weaken relative to domestic prices given the state of the

business cycle xt.   Figure 5 depicts the empirical relationship between the nominal trade weighted

dollar and the equilibrium error calculated using the parameters reported in HLW (2017) Table 3 and

shown in Figure 4. The equilibrium error appears to lead the trade weighted dollar by about 12 quarters.

The simple correlation between the TW Dollar and the VECM error lagged 12 quarters is 0.70.

         Notice that structural exchange rate equation (3) holds in any equilibrium regardless of how the

rest of the model is closed. To close the model, we need to take a stand on monetary policy and the

central bank objective function so we can pin down domestic inflation and the output gap. There are

two ways to do this. We can just assume that the objective function is quadratic in inflation and the

output gap with an arbitrary relative weight α on stabilizing home output at its natural level aFt + at. Or,

as was derived in Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2002) and Gali Monacelli (2005) , we can follow Woodford

(2003) and solve for α – and thus the optimal policy rule - as a function of deep parameters. So for a

                                                                                                   

subject to the Philipps curve and the Euler and taking Et πt+1 as given, the first order condition will be

        
x t    t which is of the same form as in Clarida, Gali and Gertler (1999). Since under optimal policy
        

the output gap will be linear in domestic inflation, the equilibrium rate of inflation under optimal policy

will satisfy  t   Et{ t 1}  (2 /  )t  ut . Solving forward and assuming ut  ut 1   t we obtain


                                                πt = (1-βρ + λ2/α)-1ut

or πt = ψut. The optimal policy rule given α is obtained by substituting the first order condition into the

Euler equation and using equilibriums dynamics for inflation. The system can be written as follows:


                                                         (1   ) 

                                                                   i 0


with r*t = Et Δ aFt + Et Δ at , rF*t = Et Δ aFt and Etπt+1 = ρψut and pt-1 = Σi=1,∞ψut-i. Thus optimal policy in the

open economy can be written as a forward looking Taylor rule with a time varying neutral real interest rate .



                                                                                                                                12
The time varying neutral real interest rate is, in turn, the sum of a global component and a country

specific component. Also notice that above we focus on an equilibrium with inflation proportional to the

exogenous cost push shock ut. As is well known, there are other equilibria in this class of DSGE models

which feature speculative hyperinflation, and this would be true even if we were to append a standard

utility of real balances into the objective function (see for example Kocherlakota and Phelan (1999) for an

insightful discussion of this issue).

        Notice in this set up, under optimal monetary policy, there is a clean distinction between impact

of neutral rate shocks (driven by forecastable changes in productivity growth) and cost push shocks.

Under optimal policy neutral rate shocks should be reflected one for one in policy rates and will result in

equilibrium adjustments in nominal exchange rate to the country specific component in neutral real rate

shocks. These adjustments in policy rates and exchange rate are sufficient to keep the economy at its

flexible price equilibrium even in the presence of nominal rigidities. Cost push shocks, by contrast, create

a tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation. Under optimal policy, the central bank follows a

forward looking Taylor rule and raises the nominal interest rate by more than the rise in expected

inflation. This optimal policy depresses output below the flexible price level so as to stabilize expected

inflation. The optimal policy will also have implications for the nominal exchange which will be

discussed below. Note that cost push shocks have no effect on the neutral policy rate unless those shocks

are themselves correlated with productivity shocks.

        These three equations illustrate several points about neutral real rate shocks in open economies

under flexible exchange rates that are worth noting.




- The neutral real policy rate in the open economy will in general be a function of global as well local

factors such as the rate of current and expected future potential growth. If countries are adjusting policy




                                                                                                             13
in response to common , global neutral real rate shocks, this will obviously impart a positive correlation in

policy even in the absence policy coordination or cooperation.




-In this model with the parameter assumption we have made on the intertemporal elasticity of

substitution, there is no gain to policy cooperation so that the Nash best response policy rules which here

take the form of Taylor type rules - lead to the maximum level global welfare that can be obtained under

discretion.

- The exchange rate is an asset price that will reflect , in part, expectations of the future time path of the

country specific component of the neutral policy rate policy rate, with a decline in the expected future

neutral policy rate below its long run level associated with a depreciation of the exchange rate today.

- However, exchange rate depreciation in the face of a persistent country specific r* shock is not a ‘beggar

thy neighbor’ policy in either motive or realization. In this simple model, trade is balanced period by

period and so the exchange rate adjustment that occurs is required to maintain goods market equilibrium

with balanced trade and not to generate a trade surplus.

- Exchange rate adjustment to a persistent country specific r* shock is required because expectations

that future home neutral rates will remain below neutral rates in the rest of the world are coincident with

expectations that home productivity and output are and will remain elevated relative to their long run

levels, and this elevated supply requires a weaker nominal exchange rate and a worsening terms of trade

as well as a lower neutral policy rate to generate the level and allocation of global aggregate demand to

clear the home and world goods market. In symbols - Et Σi=1,∞rH*t = at

 - By contrast, at least under optimal policy, exchange rates do not need to adjust to the global component in

neutral policy rates, realized or expected. In response to a global shock, a common global decline in real

policy rates can ‘do all the work’ to generate global aggregate demand in line with aggregate supply;




                                                                                                            14
- This may look like, but is not a globally inefficient ‘currency war’ defined as a ‘race to the bottom’ in

policy rates as countries seek to avoid home currency appreciation as other countries cut interest rates.




         An interesting feature of these models which finds a great deal of empirical support and is

discussed extensively in CGG (2002); Clarida Waldman (2007); Krugman Obstfeld Melitz (9th edition) ;

and Clarida (2014) is the ‘bad news good news’ result that, with an inflation targeting central bank, a

shock that pushes inflation above target can trigger the expectation of a policy rate path that results in an

appreciation of the nominal exchange rate today even though in the long run the exchange rate must (in

expectation) depreciate to return to PPP. In our model, bad news for inflation resulting from a positive

cost push shock to ut will appreciate the nominal exchange rate today if α – the welfare weight on output

stabilization – is less than λ – the slope of the Philipps curve.

                                                          i 0


A ‘cost push’ shock ut will increase domestic inflation and under optimal policy induce the central bank

to raise the nominal interest rate by more than expected inflation.                  The rise in the ex-ante real interest

rate will cause st to fall and this, along with the rise in the real interest rate itself, will reduce demand

for home output. In the ‘bad news good news’ case the equilibrium decline in s t is larger in absolute

value than is the equilibrium rise in inflation, and this can only be accomplished via an appreciation of

the nominal exchange rate More broadly, the equilibrium nominal exchange rate in this model must possess

a unit root even though shocks are stationary and our Cole-Obstfeld equilibrium replicates the complete

market allocation. The nominal exchange rate must possess a unit root because time consistent monetary

policy cannot deliver a stationary price level, only a stationary rate of inflation (Clarida, Gali and Gertler (2002);

Woodford (2003)). The unit root in the nominal exchange rate is required to produce a stationary

equilibrium terms of trade given that optimal monetary policy produces unit root in the price level.

IV. Policy Correlation, Gains from Policy Coordination, but Potential Pitfalls from Policy Cooperation

        Although these are absent in the simple model of Section III, in general there may be

international spillovers to monetary policy that are not fully incorporated in Taylor - type rules that

feedback solely on domestic macroeconomic variables. If so, there can in theory be gains to monetary

policy cooperation. However, while we observe that national monetary policies are often correlated (eras

of global monetary easing; global rate hike cycles), they also appear sometimes to be coordinated (after all,

what else are central bankers doing at all those G7 , G20, IMF, and Basel meetings?) , but rarely (if ever)

do major central banks respect a binding commitment to pursue cooperative policies , policies that would

differ from non-cooperative policies aimed solely at satisfying their objectives for domestic inflation and

employment. It has long been well appreciated (Taylor (1982)) that in small or large scale open economy

macro models, the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation (see for example,

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2002)) are found to be modest relative to the welfare achieved under a Nash

equilibrium in which each country runs a sensible policy taking as given the policy of the other

countries. In this section, we will make a somewhat different and less often discussed case against global

monetary policy cooperation even in a world of r* shocks. Namely, that in practice, adopting it – or

succumbing to it! - could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for sound, rules

based policies. According to this view, the all - in cost to a regime of policy cooperation could swamp the

theoretical benefits, and if so, we should not bemoan the absence of formal monetary policy cooperation,

we should celebrate it!

        However, and perhaps especially in a world in which there is a common global component in

neutral real policy rates across countries, international monetary policy coordination – defined to include

the sharing of information and analysis regarding estimates of the unobservable inputs to policy rules

such as the equilibrium real rate of interest and potential output as well as the considerations that would

govern the timing and trajectory of a baseline policy path as well as trigger deviations from such a path –


                                                                                                              16
can enhance the design and effectiveness of baseline policy rules. We will give examples below. But

while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of a policy rule framework if

it is in place, there are reasons to doubt that in practice there are likely to additional material, reliable,

and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least

among major G7 economies and even including a number of emerging economies with flexible exchange

rates and relatively open capital accounts. In such a regime, national monetary policies in each country

are constrained to be set so as to jointly maximize world welfare. In these models, as in the earlier

literature they build on, there are externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to

cooperation. However, as Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (2002) and Engel (2009) illustrate in ‘new Keynesian’

models , and as we review below, to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy

cooperation, policy rates in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation deviations

from target in both the home and the foreign countries. In words, whereas optimal policy in the absence of

cooperation can be implemented with a policy rule that reacts to domestic inflation, output gaps, and the

appropriately defined equilibrium – or neutral – real interest rate , a global welfare increasing policy must

bind central banks to policy rules that react to foreign as well as domestic inflation, policy rules that they

would not chose were they not bound.

        In practice, there could be another problem with policy cooperation in that is absent from most

theoretical discussions.   Simply stated, the problem is the threat to the credibility of the central bank ,

the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy

actions from the public when the policy choices required by cooperation react not only to home inflation

but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target. For example, if home inflation is above target but

foreign inflation is below target, the optimal policy rule under cooperation calls for the home (real)

policy rate to be lower – more accommodative – than it would be in the absence of cooperation (Clarida,

Gali, Gertler (2002)) . In theoretical models , the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be


                                                                                                                 17
perfect and credible, but in practice credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication

and as well the policies actually implemented to push inflation toward – and in the absence of shocks , to

keep inflation at- target. In practice, central banks could have a hard time maintaining credibility as well

as communicating a policy that kept home real interest rates low – or in extreme cases negative - not

because home inflation is too low, but because foreign inflation is too low! Or imagine the opposite case,

with home inflation below target when foreign inflation is above target. In this case, the optimal policy

rule under cooperation calls for the home (real) policy rate to be higher – less accommodative – than it

would be in the absence of cooperation, not because home inflation is too high, but because foreign

inflation is !

         While, perhaps for these reasons , we do not have many confirmed sightings of genuine

monetary policy cooperation , we do perhaps observe rather more examples of as policy coordination. The

CGG (2002) model – which is a generalization of the model of Section III - provides an illustration of the

value of policy coordination in the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium in a symmetric two country model.

We now allow for σ > 1 but set b = ½ so as to focus on the tractable symmetric case. Under these

conditions the Cole Obstfeld result will still hold and trade will be balanced period by period. The log

nominal exchange rate consistent with goods market equilibrium will satisfy

As in the simpler model of Section III, we have a structural equation that decomposes the nominal

exchange rate into a PPP term, a (relative) business cycle term, and a (forward looking) neutral real rate

term. Ceteris paribus, it is again the country specific component of the home neutral real rate that is

reflected in equilibrium nominal exchange rate, with a decline in the neutral rate inducing a depreciation

of the nominal exchange rate.

        In the simple model of Section III, the neutral real rate in each country is solely a function of that

country’s expected rate of productivity growth. However, when there are cross country spillovers, this

will not be the case and instead, the neutral real rate in each country will be in equilibrium be a function

home and foreign productivity growth as well as the home and foreign business cycle factors xt and xFt. To see

this, begin with the equations for flexible price output at home abroad derived in CGG (2002):

which reduce to r*t = Et Δ aFt + Et Δ at and rF*t = Et Δ aFt in the σ = 1 case. Letting t                         yt  ytF denote

the flexible price output differential we have                 (at , xt , xtF ) so that the     flexible price output differential


is in equilibrium a function of relative home productivity – as in the simpler model of Section III – as well

as the home and foreign output gaps. In sum, regardless of how we close the model we must have

          We close the model with an policy rule that is the optimal best response taking the other

country’s output as given. In the ‘home’ country CGG (2002) show that the optimal Nash monetary

policy rule can be written as a forward looking Taylor rule

Under the optimal Nash monetary policies we still have

And so under optimal policy as before πt = (1-βρ + λ2/α)-1ut and πF t = (1-βρ + λ2/α)-1uF t.

         In this more general model, the neutral real interest rate in each country will be a linear function

of home and foreign productivity as well as the cost push shocks, and this will be true even if home and

foreign productivity are independent (see equation block (12)). Thus, even if there is no global component to

productivity there will be in general equilibrium be a global component to the neutral real interest rate because of

the cross country spillovers that arise when σ is not equal to 1.               We illustrate this with a numerical

example. Let σ = 3 and φ = 1 and solve equation block (11 ) for home and foreign flexible price output for

the case in which home productivity is independent of foreign productivity (so that log productivity at

home is equal to at instead of at + aFt in equation block (11)). The solutions are

                         6     1    2     3                      F           6 F 1 F 2         3
(16)              yt      at  xt  atF  xtF       and     y       t        a t  x t  at  x t
                         8     8    8     8                                  8      8     8    8

which imply that relative flexible price output is simply

                                                         1
(17)                                yt  ytF  at  atF  ( xt  xtf )
                                                         2

So from equation (12) we have for these parameters

                    6        1        2        3               6           9           2        3
         rt*  2Et ( at 1  xt 1  atF1  xtF1 )  Et ( a F t 1  x F t 1  at 1  xt 1 )
                    8        8        8        8               8           8           8        8

which simplifies to

                                            10         2        3        1
(18)                                rt*       at 1  atF1  xtF1  xt 1
                                             8         8        8        8

and symmetrically for the foreign country. So in general, even if home and foreign productivity are

uncorrelated, the neutral real rate in each country will be a function of both home and foreign

productivity.

         The best Nash policy in this two country model is a Taylor type rule for setting the policy rate as

a function of expected home inflation and time varying equilibrium home real interest rate which is

function of expected home and foreign productivity growth as well as the expected change in home and

foreign output gaps. Thus, to the extent the foreign central bank has some comparative advantage in

                                                                                                                      21
nowcasting (in the rigorous sense of Giannone, Reichlin, and Small (2008)) or forecasting foreign

productivity growth and business cycle factors , sharing this information or even pooling these nowcasts

with the home central bank could improve its estimate of the home equilibrium real interest rate and thus

the effectiveness of its policy rule in meeting its domestic objectives . While in the simple models of

Section III and IV the global drivers of the r*’s are assumed to be observed and with known values of the

parameters mapping them to neutral policy rates, in practice this is not the case and coordination in such

signal extraction efforts could be very valuable.

        As discussed above, to achieve the theoretical gains from monetary policy cooperation in these

models it no longer suffices for the policymaker to follow an instrument rule based solely on domestic

inflation and the neutral real interest rate. Instead, under cooperation the home central bank must set the

policy rate as a function of home and foreign variables. In its simplest form, this rule can be written as


                         (1   )   1                   1   (1   )   1 
(16)        Rt  r*t  1                E t  t 1                             E t  F t 1
                                   2                   1  2          2    

In sum, not only do the quantitative gains from time inconsistent cooperative monetary policy rules

appear to be modest, but in addition the policy rules required to implement the cooperative outcome

could well be difficult to communicate and to adhere to without sacrificing the credibility of the inflation

target and the policy regime itself.




                                                                                                             22
V. Concluding Remarks

        We have reviewed some simple examples based on rigorous models which can i) generate

monetary policy correlation – via the global factor present in each country’s equilibrium real interest rate;

ii) rationalize the alleged benefits to monetary policy coordination ; but iii) provide some intuition for

why binding monetary policy cooperation is rare in practice if not in academic papers. We have focused

on the global factor in neutral real policy rates and shown how a plausible source of fluctuations in these

rates (productivity growth with a global as well as country specific component) also can trigger

adjustment in the nominal exchange rates. A country specific shock that pushes the expected path of the

home r*t below the foreign r*t requires a depreciation of the home nominal exchange rate to maintain

global equilibrium even with balanced trade. By contrast, a common global shock that depresses home

and foreign neutral real policy rates equally will have no exchange rate implications. While these models

are quite simple and in particular omit important potential additional drivers of neutral real policy rates

– such as asset market imperfections and institutional and individual desires to hold safe assets – they are

rich enough to shed light on the importance of global general equilibrium considerations in accounting

for and inferring shifts in country neutral policy rates. One topic for future research is modeling

medium and long horizon forecastable changes in neutral real policy rates as are estimated by HLW. The

neutral real rates that we solve for in the models of Sections III and IV are the rates consistent with the

stochastic flexible prices equilibrium in these workhorse DSGE models and may be thought of a ‘short

run’ r*’s. In the models of Section III and IV, the unconditional mean of these home and foreign r*’s are

constant and equal. A worthwhile extension beyond the scope of this paper would be to introduce non

stationary dynamics and or segmented trends (Rappoport and Rechlin (1989)) into relative productivity

levels which would allow for a tighter linkage between the HLW econometric methodology and the

theoretical modeling of time variation in r*.
