       Market Structure and Cyclical Fluctuations in U.S. Manufacturing



                                  ABSTRACT




 The relevance of imperfect competition for models of aggregate economic
 fluctuations has received increased attention from researchers in both
 macroeconomics and industrial organization. Measuring properly the size
 of industry markups of price over marginal cost is important both for
 assessing the role of market structure and for determining the extent to
 which excess capacity is a significant feature accompanying imperfect
 competition in American industry. Using a panel data set on four—digit
 Census manufacturing industries, this paper expand8 recent work by
 Robert Hall on the importance of market structure for understanding
 cyclical fluctuations.

 We outline a methodology for estimating industry markups of price over
 cost and the influence of market structure on cyclical movements in
 total factor productivity. While we find evidence to support the
 proposition that price exceeds marginal cost In U.S. manufacturing, our
 results offer only limited support for the notion that markups are
 importantly related to differences in Industry concentration, though the
 effect of unionization is important. Concentration effects are
 important only in industries producing durable goods or differentiated
 con8umer goods. In addition, much of the estimated markup of price over
 marginal cost is accounted for by fixed costs related to overhead labor,
 advertising, and central office expenses; we do not find compelling
 evidence of substantial evidence of excess capacity in most industries.

      The relevance of imperfect competition for models of aggregate

economic fluctuations has received increased attention from researchers

in both macroeconomics and industrial organization.1 In particular,

Rail has focused attention in a series of papers (1986a, 1986b, 1986c,

1986d) on the importance of market structure for understanding cyclical

fluctuations. He shows (1986b) that price substantially exceeds

marginal cost in many (two—digit—level) industries, evidence against the

hypothesis of perfect competition, and that the gap between price and

marginal cost explains the procyclical movements in total factor

productivity long studied in empirical macroeconomics. The excess of

price over marginal cost is reconciled with the observation of low

average profit rates in most industries by asserting the importance of

excess capacity.

      Measuring properly the size of industry markups of price over

marginal cost is important both for assessing the role of market

structure and for determining the extent to which excess capacity is a

significant feature accompanying imperfect competition in American

industry. There is a long tradition in applied industrial organization

of estimating the influence of market structure and industry

characteristics on calculated (usually Census measures of) price—cost

margins (see the reviews of studies in Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen,

1986a, 1986b). In this paper, we present a new method for estimating

the   gap between price arid   marginal cost for various groups of

industries,   and discuss its importance for explaining observed
procyclical   movements in     total   factor productivity. This new   approach

avoids   many of the problems with inferring information about markups of
price over marginal cost from Census price—cost margins, which are

calculated with respect to average variable cost (see the discussion in

Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen, 1986c).

     Our departure from Hall's pioneering effort centers on two areas of

empirical refinement. First, we focus on manufacturing, and make use of

a more disaggregated panel data set of 284 four—digit S.I.C. industries

to consider a richer description of Dotential market structure

influences on cyclical fluctuations stemming from interindustry

variation in concentration, import competition, and unionization.

Second, we take into account the importance of intermediate inputs

("materials") in production. This addition turns out to be important

for assessing the extent of realized industry market power (as measured

by the markup of price over cost). We use these modifications to

evaluate conclusions about the significance of imperfect competition for

cyclical fluctuations.

     The paper is organized as follows. Our methodology for estimating

industry price—cost markups and the influence of market structure on

cyclical movements in total factor productivity (the "Solow residual')

is outlined in section II, We present econometric tests of alternative

explanations of observed procyclical movements in the Solow residual in

section III. In particular, we cast doubt on the "real business cycle"

interpretation——i.e., that procyclical movements in the Solow residual

are consistent with perfect competition in the presence of productivity

disturbances common across industries. While we find evidence to

support the proposition that price exceeds marginal cost in American

manufacturing, our results offer only limited support for the notion

that markups are importantly related to differences in industry
                                           —2


concentration,       though the effect of unionization is quantitatively

important. Concentration effects are important only in industries

producing durable goods or differentiated consumer good8. In section

IV, we attempt to reconcile the price—cost margins calculated in section

II    with the   low average profit rates observed in manufacturing. Much of

the price—cost margin is accounted for by fixed costs related to

overhead labor, advertising, and central office expenses; we do not find

compelling evidence of substantial excess capacity in most industries.

Conclusions and implications are reviewed in section V.




II •    MARKET STRUCTURE AND CfCLICAL P)VEMENTS IN PRODUCTIVITY




Modeling Strategy
       We approach the task of iasurng the relevance of departures of
price from marginal cost      by modifying the framework suggested by Hall.

Consider first a sirn"le production function in which, for the ith

industry    in   period t, output Q   is   produced with constant returns to

scale from capital K and labor L according to



(1)              —
                     A eKjf(Lj/Ki),
where A and y represent a neutral shift in productivity and the rate of
flicks—neutral technical progress, respectively. Let q —

and let £        Ln(L/K). Then, as noted     by Hall, differentiating   with

respect to time and approximating with discrete changes yields
                                                  —3—

                                                       0it

where a —   in A.              Using the definition of marginal cost as the ratio of

the wage to the marginal product of labor, we express the markup of

pr1ce over marginal cost by 11(1—B), where



                           1                     wit

                                        Aie f'(Li/Kj)

That is. B has the interpretation of a price—cost margin (i.e.,

(P—MC)/P). Using this expression, we can rewrite (2) as



                =                       +

Denoting   the labor share by L' we can reexpress (4) as


(5)             —
                      ctL           6t 1                    +

                                                                                    u.
where u is a random error term in productivity, which is assumed to be

uncorrelated with aggregate fluctuations.2 Given this assumption about

the error term, it is the excess of price over marginal cost which gives

rise to a positive estimate of B.

      This estimate of the markup of price over marginal cost is upward

biased because of the exclusion of materials in the calculation of

marginal cost. Only in the (unlikely) case wherein the change in

materials use is uncorrelated with the change in output will estimates

of the margin be unbiased. If, however, materials use changes in strict

proportion to output, the formula governing the relationship between the
                                         —4

ratio of price to marginal cost based on value added i and the true

markup u can be expressed as


                     U
                  1 +    (3J—1),


where      is the ratio of materials cost to the value of output (see also

Hall, 1986b).3 For average materials shares in manufacturing, th

potential mismeasurement of the markup is quite large.

        More generally, of course, production is a function of intermediate

inputs as well——i.e., "materials." We let M denote materials, so

that m     Ln(M/K) and          represents the materials share in the value of

output. It is straightforward to show that

        Using aggregate time—series data and      individual      time—series for

two—digit industries, Hall emphasized that a positfve estimate of B

reflects the idea that the Solow (1957) residual measure of the growth

rate of total factor productivity (the left—hand side of equation (6))

can he explained by the deviation of price from marginal cost (recall

that P/MC      (1_B)l). If we assume for the moment that

and let        depend on a set of market structure characteristics X, so

that

we can rewrite (6) as

Empirical examination of the model in equation (9) involves tests of the

hypotheses that B is nonzero and that B is a function of industry

characteristics reflecting market structure.



Estimating Cyclical Movements in Total Factor Productivity

       To address the obvious simultaneity problem with using Aq on the

right—hand side of (9), we use an instrumental—variables procedure.

Under the assumption of no common element to productivity disturbances

across industries, we can use an aggregate demand variable as an

instrument (so long as no individual industry is large relative to the

economy). We use current and lagged real GNP growth as such

instruments. As a test of robustness, we also use current and lagged

values of the rate of growth of real military purchases and the rate of

growth of the relative price of imports as (arguably) exogenous

aggregate variables. The use of these instruments does not require

assumptions incompatible with the real business cycle view.
                                  —6—


    The omission of individual industry effects not captured by our
current information set can bias coefficient estimates obtained by

OLS. The availability of longitudinal data, however, allows us to

account for unobservable time—invariant industry differences. We

estimate the model using the standard fixed—effects, within—group

estimator. As in Hall (1986b,c), we set 3'    0, in order to allow

direct comparison of results. Estimations over the period from 1958 to

1981 are carried out using the panel data base of 284 four—digit Census

manufacturing industries described in Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen

(1986a, 1986b). The results are in Table I for all industries and for

decompositions by broad categories: (i) industries producing producer

goods versus consumer goods, (ii) durable goods versus nondurable goods,

and (iii) goods produced to order versus goods produced to stock.4 The

two columns report estimation results using the GNP growth instrument

and the military and imports price instruments, respectively.

     Three features of the results presented in Table 1 are particularly

noteworthy. First, under our a8sumption about ujt, the estimatnd value

of the Lerner index ((P—MC)/P) for all industries on average of about

0.36 indicates that price substantially exceeds marginal cost in U.S.

manufacturing. Second, as expected from the inclusion of materials in

variable cost, the estimated price—cost margins are significantly lower

than the value—added markups studied by Hall. Third, there is little

interindustry variation in cyclical movements in productivity (and

implied markups of price over cost) according to the broad categories in

Table   1—producer and consumer goods, durable and nondurable goods, and
goods produced to order and stock. Results obtained under the two sets
                                   —7

of instruments are qualitatively similar; in the work that follows, we

report only those results using the real GNP    growth   instruments.

     To provide information on a more disaggregated level, we pool the

four—digit industry data into two—digit groups. Estimates of equation

(9) maIntaining '' 0 for each two—digit industry group are reported in

Table 2. We use these estimates in summary fashion in Table 3. The

first two columns of Table 3 report the labor and materials shares in

the value of output (tabulations are averages over the 1958—1981

period); there is considerable variation in the data, but in all cases

the materials share is large relative to the labor share. The text two

columns contrast Rail's (1986b) implied estimates of the price—cost

margin5 with estimates using the data described above which include

materials in measuring costs. The last column is presented for purposes

of comparison with calculations from the raw data, and shows the Census

price—cost margin6 exclusive of payments to non—production workers
                                          -



("overhead labor").

     Hall   concluded that there was substantial market power in the

paper, chemicals, primary metals, and transportation equipment

industries. Each of these industries has substantial materials shares

in output. Moreover, comparing the rankings in the third and fourth

columns points up some important differences. For example, none of the

industry groups noted by Hall has an estimated markup of price over

marginal cost greater than that for all industries reported in Table 1.

     Both the findings we present and those of Hall attribute the

procyclical movements in total factor productivity to a significant gap

between industry price and   marginal   cost. Strictly speaking, however,

the empirical results could be explained in a competitive setting given
                                     —8—

specification errors. Hall (1986d) goes through a careful review of

potential biases——most notably through cyclical variation in work

effort, measurement errors in hours, the possibility of increasing

returns to scale, and the possibility of sticky prices——and shows them

to be very small, and often in a direction amplifying our results. We

do not repeat such an analysis here.




UI.    EXPLAHATIONS VOR PROCYCLICAL RHAVIOR OF ThE SOL(I RESIDUAL

Procyclica]. Solow Residuals and Perfect Competition

      The discussion in the previous section indicates some testable

hypotheses regarding links between the markup of price over marginal

cost and the Solow residual. Before proceeding to econometric work,

however, we consider a possible alternative explanation for the observed

procyclical movements in total factor productivity ——   the existence of

aggregate real business cycles.7 A key identifying assumption in our

model and that of Hall is that productivity disturbances across broad

industry groups are uncorrelated.8 An alternative interpretation of the

procyclical movement of the Solow residual is that industries are

characterized by perfect competition (in the sense that price equals

marginal cost), but that productivity disturbances are correlated across

industry groups; that is, there is an aggregate real business cycle in

the economy. Rail dismisses this possibility by assumption. We provide

some evidence on this point below.

      Our approach is a simple one; we consider the correlations in

innovations iii the Solow residual across industries. High positive

correlations would indicate that our identifying assumption about ujt is
                                    —9—

a poor one; that is, "real business cycles" would be important.9

Operationally, we estimate equation (9) for all industries,

setting       0, and calculate the simple correlations of the innovations

across four—digit classifications. We then average the correlations

across two—digit classifications, in order to provide useful summary

statistics.'° The results of this procedure for some selected two—digit

industries are reported" In Tabi 4A.

        Although the averaging of correlations makes a formal test

difficult, it is clear that the estimated correlations are quite small,

and sometimes negative. There is only limited support for the notion of

real business cycle effects; correlations over the post—1973 period are

generally larger than those estimated for the 1958—1973 period,

reflecting the oil shocks during the 1970s.

        Negative correlation is evidence against the productivity—shock

explanation of the cycle, however. Imposing the extremely strong prior

that negative correlations across four—digit classifications must he

spurious leads to the results reported'2 in Table 5A. Even there,

correlations are "large" only for the post—1973 period. We note that

our model accounts only for disembodied tech Ical change. The residuals

used to obtain these correlations still may contain a cyclical component

which should be positively correlated across industries, due the

embodiment of technological change not accounted for in the model; i.e.,

vintage effects could he important, but we still find the correlations

to be small. tn summary the assumption in Hall (1986c) and in the

empirical work below—that movements in productivity growth are not

causal factors explaining the business cycle——is consistent with the

data.
                                 — 10 —



     The correlations reported in Tables 4A and 48 iy be biased

dowiward if, indeed, the real business cycle is reflected in GNP, given

that aggregate output is used as an instrumentable variable in the

regressions. The same sets of correlations are reported in Tables 4B

and 58, based on residuals produced from equation (9) based on the use

of the exogenous military spending and import price variables as

instruments. Although the reported correlations increase slightly over

those reported in Tables 4A and 4B, the increases are very small, and

our qualitative conclusions remain unchanged.



Imperfect Competition and the Price—Cost Margin: Market—Structure Effects

     As noted in section II, the explanation for the observed

procyclical movements in the Solow residual on which we focus our

attention is that price exceeds marginal cost in most industries; that

is, information about price—cost markups can be inferred from estimating

models of the form of equation (9). It is possible to test, then,

whether variation in such estimated markups across groups of industries

reflects differences in market structure. While such differences in

market structure are difficult to define operationally, we consider

three measures—industry concentration (as measured by the four—firm

concentration ratio),'3 import competition, and unionization. Each is

discussed in turn below.

     Theory gives some guidance here as to the expected magnitudes of

the Lerner index of market power as a function of market structure and

industry behavior. For a given industry, a firm's price—cost margin can

be expressed as
                                        — 11 —


            P—MC1            s(1-i$)
                P



where Sj   is   the firm's market share, q        is   its conjectural variation

(the ith firm's guess about the output response of all other firms),

and n is the industry demand elasticity. Some reference points of

interest include the monopoly outcome, PM              —
                                                           1/n,   and the Cournot

outcome, PCM         s./n.

     We    use industry data, and we can derive industry expressfons by

aggregating across firms. For example, if marginal cost were equal to

average variable cost for each firm,        the   monopoly and Cournot outcomes

become PM           1/n and PCM — H/ri, respectively where H is the Herfindahi
index of concentration.14 Using         reasonable      assumptions about demand

elasticities and Herfindahi indices, Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen

(1986c) concluded using Census data that price—cost margins (the

relative markup of price over cost inclusive of the cost of materials)

were much closer to the Cournot predictions than the monopoly

predictions. This finding is consistent with the results in recent

cross—sectional studies by Alberts (1984) and Salinger (1984).

     Employing the same panel data used here, we found in Domowitz,

Hubbard, and Petersen (1986a, 1986b) evidence of only a weak positive

association between concentration and Census price—cost margins. Our

basic data for four—firm concentration ratios (C4) across industries and

over time are taken from the Census of Manufactures. For some

industries, however the concentration measurements reported by the

Census are significantly biased because of inappropriate specification

of product boundaries by the SIC classifications, or for those

industries for which markets are regional instead of national because of
                                   — 12 —



low value—to—weight ratios. We make use of a met culous study by Weiss
and Pascoe (1981), which adjusts concentration ratios for inappropriate

product groupings and geographic fragmentation.

       We report in Table 6 results for estimating the basic model in (9)

for various concentration groupings. The first two rows report margin

estimates according to'5 C4     50 or C4 > 50. The lack of difference in

the two estimates is striking. In the next two rows, we decompose

concentrated industries into producer—goods and consumer—goods

categories. The estimated margin is higher in consumer—goods

industries.'6 It is clear from the estimates in Table 6 that

procyclical movements in the Solow residual do not depend importantly on

domestic industry concentration.

       An obvious qualification to these results is that the measure of

concentration used ignores the role of entry by foreign firms, an

important phenomenon in recent years. Recent studies have isolated

important effects of import competition on price—cost margins (see for

example Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen, 1986a; and the review of

studies in Caves, 1985). We account for the role of import competition

by multiplying the concentration ratio by one minus the imports—to—sales

ratio (Ifs). From equation (8), we allow       to be a function of this

adjusted concentration ratio, so that



(8')            8 +
                       C4j(1—(I/S)j).

Coefficient estimates corresponding to the model in equation (9) are

reported in Table 7 for the broad categories enumerated in Table I.

Concentration differences do not appear to be important for all
                                      — 13 —



industries    on average or for producer—goods industries. Concentration

effect8 are important, though, in consumer—goods industries and in

durable—goods industries. The relative importance of industry

concentration for explainir margins in consumer—goods industries as

opposed to producer—goods industries is consistent with the evidenc. for

Census price—cost margins in Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen (1986a).

The strong    results for durable—goods industries are      of interest, since

these    industries comprise the most cyclical portion      of U.S.

manufacturl ng.

        We also consider the proposition that imperfect competition in the

labor market is important. Several recent studies have found a negative

relationship between unionization and measures of industry

profitability.'7 Specifically, we analyze jointly the effects of

concentration and unionization on the implied margin. That is, we

express the margin in equation (8) as



                     +
(8'')
                         . c4i(1_(r/s)j)   +
                                                  UNION1,


where % UNION     refers   to the percentage of workers unionized in the ith

industry.    To quantify the role of unionism, we use data on the
percentage    of total workers covered by union bargaining agreements

reported for three—digit S.I.C. industries in Freeman and Medoff

(1979).18 Freeman and Medoff point out that no consistent longitudinal

data on unionization exist; we treat the Freentan—Medoff series as a

fixed effect. Results for the categories of industries considered in

Table 7 are presented in Table 8. While there is evidence for a slight

positive effect of concentration on the estimated margin for all
                                        — 14   —




industries   in general, that effect is again most economically important

for consumer—goods industries and durable—goods industries as in Table

7. It is clear from the coefficient estimates that while concentration

Is not generally important in explaining the interindustry variation

in B, unionization is. There are two features of these results. The

results for all industries imply that the estimate of B is reduced by

about   one—third when union coverage equals 100 percent relative to when
it   is zero.19   That is,   unions   are obtaining part of the rents implied
by   the positive markup of price over marginal cast. The most

substantial effect of unions on the estimated margin is found in

durable—goods industries. Second, with respect to cyclical movements in

the Solow residual, these results suggest that "labor hoarding" is less

important in unionized industries (i.e., that layoffs in bad times are

more common).

      The estimates reported in Tables 7 and 8 ignore the Interactive

effect of the industry—specific rate of Hicks—neutral technological

progress on the concentration, import competition, and unionization

measures. In effect, the coefficients on those variables may be

interpreted as embodying the average rate of technical progress in a

random—coefficients model of such a process. An alternative approach is

to assume that the rate of technological change varies among the two—

digit industrial categories, but is identical within two—digit

classifications. As results based on this assumption difFered little

from those in Tables 7 and 8, we do not present them here.

      The clear conclusion of the previous section is that price

substantially exceeds marginal cost in U.S. manufacturing industries,

though markups and the implied procyclical moveimnts in the Solow
                                           — 15 —



residual     are not   significantly     related to differences in industry

concentration.




IV.    IMPLICAflONS     OF    01Gfl INDUSTRY MARKUPS

       tt   is of course, important to reconcile the notion of relatively

high price—cost markups with low average observed profit rates. The

explanation must be the existence of relatively large fixed costs of

production. The identity of these fixed costs is of interest for policy

considerations. If fixed costs are traceable primarily to capital,

considerable "excess capacity" may           exist   in U.S. manufacturing, and

output can be expanded without greatly elevating marginal cost. If the

source of fixed cost is not primarily capital, adding more labor to the

production process will probably reduce the marginal product of labor.

In this case, high price—cost margins may            exist   in equilibrium together

with a rapidly rising marginal cost schedule should firms expand output

much beyond average levels of production.

       To provide a connection between the markups of price over marginal

cost estimated in section III and observed rates of profit (relatve to

sales), we not that



(10)        pQ = wL +         + F +   F' + IT,
                        PMM



where M represents the unit cost of matertals, F and F' represent fixed

costs of capital and other fixed costs, respectively, and ir represents

pure profit.
                                 — 16 —



     Table 9 reports two categories of non—capital fixed costs of

production——plant overhead labor (payments to non—production workers)

and central office expenditures. Central office expenditures consist of

both central office workers and advertising. Defining managerial labor

to be a fixed input and production workers to be a variable input is

likely to lead to an underestimate of the true degree of the fixed labor

cost if there is any labor hoarding. The estimates in the second column

in Table 9 then are probably underestimates of the true degree of fixed

labor costs.

     Comparing the first column of Table 3 with the second column of

Table 9 reveals that for many industries, the managerial component of

labor expenditures is rarly as great as that for production workers.

That is, overhead labor is likely to b' a very important component of

fixed cost. Good examples are industry groups 25 (printing and

publishing) and 38 (instruments and related products), which also have

the highest estimated price—cost margins. It is also apparent that some

industries have significant levels of central office expenditures——For

example, 21 (tobacco products) and 28 (chemicals and allied products).

Average industry capital—output ratios are reported in the fourth column

of Table 9. Given any reasonable assumption about rates of depreciation

and the cost of capital (see for example the estimates in Jorgenson and

Sullivan, 1981), the fixed costs attributable to the sum of plant

overhead labor and central office expenditures are as large as those

attributable to capital for most industry groups.

     An "adjusted margin" is computed in the fifth column by subtracting

the two categories of fixed costs from the price—cost margin estimated

previously. The adiusted margin in most industries is below 0.30, with
                                     — 17



the exceptions being industry groups 21 (tobacco products), 27 (printing

and publishing), 32 (stone, clay, and glass products), and 38

(instruments and related products). It is clear from the last two

columns in the table that average profit rates will be low for most

industries, as expected; exceptions include industry groups 21 (tobacco

products), 27 (printing and publishing), and 38 (instruments and related

products).

     Hall (1986a, 1986b) argues that the joint occurrence of high

margins and low average profit rates is explained by "chronic excess

capacity" in manufacturing industries. Such a situation could be

consistent with equilibrium n an industry where minimum optimal scale

is a large fraction of total industry output.2° However, minimum

efficient scales relative to industry output In U.S. manufacturing are

typically quite small (see for example Scherer, etal., 1975; and

Scherer, 1980), so that It is difficult to imagine       an   Industry

equilibrium with substantial excess capacity for this reason alone.

Moreover, engineering and economic studies have largely concluded that

long—run cost curves at the plant level are much less steep at

suboptImal   plant scales than is suggested by many textbook diagrams
(Schereretal., 1975; Weiss, 1975). Scherer, etal. (1975) calculate
the percentage increase In unit costs in the long run as a consequence
of operating at only one—third of the siz of the minimum efficient
scale,   and find them   generally to he not very   significant.

     While excess capacity in capital does not seem to be of primary

importance here, it would he interesting to consider the possibility of

'excess labor" based on, say, specific—human—capital considerations In

manufacturing industries. If labor were perceived incorrectly In the
                                    — 18 —



data as being entirely variable cost, then measured average variable

cost would exceed marginal cost, providing a partial explanation for the

gap between price—cost markups and observed profit rat's noted by Hall

and for the procyclical movements of Census price—cost margins (which

are defined with respect to average variable cost) noted by Domowitz,

Hubbard, and Petersen (1986a,1986b).




V •   O1KLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS



      Links between the industrial organization of markets and

macroeconomic outcomes are receiving increasing theoretical and

empirical attention. We begin by exploiting the connection researched

by Rail that procyclical movements in productivity are reflective of

imperfect competition in industrial product markets. 8y using highly

disaggregated data on U.S. manufacturing industries, we are able to test

explicitly for the influences on markups of price over margins' cost and

total factor productivity movements over the cycle of such market—

structure variables as industry concentration and the extent of

unionization and foreign competition. Our principal findings were

stated in the introduction.

      Our findings indicate two promising extensions for future

research. First, the relative importance of union effects over measures

of concentration in explaining markups in homogeneous—goods

manufacturing industries points firmly in the direction of an explicit

consideration of cyclical movements in costs in industrfes characterized

by imperfect competition in both labor and product markets. Second, to
                                  — 19   —




the extent that price exceeds marginal cost in many industries, firms
are demand—constrained, so long as marginal cost is constant or not too
steeply   sloped over the relevant range. Further research on the shape

of marginal cost schedules may thus have important implications for

macroeconomics as well as for industrial economics.

Notes

1 See for example the papers by Hart (1982), Mankiw (1985), Akerlof and
  Yellen (1985), Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1985), Hubbard and Weiner
  (1985), and Rotemberg and Saloner (1986a).

2 That is, the phenomenon of "real business cycles," in which industry
  productivity movements are highly correlated (because of coimson rea
 shocks) is ruled out. We return to this point later.

 The magnitude of the overstatement clearly depends on the magnitude
 of w. We find (see Table 1) that A is approximately 0.5 on average,
 and that there is substantial variation across industries) at the
 4—digit level of disaggregation.

 The producer—goods/consumer—goods classification is taken from
 Ornstein (1975). Ornstein's classification is based on the percentage
 of shipments of output for final demand in four categories;
 consumption, investment, materials, and government. If fifty percent
 or more of an industry's output went to consumption, it was cla8sified
 as a consumer goods industry; if fifty percent of more went to
 investment plus materials, it was classified as a producer—goods
 industry. Information for the classification of industries according
  to "produce—to—order" versus "produce—to—stock" was taken from Belsley
  (1969). Durable—goods and nondurable—goods industries were defined as
  follows. Durable goods are assumed to be canital goods——for use
 either by,households or firms. With few exceptions, the set of
 durable—goods industries includes the fo lowing two—digit categories:
 25 (Furniture), 35 (Machinery Except Electrical Machinery), 36
 (Electronic Equipment), 37 (Transportation Equipment), and 38
 (Instruments arid Related Products). Exceptions include the following
 four—digit industries: 3562 (Ball Bearings), 3565 (Industry
 Patterns), 3625 (Carbon and Graphite Products), 3691 (Storage
 Batteries), 3692 (Primary Batteries—Dry and Wet), and 3694 (Engine
 Electrical Equipment).
 Hall estimated the price—cost ratio (P/NC), which is converted to a
 price—cost margin ((P—MC)/P) in Table 1.

6 This version of the Census price—cost margin is defined as

        Value Added—Production Worker Payroll
            Value Added + Cost of Materials
  Another possibility which we do not consider in much detail is that
  important cyclical movements in the labor share exist in the data as a
  result of overtime and that the marginal cost of labor exceeds the
  straight—time wage (see for example Bus, 1985). Overtime hours
  relative to total hours are nontrivial in many manufacturing
  industries (see the summary information below), but the labor share is
  sufficiently small that distortions in the margin are not very
  significant.

    It is, of course, likely that within a two—digit category,
    productivity innovations are correlated across constituent four—digit
    industries.

    The model of Kydland and Prescott (1982) depends on an aggregate pro-
    ductivity disturbance as the driving variable for the cycle. Some
    models employed in the literature on real business cycles (in
    particular that of Long and Plosser, 1983) do, however, produce
    cyclical fluctuations with shocks uncorrelated across sectors.

10 Let the 4—digit indices I and j run over two—digit industries I and
  J, and suppose that there are N four—digit industries in I and M four—
  digit industries in 1 and M four—digit industries in J. Let e
  denote a residual from equation (9) for a four—digit industry I. The
  estimated covariance between industries I and I is

            (l/T)
                         e1
    The   covarlance   between I and J is then

    estimated as (1/MN)


''The industries are textiles (22), lumber (24), chemicals (28),
  petroleum (29), rubber (30), primary metals (33), machinery (35),
  and motor vehicles (37). This list includes basic industries for
  which productivity shocks may be Important, and excludes "secnndary
  industries;" e.g., lumber and wood (24) is included, but furniture
                                 — 22



 and paner are not. Chemicals, petroleum, and rubber require consid-
 eration given the Importance of oil shocks.

'2Negative correlations are simply set to zero in the averaging
  process. Otherwise, the calculations are the same as for Table 5.

'3We do not have data on Herfindahi indices, but they are highly
  positively correlated with the four—firm concentration ratio.

14That is,   H     s .     Time—series data on Herfindahi indices are

  not available. However, all available evidence at the four—digit
  level of disaggregation, including the thorough (though somewhat
  dated) study by Nelson (1963), indicate that H values above 0.35
  are very rare.

15The results were not particularly sensitive to the choice of dividing
  i,oint.

16The concentrated producer—goods industries correspond to
  the trigger—pricing industries examined by Green and Porter (1984) and
  Rotemberg and Saloner (1986b). See the more detailed discussion In
  Dotnowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1986c).

17Several recent studies have found that unions reduce industry price—
  cost margins; see for example Freeman (1983), Salinger (1984), Karier
  (1985), and Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1986b).

8The data are averages from information gathered in 1966, 1970, and
  1972 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Expenditures on Employee
  Compensation Surveys.

'9Th1s compares with estimated reductions in Census price—cost margins
  of 17—23 percent in Freeman (1983) and 25 percent in Domowitz,
  Hubbard, and Petersen (1986b).

2011a11's assertion of thainberlin an competition may well be accurate for
  industries engaged in the production of consumer goods, where product
  differentiation is important. One can Imagine that advertising and
  investment in building "brand loyalty" are the important fixed
  costs. It is harder to make such arguments for industries
  manufacturing homogeneous producer goods.
