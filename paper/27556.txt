We study the problem of learning about the slope of a linear relationship between an outcome
(e.g., quantity) and an input (e.g., price) when the outcome is subject to time-varying, unobserved
economic shocks. We show that restrictions on the absolute magnitude of the economic shocks
are informative for the value of the slope. We argue that such restrictions are reasonable in some
economic situations. We illustrate with an application to the demand and supply of food grains.
We consider extensions including to the case of a nonlinear relationship.

                                                     Abstract

       We study the problem of learning about the slope of a linear relationship between an outcome
       (e.g., quantity) and an input (e.g., price) when the outcome is subject to time-varying, unob-
       served economic shocks. We show that restrictions on the absolute magnitude of the economic
       shocks are informative for the value of the slope. We argue that such restrictions are reasonable
       in some economic situations. We illustrate with an application to the demand and supply of
       food grains. We consider extensions including to the case of a nonlinear relationship.



1      Overview and Contribution
A canonical problem in empirical economics is to learn the slope of some outcome (e.g., quantity
demanded) with respect to some input (e.g., price) in the presence of an unobserved factor (e.g.,
preferences) that may be related to the input. Concretely, say that we observe the outcome qt and
the input pt in each of T  2 consecutive periods t , so the data are {( pt , qt )}tT=1 . We assume that


                                                  qt =  pt + t                                                   (1)

for t an unobserved factor, and that pt = pt +1 for at least one t < T . We wish to learn the value of
the slope     R, which quantifies the effect on the outcome qt of changing the input pt while
holding constant the unobserved factor t . The set  encodes a priori economic restrictions (e.g.,
negativity) on the possible values of  .
   To fix ideas, suppose that qt is the log quantity of a competitively supplied good, pt is its log
price,    = R0 is its elasticity of demand, and t reflects factors such as income, preferences,
and prices of substitutes that determine the quantity demanded at a given price. Figure 1(A) de-
picts a hypothetical dataset with T = 2. As is well known (e.g., Leontief 1929, p. 26; see also
Wright 1915 and Working 1927), any elasticity  ~   can be rationalized with any pair of points
{( p1 , q1 ) , ( p2 , q2 )}, by taking 1 = q1 - ~ p1 and 2 = q2 - ~ p2 . The figure illustrates this con-
struction for three possible elasticities  ,  , and  .
    Any conjectured elasticity   ~   thus implies a particular value of the demand shock 2 - 1 ,
which is the change in the log quantity demanded, at a given price, between periods 1 and 2. Some
values of the demand shock may be economically implausible. For example, in the world market
for grain, the main influences on demand in recent decades have been population and income, and
demand has been relatively income-inelastic (Johnson 1999; Valin et al. 2014). It may therefore
be reasonable to conclude that, at a given price, per-capita demand has changed by no more than a
few percent per year.
   A bound on the size of the shock restricts the possible values of the elasticity. For  the first-
difference operator, let t (·) be the real-valued, data-dependent function that gives the value of
the economic shock in period t implied by a given slope  ,


                                        t ( ) = qt -   pt .


In our hypothetical dataset, the values of   R compatible with the restriction that |2 ( )|  B
for some bound B  0 are given by the interval    ^ (B) = 1 [q2 - B, q2 + B]. As depicted in
                                                                p2
Figure 1(B), each elasticity   ^ (B) defines a line   p2 through the origin that intersects the line
segment connecting ( p2 , q2 - B) to ( p2 , q2 + B).
   It is possible to extend this logic to the case where T > 2. For any D-dimensional vector v and
                                                              1 D    1/k
any k > 1, write the generalized k-mean Mk (v) = D             d =1 vk
                                                                     d   , with M (v) = maxd {vd }, and
                                                         ^ k ( ) = Mk (| ( ) |) denote the k-mean of the
write the absolute value |v| = (|v1 | , ..., |vD |). Let M
absolute value of the vector of shocks  ( ) = (2 ( ) , ..., T ( )). We can then define the set



                                                   2
of slopes
                                   ^ k (B) =   R : M
                                                   ^ k ( )  B                                       (2)

that are compatible with a given bound B on the value of M ^ k ( ).
    Section 2 shows that, when nonempty, the set   ^ k (B) takes the form of a closed interval. For
 ^  (B), where the bound is applied to the maximum absolute shock, and    ^ 2 (B), where the bound
is applied to the root mean squared shock, the limit points of the interval can be expressed in closed
form. In the remaining cases, the limit points are the solutions to a tractable nonlinear equation. In
all cases, under the given restriction on the magnitude of the shocks  ( ), the true slope must lie
in the interval ^ k (B).
   Some bounds B are incompatible with the data in the sense that  ^ k (B)   = 0 / or even ^ k (B) =
/ For example, if T = 2,  = R0 , and  p2 , q2 > 0, then 
0.                                                          ^ k (B)   = 0  / for any k > 1 and any
B < q2 , because  ^ k (B) = ^ (B) = 1 [q2 - B, q2 + B]. If T = 3 and the points {( pt , qt )}T
                                         p2                                                         t =1
do not lie on a single line, ^ k (B) = 0
                                       / for any k > 1 and any sufficiently small B, because M^ k ( ) is
bounded away from zero. More generally, let B k,  = B :          ^ k (B)   = 0 / be the set of bounds
B that are compatible with the data and with . Section 2 shows that B (k, R) is a left-bounded
interval and characterizes its limit point.
   Section 3 applies the characterizations developed in Section 2 to the analysis of the demand
and supply of food grains considered by Roberts and Schlenker (2013a). Roberts and Schlenker
(2013a) estimate log-linear models of demand and supply under maintained exclusion restrictions
and conclude that both are price-inelastic. We maintain log-linearity but do not impose exclusion
restrictions. Instead we consider bounds on the size of demand and supply shocks motivated by
prior evidence on the origins of these shocks during the sample period. These bounds are infor-
mative, implying that demand and supply are price-inelastic. The implied upper bounds on the
absolute elasticities are close in magnitude to Roberts and Schlenker's point estimates (2013a). We
also calculate the minimum size of demand and supply shocks necessary to rationalize the data.
Finally, we show that the upper bounds we obtain on the absolute elasticities imply an informative
lower bound for a function of the elasticities that Roberts and Schlenker (2013a) estimate.
   Section 4 discusses extensions. In the cases where qt = q ( pt ) + t for some possibly nonlin-
ear function q (·), or qt = q ( pt , t ) for some possibly nonseparable function q (·), we show how
to bound the value of the average elasticity between any two periods. The resulting bounds are
informative in the setting of Roberts and Schlenker (2013a).
   The main contribution of this paper is to show that economically motivated bounds on the

                                                   3
magnitude of unobserved shocks can be useful in learning about a structural slope parameter. Re-
strictions on the distribution of unobserved variables are central to many canonical approaches to
identification (see, e.g., Matzkin 2007; Tamer 2010). A leading approach is to restrict the rela-
tionship between the unobserved shock and some other variable. An example (and the approach
taken by Roberts and Schlenker 2013a) is the widely employed exclusion restriction that the un-
observed shock is independent of or uncorrelated with an observed instrument. Another example
is the assumption that demand and supply shocks are independent of or uncorrelated with one an-
other, studied in Leamer (1981) and developed by Feenstra (1994), Feenstra and Weinstein (2017),
MacKay and Miller (2019), and others.1 Our approach does not directly restrict the relationship of
the unobserved shocks to observed variables or to one another. Section 4 discusses the relationship
of such restrictions to those we consider.
    Although many approaches to identification employ restrictions on the distribution of unob-
servables, some employ restrictions on the realized values of unobservables, as we do here. Such
restrictions can be especially appropriate in time-series settings where the researcher may have
prior knowledge of the factors influencing the outcome during the sample period. In the structural
vector autoregression setting, Antolín-Díaz and Rubio-Ramírez (2018) consider restrictions on the
relative importance of a given shock in explaining the change in a given observed variable during
a given time period (or periods). Ludvigson et al. (2020) consider inequality constraints on the ab-
solute magnitude of shocks during a given period (or periods), as well as inequality constraints on
the correlation between a shock and an observed variable. In the demand estimation setting, Mullin
and Snyder (forthcoming) obtain bounds on the elasticity of demand in a reference period under the
assumption that demand is growing over time.2 None of these sets of restrictions coincides with
those we consider here.
   1 See  also Leontief (1929). Morgan (1990, Chapter 6) quotes a 1913 thesis by Lenoir which discusses how the
relative variability of demand and supply shocks influences the correct interpretation of data on market quantities
and prices. Leamer (1981) also imposes that the demand (supply) elasticity is negative (positive). A large literature
(reviewed, for example, in Uhlig 2017) develops the implications of sign restrictions in a variety of settings.
    2 In our leading example of log-linear demand, this corresponds to the assumption that  > 0 for all t . Mullin and
                                                                                              t
Snyder (forthcoming) consider a variety of forms for demand in the reference period, including linear demand, demand
known up to a scalar parameter, and concave demand.

2     Characterization of Sets of Interest
We begin with the case of k = , in which we bound the maximum absolute value of the shock. In
this case the sets of interest take a particularly simple form.

Proposition 1. Let

                                                                qt   B
                                        (B) = max                  -
                                                  {t : pt =0}    pt | pt |
                                                                qt   B
                                        (B) =       min            +
                                                  {t : pt =0}    pt | pt |

        ~  0 be the unique solution to   B
and let B                                     ~ .
                                         ~ =  B
    Then B (, R) = [B , ) for B = max max{t : pt =0} {|qt |} , B
                                                               ~ , and for any B  B (, R)


                                          ^  (B) =   (B) ,   (B) .
                                          


    All proofs are given in Appendix A. The objects B ,   (B), and   (B) defined in Proposition
1 can be readily calculated on datasets of reasonable size.3
   We next consider the case of k  (1, ). Here we make use of the following properties of the
         ^ k ( ):
function M

Lemma 1. For k  (1, ), the function M ^ k ( ) is strictly decreasing on -, k and strictly in-
creasing on k ,  for k = arg min M^ k ( ) .

   Lemma 1 implies that M  ^ k ( ) has a "bowl" shape, first decreasing to a unique global minimum
and then increasing. The following characterization of   ^ k (B) is then immediate.

Proposition 2. For k  (1, ), the set B (k, R) is equal to [Bk , ) for Bk = min M
                                                                               ^ k ( ). Moreover,
for any B  B (k, R) we have that

                                            ^ k (B) =  k (B),  k (B)
                                            

                                               ^ k ( ) = B, with 
where  k (B),  k (B) are the only solutions to M                 k = k (Bk ) =  k (Bk ).

    Proposition 2 shows that B (k, R) is a left-bounded interval whose limit point Bk can be calcu-
lated by minimizing the function M^ k ( ). By Lemma 1, M  ^ k ( ) strictly increases as  departs from
    3 The objects 
                   (B) and   (B) also appear in the analysis of the linear regression model with uniformly distributed
errors (Robbins and Zhang 1986).

                                                           5
k , which simplifies computation. The limit point Bk has a direct economic interpretation as the

minimum size of shocks necessary to rationalize the data.
   Proposition 2 further shows that ^ k (B) is a closed interval whose limit points can be calculated
                                  ^ k ( ) = B. By Lemma 1, on either side of 
by solving the nonlinear equation M                                          k and for B > Bk the
equation is strictly monotone and has a unique solution, which simplifies computation. The sets
characterized in Propositions 1 and 2 are related by the fact that ^  (B)  ^ k (B) for any B  0 and
k  (1, ).
    In the special case of k = 2, in which we bound the root mean squared shock, the equation
^ 2 ( ) = B is quadratic, and so the objects B2 ,  2 (B),  2 (B), and 
M                                                                     2 defined in Proposition 2 are
available in closed form. For any D-dimensional vector v  RD , let v = (v2 , ..., vD )  RD-1 .
For any v, w  RD , let s
                       ^vw = M1 (v  w), where  is the elementwise product.

Corollary 1. For k = 2 we have that

3     Application to Demand and Supply of Food Grains
Roberts and Schlenker (2013a) estimate the elasticities of demand and supply of staple grains
using annual data from 1960 through 2007. Roberts and Schlenker (2013a, equations 1 and 3)
assume that demand and supply curves take a log-linear form consistent with equation (1). Roberts
and Schlenker (2013a) adopt an instrumental variables approach, using contemporaneous yield
shocks as excluded instruments for price in the demand equation, and past yield shocks as excluded

                                                    6
instruments for price in the supply equation. Here we explore the information about parameters of
interest that can be obtained from bounds on the size of realized shocks, without imposing exclusion
restrictions.
    Our analysis relies on the code and data from Roberts and Schlenker (2013b), supplemented
with data from the World Bank (2019a, 2019b) on annual world population and GDP. For the
                                                 T
demand equation, the data            ptD , qtD   t =1
                                                        consist of the log ptD of the average current-month futures
price of grains delivered in year t , measured in 2010 US dollars per calorie, and the log quantity qtD
of grains consumed in the world in year t , measured in calories per capita. For the supply equation,
                         T
the data     ptS , qtS   t =1
                                consist of the log ptS of the average one-year-ahead futures price of grains
delivered in year t , measured in 2010 US dollars per calorie, and the log quantity qtS of grains
produced in the world in year t , measured in calories per capita.4 We compute world GDP per
capita yt in 2010 US dollars by deflating nominal GDP per capita by the CPI provided by Roberts
and Schlenker (2013b).
    We consider bounds on the size of demand shocks that are motivated by economic features of
the demand for food grain during the sample period. The major determinants of world demand
for grain in the modern period are population and income (Johnson 1999; Valin et al. 2014).
Because we measure demand on a per capita basis, and because demand for grain is relatively
income-inelastic (Johnson 1999; Valin et al. 2014), we expect relatively small annual shocks to
the demand for grain. For example, forecasts summarized in Valin et al. (2014, Table 3) imply
an income elasticity of world food crop demand ranging from 0.09 to 0.37.5 Given the evolution
of annual log world GDP per capita yt over the study period, an income elasticity of demand of
0.37 implies that the income-driven shock to log per-capita demand has maximum absolute value
M (|0.37y|)  0.05 and root mean square value M2 (|0.37y|)  0.02. Allowing for some non-
income-driven shocks of similar magnitude, we consider bounds BD on demand shocks in [0, 0.10]
for k =  and in [0, 0.04] for k = 2.
    These bounds are context-specific. Larger bounds might be appropriate in historical periods
with more income-elastic food demand (see, e.g., Logan 2006) or in periods that include major
shocks such as world wars or global pandemics. The bounds are also a priori in the sense that they
incorporate information that is not contained in the time-series data that we analyze. For example,
   4 We  use the definitions of price and total calories from Roberts and Schlenker (2013a, Table 1, Column 2c), and
divide total calories by world population to obtain calories per capita.
   5 The models summarized in Valin et al. (2014, Table 3) imply that an increase from $6,700 to $16,000 in world GDP

over the period 2005-2050 will cause an increase in per capita food demand of between 8 and 38 percent. The implied
income elasticities therefore range from ln (1.08) / ln (16000/6700)  0.088 to ln (1.38) / ln (16000/6700)  0.370.


                                                               7
estimates of the income elasticity of food demand can be informed by comparisons across countries
at a point in time.6 We consider smaller values of BD in the case of k = 2 than in the case of k = ,
consistent with the facts that M2 (|0.37y|) < M (|0.37y|) and that    ^  (B)    ^ 2 (B) for any B  0.
      Figure 2 depicts the implications of the contemplated bounds BD for the elasticity of demand
 D  D = R0 . The first column of plots considers bounds BD on the maximum value of the
shock (k = ), and the second column of plots considers bounds BD on the root mean squared shock
                                                                                                                     T
(k = 2). In each column, the first row of plots depicts a scatterplot of the data                        ptD , qtD   t =2
along with the demand functions consistent with a particular value of BD . The second row of plots
depicts the interval ^ k BD  D associated with each BD in a given interval.
    The first row of plots in Figure 2 shows that demand functions take the form of lines through
                                                                  ^ k  D  BD and  D  0 if and
the origin. A demand function is consistent with the restrictions M
only if its slope  D is in ^ k BD  D . A demand function with slope  D passes through the points
                     T
      pt ,  D  pt    t =2
                          .   For any t , the set of points        ptD ,  D  ptD    D ^ k (BD )   defines a vertical line
segment that is depicted (with a solid line) on the plot. For k = , the line segment is contained in
the segment          ptD , qtD + b      b[-BD ,BD ]
                                                      , which is also depicted (with a dotted line) for reference.
      The second row of plots in Figure 2 shows that the bounds we contemplate are informative. Any
of the contemplated bounds implies that demand is inelastic,  D < 1. Imposing an exclusion re-
striction, Roberts and Schlenker (2013a, Table 1, Column 2c) estimate that the elasticity of demand
is ^ D = -0.066 with a confidence interval of [-0.107, -0.025], also depicted in the plot. A bound
      RS
of   BD    = 0.07 on the maximum shock implies an elasticity not below -0.122. The same bound on
the elasticity arises from a bound of BD = 0.030 on the root mean squared shock. Appendix Figure
1 depicts the corresponding bound for other values of k, as well as (for reference) Mk (|0.37y|).
      The second row of plots in Figure 2 also illustrates the interpretation of the set B k, D . The
plots report that under any elasticity of demand the data require that the maximum absolute shock
be at least 0.038 and the root mean square shock be at least 0.017. These conclusions rely only on
equation (1) and the sign restriction that  D  0, and may be of direct economic interest.
      We can also consider bounds on the size of supply shocks. A major source of shocks to the
world supply of grain is variation in agricultural yields due to the weather (Roberts and Schlenker
     6 Muhammad  et al. (2011) estimate a model of food demand using country-level data from 2005. Alexandratos
and Bruinsma (2012, pp. 56-57) use cross-country variation to determine the relationship between calorie demand and
per-capita expenditure in 2005/2007. Several of the models summarized in Valin et al. (2014, p. 56) use the studies
by Muhammad et al. (2011) and Alexandratos and Bruinsma (2012) as source information on the income elasticity of
demand for food.

2013a). Roberts and Schlenker (2013a) construct an annual measure of yield shocks.7 The maxi-
mum absolute value of the yield shock over the sample period is 0.057, and the root mean square
value of the yield shock is 0.024. Allowing for shocks that do not act through yield (e.g., changes
in growing area), we consider bounds BS on supply shocks in [0, 0.20] for k =  and in [0, 0.06] for
k = 2.
    Figure 3 depicts the implications of the contemplated bounds BS for the elasticity of supply
 S  S = R0 . The structure parallels that of Figure 2. The contemplated bounds are again
informative. All of the contemplated bounds imply that supply is inelastic,  S < 1. Roberts and
Schlenker (2013a, Table 1, Column 2c) estimate that the elasticity of supply is ^ S = 0.097 with
                                                                                                RS
a confidence interval of [0.060, 0.134], also depicted in the plot. A bound of                 BS =     0.12 on the
maximum shock implies a supply elasticity of at most 0.130. The same bound on the elasticity
arises from a bound of BS = 0.043 on the root mean squared shock. A maximum absolute shock of
at least 0.096 and a root mean square shock of at least 0.041 are necessary to rationalize the data.
                                                                                                   -1
    Roberts and Schlenker (2013a) devote attention to the "multiplier"                D +S              , which gov-
erns the effect on equilibrium prices of an exogenous change in quantity. Roberts and Schlenker
(2013a) conclude that the estimated multiplier is economically substantial. We can determine the
                                                                                                                        -1 8
implications of bounds BD , BS for any known function   D ,  S , such as   D ,  S =  D +  S                               ,
by forming the set

               ^ k BD , BS =   D ,  S :  D  
                                            ^ k B D  D ,  S  ^ k BS  S .


Appendix Figure 2 shows that the bounds we contemplate are informative in that they imply a large
multiplier. Roberts and Schlenker (2013a, Table 1, Column 2c) estimate that the multiplier has
a value of 6.31 with a confidence interval of [4.6, 9.1]. A bound of BD = 0.07 on the maximum
demand shock coupled with a bound of BS = 0.12 on the maximum supply shock implies a lower
bound on the multiplier of 3.97.
   7 We  use the definition of the yield shock underlying Roberts and Schlenker's (2013a) Table 1, Column 2c.
   8 Another                                                                 -1
               prominent example is the function   D ,  S =  S  D +  S           , which determines how the incidence
of a tax is shared between consumers and producers (see, e.g., Weyl and Fabinger 2013).

4    Discussion and Extensions
Nonlinear relationship to the input. Our analysis focuses on a linear relationship between the
output and the input, as assumed by Roberts and Schlenker (2013a) in our main application. In
some settings we may be interested in nonlinear relationships of the form


                                            qt = q ( pt ) + t                                     (3)


for q (·) some unknown function. For any two periods s < t we can write


                                   qt - qs = s,t ( pt - ps ) + t - s


where
                                                  q ( pt ) - q ( ps )
                                         s,t =
                                                       pt - ps
when pt = ps and s,t is defined arbitrarily otherwise. Thus if pt = ps then s,t describes the average
slope of q (·) between ps and pt , and if q (·) is everywhere differentiable then by the mean value
theorem q (c) = s,t for some c strictly between ps and pt .
    It is immediate that

                                             qt - qs      B       qt - qs     B
                {s,t  R : |t - s |  B} =             -          ,         +                       (4)
                                             pt - ps | pt - ps | pt - ps | pt - ps |

whenever ps = pt . The set given in equation (4) has the same structure as the interval ^ (B) in the
linear case with T = 2.
    Appendix Figure 3 depicts the set given in equation (4) (intersected with the relevant sign
restrictions) for pairs (t - 1, t ) and for reference values of B in our application to Roberts and
Schlenker (2013a). In 80 percent of years t the analysis implies that demand is inelastic between
years t - 1 and t in the sense that t -1,t < 1. In 39 percent of years t the analysis implies that
supply is inelastic between years t - 1 and t .
    We may also be interested in a summary of the average slopes such as the mean  = M1 
of the average slopes  = (1,2 , ..., T -1,T ) between adjacent periods. We can write that


                                qt =   pt + t -1,t -   pt + t .




                                                     10
By the Minkowski inequality we have that


                      Mk         -    p +                    Mk           -   p              + Mk (| |) .


Therefore if we are prepared to impose a bound Mk                           -   p               V on the deviation of the
average slopes from  and a bound Mk (| |)  B on the size of the shocks, then we can say that
the set of possible values of  is contained in ^ k (B + V ).
    Lastly, we may wish to restrict the form of q (·). Appendix Figure (4) depicts bounds on the
average slopes t -1,t between adjacent periods in our application to Roberts and Schlenker (2013a)
under the assumption that q (·) is polynomial of known degree and under reference bounds on the
maximum shock M   ^  (| |). Even allowing for a sixth-degree polynomial, in many periods the
bounds depicted in Appendix Figure 4 are meaningfully tighter than those depicted in Appendix
Figure 3.
    Nonseparable relationship to a possibly nonscalar unobserved factor. A further relaxation of
our model can be written as
                                                         qt = q
                                                              ~ ( pt , t )                                                       (5)

where t may now be non-scalar or even infinite-dimensional. The model in equation (5) can
accommodate any functional relationship between qt and pt , including relationships that depend
on the time period t .9
    For any two periods s < t we can now write


                                           qt - qs = ~s,t ( pt - ps ) + ~t ,t - ~t ,s


where
                                                       ~ ( pt , s ) - q
                                                ~s,t = q              ~ ( ps , s )
                                                
                                                                pt - ps
when pt = ps and ~s,t is defined arbitrarily otherwise, and where


                                            ~t ,t - 
                                                            ~ ( pt , t ) - q
                                                    ~t ,s = q              ~ ( pt , s ) .


Thus if pt = ps then ~s,t describes the average slope of q
                                                         ~ (·, s ) between ps and pt , fixing the
   9 Fixing    any such relationship qt = q                                                                          ~ (·, ·) so that
                                               ~t ( pt , t ) for t an unobserved factor, let t = (t , t ) and define q
~ ( pt , t ) = q
q              ~t ( pt , t ) for all t and t .



                                                                11
unobserved factor at s . The difference ~t ,t - ~t ,s describes the effect on the output of changing the
unobserved factor from s to t , fixing the input at pt .
    If we are prepared to bound |~t ,t - ~t ,s | above by some amount B, then the resulting bounds on
~s,t follow an analogous structure to the set in equation (4). In the context of our application to

Roberts and Schlenker (2013a), this means that the intervals depicted in Appendix Figure 3 can be
interpreted as showing the bounds on ~s,t implied by reference bounds B on the changes in quantity
demanded or quantity supplied at given prices pt between periods t - 1 and t .

                                              |M1 ( ( )  z)|  C                                                   (6)


where C  0 is a scalar. An orthogonality restriction is such a restriction that takes C = 0.11
    Restrictions of the form in (6) are related to those we consider in the sense that, from the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the fact that z is standardized,


                                    (M1 ( ( )  z))2  (M2 ( ( )))2 .


Hence M2 ( ( )) = M   ^ 2 ( )  B implies that |M1 ( ( )  z)|  B.
   As a further connection, recall that k = arg min M
                                                    ^ k ( ) for k  (1, ). By Lemma 1, k is the
unique solution to
                                       1 T
                                                t ( ) |t ( )|k-2  pt = 0.                                         (7)
                                     T - 1 t =2
Observe that for k = 2 and  pt standardized, equation (7) is equivalent to an orthogonality restric-
tion with zt =  pt .
    Connection to cross-equation restrictions. Let tD  D = qtD -  D  ptD and tS  S =
qtS -  S  ptS , and assume in the spirit of static competitive equilibrium that qtD = qtS = qt and

                                                         ~ - M1 (z
                                 ~t we can take zt = M2 (z
                 with a variable z                                         ~t - (t - 1) M1 (z
                                                                                            ~)), for J a conformable
vector of ones.
   11 When C = 0, the inequality in (6) implies that  = M (q  z) /M ( p  z) when this ratio--the linear
                                                               1              1
instrumental-variables estimator--is well-defined. In practice restrictions of this form are more often applied to the
distribution of unobserved shocks than to their realization.




                                                         12
 ptD =  ptS =  pt .12 Then


            D ,  S : Mk  D  D              BD , Mk        S  S           BS = ^ k BD × ^ k BS .


Intuitively, because any pair  D ,  S   ^ k BD ×  ^ k BS is consistent with the data, and the data
are consistent with equilibrium, any pair  D ,  S     ^ k BD ×  ^ k BS must also be consistent
with equilibrium. In this sense there is no further information about  D to be obtained by placing a
bound BS on the size of the shocks  S  S , and vice versa.
    The situation is different if we are prepared to restrict the relationship between the shocks
tD  D and the shocks tS  S . For example, in the context of the world market for food
grain, we may be prepared to assume that the major source of demand shocks (say, income) is not
strongly related to the major source of supply shocks (say, weather). For illustration, suppose that
M1 (q) = M1 ( p) = 0 and take the restriction that


                                       M1  D  D   S  S                        R.                                   (8)


If R = 0 then                                                                      
                                                                             2

                                                                                     s
                              D -          S -                                   - 1

which is analogous to Leamer (1981, equation 6). If  S  0 and  D  0, then, again following
Leamer (1981), if 2 < 0, then  D  2 , and if 2 > 0, then  S  2 .
   Interpretation of bounds on slope under tight bounds on shocks. Our approach assumes that the
bound B holds, M^ k ( )  B, but not that it is tight, M
                                                      ^ k ( ) = B. Tightness seems unlikely to arise
in practice, but it can nevertheless be instructive to note how the sets we characterize behave under
tightness.

Corollary 2. If M (| ( )|) = B, and in particular there are s, t such that  ps ,  pt = 0, s =
B sgn (- ps ), and t = B sgn ( pt ), then ^  (B) = 1.
    If Mk (| ( )|) = B for some k  (1, ), then either  k (B) =  or  k (B) =  , or both if B = Bk .

These properties follow directly from the definitions in Propositions 1 and 2.
  12 In our application, the quantity supplied and quantity demanded need not be equal at a point in time (and likewise
for the supply price and the demand price) because grain can be stored and planting decisions are made in advance
(Roberts and Schlenker 2013a).



                                                         13
    No variation in the input. We have assumed throughout that pt = pt +1 for some t < T . If this
fails, any bound that is compatible with the data is uninformative. More precisely, if  p = 0, then
 ^ k (B) = R if Mk (|q|)  B and            / otherwise. Thus in this case B (k, R) = [Mk (|q|) , ).
                                 ^ k (B) = 0



5     Conclusions
We show that a priori bounds on the size of economic shocks can imply a restriction on a slope pa-
rameter in an economic model. In an application to the demand and supply of food grain, we show
that economically motivated bounds on the size of shocks imply informative bounds on parameters
of interest.

A     Proofs of Results Stated in the Text

Proof of Proposition 1
We have that


                                   ^  ( ) =
                                   M             max (|qt -   pt |) .
                                              t {2,...,T }

          ^  ( )  B if and only if
Therefore M

for all t . For a given t , if  pt = 0 this condition is equivalent to


                                              qt  [-B, B] ,


whereas if  pt = 0 it is equivalent to

                                          qt   B qt       B
                                             -      ,   +       .
                                           pt | pt |  pt | pt |

Therefore if B < |qt | for some t with  pt = 0 then ^  (B) = 0.
                                                             / So take B  max{t : pt =0} |qt |.
Let

                                                             qt   B
                                    (B) = max                   -
                                             {t : pt =0}      pt | pt |
                                                             qt   B
                                    (B) =       min             +       .
                                             {t : pt =0}      pt | pt |

If   (B) >   (B) then ^  (B) = 0;
                               / otherwise ^  (B) =   (B) ,   (B) . Notice that   (B) is
continuous and strictly decreasing in B with limB   (B) = - and that   (B) is continuous
and strictly increasing in B with limB   (B) = . Notice further that

                                                                 qt
                                          (0) = max

                                                                 qt
                                          (0) =       min
                                                   {t : pt =0}    pt



                                                      20

and therefore that   (0)    (0). Therefore there is a unique solution B              ~ .
                                                                                ~ =  B
The proposition then follows immediately.


Proof of Lemma 1
                                                                         ^ k ( ):
We proceed by establishing several elementary properties of the function M

                                                                           1/k
                                                   1 T
                              ^ k ( ) =
                              M                            |qt -   pt |k
                                                 T - 1 t=2


for k  (1, ).
              ^ k ( ) is continuous in  for all   R.
Property (i). M
    This property follows because M   ^ k ( ) is a composite of continuous elementary operations.
                     ^ k ( ) = lim  M
Property (ii). lim - M              ^ k ( ) = .
     Observe that for t such that  pt = 0,


                           lim |qt -   pt |k = lim |qt -   pt |k = 
                           -                             


     whereas for t such that  pt = 0,


                       lim |qt -   pt |k = lim |qt -   pt |k = |qt |k .
                       -                              


     The property then follows immediately because limx x1/k =  for k > 0, and by assumption
     pt = 0 for some t  {2, ..., T }.
                ^ k ( ) k is strictly convex in  on R.
Property (iii). M
     We have that
                                         k           1 T
                               ^ k ( )
                               M             =               |qt -   pt |k .
                                                   T - 1 t=2

     If  pt = 0 then the function |qt -   pt |k is trivially weakly convex in  . Therefore it suffices
     to show that if  pt = 0 then the function |qt -   pt |k is strictly convex in  . But this follows
     from the strict convexity of |x|k in x on R for k > 1, because if f (x) is strictly convex in x then
    so is f (ax + b) for a = 0.
Property (iv). There is k  R such that k = arg min M

                                                                                                ^ k ( ).

     By property (iii), there are at most two solutions to (c )k = M^ k ( ) k . Hence there are exactly
     two solutions to c = M   ^ k ( ); denote these  (c ) ,  (c ), with  (c ) <  (c ). Because the
     interval  (c ) ,  (c ) is compact, by properties (i) and (iii), M   ^ k ( ) k has a minimum on
       (c ) ,  (c ) at some unique  k on the interior of  (c ) ,  (c ) . But also by property (iii),
      M^ k ( ) k > M^k  k k for any      /  (c ) ,  (c ) , establishing that k = arg min M^ k ( ) k
     and hence   k = arg min M ^ k ( ) .

Property (v). M         ^ k ( ) for any  <  < k and M

     This is an immediate consequence of property (iii), applying the strict monotonicity of xk on
     R0 for k  (1, ).


Proof of Proposition 2
This follows immediately from Lemma 1.


Proof of Corollary 1
We have that
                                                                            1/2

                             M                       (qt -   pt )2                .
                                          T - 1 t =2

By Lemma 1, M^ 2 ( ) has a unique global minimizer    2 . Because M^ 2 ( ) is differentiable, the
minimizer 2 must satisfy the first-order condition d M
                                                     ^ 2 ( ) |  = 0, which is equivalent to the
                                                        d                  =2

and therefore
                                                    ^qp

Observe that, by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, this expression is real-valued.

Observe that these roots are real-valued whenever B  B2 , thus completing the proof.


Proof of Corollary 2
For the first part, observe that by the definition of   (B) and   (B) in Proposition 1, it follows
that

                                           sgn ( pt ) t + B              sgn ( pt ) t - B
           (B) -   (B) =       min                          - max                         .
                             {t : pt =0}        | pt |       {t : pt =0}      | pt |

If s = B sgn (- ps ) for some s such that  ps = 0, then the first term is equal to zero. If t =
B sgn ( pt ) for some t such that  pt = 0, then the second term is equal to zero. But then   (B) -
  (B) = 0 and hence     ^  (B) is a singleton as desired.
     For the second part, the desired conclusion follows from the fact that  k (B) ,  k (B) are the
                               ^ k ( ) = B and that these solutions coincide when B = Bk .

Notes: Panels A and B illustrate, respectively, the bounds on the average elasticity of demand and supply
of grain between adjacent years in the application of Roberts and Schlenker (2013a). The depicted bounds
intersect those in equation (4) with the relevant sign restriction for each elasticity. We use BD = 0.07 and
BS = 0.12 as the bounds on the absolute value of shocks to demand and supply, respectively. Each line
segment represents the interval of possible average elasticities between the given year and the preceding year,
with an arrow indicating that the interval contains elasticities greater than one, and a crosshatch indicating
the value of qt / pt when contained in the plotted range.

Notes: Panels A and B illustrate, respectively, the bounds on the average elasticity of demand and supply
of grain between adjacent years in the application of Roberts and Schlenker (2013a). We use BD = 0.07
and BS = 0.12 as the bounds on the maximum absolute value of shocks to demand and supply, respectively.
We assume that the function q (·) defined in equation (3) is a polynomial of known degree whose derivative
is nonnegative (Panel A) or nonpositive (Panel B) everywhere on the closed interval from the lowest to the
highest observed price. Each line segment represents the interval of possible average elasticities between
the given year and the preceding year under the given polynomial degree (from one to six), with an arrow
indicating that the interval includes absolute elasticities greater than one.
