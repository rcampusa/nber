     ADJUSTMENT AND STRUCTURAL CHANGE UNDER SUPPLY SHOCKS

                           ABSTRACT


    The resource boom effect and the input price effect of

raw material price changes are analyzed within a two—period,

two-sector (plus resource industry), open economy framework.
Diagrammatic exposition is used to study the 'dutch disease',
and in particular the distinction between the short term wealth
effects (causing a real appreciation and a movement of variable
factors from tradable to non—tradable industries) and between

the long—run effects on total investment, its sectoral allocation
and its finance by foreign borrowing. The framework further
enables analysis of the different allocational effects of tem-
porary versus permanent raw material price increases, when the
two sectors differ in material use. Also discussed are the
effects of changes in the world interest rate on factor allocation
and foreign borrowing as well as the allocational effects of
government intervention in the case of temporary real wage

rigidity.

                      UNDER SUPPLY SHOCKS


I ntroduction*

     Macro—economic adjustment and long—term structural changes are

often closely related, yet they are usually kept in separate analy-
tical boxes. Nowhere is the inadequacy of such dichotomy more ap-
parent than in the understanding of the developments and policy
response of individual countries after the supply shocks of the 1970s.

Raw materials price increases played a major role in the ensuing
stagflation, which could be perceived as a short—term macro—economic
adjustment problem. However, as time progressed it became more
and more clear that the longer run implications of these shocks
on productivity and profitability are at least as important.
     There are two different aspects of raw material price effects
which have been discussed under separate headings. One is the
resource boom effect (see, for example, Corden and Neary (1980)).
If a country is a net exporter of a raw material whose price has
increased, there will be a short run increase in the relative price

of non—tradable goods (or a real appreciation) and a shift in var-

iable factors out of existing tradable goods such as manufacturing,
say, and into services. Relative profitability will further affect

today's investment and therefore future production and capital
in place in the various sectors. It is important to stress,
however, that this is only one example of a pure wealth effect,
which could also take place when an oil discovery is announced

or, in a completely different context, when a country receives
an unexpected foreign currency transfer (much like the old

"transfer problem"). The analysis of this type of problem is
best conceived in a framework in which international capital
mobility is allowed for, because a wealth change will affect the

country 's borrowing.
     Another, probably more important, aspect is that of the role
of raw materials as a major input into the productive system. This
may hit both net importers as well as net exporters of such material
and would tend to shift resources away from a raw material intensive

activity into    less-intensive ones. This, too, might cause "de-
industrialization" but for a different reason. In this context,
it is important to make the distinction between temporary and per-
manent change in raw material prices. The former may have wealth
effects but need not cause long—run changes in relative prices.

It is mainly the latter that will affect investment behavior.
     The present paper extends an earlier factor—price—frontier
analysis of mine (1981) to a two-sector framework (sections I and II)
It then analyzes the above issues in a two—period dynamic framework

which is a stripped down version of a model that was previously

used for simulation experiments (Sachs (1980), Bruno and Sachs (l981)).l

  Louis Dicks-Mireaux is presently applying a similar framework for
the U.K.

     After laying out the ingredients of the model in terms of pro-

duction (II), household behaviour (III), investment and the current
account (IV), diagrammatic exposition is used to show the effects

of pure wealth and public expenditure changes (V), temporary and
permanent change in raw material prices (VI) as well as the effect
of changes in world interest rates and alternative current account

objectives (VII) .   The paper ends with a brief discussion of the
effect of short-term real wage rigidity and the related policy

response.

I.   The factor-price-frontier, raw material prices and dynamic

     adjustment
     The effect of raw material prices on the supply side of an
open economy is best illustrated within the framework of the factor
price frontier, in a three factor production world, which will here
be reiterated only in summary form. Assume first that the economy
consists of a single sector and let Q = Q(L,K,N) be a well-behaved
constant returns production function for gross output of a final

good using labour, L, capital, K, and a raw material, N. The price
of the output is P, and that of the raw material is P. For the
time being assume that the relative price ll = Ps/P is given (as is
the case if both N and Q are tradeable goods in a small open economy).
Let Y be the real income derived, Y =   Q —   llN1 and assume optimal
use of N such that Q/N = 11n      Denote the real returns (marginal

products) to labour and capital by      and R respectively.

     The factor-price frontier (FFP) summarizes the information about
the technology in terms of the maximal combinations of the three

marginal factor products, (WRIH) = 0.          The curve    is drawn in
                                  4


W —   R   space (see Figure 1) for a given relative raw—material price
1101s downward sloping and convex to the origin. The slope of
the tangent at the point A measures the capital/labour ratio that

corresponds to the pair of factor prices (R°W° ) and its intercept
on the Waxis (OT) measures Y/L. Likewise the intercept on the R
axis (OS) measures Y/K. The elasticity of FPF at the point A = SA/TA
measures the relative shares of capital and labour in Y.
    Weak separability of the production function which will be
assumed    here {Q = Q[V(L,K), N]} implies weak separability
of the dual FPF, i.e.,      will take the form {f(W,R), ll] = 0.
A raw—material price increase, like Hicks-neutral technical regress,
is represented by a homothetic inward shift of the FPF from        to '
Only at the point C on the new FPF, on a ray OA, will the capital/
labour ratio be the same as at A. C is thus a full-employment point,
in the short run (when K = K, L = L)    .   Both real factor rewards at C
must fall at the same rate from their original level at A. Total
real income per unit of labour (Y/L) likewise falls by the same
proportion from OT to OM (and Y/K from OS to ON). The case of real
wage rigidity at W0, which may occur in the very short run, is
represented by the point B where R and Y/K must of necessity fall by
more than at C and the capital/ labour ratio is higher than at C.
At the initial/capital stock K, L must fall and unemployment will
emerge, as long as the real wage does not fall by the required amount.1

11n the putty-clay case in which the capital/labour ratio cannot
immediately adjust to the new factor prices, the various solutions are
given along the line FCG, i.e. in the rigid real wage, rigid capital/
labour ratio case the economy will be at F and not at B, the rate of
profit falling by more than at B, and L staying constant.
    One should also point out that under an alternative technological
                                                See Bruno (1981)
assumption the FPF need not shift honDthetically .

     The polar case to the very short run (W =      W)   is that of an
 imposed long—run real rate of return (R =   R°).   This is represented

 by the point D, to be termed the long-run, at which the real wage
 and the capital/labour ratio are below their levels at C. In
contrast to C, the point D may represent an equilibrium steady—
 state level after capital has adjusted downward to a given real
rate of return, R0. With full employment of labour, capital and
output (gross and net) at D must both lower than at the initial
point A.

     To see the short—run and long—run implications of a permanent
raw material price shock within this framework one may consider
some simple dynamics in terms of two key variables, the real

wage and the capital stock. The real wage can be made to change
as a function of unemployment, in Phillips curve fashion. The
capital stock can be made to adjust via an investment function
that will depend in some measure on the instantaneous and future
expected profit rate. With the aid of such a two-equation dynamic
model, one can analyze the alternative paths leading to an
ultimate steady state at the point D.1 An alternate procedure,
which we shall adopt in the more detailed two-sector discussion

below, is to think of the horizon as consisting of two periods,
1
   One has to keep in mind that a growing economy will usually also
 exhibit pure technical progress. To avoid the need to have the FPF
 simultaneously shift outward, when there is technical progress, one
may instead redefine factor products to be measured in intensity units.
 Thus in the empirically relevant case of Harrod neutral (or labour
 augmenting) technical progess, for example, the real wage (Wv) must be
 reinterpreted as being measured relative to its long run trend.
Another implication of this is that when we talk of a fall in
capital—labour ratios what may be implied is only a fall relative
to what it would be in the absence of the exogenous shock.

the short run, in which the capital stock is fixed, and the second
period, the long run, for which first period investment may affect

long-run capital in place. In this way today's investment is
uniquely determined by the expected future rate of profit, which
in turn depends on the assumptions made about future factor prices
and the extent of international capital mobility.


II.   A two-period model of production and factor allocation

      There are a number of interesting issue, relating to the
role of raw materials, which are of necessity ignored when one

looks at a single sector economy.1 Demand has so far played no
role at all. Also there was no role for endogenous changes in

relative commodity prices leading to compositional shifts within
the economy. In the context of the role of raw materials composi-
tional shifts , be of great importance in more than one respect.

A mineral boom leads to the so-called 'dutch disease', whereby

an existing tradable goods industry may be squeezed out by real
appreciation of the exchange rate, while a domestic service industry
may expand (see Corden and Neary (1981), Neary and Purvis (1981)
and van Wijnbergen (1981)) . A more direct effect of a rise in the

price of raw materials might be to contract the industry that is
relatively intensive in raw material use while a less raw material
intensive industry might contract less or even expand.2

1The single sector formulation can, however, be usefully applied to
the empirical analysis of a single large tradable goods sector such
as manufacturing.
21f the country is a producer of both the raw material and the raw
material using final tradable goods, such as most manufactures, de—
industrialization may thus occur for a combination of both reasons, as
is the case           in the U.K., for example.
                               8




In the case of both phenomer..a it is important to distinguish between

short—run and long-run effects of the exogenous changes that are
taking place. In the short run only variable factors (e.g. labour)
may be free to move from one sector into the other (If real wages
are rigid there may also be room for government intervention)

Relative profitability changes may, however, induce long—run changes
in capital investment patterns. Whether the latter will in fact
take place in turn depends on the extent to which the exogenous
changes (e.g. in mineral prices) are perceived to be temporary or
permanent. All of these considerations lead to the choice of a
multisectoral as well as inter—temporal framework of analysis.
     A natural extention of the model briefly discussed in the
previous section would be one in which another non—tradeable goods
sector is added on, in true Scandinavian tradition. Its extention
to an infinite horizon framework becomes analytically intractable, as
the number of state variables jumps to three or more. One way out
is to run computer simulations of such models which can be made as

complex as one wishes (see Sachs, (1980), Bruno and Sachs (1981)).

Useful as these are, they do, however, have the drawback that it is
often hard to see through how particular results depend on specific

numerical assumptions made.
     To obtain relative analytical simplicity we shall here sacrifice
the full fledged long-term horizon. Much of what is relevant in the
distinction between the short and the long-run can be seen from
looking at two—period simplifications of the world. Even a rational
expectations view of investment, based on future prices, can be
                                  9



expressed in this way, without need to bring in explicitly

Tobin's q or the 'costs of adjustment.' Finally the view of
the balance of payments in its interternporal allocation aspects
can be fitted well into this scheme.1

       Consider a two—commodity framework, tradeables (or the

'foreign' sector with subscript f) and domestic non-tradeables

(with subscript d) within a two-period horizon (using superscript
t =   1,2).
      Production of tradeables Qf =     Qf(Lf?    Kf ,    N) uses inputs of

labour (Lf). fixed initial capital (Kf) and raw materials (N)?                 it

supplies the demand for private consumer goods (Cf) investment
goods (I) and net exports (X) .       The latter may be negative (net

imports). The domestic price of tradeables                   equals the world
price (p*) times the exchange rate (e). The noi—tradeable goods
sector will be assumed to use only labour and capital, d =
                                                                           d'd'      Kd)
and to supply only private (Cd) and public (G) consumer goods. The
respective sector specialization in the production of exports,
investment goods and public consumption and in the use of raw
materials is not essential but clearly simplifies the analysis.
There is a third sector in the economy, producing a fixed quantity
of tradeable raw materials (H1, H2), for which the fixed inputs
will not be separately accounted.              The country may be a net
'A mu1tictOral,intertemporal, view of foreign trade and investment
allocation was very popular in the Trade and Develooment literature
of the 1960's, mostly based on empirical development proqrammincr
models, but also including some theoretical contributions see e.g.
Bardhan (1966), Bruno (1967) . However, the associated short-term
adjustment problem was usually discussed in a separate box. For
recent two—period formulations of investment and the balance of
payments see Razin (1980), Sachs (1981).

     While the total labour supply is fixed in both periods
  t    t   _t
(Ld + Lf = L )   capital   in each sector in the second period is

augmented or contracted by the amount of tradeable investment

goods produced (or traded) for each sector in the first period

(K - Kd + K -         = Ii).   For simplicity we assume no depreciation
but allow for negative I No new investment goods have to be
produced in the second period since this represents the along—run

with K, K staying on for posterity.
      The main distinction between the two periods is that in
the first, the short-run, capital is held fixed and is sector-
specific, while in the second, the long—run, it is malleable.

On the production side this model has its antecedents in the
work of Mayer (1974) and others. The earlier model is here
extended to take into account investment and wealth as well as
the role of raw materials.

     Production and factor rewards are obtained from firm
maximization of discounted cash flow. If the relative price of
domestic over foreign goods is denoted by r= d'f'1 that of
raw materials by irs, the real wage in foreign good units is Wf

and the own rate of interest on foreign goods is r, firms

maximize (Q + TF'Q -    wL'    -

subject to the labour and production constraints. The usual first
order conditions are obtained for both periods:

real exchange rate.

        For capital in the second period we get:
                2
        R =                =         =1   + r                        (2)


 (First period equality of marginal products at the initial

point Kd, Kf is assumed).

        Equations (1) give the conventional static optimal
allocations of variable factors of production in each period.

They simply say that for profit maximization, factors that
are mobileshould in each period be allocated so as to equate the

marginal products in both sectors, subject to proper accounting
of relative output prices (ii)

        Equation       (2), on the other hand, represents the intertemporal
arbitrage condition. It says that investment in the first period
and its allocation to capital growth (or contraction) in each
sector must be such that the marginal products of capital by the
second period in each sector will be equal to the given foreign
real interest factor (R = 1 + r).

        We are now ready to make use of these production equilibrium
conditions in order to return to a factor—price frontier framework,

this time looking at the FPF's of both sectors within the same

diagram.
        While the factor price frontier for the f good is                    0
                                                              4f (wfFR7r =
(see curve           in Figure 2), that of the d good can be represented
in the same diagram if written in the form d(wf/Tr,R/rr) = 0. The
curve         in Figure 2 represents the FPF for the initial relative
price iT°.      It is here drawn under the assumption that d are more

capital—intensive than f goods. An increase in the relative price rr

(a real appreciation) will shift this curve homothetically

outwards while a decrease in 'ii        (a real depreciation) will shift
it inwards.

     Consider now the case in which the real rate of interest is

given exogenously R = R0, as would be the case under free
international capital mobility1 and consider the case of a once—

and—for—all increase in the relative price of raw materials, moving

   to .       The 'long-run' (i.e. second period) solution must entail
a snift of       to   passing through the long-run point D. We can
thus immediately deduce a number of important properties:

     (1) The given marginal product of capital R°( = 1 +        r*)   fixes
                           2                                    2
the long—run real wage Wf as well as the relative price it          uniquely.
     (2) We know that with an increase in raw material prices
affecting only the f sector     'rr2 must in this case fall in the

second period i.e.        <

     (3) From the geometry of Figure 2, we can deduce that the

capital—labour ratio in the d sector must fall (as it does in f)
in the long-run. This follows from the fact that the tangent at D
has lower slope than at E, which in turn is the same as at A (on
     We have thus established that a permanent rise in relative

raw material prices, at given real rates of return to capital,

must cause a long run fall in the real wage and in the capital
intensities in both sectors as well as a real depreciation, on the

assumption that the traded goods sector is the raw material intensive

 Here demand must naturally play an important role.

 III. Consumption, wealth and short-run equilibrium.

      We shall assume that households decide on their consumption

 basket by maximizing discounted utility subject to a given net/
 wealth constraint:


      C + iIC + R1(C + ir2C) =                                          (3)

      Making use of the fact that real incomes equal real factor

 can be rewritten in the following simplified form:

variables.

which equals the marginal rate of substitution on the short—run
production possibility curve. It will also be a negative function
of the exogenous                  (we ignore the fixed factors here).1 The

next simplification is introduced by the choice of a linear

logarithmic utility function for households (see Sachs (1981))
which implies that consumption of each good in each period is a
fixed proportion of total net wealth:

                =
                    r1C     =     (l+6)1         =   (l+)R'     C bQ            (5)




        where ó = pure discount rate and ,b depend on the utility
                    2
parameters.

           Although this particular specification of the utility
function is not required for most of the qualitative results to

be obtained below, its very simple implications for consumption
behavior enable a very convenient diagrammatic representation of
the whole two period model and we therefore adopt it here.


    'When real wages are slow to adjust (see below) the economy may

    not be on its PPC and we must instead use the supply function for

          When we combine rr1C = bQ                     from (5) with the expression

for net wealth (4), we can relate the present consumption of the

domestic good (Tr1C, expressed in foreign good units) to its
relative price and to the main exogenous variables determining

the value of net wealth:

          The curved markedbQ in the first quadrant of figure 3 gives
a downward sloping demand curve for consumption of the domestic

good.1 It will shift up or down depending on the exogenous
increases or decreases in wealth. Private net wealth increases
                                         t
with the size of raw material deposits (H ) and falls with the
rate of interest (R) and the expected future government expenditure
expenditure (G2). The signs on the effect of raw material prices

for each period   depend on whether the economy is a net exporter
                                                       t    t>    2
or net importer of the raw material, i.e., on whether H - N < 0.
We shall make use of this property in analysing the effect of
temporary or permanent increases in raw material prices.
          All that we need to obtain the first period equilibrium is to
add a supply schedule for domestic consumer goods:

          C =                  -                                                          (7)
                   Q(iT1)
1.
 Since      Cf is proportional to lrCd, it also represents consumption

of the foreign good and total first period consumption. Note that
Cd in physical units is represented in this diagram by the slope
of a ray from the origin.
2Strictly speaking we have                              =   H'   - N1   ,
                                                                            = H2   - N2

 -   (positive         term). The additional term in period 2 comes from the
act that R is held constant and not
                                 17


        To conform to the variables in the diagram we multiply both

sides of equation (7) by the relative price ir1. This curve is
upward sloping and shifts down and to the right with increases
    1
in G

        Even before looking at investment and second period equilibrium

we can already deduce that any factor that increases wealth (in
units of the f good) will cause an increase in present consumption
and will also cause a real appreciation in the short run. The
latter in turn implies a shift of labor and production from tradeable

goods to non—tradable goods e.g. from manufacturing into services.
Here is one manifestation of de-industrialization in the short—run.
Note that an increase in wealth may be caused by a variety of

reasons, including the news that a North-Sea oil discovery is

expected in the long-run (i.e. H2rises). Likewise one gets the
usual result that a temporary fiscal expansion (G1 rises but G2
stays constant) crowds out private consumption and causes a real
appreciation, if public expenditure is centered on domestic goods.
More relevant in the present context, however, are the long—run

effects of such expansion. We appropriately turn to investment and

second period equilibrium.

Iv. Investment, foreign borrowing and long run production

        Having shown how future factor prices and first period
equilibrium are determined all that is left to complete the

solution of the system is to show how the future ccinposition of

output and capital stock are determined. This will tell us what
todayts investment will be which in turn will determine the current

account.

     With constant returns to scale, output and labor demands
can be written as proportions of capital stocks in each sector.
Since future relative prices are uniquely determined we can
write the second period supply equation for the domestic
consumption good as a linear function of the capital stock:

         2
        Cd =
                22   22
                 'd (Wf/rr -   G
                                   2
                                       )                               (8)

where        is output per unit of capital in the domestic goods
industry. (Note that in figure 2 this is measured by the R-
intercept of the tangent to the point D). Multiplying both
sides of (8) by the second period relative price we can draw (8)
as an upward sloping supply curve in the rr2C and            space (see

quadrant II of figure 3) .     The use of the common vertical axis

for the consumption good of both periods is justified by our
simplifying assumption on consumption behavior (5), since the
two are proportional to each other as long as the interest rates

do not change N2C/ii1C =       (l+r)/(l+S),     by intertemporal optimality (5)).

        Since consumption of the two periods are proportional, eq. (8)

and the curve marked (Q - G2) in figure 3, uniquely determine
the amount to be invested in the domestic industry (Kg), as given,
                                         19


for example, at the point A2.
        The system is closed by assuming full employment and labor

market clearing in the second period:

                        +    22 2 ,      ) = L—2

        KdAd (Wf/lr )       KfAf   (Wf


        Equation (9) is represented by the line marked L2 in quadrant
III of figure 3 in which the two axes represent the two capital

stocks, respectively. Its slope equals the ratio of capital/labor
ratios (A/X) in the two sectors. The way the line has been
drawn here, relative to a 450 line, assumes that the d sector is

the more capital-intensive one. In the reverse capital intensity
case, the 2 line must cut the 45° line in the other direction.
As we shall see relative intensities will matter as far as total
investment requirements are concerned. The distance of the inter-
cepts of the respective 45° lines through the initial (A3) and

any post-shock equilibrium (e.g. B3 or D3) will measure total
                                              2             —     —

        Equations (6) — (9) and the corresponding four curves of
figure 3 uniquely determine the equilibrium of the system in
terms of the relevant endogenous variables.1
       Before we turn to the analysis of the response to various
kinds of exogenous shocks, we must look at the implications for
the current account.

equation to determine the first period real wage.

must by deeinition be equal to total domestic savings (S)1, which

is I + F.       The line marked            in quadrant I of figure 3 describes
                + H1]. Its vertical distance from the line
                                                                                  2
(whose co-ordinate is ir Cd =

the first period (S1). The                 line is of necessity steeper than
    so that ceteris paribus S1 falls with ir'.               The difference
(S' —   Ii)   measures the current account surplus (F').

    We shall consider two possibilities. One is the case in which
there is no endogenous capital mobility and F1 and F2 are held

equal to zero or to some pre—specified given numbers. The other
case to which we shall turn first is the one in which borrowing and
lending take place at a given world interest rate r*. In this case
we must have R° =          (l+r*)   and the balance of payments constraint

takes the form


    F1 + (l+r*)F2 =            0                                                      (11)

 since Q =      C    + G.
 This vertical1distance depends on (B-b)Yf( )which is a negative
 function of it since >b.

      It is readily established that, upon substitution of (10),
equations (11) and (3) become the same budget constraint for
R =   l+r*.   In fact, the whole pattern of resource allocation and
pricing described above could be got from the solution of an

optimal growth problem in which society is assumed to maximize

discounted utility, as above, subject to the various production
and supply constraints in the two periods pius the intertemporal

capital mobility condition (11).


V. The implications of pure wealth and expenditure effects
      For the time being, we stick to the assumption that the long-
run real interest rate is given and therefore once the future
price of raw materials is set all future relative prices are
known. Since investors are assumed to behave rationally and look
only at future relative prices, factor proportions in each sector
are known. Future intersectional allocation of capital,labour
and output may still be affected by changes in wealth or in rela-

tive demand for different goods today. We first look again at
pure wealth shifts and at changes in government expenditure.
      Consider again the effect of an exogenous change in total
wealth. A relevant example in the present context would be the
discovery of North Sea oil (raising H on the right—hand side of

equation (6)). An alternative (not unheard of in my own country)
would be a large foreign exchange transfer. In terms of figure 3
                                      23




this will show as an upward shift in the curve Q in quadrant I

with equilibrium taking place at points B1, B2, B3, respectively,
in the various quadrants. Consumption goes up (in all goods and
periods), the relative price            today rises, but only temporarily
(note that second period's 2 remains unchanged). This induces
an increase in investment for non—tradables (K) next period and

this   also implies a long—run movement of labour out of f and into
d, a clear manifestation of long—run de—industrialization (see
the discussion of the "dutch disease", as, for example, in Corden

and Neary (1980)).
    As we have seen before this intersectoral movement of labour
already starts in the first period as the relative price                         rises

and capital is still frozen at its initial levels. One can use
the FPF framework to show how FPF for d moves temporarily in an
outward direction (see figure 2 move from                       to       At the initial
real wage w, the rate of return in the d sector rises and
falls through the absorption of labour that is moving out of d and

into f. At the same time, Wf will be rising to balance the labour
market. Eventually rr falls back to the predetermined long-run
level (which here is assumed to be the same as the initial relative
price), and so does the real wage in both f units (Wf) and d units

(wf/Tr)l while the adjustment of capital stocks takes place. The
production possibility curve will have a shift biased towards the
                               24




   axis. Finally we note that in the case in which      <       as

is depicted in figure 3, total net investment in the first period

will be positive (compare the 450 lines through A3 and B3). It
is easy to see that under reverse relative capital intensities,
this intersectoral shift will take place together with a fall in

total net investment.
    There is an interesting point related to savings and current
account behaviour which can be read off the diagram. Suppose the
wealth shift comes only from the expectation of future oil finds
(i.e., only H2 rises, while H1 does not change). In that case,

the curve Yf stays put while   moves up. Savings today thus fall
in expectation of greater riches (note the vertical distance

between B1 and    curve). If I rises (in the case A <X) one
can unambiguously associate these developments with a decrease in
                                                                1
today's current account surplus (or increase in the deficit).
    Consider again now an increase in government expenditure, which

here is confined to d goods, coupled with an equivalent increase in
taxes. As we have seen, this must crowd out private consumption
expenditure. In figure 3 it will show in a downward shift of curve

Q in quadrant 1 with    staying put and equilibrium now taking place

at D1, D2, and D3, respectively. Consumption falls, '   rises
temporarily, S falls,    falls and    rises. Total investment falls

if d is more capital intensive than f. Total investment goes up

If one were to allow for investment in the H-industry, this point
 would be further strengthened.
                                  25




(and the current account falls) in the reverse capital intensity
case. It is interesting to note that a d-biased increase in
public consumption today in this case induces a shift into f goods

production tomorrow. This seemingly counter-intuitive result
comes from the reduction in savings and the current account today.
Production for net exports in the second period will thus have

to increase (in the first period Q falls with the temporary
rise in 1)


VI. Temporary or permanent increases in raw material prices1

    Suppose now that Tr goes up but 1T is expected to stay put.
This would be the case if a real oil price increase, say, is

expected to be only temporary. The crucial question is what
happens to net wealth.       If the country is not self-sufficient

today (N1 > H1), the Q curve shifts down causing a fall in con-

sumption, and in ir, a fall in         (as well as L, Q) and a rise
    2              2     2
in Kf (as well as Lf Qf). Again this seemingly paradoxical
result comes from the demand side, and it crucially depends on
the assumed temporary nature of the raw material price increase.
    Suppose now that both present and future prices of raw
materials (Tr1, 7r2) increase at the same rate. Again the 2 curve

could shift up or down, depending on the effect on private wealth.

If i1 does not vary much, the analysis suggests a corresponding
multi-period self-sufficiency condition. For a country that is


'For a very similar analysis of raw material price shocks within
 a two—period model, as well as the welfare implications, see
 Svensson (1981).

a net importer we would anyway expect a downward shift in the
curve. This time, however, the other curves in quadrant II and
III shift as well. Consider first the supply curve Q. Since
now the future relative price of ('iT2) also goes down, the inter-

cept on the consumption axis (—'rr2G2) is reduced. The slope of

the      curve, on the other hand, depends on what happens to the

output-capital ratio in the d sector (R-axis intercept of the tan-

gent to q     in   figure 3). If, as is likely, it falls, the curve
   rotates leftwards. In figure 3, equilibrium is at the point
E2 which, relative to A2, shows an increase in capital requirements
in the d sector (K). Similarly the curve 2 in quadrant III now
shifts inwards with equilibrium taking place at E3. K thus falls
while       increases. In the case described in figure 3 total

investment goes down. These results seem to agree generally quite
well with the quantitative estimates obtained from a much more

detailed empirical simulation model (Bruno and Sachs (1981)).
However, one can see from inspection of the figure that there is
a variety of possible outcomes depending on relative shifts in

the constituent curves.       (E.g., one could have both capital goods

falling, if Q rotates less to the left, or one could even con-
ceive of an extreme case in which        increases, though this seems

relatively unlikely.)
      To get a better idea of the various possible outcomes we
consider the comparative statics of the model in more explicit

analytical form. Let us denote the factor shares for labour and

capital in the two sectors by c, y. (i=d,f) and that of raw
materials in the TR sector by                    (c +   =
                                                            cYf
The two factor price frontiers tell us that the rates of change
                                                                  +
                                                                      f   +   = 1)



(denoted by ")      of   marginal factor products must obey the follow-

ing equations:


    TR:    czfwf +       fn    +
                                   •YfR
                                          = 0

                                          = 0
                                                                                     (12)

    NT:    ad(wfTr) +                                                                (13)



It follows that for a given ir and R the shifts in the real wage

and the relative price of NT are uniquely determined as follows:



    wf =   f        (fTf   + YfR)                                                    (14)

      =
          dWf   +
                    1dR
                           =
                               af dfn +                                              (15)



For the special case R = 0, with which we have dealt so far,
equation (15) gives an exact measure of the long—run reduction in
the price of non—tradables for a "small" increase in irn .                     When R

also changes (see discussion below) the second term in (15) shows
that a long-run fall in R will lead to a further fall in the

relative price (Tr)            if d is more capital intensive than f, as is

here assumed.        (For the reverse capital intensity case a fall in

R would mitigate the long-run fall in rr)
                                            28




       Consider the production side now. Denoting the elasticities

of substitution between labour and capital by c (                id,f)   we have:


          —                                                                 (16)
              La = cY.(WfR)

For the d sector we thus find (substituting from (16) and assuming
  = 0)



          -
              Ld
                   =
                       (l-cd)      dd   =
                                            f    (l_cf)adf1rfl


          -
              Kd           dd'd =       afdadfn
and,
              =        +   d   -   = fadfdn                                 (17)



       Equation (17) thus shows that the output-capital ratio must

fall, and likewise the slope of the                line in figure 3, as long

as the elasticity of substitution between labour and capital in
d is less than 1.              It is interesting to note that in the special

Cobb-Douglas case (=l) it will stay put. We have thus justified
the analysis of the change in quadrant II of figure 3. What can
we explicitly say about the changes in the capital stocks (quad-
rant III, figure 3) as a result of an increase in raw material

prices? Returning to the notation for period 2 we have, using

equations (8) and (16):
                                      29




        =      - (QcKc)      = C
                                   (C) afaddfTr
              22
where c = Cd/Qd.
     Next we can substitute for ir2 from equation (16) and write

C = Oir     where o   is   the e1asticit of total wealth with respect
to a permanent raw material price change (ir1 =       Tr).
     We can thus write:


        =
              fdf          (c_Cd) + cO] r                             (18)



Likewise, we have


        =     - (K—L)        which (using equations (16), (14) and (18)


gives


     L =      +    dfu/afn

        =
            [af    fGd(l_d) + c(fcdBf + 0)] r                         (19)



Looking at signs and orders of magnitude of parameters there is

a strong presumption that L > 0 and            > 0 while     may be
positive but need not necessarily be so. The ambiguity arises
1
      can roughly be approximated by th ratio to wea1h 9f he
    total self-sufficiency measure : [H - N        + (l+r)   (H —N )i /Q.
                                           30




from the fact that 0 is negative for a net importer while in (18)

    (c—ad) may or may not be positive.1            If L rises, then by
construction           must fall, and since K/L is known to fall in
response to a 1T increase, K must be falling and so do                   and


       We can thus state as an upshot that there is a strong

presumption that employment, output and capital in the f industry
will fall and that employment and output (and maybe capital) in
the d industry will rise.

       It is important to stress again that when it comes to drawing
any lessons for reality everything that has been said here about

sectoral changes should be interpreted as deviations from what
long—run trend would otherwise be, and not necessarily as indica-
ting absolute positive or negative levels of investments, etc.

We have assumed zero population growth, no technical progress
and no depreciation of capital. While relaxation of these assump-

tions would not pose particular difficulties, they do simplify the
analysis, but at the same time require that one interpret the

results with suitable modification.



VII. World equilibrium, changes in the rate of interest and the

         current account
       So far we have conducted the analysis under the assumption
1
      Numerical example (      with   reasonable orders of magnitude):
         = 0.6,    = 0.4,             0.4, Gd =0.7, c = 0.8, 0= —0.05.
      We get (per 1% of ir ): K = 0.02, L = 0.72, Q = 0.44 (percent).
      If 0= _O.lO, Kd =-O.O2, Ld = 0.68, 0d = 0.40 (percent). In
      both cases, ir    =   -0.7,   Wf =   -1.0.
                                  31




that the world rate r* remains constant. This is a very con-
venient device since it appropriately fixes the long—run factor

prices and factor proportions. This particular small economy
assumption need, of course, not hold if one thinks of the impli-
cations of an increase in raw material prices hitting all indus-
trial countries at the same time. In the short and medium run,
as experience has also shown, a shift in the world savings schedule

and an investment short—fail may drive the real rate down, although
it is not clear why this should be sustained for a very long

period.      In any case, one may consider the implication of an
exogenous change for a single country within the above model.
Specifically let us consider a drop in r* on top of a permanent

increase in it

    A fall inr* causes a rise in w (or rather mitigates the fall

in w). If d is more capital intensive than f, there will be a
further fall in rr2.     The same analysis also shows that       as

well as            fall relatively to their previous long-run solution.

The fall in r raises the present value of wealth (n), and thus

shifts up the curve 2 in figure 3, leading to a relative increase
in consumption, 'rr1   and Q, and a relative fall in Q. Since
the curve        stays the same, savings (S1) must fall in the process,
as one would expect.
   This will hold as long as the weighted marginal propensity to
   save out of wealth of the net exporters of raw materials out-
   weighs the MPS for the net importers.
                                     32




          The outcome in the second period depends on what happens
to consumption demand for non—tradables which in turn is propor-

tional to (l+r) C. The latter may go down since in all prob—
ability Q (and thus C) increases by less than (l+r) falls. So
the question is whether the resulting relative fall in demand

for          can outweigh the effect of rising per unit capital

requirements. The term multiplying P in a modified expression for
K (as in (18)) turns out to be
               ambiguous in sign.1 Again the presumption is that it
will certainly reduce L. Here the elasticity with respect to R is



     (
             dd     (l—f)/afJ-3-c
                                          +
                                              eLf
                                                    —l
                                                         adyf

which is always positive. If the fall in the rate of interest
reduces L it certainly increases L. With the relative increase
in             the capital stock                    as well as the output of f

in the second period must be higher than otherwise. With the
fall in C =        (1+r)C,   it turns out that the current account in
the second period (F2) must improve and therefore F1 in the
                                2
first period must worsen.
         The final upshot, which makes intuitive sense, is that an
exogenous fall in the interest rate makes for more net foreign

1
         For the numerical eample given earlier this equals +0.3, a
         fall in R reduces Kd.
2
         This would1irnmediately follow if total investment (Ii) rises;
         savings (S ), as we have seen, certainly falls. The rise in
         investments i proable1but not certain while the fall in the
         difference (F = S -    I
                                ) is ambiguous.
                                33




borrowing (or reduction in capital outflow) today at the expense
of the future and this has a counterpart in the structure of

production and consumption. Less production and more consumption
(by imports) of tradables today and more production (less con—

surnption) next period, Correspondingly the relative price        falls

less today (a smaller real depreciation) and more tomorrow.
    This monotonic relationship between r and the current account

can also be used to consider the case in which we do not assume

free capital mobility. Suppose the government sets a target
for the current account which involves a smaller deficit (or

larger surplus) than would be obtained as an endogenouS solution
                 2   This implies government intervention in the
of the system.
form of fiscal and real exchange rate policy such as implicitly
involves an increase in the domestic real rate of interest. The
implications for the structure of production and consumption in
both periods will be exactly the reverse of that found in the case
previously considered. In other words, there will now be an
increase in savings and in net production of f today at the expense
of less of the same tomorrow, with all the concomitant effects on

patterns of investment and labour use.

    The converse may also take place. A government may decide
to run a larger deficit than would otherwise be obtained for

reasons of supporting price stability or full employment. These

   literature (op. cit.).
2 We implicitly assume that only the government now conducts
   the foreign borrowing or lending with the budget absorbing
   the difference in interest rates.

questions will be briefly discussed in the next section.



VIII. Real wage rigidity and other modifications
    So far we have assumed wage and price flexibility and
automatic clearing of all markets. Under a raw material price

shock unemployment may arise when real wages are temporarily
downward rigid (see Bruno and Sachs, 1979). For simplicity
consider such rigidity in terms of this periods wage in f
              1
units (wf).        In the extreme case in which wf is held fixed

at its initial level (wf =           w   in the 'very short-run") a raw

material price increase will now show in a greater reduction

in real wealth since net output of f (Y), for a given wf I           falls
by more than it would fall otherwise.2             Wealth (Q) will no

longer depend directly on ri, and the            curve in figure 3 (quadrant

I) will now be replaced by a line parallel to the rr axis which

shifts down as Ti increases, to a position like the line passing
through points D0 and D1 in the figure. If ri were also downward
rigid (say the nominal exchange rate were fixed and prices of d

     are downward rigid), the economy would momentarily stay at

the point D, where there is excess supply in the commodity
market (the demand for C is less than Q - G1), as well as
unemployment. If commodity prices are free to adjust, Ti1 will
fall and C will rise to the point D0, where the d market clears
   More realistically the consumption wage should be expressed
   in terms of an average of wf and Wf/1T. Real wage rigidity
   may thus imply a constraint on the relationship between Wf
    and ii, rather than on Wf alone.
2
    Formally, this can be seen by showing that Yf/tnl -N while

    (Yf/7rH            —N   -(positive term)
                  Wf
                                  35




clears but labour does not. Full employment could be reached, with
a rigid real wage, at the point D. This corresponds to the case
in which government expenditure is increased to insure full

employment (the line       shifts to pass exactly through D),
while taxes are suitably adjusted and domestic consumption
of d falls.
      Since consumption along with private wealth must be lower than
in the flexible wage case (which corresponds to the points E1,

E2, etc.), the effect in the second period is to reduce K, L2

and Q (point D in quadrant II) and increase K, L and
relative to what they would otherwise be. This solution
correspondingly implies that there will be a larger surplus
(or smaller deficit) in the current account in the second

period at the expense of the first period in which both domestic
savings and the current account must fall.

     The above analysis may look somewhat mechanistic since we
have fixed the real wage independently of the state of the labour

market in which case the size of public expenditure does not seem
to have any quantitative effects in the future. This could

easily be modified by assuming, in Phillips curve fashion, that

Wf   changes   smoothly as a negative function of the unemployment

rate. In this case this period's changes in G will directly affect
the size of the structural changes in the second period.1

     Note that we have assumed that the increase in G1is financed
     by increased taxes. Had we assumed insted that this is
     financed by a decrease in next period's G (i.e., by debt)
     the intertempoa1 link would also show directly (by an upward
     shift in the    line in quadrant II of figure 3).
                                                   36




      As long as nominal money has not been incorporated in the

model one cannot explicitly analyze inflation and the role of

monetary policy. While this can be remedied formally by intro-
ducing money demand/supply and a nominal interest rate, the

likely role of money can be guessed even without its explicit
introduction. Money may have a real long—term effect in this
model if there is short-term non—neutrality. As in similar

rigid,         in which case real private wealth (as well as Tr and Wf)

may change as a result of monetary policy, thus affecting next
period's factor allocations in a way similar to that analyzed
before.

      We conclude our discussion by noting again that, with one
exception, we have so far stuck to the simplification that only

second period's quantities are affected by today's disturbances
while relative prices were assumed to remain invariant. A more
general approach should also allow for induced changes in long—run
relative prices. We briefly mention one example where this may
occur. Suppose we relax the assumption that the f good is a
perfect substitute for the world final good and assume instead

that the individual country faces a downward sloping demand
curve for its product (priced Pf) which is an imperfect substi-
tute for the world final good (whose domestic price is e.p*                               Pf).
In that case the final          goods terms of trade (pf/ep*) become an
                                37




additional endogenous relative price, which may now move the

final position of the FPF for f (the curve           in figure 2),
since the relative price of the raw material will also become
          1
endogenous [7Th   = ep /Pf = (pn*/p*)   (ep*/pf)]•    What this

implies is that present period's stabilization policies may
affect next period's 2 and w even though r* is given. Once
we introduce these and additional complications, however, there
remains less advantage in considering an analytical model over
simulations with a more realistically complex empirical framework.
After all we set out with the objective of showing that consider-
able insight into some of the issues can be gained by looking
at a stripped-down version of such a model.




1 Such argument, for a medium term context, explains why in face
   of the same external price shock (in terms of p*/p*) a country
   like Germany suffered a smaller internal increase in    in the
   1970s, compared to Japan or the U.K.  (The implications for the
   differential productivity performance in manufacturing are
   discussed in Bruno, 1981.)
