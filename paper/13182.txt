A Professor Like Me: The Influence of Instructor Gender on College Achievement

JEL No. I2

                                              ABSTRACT

Many wonder whether teacher gender plays an important role in higher education by influencing student
achievement and subject interest. The data used in this paper helps identify average effects from male
and female college students assigned to male or female teachers. In contrast to previous work at the
primary and secondary school level, our focus on large first-year undergraduate classes isolates gender
interaction effects due to students reacting to instructors rather than instructors reacting to students.
In addition, by focusing on college, we examine the extent to which gender interactions may exist
at later ages. We find that assignment to a same-sex instructor boosts relative grade performance and
the likelihood of completing a course, but the magnitudes of these effects are small. A same-sex instructor
increases average grade performance by at most 5 percent of its standard deviation and decreases the
likelihood of dropping a course by 1.2 percentage points. The effects are similar when conditioning
on initial ability (high school achievement), and ethnic background (mother tongue not English), but
smaller when conditioning on mathematics and science courses. The effects of same-sex instructors
on upper-year course selection are insignificant.

I. Introduction



        Education outcomes often differ by gender, and many of these differences seem to

increase with age. The National Center for Education Statistics documents these trends

for the United States [e.g. Freemen, 2004]. In early years, boys and girls appear to be on

similar footing, performing about the same on tests of general knowledge, reading and

mathematics. But by fourth grade, girls perform substantially better than boys at reading

and slightly worse at mathematics. Gender differences by subject persist into high school

and college, and occur for all reporting OECD countries.                     More men than women

complete bachelor degrees in math, physical and computer sciences, business, and

engineering. More men than women also graduate with masters and doctoral degrees in

these subjects and complete programs in law, dentistry, and medicine, although these

differences have narrowed over time.

        While men tend to take more courses and perform better at subjects related to

higher-paying occupations, women consistently outshine men in terms of overall

educational attainment. Women are less likely to repeat a grade, drop out of high school,

and more likely to enroll in college, finish college, and complete an advanced degree.

Women currently receive 57 percent of all bachelor’s degrees, and about 56 percent of all

graduate degrees, reflecting steady increases since the early 1970s.

        Role model effects are frequently considered key for explaining gender

differences in education.1 There is rich evidence within the psychology literature that

girls and boys respond differently to mothers and fathers [e.g. Brown, 1990, Brown et al.,


1
 For a review of explanations of gender differences in education and specialization, see Jacobs (1996), and
DiPrete and Buchmann (2005).


                                                     1
1986], and pick different celebrities and athletes to emulate. Male and female teachers

are also potential role models. Students spend large portions of weekdays interacting

with them. Perhaps not coincidently, females still constitute the majority of teachers in

elementary and secondary schools during the period when girls repeat grades less than

boys and form views about going to college. Conversely, male teachers, especially in

college, dominate fields in mathematics, engineering, and sciences while male students

enroll in these subjects more.

       A few recent papers have used datasets with multiple student-teacher matches in

elementary school to compare differences in student performance with differences in

teacher gender for the same student. [Dee, 2006, 2007, Holmlund and Sund (2005)].

These studies improve on earlier ones by controlling for unobservable student traits that

are common across the classroom, but they are not able to distinguish between role model

effects – from students reacting to teachers depending on teacher gender – or teacher bias

effects – from teachers reacting to students depending on student gender.

       Our study is the first to estimate the impact of having a same-sex instructor on

classroom performance in college using both within student and within instructor

variation. Since we focus on large first-year undergraduate classes where teachers do not

grade students’ exams and students do not typically receive differential treatment from

teachers, we can more confidently equate gender interaction effects with role-model

effects. In addition, by focussing on college we examine the extent to which gender role

model effects exist at later ages. Many social scientists wonder whether role model

effects function mostly at young ages, and whether encounters at later ages can have any

significant impact on social-economic success. Lastly, our paper speaks directly to the




                                            2
debate about increasing female representation in male-dominated fields. There have been

many widely publicized efforts by the government, companies, and schools to increase

female representation in math and science. This paper estimates the impact of male and

female undergraduates’ exposure to same sex teachers and whether such exposure can

affect student achievement and subject interest.

       Our results suggest teacher gender plays little or no role in student achievement

and field of study choice. While we find some evidence that female students perform

relatively better in terms of grade performance and are less likely to drop a course when

encountered with a female instructor instead of male instructor, the magnitude of these

effects are small. The evidence also holds when we consider subgroups across different

subjects (mathematics and science), different pre-college ability (high school

achievement), and different ethnicities (mother tongue not English).




II. Background



       Teachers may respond differently depending on the gender of a student, or

students may respond differently depending on the gender of a teacher. In the first case,

teachers discriminate, and exhibit bias with respect to how they engage or evaluate boys

and girls in the classroom. The way teachers behave interacting with boys or girls may

depend on whether teachers themselves are male or female.         These effects may be

conscious or unconscious. In the second case, students may see teachers more as role

models if they are of the same sex, and exhibit greater intellectual engagement, conduct,

and interest. Students may also react to teachers when they fear being viewed through


                                             3
negative ‘stereotype threats’ – for example, when female students are reminded about a

belief they are not supposed to be good at math when being taught by a male teacher. In

one study [Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999)], for example, women underperformed men

on a math test when told that the test produces gender differences but did not when told

the opposite. Another possibility is that male and female students respond differently to

male and female teaching styles. If girls and boys respond differently to teacher behavior

rather than teacher gender per se, relative differences in academic achievement could still

arise.

         At the primary and secondary school level, a number of recent studies have

estimated effects from being taught by a same-sex teacher, without attempting to

disentangle why such effects exist. Results have been mixed. Nixon and Robinson

(1999) regressed education attainment on the proportion of female faculty in an

individual’s high school, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).

With linear controls for family background, they concluded that raising the percentage of

high school female faculty increases high school and college completion among girls, but

decreases these outcomes among boys. On the other hand, Ehrenberg, Goldhaber, and

Brewer (1995) adopted a better identification strategy by regressing individual test score

gains between Grade 8 and Grade 10 on Grade 10 teacher gender and race characteristics

using the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS). Their analysis suggested

these characteristics have no affect on test scores, but do affect    teachers’ subjective

evaluations of students.

         Dee (2007) also used the NELS but for Grade 8 students with two recorded

subject outcomes. His study was the first to use a ‘matched pairs’ approach to estimate




                                            4
the effects of same-sex teachers on grade performance and teacher evaluations. Using the

NELS, Dee examined whether test scores and student evaluations for boys and girls

systematically differed between classes depending on teacher gender differences. Test

scores were lower for boys assigned to female teachers while no difference occurred for

girls. Dee argued that his data suggested female math teachers may have been assigned

to lower-achieving classes, and therefore excluded the sample with math teachers in his

baseline results. Test scores were about 4 percent of a standard deviation higher for girls

assigned to female teachers and 4 percent of a standard deviation lower for boys. Female

teachers were also more likely to believe boys are disruptive and don’t do homework.

       Holmlund and Sund (2005) adopted a similar approach using a large dataset of

secondary students in Sweden. In contrast to Dee’s results, they found no significant

effects on grade performance.      Carrington and Tymms (2005, 2007) used multiple

classroom data for Grade 6 students from the Performance Indicators in Primary Schools

(PIPS). They found no significant gender interactions for subject test score performance

and subjective attitudes towards math, reading, and science. Lahelma (2000) interviews

13 and 14 year-olds about what they think about the importance of teacher gender.

Although students often commented on the lack of male teachers in their schools, the

issue of gender did not figure prominently in their observations about the quality of

teaching that they valued. Students emphasized teachers who were engaging, friendly,

sensitive, impartial, and able to maintain discipline, regardless of gender. Finally, in

related work, Lavy and Schlosser (2007) used idiosyncratic variation in the proportion of

girls in a class and conclude more girls in a class lowers disruption, improves student-

teacher relationships and lessens teachers’ fatigue.




                                             5
       Few studies have examined gender interactions at the college level. Canes and

Rosen (1995) used year-to-year variation in the proportion of female faculty in a

department and found no correlation with year-to-year variation in the proportion of

females majoring in related subjects. On the other hand, Neumark and Gardecki (1998)

found female graduate students in faculties with more women and with female advisors

do better on the job, and Rothstein (1995) found that the probability a female college

student obtains an advanced degree is positively associated with the percentage of faculty

at her undergrad institution who are female. As with the earlier secondary school studies,

many of these results are prone to possible omitted variables bias and apply only to

limited cases. Bettinger and Long (2005) improved on this earlier work by using within

course and student variation. They examined the impact of same-sex instructors on the

choice of major and course credits and find small positive effects for females. Their data,

however, did not allow them to explore interaction effects on more immediate classroom

outcomes, such as course dropout and grade.

       The existing research on the role of gender in higher education has been

significantly hampered by lack of appropriate data. Most of the earlier studies are limited

to small samples and prone to possible omitted variables bias. The data used in this paper

provides better identification of student-teacher gender interactions in college,

specifically at the classroom level. We use both within student and within class variation

to estimate average counterfactual outcomes from male and female students assigned to

male or female teachers. Our focus on large first-year undergraduate classes where

teachers do not grade students’ exams and students do not typically receive differential

treatment from teachers, allows us to more confidently isolate gender interaction effects




                                            6
due to role-model effects rather than discrimination effects. In addition, by focussing on

college we examine the extent to which gender interactions exist at later ages. Many

social scientists wonder whether role model effects function mostly at young ages, and

whether encounters at later ages can have any significant impact on social-economic

success.   Lastly, our paper speaks directly to the debate about increasing female

representation in male-dominated fields.




III. Data and Statistical Methodology



       Our study uses detailed student and instructor administrative data from the

University of Toronto’s Arts and Science Faculty. The data cover the Fall and Winter

school year periods between 1996 and 2005. We focus on the 34,352 students that

entered into full-time undergraduate programs from Ontario high schools, and were 17 to

20 years old on September 1 in the year of entry. We also focus on the 88 largest first

year courses with at least 50 students in a section. This sample includes 85 percent of all

first-year classes.   Focussing on large courses minimizes the possibility that results

depend on small and anomalous classes, and helps speed statistical computation.

       We have enrolment data that include gender, date of birth, mother tongue,

citizenship, entering program of study, and high-school grades. We also have data for

registration status at the start of each Fall and Winter term, the number of credits students

are enrolled in, financial status with the university, cumulative and current Grade Point

Average (GPA), program of study, and graduation status. Our course data contain




                                             7
information on courses enrolled in and credits received for each year and each course.

The data distinguish between course enrolment status on September 1, November 1,

January 1, March 1, and the most current status. An advantage of this file is that it allows

us to match to courses that students enrolled in before their first day of class, regardless

of whether they completed the course or not. The course data also includes section

information and final grade received, and is matched to instructors. We also use a number

of objective and subjective teacher quality measures such as instructor rank and average

evaluation score.2

           We first estimate gender interactions for male and female students separately.

Our initial empirical model takes on the following specification:



(1)         yikt = β * f _ instructorikt + δ i + δ k + δ t + uikt



where yikt is a classroom or subject-specific outcome for student i taking course k in

school year t , f _ instructorikt is an indicator variable for whether a teacher have the is

female, δ i , δ k , and δ t are fixed effects for student, course, and year respectively, and uikt

is the error term. β measures the average effect from assignment to a female versus male

instructor, and captures both a gender interaction effect and an instructor quality effect (if

males and females teach differently). The difference between the β coefficient for the

female sample compared to male sample is the relative gender difference predicted from

assignment to a female versus male instructor.

    See also Hoffmann and Oreopoulos (2006) for more description of related data.


                                                        8
       To explore the importance of unobserved student and teacher characteristics, we

replace student fixed effects with individual controls. We also explore the sensitivity of

these estimates when including female indicators instead of fixed effects, and time-of-day

controls. Remaining potential selection biases are mitigated by focusing on large classes

with multiple sections where the final instructor allocation is not indicated in course

calendars, and by focusing on first year students that have limited flexibility in choosing

courses. We also explore (and find similar) results from using courses with only one

instructor per year. This further removes students’ ability to target particular courses.

       Our data also allow for classroom fixed effects using the following specification:



(2)     yic = δ * f _ studentic * f _ instructoric + θ kg + δ i + δ c + uic




where yic is a classroom or subject-specific outcome for student i in classroom c,

f _ studentic is an indicator variable for whether a student is female, δ i , and δ c are fixed

effects for student and course respectively, and θ kg are course by gender fixed effects.

These last controls allow gender differences in performance that are not attributable to

teacher differences to vary across subjects courses. These are necessary to account for

the possibility that the courses in which males and females tend to diverge are also the

courses in which instructors tend to be more likely male or more likely female. The

coefficient δ reflects the average outcome gain for females, relative to males, from

assignment to a female versus male instructor or, conversely, the average outcome loss

for males, relative to females, from assignment to a female versus male instructor.




                                                  9
         Focusing on first-year students helps minimize gender-based course selection for

two reasons. First, first year students cannot easily identify instructors, and especially

gender of instructors, prior to enrollment. Course calendars at the University of Toronto

usually do not indicate the instructor teaching the class, and when they do, only first

initials are included.        Second, first year students are inexperienced about teacher

allocation mechanisms of the university and cannot rely either on their own or peer

groups’ past experience. We also restrict our sample to full year and first semester

courses. Dropping courses taken in the second semester further minimizes opportunities

for selecting courses by instructor. Students are matched to classes chosen before the

first week of school. For purposes of comparison, we also include in the appendix

separate and pooled results using second year classes. The possibility of selecting classes

based on instructor is greater in second year, but the variety of courses and instructors

teaching them is greater.

         For our main sample, we tested for evidence of gender-specific selection by

regressing the fraction of female students in a section on whether an instructor was

female, conditioning on course or course-by-year fixed effects. There was no significant

relationship.3 The proportion of females in a class was consistently uncorrelated with the

gender of the instructor under all specifications we tried. In addition, we estimated

equation (2) with a student’s high school grade as the outcome variable, and without

student fixed effects. As expected in the absence of gender specific sorting, we found no

  Details of these results are available on request. The coefficient from regressing the fraction of female
students in a first year classroom on whether an instructor was female, with course and year fixed effects is
0.004, with a standard error of 0.006. Results were similar when using course by year fixed effects or
adding instructor and student background characteristics as controls.


                                                     10
relative differences in high school grades between males and females within classrooms.4

        We use four student outcome variables at the student by course level: Whether

students dropped the course (“Dropped Course”), the grade received for students that

completed the course (“Grade”), the number of additional courses students take in the

same subject in all subsequent years (“Subject Course, Subsequent Years”), and the

number of subsequent credits received in the same subject in all subsequent years,

(“Subject Credits, Subsequent Years”). To receive a credit requires both taking a course

and passing it. Other than the binary variable, “Dropped Course”, all variables are

normalized for each course to have mean zero and standard deviation one.

        Table 1 presents summary descriptive statistics for the sample of entering first

year full time students between 1996 and 2004. The main dataset has one observation per

student-class.    Each student takes 4.2 half and full-year classes, on average.                  After

restricting the sample to large full year and first semester classes, and dropping classes

co-taught by male and female instructors, the average number of classes per student in

our sample is 2.6. Sixty percent of first-year students are female. Fourteen percent of

them take courses in math (usually calculus) compared to 17 percent of males. Sixteen

percent of females take courses in chemistry and physics, compared to 15 percent of

males. Notably, substantially fewer females compared to males take courses in business,

economics, and computer science, but more take courses in psychology and sociology.

Twenty-three percent of first-year instructors are female (24 percent, on average, per

course). There are 1,450 classes within 88 courses over this 9 year period, with 16.8

classes on average per course, and 2.4 classes on average per course in each year. The

  The coefficient from regressing high school grade average (in a student’s last year) on the interaction
between being a female student and facing a female instructor, with female student, course-by-female-
student, and classroom fixed effects is 0.03 percent, with a standard error of 0.16.

table indicates that course dropout and performance does not differ noticeably by gender

across first year courses. Second year statistics are presented for comparison. By the

second year, female students are slightly less likely to drop courses, have higher average

grades and acquire less course credits than their male fellow students.




IV. Results



       Table 2 presents estimates of equation (2) separately for male and female

students.   In the first two columns we regress student achievement on whether an

instructor is female, controlling for course and school year. For females, we estimate no

significant difference in the likelihood of dropping a class based on whether the instructor

is male or female. Males, on the other hand, are about 1.8 percentage points more likely

to drop a course when beginning a course with a female instructor. The difference

between the female and male student effects is the predicted relative effect between

gender groups from facing a female instead of male instructor.            The second set of

columns shows results from including student controls for students’ last year of high

school average grade, program of study, and age, and the third set of columns shows

results from including student fixed effects across courses. Neither of these alternative

specifications alters the point estimates by very much.

       Without conditioning for student background, males perform slightly better, on

average, with a male instructor. The estimated relative gain to male students from

assignment to a male instructor is about 5 percent of a standard deviation, without student




                                            12
controls. This translates into a 0.6 percentage point increase in expected grade (out of

100 percent). When student controls or fixed effects are added, the estimated effect falls

further, and we cannot reject that the estimated effect is zero. The relative effect falls and

becomes statistically insignificant when student fixed effects are added, in part because

the estimated effect from females with a female instructor is slightly negative.

       Table 3 presents results after pooling males and females in the same regression.

Column 1 shows the coefficient estimates of the female-student-female-instructor

interaction, including course fixed effects and student background controls. These results

are the same ones listed in column 6 of Table 1. They show the expected change in

average achievement for females relative to males from assignment to a female

instructor. This can also be interpreted as the expected relative loss in average male

achievement from assignment to a female instructor. The coefficients in column 2 are the

same ones listed in column 9 of Table 2 from including student fixed effects instead of

student controls.

       Pooling males and females together allows for classroom fixed effects. With

classroom fixed effects and student controls in column 3, females are about 1 percentage

point less likely than males in the same class to drop a course in a class with a female

instructor. Conversely, males are 1 percentage point less likely than females to drop a

class if the instructor is male.    The 95 percent confidence region for these effects,

however, includes zero. With classroom fixed effects and student controls, the difference

between female and male average grade performance is 3.8 percent of a standard

deviation higher (0.4 percentage points) with a female instructor. With both classroom

and student fixed effects, the estimated effect is zero. Turning to subject interest, relative




                                             13
differences in male and female likelihood of taking related courses in subsequent years,

and passing these courses, appear generally unaffected by whether a female or male

teaches a first-year class.

        Table 4 presents the results for sub-populations by mother tongue, type of course,

and initial ability. For comparison, the first row replicates baseline findings in Table 3.

The point estimates provide imprecise evidence that the estimated same-sex instructor

effects on grade performance and course completion are larger for native English

speaking students than for non-English speaking students, and smaller for math and

science instructors than for social science instructors. In general, all the point estimates

are small and mostly insignificant. We do not find evidence that the effects depend on

students’ initial ability (using high school entry grade as a proxy).5




V. Sample Selection for Grade Outcomes



        Estimation of gender-interaction effects in college on grades is possible only for

the sample of students that write the final exam. Table 2 suggests that the propensity to

drop a course is affected by gender interactions as well. This creates a sample selection

problem, formally described by the following set of equations:

(3)      Gradeic = δ grade * f _ student ic * f _ instructoric + θ kcgrade + δ igrade + δ cgrade + u kcgrade




5
 We repeat the analysis for a sample of second year students and for a pooled sample of first and second
year students.


                                                     14
(4)

Dropped ic = δ dropped * f _ student ic * f _ instructoric + θ kcdropped + δ idropped + δ cdropped + u kcdropped


(5)      Grade kc = 1[ Dropout kc ≥ 0] * Grade kc* .



Equations (3) and (4) replicate equation (2) for “Grade” and “Dropped Course” as

outcome variable, while equation (5) accounts for the potential selection bias. OLS-

estimates of the parameter of interest, δ grade , is biased if δ dropped is different from zero.

Our earlier analysis indicates that female students are indeed less likely to drop a course,

relative to male students, when the class is taught by a female teacher (and vice versa).

        Correcting for sample selection is difficult in our case since any variable affecting

dropout behavior arguably also affects potential grades. Without exclusion restrictions,

identification in a standard Heckman-selection model is solely based on the non-linearity

of the correction term. Instead of relying on this source of variation we estimate upper

bounds of δ grade using a procedure similar to the ones described by Krueger and

Whitmore (2002) and Lee (2005).

        In general, OLS-estimates are downward biased if relatively more students stay to

complete a course when the instructor is of the same sex, and if these marginal students

are from the left tail of the grade distribution. We can therefore estimate an upper bound

of δ grade when applying OLS to a sample without the ( δ dropped *100)-percent worst

female students (relative to males) from female-taught classes.

        We therefore apply the following procedure: In the first step we estimate dropout

equations following the same specifications as in table 2. This provides us with an




                                                     15
estimate of δ dropped , the female-male student difference in dropout behavior when taught

by a female teacher. We then calculate the ( δ dropped *100) percentile of the female-grade

distribution for every class taught by a female teacher and drop all female students with a

final grade lower than this percentile. Since we are focusing on selection due to the

relative difference from having a female versus a male instructor between female and

male students we do not need to trim marginal male students. In the second step we use

this restricted sample to estimate the same equation as in the first step, but with final

grade replacing the dropout variable.

       The first set of columns in Table 5 presents these results. The upper bound effect

on relative grade performance by gender is about 5 to 7 percent of a standard deviation.

Thus, if same-sex instructors increase course completion for students at the bottom of the

class, accounting for this selection leads to a small, but no longer insignificant gender

interaction effect on grades. Expected grades may increase by up to 0.6 to 0.8 percentage

points from being matched to a same-sex instructor.

       In the second set of columns in Table 5, we repeat the same selection analysis, but

from estimating the first-stage regression for each course separately. This yields course-

specific estimates of ( δ dropped *100), which are then used to trim the female-taught grade

distributions within the same course. Since every student is allowed to take every course

only once, a specification including individual fixed effects is not identified in this case.

Table 5 reveals that the upper bound effect on grade performance is similar: assignment

to a same sex instructor, leaving out students that finished the course because of same-sex

assignment, increases relative grade performance by about 5 percent of a standard

deviation (0.6 percentage points).      These results suggest that, under conservative



                                             16
estimates that account for course completion effects, assignment to a same-sex instructor

improves expected grade performance, but not by an amount that would substantially

impact a student’s GPA.




VI. Conclusion



       In this paper, we address the importance of gender interactions between teachers

and students at the college level to explain educational performance and subject interest.

Our detailed administrative dataset from a large public university provides a rare

opportunity to predict how classroom outcomes between males and females

systematically differ depending on whether an instructor assigned to the class is male or

female. Using within class variation for students taking multiple courses, we find that

students react only marginally to an instructor’s gender. Students taught by a same-sex

instructor are about one percentage point less likely to drop a course (a 10 percent change

from the mean). Relative grade performance is about 1 to 5 percent of a standard

deviation better for students with a same-sex instructor. The small effects appear driven

more by males performing worse when assigned to a female instructor, with females

performing about the same.       We also find no important influence from same-sex

instructors on taking or passing subsequent courses in related subjects.

       Our grade score estimates are somewhat smaller than the 5 to 10 percent standard

deviation effects reported by Dee (2007) at the primary school level (using similar

methodology), but not by much. Two possibilities may explain the difference. First,




                                            17
same-sex instructors may matter more at earlier ages, when development of cognitive and

non-cognitive ability occurs more rapidly. Second, reactions from students over the

gender of a teacher may matter less than reactions from teachers over the gender of a

student. As mentioned earlier, college instructors do not typically interact on a one-on-

one basis with students in large first year classes and do not typically grade tests, so there

is less chance of discrimination. Another result that matches some of Dee’s findings is

that the interaction effect seems to stem more from male students performing worse with

female instructors, while female performance appears unaffected.

       We interpret these findings to suggest instructor gender plays only a minor role in

determining college student achievement. Most of our baseline estimates imply that

expected changes to performance and subject interest are small from same-sex instructor

assignment, and many of these estimates are statistically insignificant. The small effects

we do detect appear more due to social science courses than math or physical science

courses, and do not appear to differ by initial student ability.        It should be noted,

however, that all the estimates in this paper relate to cases where one instructor is

replaced at the margin for another who differs by gender. We cannot explore potential

non-linear effects from more dramatic changes in the proportion of male or female

faculty in a department or institution with this methodology.

       The results are consistent with our earlier research [Hoffmann and Oreopoulos,

2006], which finds that observable instructor characteristics, such as rank, experience,

and salary, do not explain differences in student performance. Subjective instructor

quality, however, does predict these differences, although overall instructor effects are




                                             18
small. Hard-to-measure instructor qualities may matter more in predicting achievement,

even for instructors that exhibit the same age, salary, rank, and gender.

Notes: The table shows uncorrected and sample-selection corrected estimates for the gender interaction when
grade is used as outcome variable. We first estimate the gender-interaction in dropout-regressions (not shown in
table). The estimate provides us with the x-percentage difference of the propensity to drop the course between
female and male students when taught by a female teacher. We calculate x-percentage quintiles of the female
grade distribution in female taught classes and drop all female students with grades below this quintile. Our
upper-bound estimates come from regressions on the restricted sample. The first three rows show estimates
when we trim the overall female grade distribution in female-taught classes. The last three rows repeat the
analysis when we trim course-specific distributions instead. In this case, the specification with individual fixed
effects is not identified. Each cell reports the coefficient of the student-teacher gender interaction from a
separate linear probability regression. All regressions include course-by-gender fixed effects. Student controls
are: highschool grade average and fixed effects for academic year, age, mother tongue and program enrolled.
One, two, and three astricies indicate statistical significance at the 10, 5, and 1 percent levels respectively.
