The Anatomy of a Trade Collapse: The UK, 1929-33

                                          ABSTRACT

A recent literature explores the nature and causes of the collapse in international trade during
2008 and 2009. The decline was particularly great for automobiles and industrial supplies; it
occurred largely along the intensive margin; quantities fell by more than prices; and prices fell
less for differentiated products. Do these stylised facts apply to trade collapses more generally?
This paper uses detailed, commodity specific information on UK imports between 1929 and
1933, to see to what extent the trade collapses of the Great Depression and Great Recession
resembled each other. It also compares the free trading trade collapse of 1929-31 with the
protectionist collapse of 1931-3, to see to what extent protection, and gradual recovery from the
Great Depression, mattered for UK trade patterns. Deflation was a feature of the 1930s trade
collapse, and after 1931 protectionism made the UK's trade collapse geographically unbalanced.
Many other features of the two trade collapses are remarkably similar, however. Both took place
along the intensive rather than the extensive margin; the same types of goods were particularly
badly hit in both instances; and prices of differentiated durable manufactured goods barely fell on
either occasion.

Introduction
The “Great Trade Collapse” (GTC) of 2008-9 has given rise to an extensive
literature analyzing its nature and causes (a notable early contribution was
Baldwin, 2009). Several stylized facts about the collapse are now commonly
accepted:1
    First, there was no great increase in protection during the GTC, implying
that protection can only have played a modest role in explaining it (Kee et al.,
2011).
    Second, the GTC was by far the most severe post-war trade collapse, and
stands out as being unusually synchronized (Martins and Araújo, 2009).
    Third, the GTC was far more the result of a decline in the quantity of
goods traded, than of a fall in traded goods prices (Levchenko et al., 2010;
Bricongne et al., 2012).
    Fourth, the GTC was overwhelmingly due to changes along the intensive
margin, rather than the extensive margin (as predicted by Schott, 2009; see
Levchenko et al., 2010; Haddad et al., 2010; Bricongne et al., 2012).2
    Fifth, the GTC saw imports in some sectors fall more rapidly than others.
Trade in goods fell by much more than trade in services; trade in automobiles
and industrial supplies fell a lot, while trade in consumer goods and agricul-
tural goods fell by a lot less (Levchenko et al., 2010; Bricongne et al., 2012);
durable goods trade fell by more than non-durable goods trade (Levchenko
et al., 2010; Gopinath et al., 2012).3 It is commonly accepted that such com-
positional effects can help to explain the size of the GTC, especially when
taken in conjunction with the existence of vertical supply chains and inter-
   1
      Stylized facts two through five below are discussed by Bems et al. (2013).
   2
      That is, it was due more to exports of previously traded goods falling (but not van-
ishing), than to a decline in the number of goods exported. This is consistent with the
more general argument of Bernard et al. (2009) that short-run (i.e. one-year) changes in
trade over time are dominated by changes in the intensive margin.
    3
      Chen and Juvenal (2015) provide evidence that high quality Argentinian wine exports
fell by more than low quality exports, and suggest that this may be indicative of a broader
phenomenon.


                                            1
industry linkages (O’Rourke, 2009; Bems et al., 2010, 2011; Bussière et al.,
2013; Bems et al., 2013; Eaton et al., 2016).
     Sixth, the relative contributions of price and quantity to the GTC varied
across sectors. In the case of the US, import and export prices of differ-
entiated goods barely declined, implying that the entire fall in the value of
differentiated goods trade was due to a fall in quantity; non-differentiated
goods prices fell significantly, however, and thus contributed to the trade
collapse in those products (Gopinath et al., 2012; see also Haddad et al.,
2010).
     And seventh, Levchenko et al. (2010) find that in the case of the US, the
collapse in trade was geographically quite well-balanced, in the sense that
imports and exports fell by a lot for all major trading partners.
     It would be nice to know if these stylized facts reflect the idiosyncratic
features of the world economy in 2008, or if they are in some sense “typical” of
great trade collapses. It is difficult to know, absent information on other great
trade collapses, which is why it is surprising that there has not been more
research to date comparing the experience of 2008-9 with that of the Great
Depression. In an early contribution, written in “real time”, Eichengreen
and O’Rourke (2009) explicitly compared the output and trade collapses of
the Great Depression and Great Recession: they found that at the time of
writing (April 2009), world industrial output was falling as steeply as it had
done during the first year of the Great Depression, while world trade was
falling even more sharply (Figure 1). However, shortly afterwards the Great
Recession bottomed out, reflecting the superior macroeconomic response of
2009, as compared with its interwar counterpart.
     Almunia et al. (2010) took the comparison further, and highlighted the
potential importance of compositional factors in explaining the violence of
the GTC. During the interwar period, the world economy was still largely
divided between an industrial “North” and a primary-commodity-producing
“South”, while during the Great Depression it was industrial output (along

with output of semi-manufactured raw materials and non-agricultural pri-
mary products) that collapsed, not agricultural output (which remained sta-
ble). Similarly, it was manufacturing trade, rather than non-manufacturing
trade, that collapsed after 1929. These divergent trends in output and trade
translated into a terms of trade gain for the North, and a terms of trade col-
lapse for the South, but they also had implications for the overall magnitude
of the trade collapse. Almunia et al. (2010) point out that while manufactur-
ing accounted for 70% of world merchandise trade in 2007, it only accounted
for 44% in 1929. Had the composition of interwar trade been the same as in
2007, the trade collapse of 1929-30 would have been as big as that experienced
during 2008-9.
    Since then, there has been comparatively little work comparing the GTC
with the trade collapse of 1929-33.4 In particular, no-one has asked whether
the earlier trade collapse shared the same features as the later one. This
paper does that, using detailed information from a variety of sources on UK
trade between 1929 and 1933. We find that while several stylized facts are
common to both episodes, others are not. Some of the divergence between
the two episodes is due to the shift towards protection which occurred in the
UK at the end of 1931, and so one focus of the paper will be to contrast the
largely free trading trade collapse of 1929-31 with the protectionist collapse
of 1931-33.5 We thus begin with a discussion of UK trade policy.

McKenna Duty, the 1920 Dyestuffs Industry Act, the 1921 Safeguarding of

of interwar British trade policy and its consequences.

Industries Act, and so forth), British trade policy remained predominantly
liberal until 1931. However, in November of that year the Abnormal Im-
portations Act allowed the Board of Trade to impose tariffs of up to 100%
ad valorem on manufactured goods from outside the Empire, and the Hor-
ticultural Products (Emergency Duties) Act soon allowed the Minister of
Agriculture to impose similar duties on non-Empire fruit, flowers and veg-
etables.
    In February 1932 an Import Duties Act imposed a general 10% tariff on
goods not already subject to duties, though some important primary imports
were exempted. Goods from British colonies were exempted, while imports
from the self-governing Dominions were temporarily exempted pending the
outcome of the Ottawa conference due to begin in July. The new Import
Duties Advisory Committee could impose additional duties.
    The Ottawa conference led to a series of bilateral trade agreements be-
tween the participants, the UK signing agreements with Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, India and Southern Rhodesia.
Broadly speaking, Britain agreed to maintain or raise tariffs imposed on for-
eign imports under the terms of the 1932 Import Duties Act, and not to
reduce the 10% ad valorem tariff without the consent of the Dominions; to
continue to exempt Empire products from these tariffs; and to introduce or
enhance Imperial Preference on a wide range of agricultural commodities and
raw materials of special interest to the Dominions, by raising duties or by
protecting goods that had previously been duty free such as wheat. In ad-
dition, quotas were introduced for several agricultural commodities, on the
basis that policy needed to serve the interests of “the home producer first,
Empire producers second, and foreign producers last” Richardson (1936, p.
138).
    de Bromhead et al. (2017) analyse a sample of 258 goods imported into
the UK from 42 countries, between 1924 and 1938. The sample accounts for
roughly half of total British imports, and is representative of British imports

during the period. UK imports during this period can be usefully divided into
four broad categories: agricultural products such as wheat or meat; manu-
factured goods such as copper or machinery; raw materials such as coal,
fertilizers, raw cotton or oilseeds; and “exotic” or “colonial” goods, on which
revenue tariffs were levied. (Tariffs on goods such as tea, coffee, sugar and
tobacco were traditionally very high, reflecting highly inelastic demand.)7
Figure 2 plots the share of imports in each of these four broad categories
that were subject to duties of one kind or another during the interwar pe-
riod. As can be seen, the shift towards protection in 1931 mostly involved an
increase in agricultural tariffs (which had been previously non-existent) and
manufacturing tariffs. Figure 3 shows that these tariffs discriminated heavily
in favour of Empire countries, and against the rest of the world. Empire sup-
pliers faced no agricultural tariffs at all after 1931, and manufacturing tariffs
averaging less than five percent, while foreign countries faced steadily rising
agricultural tariffs (as well as quotas in some sectors), and manufacturing
tariffs averaging over 20 percent.
    In summary: the UK trade collapse of 1929-33 took place under two
very different trade policy regimes, a broadly liberal one from 1929-31, and
a protectionist one from 1931-33 which saw not only a substantial increase
in protection, but active discrimination in favour of the British Empire, and
against the rest of the world. The first stylized fact about the GTC clearly
does not apply to the interwar period.
    7
      Raw silk and petroleum were also included in this category, since although they were
raw materials, they became subject to tariffs that were much higher than the tariffs applied
to raw materials generally, presumably for revenue-raising reasons. Full details of this four-
category classification are provided in de Bromhead et al. (2017), Appendix 1.

2    The 1929-33 trade collapse in comparative
     perspective
How did the trade collapse of 1929-33 compare with previous and subsequent
declines in trade, including the trade collapse of 2008-9? Figure 4 plots annual
log changes in the value of UK imports since 1870, while Figure 5 provides
similar information for UK exports. The data were taken from the Bank
of England’s Three Centuries database (Bank of England, 2016, accessed 21
March 2017.) The two shaded areas represent the two world wars, while the
two vertical dashed red lines represent the onset of the Great Depression in
1929, and the Great Recession in 2008. As can be seen, the largest one year
drop in the value of imports during this period came in 1921 (0.53 log points).
However, the cumulative 4 year decline from 1929 to 1933 was slightly larger
(0.54 log points). By contrast, the decline in 2009 was much smaller (just
0.076 log points, as compared with 0.142 log points in 1930). The contrast
between the trade collapses of the Great Depression and Great Recession
emerges even more clearly when it comes to exports. Once again, the largest
single fall in the value of trade came in 1921 (0.61 log points), while the
cumulative decline from 1929-33 was 0.65 log points, and exports fell in 2009
by just 0.054 log points (as compared with 0.216 log points in 1930).
    Finally, Figure 6 plots import and export shares of GDP in the UK. As
can be seen, the plunge in the trade ratio after 1929 dwarfs both even the
1921 decline, while the ratio actually rose after 2008 (only declining in 2014).
    1921 aside, the Great Depression clearly stands out as the the period
that saw the greatest UK trade collapse over the past century and a half. In
comparison, the UK’s Great Recession trade collapse was a much smaller,
and shorter-lived affair.

The nature of the 1929-33 and 2008-9 trade collapses were very different.
The Great Depression saw substantial deflation, while the Great Recession
did not. Prices of food and raw materials, in particular, fell sharply across
the globe after 1929, while manufacturing prices fell by less. Given the inter-
national division of labour of the time, between a manufacturing-exporting
North and a primary-product-exporting South, this implied that the terms
of trade moved sharply in favour of the former, and against the latter. These
forces were very much at work in the case of the UK. In 1929, manufactures

   Figures 7 and 8 plot annual log changes in import and export prices,
respectively, from 1870 to 2015. Once again 1921 stands out as an exceptional
year, but that episode aside, import price declines were greater during the
Great Depression than at any other time. Export price falls during 1929-33
were less exceptional, but were still substantial. In sharp contrast, import
and export prices actually increased slightly in 2009. Figure 9 shows the
impressive improvement in the UK’s terms of trade after 1929.
   Given the magnitude of price declines during the Great Depression, trade
quantities fell by substantially less than trade values. Figures 10 and 11 plot
annual log changes in the volume of UK imports and exports, respectively.
As can be seen, the volume of UK imports remained steady in 1930 and 1931,
before dropping by 0.114 log points in 1932. This decline was, admittedly,

smaller than those experienced, not only in 1921 as before (0.125 log points),
but in 1917, 1941, and 1942. On the other hand, it was slightly larger than
the decline experienced in 2009 (0.096 log points). Once again, 1921 aside,
1932 saw the greatest peacetime decline in UK imports, expressed in volume
terms, during the period (though 1929 was not far behind). Export volumes
fell by even more during the Great Depression: by a cumulative 0.37 log
points during 1930 and 1931, as compared with 0.091 log points in 2008-9
(and 0.23 log points in 1921).
    Table summarises the discussion to date. Falling import prices accounted
for no less than 83% of the decline in the value of imports between 1929 and
1933. They accounted for essentially all of the decline in every year bar 1932,
when they only accounted for 40%. Falling export prices accounted for 42%
of the export collapse during the Great Depression. In sharp contrast, the
UK trade collapse during the Great Recession was entirely accounted for by

not apply to the earlier episode.


4                                        Intensive versus extensive margins
What were the relative contributions of the intensive and extensive margins
to the Great Depression trade collapse? In order to answer this question, we
need detailed information on commodity-level trade, by country. As already
mentioned, in a companion paper (de Bromhead et al., 2017) we construct
such a dataset, for a sample of 258 product categories imported from 42
countries. The data for 1929-33 are taken from the 1933 volume of the
Annual Statement of the Trade of the United Kingdom (Statistical Office,
H.M. Customs and Excise Department, 1935). The number of varieties (i.e.
particular goods imported from particular countries) imported into the UK

was 1338 in 1929, 1354 in 1930, 1339 in 1931, 1319 in 1932 and 1298 in 1933.
The total number of varieties imported was thus stable between 1929 and
1931, the years when the bulk of the decline in trade took place, and fell by
only 3% between 1929 and 1933.
   Alternatively, we can decompose the decline in UK imports between 1929
and 1933 in the manner of Kehoe and Ruhl (2013, p. 380). When we compute
the log change of the total imports of those varieties which are traded in
both years, which we take to be the intensive margin, and compare this with
the log change in the total value of all imports, we find that the intensive
margin can account for the entire decline in trade.This is true not only for
imports overall, but for trade coming from both the Empire and the rest of
the world. Despite the many differences between the two trade collapses, the
fourth stylized fact about the GTC seems to apply to the interwar period as
well. Indeed, it applies not just at a one or two year horizon, but at a longer
4 year horizon as well.


5    The composition of two great trade collapses
Levchenko et al. (2010) divide US trade flows during the GTC into 10 cate-
gories, depending on sector and end-use, and distinguishing between durable

                                      15
and non-durable goods. These are: foods, feeds, and beverages; industrial
supplies and materials (both durable, and non-durable); petroleum and prod-
ucts; automotive vehicles, engines, and parts; other consumer goods (both
durable, and non-durable); other capital goods (aircraft, computers, and
other); and other goods. They find that trade in automobiles declined very
sharply, on both the export and import side; that trade in industrial supplies
was also particularly badly hit; that the value of petroleum imports (there
were no exports) fell more than any other category; and that trade fell by
much less in the food and consumer goods categories (especially non-durable
consumer goods).
    Did these divergent trends reflected a variety of idiosyncratic factors, or
more fundamental features of the economy, having to do, for example, with
investor and consumer responses in the face of a large and unexpected shock,
or the differential impact of credit constraints on various sectors? The official
UK trade statistics break down UK exports and imports into 1418 and 1627
categories, respectively (not including parcel post which we excluded from the
analysis) (Statistical Office, H.M. Customs and Excise Department, 1935).
We divided these trade flows into the same 9 categories as Levchenko et al.
(2010) (that is to say, we excluded computers, which were not relevant in the
earlier period).9 The classifications used by Levchenko et al. (2010), as well
as by Gopinath et al. (2012) (see later), are based on the “Net Exports of
Goods and Services” account in the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. We use the
tables provided in the NIPA handbook (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2016,
Tables 8-B, 5-A and 6-B) to match British interwar trade data onto these
classifications.10 We distinguish between durable and non-durable goods in
   9
      There were only ten computers, properly defined, in the world by 1946 (Marks, 2016,
p. 178)
   10
      To    do    this,   the   fine-grained    North      American     Industrial  Clas-
sification     System      (NAICS)       underlying      NIPA       was      used    (see
http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/subjects/standard/naics/2017/introduction),         and es-
pecially the detailed 2017 North American Product Classification System (NAPCS) table


                                           16
the same way as the Bureau of Economic Analysis (2016, p. 5-4) BEA (2016,
chapter 5, p. 5-4), defining durable goods as those that have “an average
useful life of at least 3 years”.11 Finally, we calculated the decline in trade for
each of these nine categories, for both 1929-31 and 1931-33.
    The results are plotted in Figure 12. In both panels, the percentage
changes in trade during the GTC, taken from Levchenko et al. (2010), are
plotted on the horizontal axis, while percentage changes in trade during the
Great Depression are plotted on the vertical axis. The top panel plots the cu-
mulative changes between 1929 and 1931, while the lower panel plots changes
during 1931-33. Sectors experiencing larger percentage declines in output are
shown on the left (2008-9) or bottom (1929-33) of the graphs.
    As can be seen, the composition of the 2008-9 American, and 1929-31 UK,
trade collapses was strikingly similar, despite the fact that we are considering
two different countries in very different eras. Automobiles and industrial
supplies were the most affected in both cases, consumer goods and food the
least. The correlation across categories between the extent of the import
collapse is positive and strong. The correlation is also clearly positive for
exports, with trade in industrial supplies and automobiles being severely hit
in both crises, and aircraft and consumer non-durables not being as badly
affected.
    The lower panel of Figure 12 tells a different story however: the cross-
category correlation between the US GTC, and the UK trade collapse of 1931-
33, was actually negative. One possible explanation is protectionism; another
is the fact that the British economy started to recover following the UK’s
available at https://www.naics.com/napcs-north-american-product-classification-system/
(last accessed 24 June 2017). This links products to NAICS defined industries.
   11
      To distinguish durable from non-durable goods we used the Statistics Canada
Variant of NAICS 2012 - Durable / non-durable manufacturing industries available
at http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD=128494 (last ac-
cessed 24 June 2017). We grouped raw materials according to the durability/non-
durability of the intermediate and final goods produced by the main industries transform-
ing them, which is consistent with NIPA. In practice, we follow the same classification as
the post-2009 literature we are referring to.

departure from gold in September 1931. The fact that the value of investment
fell more sharply in both periods than did the value of consumption perhaps
argues more in favour of the former than the latter explanation (Feinstein,
1972, Table 2, p. T9). Whatever the reason, the reversal of the correlation
between the two periods is striking, and reflects, for example, the fact that
consumer goods imports plumetted after 1931. We would argue that the
1929-31 experience more clearly matches that of 2008-9: this was a trade
collapse coinciding with a more general economic collapse, in a broadly free-
trading environment. And so it is suggestive that the composition of the
1929-31 and 2008-9 trade collapses was so similar.


6          Price changes during the two trade collapses
The sixth stylized fact regarding the GTC of 2008-9 has to do with the
differing price changes for different types of goods. In particular, Gopinath
et al. (2012) find that while US exports and imports of non-differentiated
goods saw a 16% price decline on average, differentiated goods prices fell on
average by approximately only 1%. Was this an idiosyncratic feature of the
US economy in 2008-9, or did something similar occur in 1929-33?
    It was possible to calculate unit values for 1196 of the 1418 export cat-
egories listed in the UK trade statistics, and for 1329 of the 1627 import
categories. Since unit values are famously volatile, we followed Gopinath
et al. (2012, p. 307) and excluded all unit value series where prices changed
by more than 2 log points. This left us with 1191 export price series, and 1327
import price series. We then classified these price series in the same way as
Gopinath et al., distinguishing between manufactures and non-manufactures,
and then classifying manufactured goods by end-use; by durability; and by
whether the goods were differentiated or not, using the classification in Rauch
(1999).12 Goods that could not be unambiguously assigned to one category
    12
         We did so using the same sources as those listed in footnote 10.


                                                19
were excluded from the analysis.13 Finally, we calculated the median price
change within each category.
    The results are presented in Table 2. As can be seen, non-differentiated
export and import prices fell by roughly 15-17% between 1929 and 1931,
rather similar to the price changes experienced during 2008-9. However, dif-
ferentiated goods prices also fell, though by much less (9-10%).14 Breaking
these aggregate findings down, it seems as though the big difference between
2008-9 and 1929-31 concerned non-manufactures, and nondurable manufac-
tured goods. For these two broad categories, prices of differentiated and
non-differentiated goods fell by very similar amounts between 1929 and 1931.
However, prices for durable, differentiated, manufactured goods only fell by
2-3%, much less than the 14-15% price decline for non-differentiated durable
manufactures. It seems as though what was true more broadly in 2008-9 was
only true for durable manufactures in 1929-31.
    Prices also fell more for non-differentiated than for differentiated imports
between 1931 and 1933,15 and prices did not fall at all for differentiated,
durable, imported manufactured goods. The two sub-periods thus resembled
each other on the import side. However, export prices fell by more for differ-
entiated than for non-differentiated goods, and in particular for nondurable
manufactures and durable intermediate goods.16 We have no explanation
for this apparent anomaly, though we recall that the second interwar sub-
period was also an outlier when it came to the composition of the trade
collapse (Section 5). It may also be that some goods that were classified by
Rauch as non-differentiated in the late 20th century were in fact differenti-
ated during the interwar period, since standardization might not yet have
occurred in those particular product categories. In that case, Table 2 may
  13
     These were typically goods described as “not elsewhere specified”. Keeping these goods
in the analysis, and allocating their price changes to all relevant categories, left the results
almost entirely unchanged. Details available on request.

     The differences are statistically significant at the 5% level using Mood’s median test.

7        The geography of two trade collapses
Levchenko et al. (2010) find, for the US, that the GTC was remarkably
balanced across trading partners. Was the same true for the UK during
1929-33? Table 3 gives the percentage changes in nominal trade flows for
each of the four broad categories defined in Section 1, distinguishing between
exports to and imports from the British Empire, on the one hand, and the
rest of the world on the other.
    As can be seen, between 1929 and 1931 the trade collapse was geographi-
cally balanced, in the sense that trade flows between the UK and the Empire
fell by roughly the same amount as trade flows between the UK and the
rest of the world.17 Consistent with what we saw earlier, imports of indus-
trial raw materials were particularly badly hit, but they fell by very similar
amounts from both the Empire and from foreign countries. The picture was
very different between 1931 and 1933. Exports to the two groups of coun-
tries fell by roughly similar amounts (although manufactured exports to the
Empire remained constant, while those to the rest of the world fell by 7%).
However, while imports from the Empire rose slightly, imports from the rest
of the world fell by 30%. This difference between imports from the Empire
and from the rest of the world was general across all four broad categories; it
was largest for manufactures, and smallest for colonial goods. Table 4 shows
that the prices of goods traded with the Empire and rest of the world fell
very similarly, on average, suggesting that the shift towards the former and
away from the latter evident in Table 3 was due above all to a relative shift
    17
    The one exception concerns British exports of colonial goods such as sugar and to-
bacco: re-exports to the Empire remained roughly constant, while re-exports to the rest
of the world rose dramatically.

in real trade flows.18
    Figure 13 provides an alternative perspective on the same issue. It plots
imperial versus foreign percentage changes in export and import flows, in
1929-31 and 1931-33, for the same nine categories that we considered in
Section 5. As can be seen, during 1929-31 categories that saw their trade fall
by more vis à vis the Empire also saw larger declines vis à vis the rest of the
world: the same underlying forces were lowering trade with both groups of
countries. The same remained true for exports after 1931, but the correlation
becomes negative for imports.
    The fact that the geographical composition of the import collapse changed
  18
    This British shift towards empire was mirrored by a more general balkanisation or
international trade, that was the subject of much contemporary discussion: see for example
Hilgerdt (1935, 1943); Condliffe (1941), or more recently Latham (1981, Chapter 3) and
the many references in de Bromhead et al. (2017).

so radically after 1931 is consistent with the UK’s switch to protection having
had a major impact on trade flows (de Bromhead et al., 2017).19 The fact
that there was no such change on the export side suggests that the switch to
Imperial Preference in 1932 may have helped Imperial producers exporting
to Britain, more than it helped UK producers exporting to the Empire.


8        Conclusion
The GTC of 2008-9 and the trade collapse of 1929-33 took place in very
different economic environments. The Great Recession was violent indeed,
but much shorter-lived than the Great Depression. The interwar gold stan-
dard implied worldwide deflation, of a sort not seen in the later crisis. Trade
policies remained broadly liberal during 2008-9, in sharp contest with the
dramatic switch to protection experienced after 1929 worldwide (and after
1931 in the UK).
    These differences mattered for the nature of the two trade collapses, in a
number of ways. Most obviously, price declines accounted for a larger share
of the interwar trade collapse, than they did of the 2008-9 GTC. And after
1931, discriminatory trade policies meant that the UK trade collapse became
geographically imbalanced, in contrast to the US GTC experience.
    Many other features of the two trade collapses are remarkably similar,
however. This is especially the case if we compare the GTC with the UK
trade collapse of 1929-31, which, like the GTC, was driven by a worldwide
collapse in incomes and output, and took place in a country pursuing gener-
ally liberal trade policies. Both trade collapses took place along the intensive
rather than the extensive margin (Section 4); the same types of goods were
particularly badly hit in both instances (Section 5); and prices of differenti-
ated durable manufactured goods barely fell on either occasion (Section 6).

    See also Gowa and Hicks (2013). Kitson and Solomou (1990) remains a classic reference
on interwar UK protection.



                                           26
These similarities are supportive of theoretical accounts of the GTC empha-
sizing the composition of expenditure changes during major economic crises,
or the relative sizes of firms operating closer to or further away from the
margin between exporting or not.
    It should be emphasized, however, that we have only provided evidence
for one major interwar economy, the United Kingdom, in much the same way
as many writers on the GTC have focussed on the US. It remains to be seen
whether the stylized British facts that we have uncovered were common to
other economies during the interwar period.
