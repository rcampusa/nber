   ARE OSHA HEALTH INSPECTIONS EFFECTIVE? A LONGITUDINAL STUDY IN THE
                          MA1JFACTURING SECTOR


                                ABSTRACT


     We examine the impact of OSHA health inspections on compliance with
agency regulations in the manufacturing sector, with a unique plant-level
dataset of inspection and compliance behavior during 1972—1983, the first
twelve years of OSHA enforcement operations.   Two major findings are robust
across the range of linear and count  models estimated in the paper: (1) the
number of citations and the number of violations of worker exposure
restrictions decrease with additional health inspections in manufacturing
plants; and (2) the first health inspection has the strongest impact. The
results suggest that prior research focusing on the limited impact of OSHA
safety regulations may under-estimate OSHA's total contribution to reducing
workplace risks.

I. INTRODUCTION

      The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been

controversial since it was established in 1970.   Observers have challenged

the agency's efforts on worker safety, arguing occupational disease

presents a more serious case for government action2 because workers

experience greater difficulty collecting risk information for long—term

disease hazards than for more immediate injury risks.   Consequently,

neither the wage—setting process nor the workers' compensation system

internalize the costs of occupational disease as effectively as for

occupational injuries.3   Given the current regulatory approach to

workplace health and safety, analysts further assert that OSHA health

standards are more effectively designed to reduce future occupational

disease than OSHA safety standards are designed to reduce accidents.

Safety engineers have determined that the majority of injuries are not

related to the violation of OSHA safety standards and would occur despite

perfect compliance.4   On the other hand, OSHA health standards establish

worker exposure restrictions for most of the known disease threats in the

workplace, and require medical exams, exposure monitoring, and warning

signs.

     Rule—making for OSHA health standards has not been exempt from

controversy.       Many of the 10 health standards promulgated through rule-

making since 1972 have been challenged on cost-benefit grounds.5       Though

OSHA standard—setting does not explicitly incorporate cost—benefit

principles, the Supreme Court decided in the benzene case6 and affirmed in

the cotton dust case' that, for each new standard, OSHA must show that

"significant risks" currently exist and can be eliminated or reduced with

the proposed regulation.       OSHA also adopted Threshold Limit Values (TLV)

for 400 chemical substances in 1971 and an additional 168 chemicals in

1988, by reference from the voluntary standards of the American Committee

of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), a consensus—based

organization.       The goals for risk-reduction In ACGIH standard-setting

appear to be less stringent than for OSHA standards promulgated through
               e
rule—making.



5.   Mendeloff (1988) compiled and re—evaluated the historical record of
     cost and benefit studies for health standards. In his data (Table 2.1,
     p. 22), the accepted estimates of the willingness—to-pay for a life
     saved ($1.6—$8.3 million in 1985$; Fisher et al., 1989) fall within
     the range of costs per cancer prevented for all health standards (with
     cancer risks) promulgated through rule—making, except vinyl chloride.
      Employing an estimate of $2.5 million per life—saved, Mendeloff
     concludes that several standards are probably too stringent according
     to cost-benefit criteria, though the excess stringency is perhaps not
     as great as some critics have suggested. (p. xv)

     regulated chemicals, in accordance with ACGIH actions on the
     substances during the 1971—88 period.   See Mendeloff (1988) for a more
     complete discussion of the ACGIH standards.

      Despite greater expectations for OSHA's intervention to reduce health
risks, lack of suitable data to measure health effects has restricted most

statistical studies of OSHA to examining safety performance.9 Though some

early studies suggested OSHA had no effect on workplace injuries, current

research with longitudinal plant-level data indicates that OSHA has had a

small, salutary effect on reducing injuries.'0 Because the effect of the
                                                         however, the
agency on workplace health risks has not been evaluated,

research to date may substantially under—represent OSHA's total effect on

workplace quality.

      Direct measurement of the incidence of occupational disease is

extremely difficult because of the confluence of several factors: long

latency periods (frequently 10—25 years) between initial workplace
                                                              mobility of
exposure to hazardous substances and the onset of disease;

workers across establishments; and, sometimes, inaccurate diagnoses or

inaccurate attribution of causation for diseases.    As a result, there is

                                                        for occupational

                                                                      of the
      process of setting health standards, and a study of enforcement
      asbestos standard (Jones, 1984).

 10. Analyzing a 7—year panel with plant-specific injury rates and OSHA
     inspection data, Gray and Scholz (1989) estimated that a 10% increase
     in inspections with penalties would have a cumulative effect lagged
     over 3 years of reducing total accident rates by 1—2%. Analyzing
                                                                        OSHA
     enforcement and compliance data, Gray and Jones (1989) showed that
     during the first twelve years of the agency, OSHA inspections reduced
     citations in ever—inspected plants by 3.0 citations or by 0.36 s.d.,
     on average. For earlier statistical studies on safety effects, see
     Viscusi (1979, 1986); Bartel and Thomas (1985); Mendeloff (1979);
     Smith (1979); and McCaffrey (1983).

disease because most of the diseases are characterized by dose—response

relationships.

        In this paper, we employ a unique plant-level dataset characterizing

OSHA health enforcement and plant compliance, to study the impact of OSHA

on reducing workplace health hazards.      To solve the problem of measuring

OSHA's effect on reducing health risks, we use data that document the

worker over—exposures to regulated substances and citations for violating

OSHA standards, recorded during OSHA health inspections.      The longitudinal

structure of the OSHA enforcement data allows us to estimate the

determinants of plant—level health compliance patterns through the first

12 years (1972—1983) of the agency's enforcement operations.      We

implicitly assume that the future incidence of occupational disease will

decline with (1) an increase In compliance with OSHA health standards, and

(2) a reduction in violations of worker exposure restrictions.

        In recognition of the count form of the data series for both

violation measures, we estimate several count—distribution models, along

with the standard linear and log-linear models, to test the robustness of

the results to model specification.       Taking advantage of the longitudinal

form of the dataset, we estimate the fixed-effects versions of the Poisson

and   negative binomial count models developed in Hausman, Hall and
Griliches.

        The following section of the paper presents a simple model of

enforcement and compliance.     The third section presents the statistical

count models employed in the analysis.       The fourth section describes the

data.     The fifth section presents the empirical results, and the final

section summarizes the paper.

 and may provide a "management shock" to action.    In addition, we

 implicitly assume that firms' responses to inspections are partially

 motivated by the trade—off between the anticipated future penalties

 non—compliance and the costs of compliance.    Though OSHA penalties for

 initial violations tend to be very low, the penalty schedules for repeat

 and willful violations cited in subsequent inspections are substantially

 higher.2 To measure the intensity of agency enforcement, we employ dummy

     We employ two measures of plant performance with OSIIA health

standards.    The number of worker exposure measurements violating OSHA

permissible exposure limits LNIJMBADI serves as a proxy for plant

performance in preventing (reducing) the future incidence of occupational

disease.'3 The number of citations [NUMCITEI provides a measure of

violations of all OSHA standards.

     We control for several factors which may affect the consistency of

the relationship between measured and "true" violations across inspections

or through time.    First, different Administrations may vary in the rate at

which enforcement officers choose to sample various regulated substances,

to cite different types of violations, or to impose penalties for repeat

violations.    We control for variations in agency enforcement policy across

Administrations with dummy variables for the Nixon/Ford (1972—76) and

Carter (1977—80) Administrations; the excluded dummy covers 1981—mid-83,

 the early part of the Reagan Administration.   Second, the origin of each

 inspection (complaint, follow—up, general schedule, accident) affects how

 much of an establishment is inspected, and therefore affects the

 likelihood that violations will be detected.    The dummy variable




 13. See the detailed study of the worker exposure data (Jones et al.,
     1986) for a discussion of sampling and reporting issues. An in-depth
     study of records in two OSHA offices indicated that compliance samples
     were taken in 48% and 61% of all health inspections, but samples iere
     reported in approximately half of the inspections with samples taken.
     In the study the lack of reporting appeared to be random. Contrary to
     prior hypotheses, the distribution of severity levels for all
     compliance samples taken (as reported in area office files) was
     approximately the same as the distribution of severity levels for all
     compliance samples reported in the MIS by area offices.

identifies general schedule (targeted) inspections, which allow for the

broadest coverage of the workplace.14

       We observe the violation level only when an enforcement officer

inspects an establishment.       The criteria OSHA uses to select plants for

repeated inspections will affect       the choice of an appropriate estimation

procedure.        OSHA's policy of targeting high—hazard plants suggests that

(re)inspectiofl criteria conform to characteristics for which we can

control in the analysis.        Due to the longitudinal nature of the dataset,

                                                        unobservable,
we also employ a fixed—effects framework to control for

permanent, plant—level effects.



III. STATISTICAL FRA$EWORF FOR COUNT MODELS

       The dependent variable NUMCITE, measuring the number of       citations


detected     in   an inspection, equals 0 for   50% of the sample and has values

 of   3 or less for 75% of the sample.       The other dependent variable

                                                                 of OSHA
 (NUMBADI, measuring the number of exposure samples in violation

 standards, equals 0 for 81% of the sample, and has values of 3 or less for

 95% of the sample.        (See Table AZ for a complete characterization of the

 distributions.)        Given these distributions, count models, in which the

 dependent variable takes only non—negative integer values, seem more
                                                                  Of particular

 binomial models developed in Hausman, Hall and Griliches (1984)

 referred to as HHG).        The presentation below of the models we estimate is

 based on their discussion.




  14. In accident, follow—up, and complaint inspections, inspectors are
      directed to focus on the specific factors originating the inspection.
                                      8




      For events that occur randomly and independently through time, the

Poisson distribution is a natural starting point among count models.

Denote the Poisson parameter as X, and the number of violations identified

by OSRA for plant j    during inspection i, as v,.     The basic Poisson

probability distribution is:



(1)        pr(v) =    f(v)     [exp(-X]XiIvj!            i=l,...I;   j=l,...J.



The exponential functional form is conventionally used to incorporate

exogenous variables, X, in order to restrict the range of possible

values of the predicted Poisson parameter to positive real numbers:'5


(2)            =   exp(X16)


        HHG note that the advantages of the Poisson framework include (1)

natural treatments of the integer property of the outcomes and of the

zero—value case; (2) convenient time aggregation, which facilitates the

implementation of a fixed—effect framework; and (3) ease of estimation by

MLE due to global concavity of log—likelihood function.

        At the same time, the basic Poisson model is   restrictive   in several

ways.     First, it is based on the assumption that events are independently

and identically distributed through time conditional on X.       Given the

panel structure of the data, a primary alternative hypothesis is

heterogeneity across plants, attributable to unmeasured differences such




15. Use of the exponential form requires adding 1 to the values of the
    dependent variable, to handle 0—value observations.

we test with the fixed—effects Poisson framework.
                                                                     the

spuriously small.   Greater flexibility in the mean/variance relationship

can be achieved by generalizing the Poisson model

in XIXO)   to allow for unexplained variation in X. Under certain
distributional assumptions, the resulting compound Poisson distribution

yields the negative binomial distribution.

     Figure 1 summarizes the models we estimate.         For comparison with the

 count models, we also estimate 2 linear models.        The first model is:

 (v.X+c), or (v=X#u+C) in the fixed—effects version.          The first and

                                                                        The
 second moments are: (X0,i,2) and (X0iiJ, a,2+a2) respectively.
                                                                   in the
 second model is the log—linear version, lnvX6+C, or lnv=XBi-I.I+C

 fixed—effects form, with first and second moments (exp(X0J,a2) and

 (expLXOi.uI,a22+a,.2), respectively.       The third and fourth models are the

 Poisson and negative binomial models, respectively.         The assumed mean

 function is the same in models 2-4, exp(X0), which differs from the mean

 function in model 1: (X0).




                                                                       the

The OSBA panel is unbalanced: plants vary in the total number

inspections they have received.            In the analysis sample, we truncate the

number of inspections in plant j, i, to a maximum of 5.

           Unobserved plant—specific effects can be incorporated by specifying

employed:

 where      IJj   is the effect specific to plant j and u0              is   the overall

 intercept.           The fixed—effects framework does not require a distributional

 assumption for , and allows for correlation between the plant effect and

 the observed exogenous variables.1'

      The log—likelihood function for the fixed—effect Poisson model (3.2)

is:

                      —

      The log—likelihood function consists of different segments for plants

with 2,   3,   4 or 5 inspections in the panel, respectively, with the

segments linked by common parameters on shared variables.t9



Negative Binomial Distribution Models

      To relax the Poisson model restriction that the mean and variance of

(v1IX) are equal, we allow for randomness in X by replacing (2) with

the stochastic equation:


(6)              —   exp[X6   +



where the error term s represents intrinsic randomness.                It is well known

that if the probability density of c, or equivalently of                      follows

 the gamma distribution, then the pr(v1)) is distributed negative binomial.

      HHG assume gamma—distribution parameters (y,            8),   with

and 8 common both across firms and across time.          Note the nature of the




 19. In order to implement the fixed—effects framework, plants with only
     one inspection cannot be used in the analysis.

stochasticity in            in this model:          can vary over time even if

remains constant (unlike with the Poisson model); however, there are no

firm—specific effects, so the            are independent across inspections for a

plant.    With this formulation, the first and second moments of the

distribution of v are:                                and

With a variance/mean ratio for v of (1+6)18 > 1, the specification allows

for over—dispersion (with the original Poisson as a limiting case with

6-).      However, it does not allow the variance to increase with the value

of the dependent variable.

        The log—likelihood function for model 4.1 is:



(7)         log L =    £1(—logr(v÷1)         —    1ogr(exp(Xø)]

                       +   exp(XB)log(8/(l+8)I

                       —   (v)log(l+8)   +   logr(v1+exp(X1,B)1}

         In order to incorporate plant—specific effects in the negative

 binomial model, HUG again condition the estimation on the sum of citations

 across all inspections.        Th firm—specific effect is incorporated by

 setting the parameters of the underlying gamma function as follows:

 ('rj,8j) =   (expIX8J         f/exp[3iJ) where 8 now varies across plants-

 The moments of the corresponding unconditional negative binomial model

 are:



         E(v1) =     exp(Xj÷3iJ/+

         V(v))   =    (exp[X+2U)1/4')2)(1 + $)/expfuJl)
                                         14




The variance/mean ratio for v in this specification is (exp(u)J +

which allows for both over—dispersion and a plant—specific variance/mean
ratio.    The log—likelihood function for the fixed—effects negative

binomial model (4.2)         is:




(8)          log L =   E(logr[(Ev)+1J        —       E1logr(v+1)

                       +   logrIEexp(X1J)1       —




                       +   E1logr(exp(X6)+v1           —   ElogrIexp(X)])

As with the fixed—effects Poisson model, the log—likelihood function

consists of four separate segments with plants in each segment

distinguished by total number of health inspections, 1,=2,...5, but

sharing the same coefficient matrix 8.



IV.   DATA

         The source of data for the analysis is OSHA's enforcement Management

Information System (MIS), used by the agency to track agency enforcement

and company compliance performance.              The version of the MIS data obtained

for this study includes the 63,383 federal health inspections performed in
                                                                                    20
37,639 manufacturing establishments between 1972 and the middle of 1983.
In order to create longitudinal records of plant inspection histories,

Gray (1986) matched all inspections of individual establishments using




20. Not included in the data are those few inspections done in 1971 and
    1972 before the MIS was operational, and inspections performed in
    "state plan" states, where state authorities have taken over
    responsibility for enforcement.

establishment—level identifiers.2' In order to implement efficiently the

conditioning procedure in the Andersen ML.E technique, we only include up

to the fifth inspection for a plant.     This truncation does not result in

the loss of any plants, but does eliminate 2909 health inspections of

sequence order 6 and above (4.6% of all inspections) in 984 heavily

health—inspected plants (2.6% of all plants), yielding a sample of 60,474

inspections.

        In order to estimate the fixed—effect versions of the models, we

restrict the analysis sample to the 35,427 health inspections in the

12,592 plants with two or more health inspections during the period.

Table Al compares the means and standard deviations of the variables for

the full sample (I) with for the analysis sample (II).      Across the full

sample, inspectors wrote citations (NUNCITE) in 50% of the inspections,

averaging 2.5 citations across all inspections and 5 citations in

inspections with citations.    Inspectors reported an average of .6 exposure

samples violating exposure limits in each inspection, for an average of

 3.2 violations in plants with exposure violations.    In the analysis

 sample, the NUMCITE mean is almost identical;    the mean of NUMBAD is 25%

 higher than the mean for sample I (.76 relative to .61).

        In its early years, OSHA did not hire many industrial hygienists and

 so the agency conducted relatively few health inspections.     The agency

 began to place greater priority on health inspections by the end of the




 21.   This project used the Fellegi-Sunter technique of record matching,
       based on establishing the likelihood of agreement in the various
       fields.  Because of the variation in coding of establishment data over
       time (including errors in data entry), there are almost certainly
       cases in which inspections of the same establishment are not
       identified as such.  It is also possible (though less likely given the
       structure of the weights) that inspections of different establishments
       are mis—identified as repeat inspections of a single establishment.

                                                                   of the
Ford Administration, when a health professional was appointed head

agency for the first time.     In the full sample, health inspections are

fairly evenly distributed across the years in the Carter (1977—80) and

Reagan (1980—mid—83) Administrations (at 11% per year, with a

to 12.6% In 1980).     Not surprisingly, after eliminating plants with only

one inspection,     the profile of sample II shifts slightly toward the

earlier part of the panel.      General-schedule targeting (aimed toward high-

hazard workplaces) generated 44% of the inspections among all plants,

dropping to 1/3 in the analysis sample.      Slightly over half of the

inspections (55%) in sample I were In plants with fewer than 100

employees; the share of small plants declines to 42% in the analysis

sample.

      Table A2 presents more detailed descriptive statistics for the two

count variables, separately for the two samples.      Given the patterns In

the means, it Is not surprising that the distribution for NUMCITE Is

almost identical for the two samples and     the distribution for NUMBAD is

shifted slightly upward in the analysis sample.      We also show a 2x2 table

 indicating the joint outcomes on the 2 violation measures.     It is

 reassuring that among plants with exposure violations, 88% received

 citations.     Among plants with citations, 34% had documented exposure
               22
 violations.




 22. Inspectors may cite plants for not having the appropriate control
     equipment to achieve exposure limits, without taking exposure
     measurements.  Alternatively, citations may involve violations of
     other requirements such as exposure employer monitoring, warning
     signs, personal protective equipment, or medical exams.

V. E1PIRICAL RESULTS

    The major issue considered in this paper is: do OSHA's enforcement

efforts deter violations of OSHA health standards?     To address this issue

we estimate each of the four models developed above, both with and without

plant—specific fixed effects.     For the versions of the model without fixed

effects, we control for the selection effect by incorporating the variable

HNUMINSP, the total number of health inspections experienced by a plant,

as a proxy for the plant fixed effect.     As with the inspection—sequence

series of variables [HSEQNUMI, we create dummy variables for values of
                               523
HNUMINSP equal to 1 through

    Tables 1 and 2 report the estimates of the determinants of the total

number of citations, NUMCITE, and the number of exposure violations

reported, NUMBAD, respectively.      Across all specifications for both

variables, the results are consistent with the qualitative conclusions

that (1) both measures of violation (worker exposure violations and

citations of standards) decrease with additional inspections, and (2) the

first health inspection has the strongest impact in reducing violations.

    We first consider the results for NUMCITE presented in Table 1.         In


all four models, the fixed-effects framework cannot be rejected.      The

 coefficients on the health inspection variables (IISEQNUMJ) are somewhat

 larger (and the differences are statistically significant) in the fixed—

 effects versions.     However, the estimates of the impact of OSHA

 enforcement throughout the sample, (summarized for fixed—effects models

 below in Table 3), are not greatly affected by the differences.




 23. With this model, the coefficients of the health inspection sequence
     variables EHSEQNUMh the focus of our inquiry, are estimated without
     bias.   The coefficients on HNUMINSP are underestimated by a factor
     equal to the ratio of the variance of the "noise" in HNUMINSP (as a
     proxy for p) to the total variance of HNUMINSP.   Proof available from

      Because the specification of the mean function is a critical

component in the implementation of the count models, we are particularly

interested in specification testing for models 1 and 2.     The R2 are not

comparable in the two models (due to the data transformation).

Alternatively, we use the Sargan test which indicates the log—linear model

(2) is preferred to the linear version (1).24

      Comparing the results for the two count—distribution models, we see

the dramatic decline in the log—likelihood function for the negative

binomial model25 relative to the Poisson, from —126,186 to —66,464 for the

non—fixed—effects version, and -53,989 to —23,375 for the fixed—effects

version.   Based on a       test, the negative binomial model is not rejected

in either version.      For the non—fixed—effects version, we can also examine

the estimate of 6, which allows for over—dispersion in the negative

binomial specification.      In model 4.1, the estimated ratio of the variance

to the mean is (1+6)16=6, substantially different from the imposed ratio




24. The statistic presented by Sargan (1964) is: S=(j/g2)T, where b is
    the root—Inse from model 1, and    is the root-mse from model 2, and g
    is the geometric mean of v.   Based on the assumption that the errors
    from each model k, (k1,2), are distributed iid N(O,k): if S>1, then
    model 2 is favored; if S<1, then model 1 is favored.   [Maddala (1977,
    p. 317) proposed a comparable test.j   The value  of  (/g2)  = 2.8 for
    both the fixed-effects and the non—fixed—effects versions, which
    indicates that the log—linear model is preferred to the linear model.

25. Unlike the other fixed—effects models, the negative binomial allows
    estimation of coefficients for variables that are constant for a plant
    over time.   Including the constant term had important implications:
    without it, the IISEQNUM2 coefficient in the NIJMBAD equation was
    substantially (50Z) higher in magnitude, yielding a much larger
    estimate of the effect of first inspections than with the other
    models.   We also include the SMALL plant dummy in the reported
    results.   The procedure would not converge when the HNUMINSP dummies
    were included, however, due to their high collinearity with the
    HSEQNUM dummies.   When we incorporated UNUMINSP dummies with a range
    of pre—specified parameter values for the coefficients (rather than
    estimating them), the }ISEQNUM parameter estimates were not greatly
    affected.

sequence variables are all precisely estimated, with the exception of the

HSEQNUMS variables.

         For NUMCITE [mean=2.5, sd=5.2J, the pattern of inspection effects is

very similar for models 1, 2, and 3.       The log—linear results (Col. 2.2)

indicate that the first—inspection effect is to reduce citations by —2.0,

with subsequent inspections yielding reductions of - .5,     —   .4,   and —.14

citations each, for an estimated total impact of the OSHA inspection

pattern for the average manufacturing plant of -2.4 (-.5 Sd).            For the

Poisson model, the estimated total effect is approximately the same, -2.7

citations (—.5 Sd); with reductions declining across inspections, -1.9,

—1.0, —.4, —.2.    The negative binomial model estimates OSHA's total effect

to be 20% lower than the other three models: —1.9 citations (-.2), with

the reductions concentrated on the first inspection (—1.8 citations), with

subsequent inspections yielding reductions of —.15, —.15, —.01 citations.

         Note the effect of an inspection is observed in the subsequent

inspection.    The estimates of total effects cited above assume that the

(unobserved) effect of the last inspection for each plant is equal to the

effect measured for that inspection sequence number in the sub-set of the

sample receiving additional inspections.27       Alternatively, "more

conservative" estimates of the effect of OSHA inspections during 1972—83,

based on the assumption that there is no effect of the last inspection in

any plant, range from —1.2 (—.2 Sd) to —1.6 (—.3 sd) for the Poisson

model.     (See the notes to Table 3 for further details on the calculations.)




27. It follows that we have no measure of the effect of the fifth
    inspection, and so we must assume a zero impact.  The calculation
    attributes the estimated first—inspection effect to plants receiving
    only one inspection; these plants were not included in the analysis
    sample.

negative binomial model.



VI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

      In   this paper, we provide the first estimates of the impact of OSHA

health—related enforcement on compliance throughout the manufacturing sector.

We resolved the lack—of-data impediment to research on OSHA's health effects

by creating violation measures from the data on exposure samples and citations

recorded by OSHA inspectors in the agency enforcement MIS.

      Two major conclusions are robust across the range of linear and count

models estimated in the paper: (1) both the number of citations of OSHA

standards and the number of violations of worker exposure limits decrease with

additional health inspections in manufacturing plants; and (2) the first

health inspection has the strongest impact.   The best estimates, based on the

fixed—effects negative binomial models, suggest that in ever-inspected

manufacturing plants, OSHA health inspections during the first twelve years of

the agency operation have reduced the number of citations on average by -2 or

-.4 sd and have reduced the number of detected exposure violations by - .4 or

—.23 sd.29   The ranges of estimates across the models are for reductions from

—1.9 to —2.7 citations and for reductions of —.4 to —.5 worker over-

exposures samples.   The methodology does not allow us to estimate the



29. The estimated reduction in citations induced by health inspections
    presented In this paper is of comparable magnitude to the estimated
    reduction reported in our earlier study, focusing on safety inspections
    (80Z of all OSHA inspections). With a Tobit model, we estimated
    inspection effects on citations of (-2.3, —.6, —.5 and -.3); with a linear
    fixed—effects model, the estimated inspection effects were somewhat larger
    (—2.9, —1.4, —.8, and —.9). The average effect of OSHA inspections

       Because the dataset involved in the safety analysis was substantially
    larger, we did not employ the difficult-to—estimate count models.
