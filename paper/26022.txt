                                         ABSTRACT

This paper presents on three new styled facts: first, schools of public affairs hire many
economists; second, those economists are disproportionately female; and third, salaries in schools
of public affairs are, on average, lower than salaries in mainline departments of economics. We
seek to understand the linkage, if any, among these facts. We assembled a unique database of
over 2,150 faculty salary profiles from the top 50 Schools of Public Affairs in the United States
as well as the corresponding Economics and Political Science departments. For each faculty
member we obtained salary data to analyze the relationship between scholarly discipline,
department placement, gender, and annual salary compensation. We found substantial pay
differences based on departmental affiliation, significant differences in citation records between
male and female faculty in schools of public affairs, and no evidence that the public affairs
discount could be explained by compositional differences with respect to gender, experience or
scholarly citations.

I.     INTRODUCTION

       Salary equity studies have long been used to illuminate pay disparities among higher

education faculty based on gender (e.g., Ginther and Hayes, 2003); race and ethnicity (e.g., Webber

and Gonzales Canche, 2015); organizational loyalty (e.g., Barbezat, 2004; Masakure, 2016), and

scholarly discipline (e.g., Ehrenberg, McGraw, and Mrdjenovic, 2006; Curtis and Kisielewski,

2015). Our study contributes to the literature by disentangling the contributions of discipline,

departmental affiliation and gender in faculty pay differentials for schools of public affairs.

       Three key observations motivate our analysis. First, we observe that schools of public

affairs hire many economists. Second, we observe that those economists are disproportionately

female. Finally, we observe that salaries in schools of public affairs are, on average, lower than

salaries in mainline departments of economics. We seek to understand the linkage, if any, among

these three new styled facts.

       Using various data sources, we assembled a unique database of over 2,150 faculty salary

profiles from the top 50 Graduate Schools of Public Affairs in the United States as well as the

corresponding Economics and Political Science departments in their home universities. For each

faculty member we collected compensation data to analyze the relationship between field of

specialization, department placement, and annual salary compensation. In addition, we also control

for measures of scholarly productivity, such as, citation counts, h-indices, and i10-indices.

       There are a couple of key takeaways from our analysis here. First, we found substantial

pay differences based on departmental affiliation. Economists in schools of public affairs were

paid at a significant discount compared to their counterparts employed in traditional departments

of economics. Second, the public affairs discount could not be explained by compositional

differences. Controlling for gender, experience and various indicators of research productivity only



                                                  2
 
widened the salary gap between economics departments and schools of public affairs. Lastly, we

found evidence that citation records differed by gender, discipline and departmental affiliation;

and that salary differences between male and female faculty members were not statistically

significant once these differences in citation records were taken into account. We found no

evidence that the return to citations was systematically higher (or lower) for male than for female

faculty members in the institutions of higher education under analysis.


II.           RELEVANT LITERATURE

              The economics literature includes a remarkable number of salary analyses in the higher

education contexts. Nearly all of these studies are at least loosely based on hedonic wage models

in which the individual's salary is a function of worker characteristics, job characteristics and

location characteristics.1 Most of these studies focus on quantifying faculty salary differences by

some demographic of interest, typically by gender, race/ethnicity or scholarly discipline. Many

focus exclusively on salary differentials within economics.

              One of the key challenges in those analyses of faculty salary has been the measurement of

productivity. Common measures of research productivity include: numbers of publications

(Ginther, 2003; Barbezat, 2004; Umbach, 2007; Binder et al., 2010; Renzulli, Reynolds, Kelly,

and Grant, 2013; Tuckman and Tuckman, 1976); numbers of citations (Hamermesh, Johnson and

Weisbrod, 1982; Gibson, Anderson, and Tressler, 2017; Gibson and Burton-McKenzie, 2017;

Hamermesh, 2018) or grant dollars received (Binder et al., 2010; Renzulli et al., 2013). Common

measures of teaching productivity include: numbers of teaching awards (Carlin et al., 2013);

                                                               3
 
numbers of instructional preparations (Binder et al., 2010); numbers of classes taught (Renzulli et

al., 2013); or percent time in teaching (Umbach, 2007).

       Of keen interest (at least to economists) have been studies documenting and explaining

salary premia for economists vis-à-vis faculty in other academic disciplines. Academic economists

enjoy some of the highest average salaries among university faculty. Ehrenberg, McGraw, and

Mrdjenovic (2006) found that, at the full professor level, only faculty in engineering and computer

science programs earn more than those in economics departments. More recently, Curtis and

Kisielewski (2015) found that professors' salaries in economics exceeded those of their social

scientist peers in sociology, anthropology, political science and government at each of the

assistant, associate, and full professor ranks. For the period of 2002 through 2016, salaries of

economists also grew at a faster rate than any their other social science counterparts, rising twice

as quickly as anthropology and political science and at three times the rate of sociology for new

assistant professors in particular (Curtis and Kisielewski, 2015).

       There are several reasons why academic economists enjoy such a salary premium over

their colleagues in other social sciences. Human capital theory predicts that workers with similar

characteristics--such as professors with similar degrees, responsibilities, and years of

experience--will receive similar compensation while workers with dissimilar characteristics will

receive dissimilar compensation (e.g., Park, 2012). Even though their teaching tasks might be

similar to those of other academics, economists could earn a premium based on their comparative

advantage in producing specific, highly-valued academic products. Freeman (1999) argued that

economics, with more powerful analytic tools, stronger students (i.e., based on Graduate Record

Examinations [GRE] scores), and more mathematically demanding curricula than in sociology or

political science, was "the strongest social science" and therefore commanded the highest wages.



                                                 4
 
       Alternatively, external labor market pressure could account for differences in salary.

Economists enjoy unique access to high-value alternative sources of income, such as consulting

fees, private investment, and corporate board membership (Fourcade, Ollion, and Algan, 2015),

which suggest a high earnings potential for economists who choose to pursue opportunities outside

academia. Relatively high wages for economics faculty are therefore justified because universities

must compete with the demand for economists in the non-academic labor market (Boyle, 2008;

Ehrenberg, 2004b; Buchanan and Tollison, 1981).

       On the other hand, some researchers attribute the higher salaries in economics, at least in

part, to the male-dominated nature of the discipline (Bellas, 1994; Bellas, 1997; Smart, 1991;

Perna, 2003). Researchers have found evidence that female salaries in higher education are

systematically below those of males (e.g., Ginther and Hayes, 2003; Ginther and Kahn, 2004;

Umbach, 2007) even after controlling for differences in experience and productivity. To the extent

that this bias persists, salaries could be higher in economics simply because there are fewer women

in the profession.

       The disproportionately male composition of economics departments may also exert an

influence on pay through citation practices. Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell (2018) find that male

scholars not only cite other male scholars more often than they cite female scholars, but are also

more likely to cite themselves than are female scholars. In economics specifically, male-authored

papers are cited at higher rates than either female-authored papers or mixed-authorship papers

(Ferber and Brün, 2011). Considering that the marginal value of a citation may be as high as $1,300

per year (Diamond Jr., 1986), gendered citation practices can result in disproportionate financial

and career rewards for scholars in male-dominated subfields of social science (Dion, Sumner, and

Mitchell, 2018).



                                                5
 
              Thus, the literature suggests that gender composition could at least partially explain the

salary gap between economics departments and schools of public affairs. If more female academic

economists choose to pursue careers in schools of public affairs, we might expect lower pay for

economists in those fields due to a greater proportion of women on the faculty.

              Much of the research examining faculty salary dispersion between disciplines relies heavily

on survey data and very few to date rely on administrative university-level faculty data.2 Thus, our

study contributes to this literature by analyzing a uniquely assembled dataset of over 2,150 faculty

salary profiles from the top 50 Graduate Programs in Public Affairs in the United States and their

corresponding Economics and Political Science departments at those universities, rather than

survey data.3 Unlike surveys conducted by groups such as the American Association of University

Professors (Ehrenberg, 2004a) or American Political Science Association (Claypool et al., 2017),

the multi-institutional faculty-level data in our study allows us to specifically distinguish faculty

by their discipline. For each faculty member we concatenated compensation data to analyze the

relationship between specialization, department placement, and salary. When possible we also

collected information of the faculty's level of productivity as measured by their citation counts, h-

indices, and i10-indices.

    Only a small number of studies about salary dispersion within or between departments use university-level faculty
salary data, and these typically use data from only a single university or a small sample (e.g., Boudreau et al., 1997;
Volk, Slaughter, and Thomas, 2001; Hilmer, Hilmer, and Lush, 2012).  
3
    Several studies (Fairweather, 1995; Umbach 2007, 2008) utilize the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty
(NSOPF), administered by the National Center for Education Statistics. Friedman (1991) conducted a telephone
survey of department heads at public administration programs, one element of which aimed to determine how many
economists were employed by public affairs programs. The Carnegie Survey of Faculty also appears in the Langton
and Pfeffer (1994) study about labor market characteristics, while Gomez-Mejia and Balkin (1992) opted to design
their own survey. 

                                                               6
 
III.    DATA SOURCES AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

        We approach our inquiry into the relative salaries of economists from the perspective of a

leading school of public affairs. Thus, we began our analysis by identifying a sampling frame

based on the universities housing the top graduate programs in public affairs, according to the U.S.

News and World Report (USNWR) rankings for 2018. We chose to limit our search to schools of

public affairs in the top 50 of the USNWR rankings to ensure a sufficiently large sample while

maintaining a focus on sectoral leaders. Once we identified the leading schools of public affairs,

we sought publicly available faculty salary data for each of the corresponding colleges or

universities. No private institutions of higher education (IHEs) meeting the search criteria

voluntarily published salary data publicly. However, we extracted payroll information for the 33

public IHEs from numerous sources, including university and state government websites, nonprofit

organizations committed to transparency, and newspapers or other periodicals in the state of

interest. If salary data were unpublished, we submitted open records requests to obtain the sought-

after data). See Table 1 for descriptive statistics

                                              [Table 1 about here]

        Not all of these original datasets provided the same information. Each publicly-available

payroll dataset included name, title, and salary. However, some datasets provided multiple figures

for salary, while others provided only one. Some datasets also provided full-time equivalent (FTE)

numbers, but not others. The reporting years varied. Where available, we calculated the most recent

salary using FTE information for each faculty. However, we recognize that there are institution-

specific differences in the measurement of salary. As a result, our analyses will include IHE fixed

effects in all estimated regression models.




                                                      7
 
              For each of the 33 IHEs, we retained salary data for three departmental types: public affairs,

economics, and political science. We restricted the sample to regular faculty members at the

assistant, associate and full professor levels. Thus, we excluded adjunct, visiting, distinguished,

and emeritus positions, as well as administrative faculty such as deans or department heads.

              The next step in compiling a useful dataset required visiting each university's website and

matching information from the faculty directory with the names listed in the dataset for that

institution. We coded each faculty member's department using a series of indicator variables based

on the faculty department website where their profile appeared. To determine a faculty member's

sex, highest degree held, year of degree and academic discipline, we examined information

available in their faculty biography or the curriculum vitae (CV) posted on their faculty page. If

such information were unavailable, we performed a broader Internet search to locate any missing

details about an individual, leading either to a personal website or to their PhD information posted

with an affiliated organization.

              We constructed indicator variables for whether or not a faculty member was an economist

or a political scientist based on the field in which they obtained their PhD and their departmental

affiliations. Faculty members with a degree in economics (including variants like agricultural

economics or econometrics) were classified as economists, as were all faculty members in

departments of economics. Faculty members with degrees in political science, government, foreign

affairs or international relations were classified as political scientists, as were all faculty members

in departments of political science. Individuals with degrees in political economy or "political

science and economics" were assigned a one for both the economist indicator variable and the

political scientist indicator variable.4 If professors listed only their PhD-granting institution,


                                                            
4
     The analysis was not sensitive to this coding choice because the number of individuals was small. 

                                                               8
 
without any additional PhD information and were not affiliated with a traditional economics or

political science department, we coded their field of degree as missing. In addition, if the available

online resources indicated that the faculty member did not hold a PhD, then he or she was excluded

from the analysis.5 We coded as missing any educational attainment data that could not be located

online, which occurred most often when a professor did not provide a CV publicly. Some faculty

advertised their CV as available on request, but we did not send any CV requests for this study,

opting to use only publicly posted information.

              Because we were interested in analyzing differences in salary by gender, we also collected

the information on faculty's sex from the same public sources as discipline and department

information. Then, we coded each faculty member as male or female based on our familiarity with

the individuals, photographs posted to their faculty profile or personal website, and any gendered

third-person pronouns included in their own biographical materials.

              Finally, we followed Hamermesh (2018) and measured faculty productivity using citation

metrics commonly available through Google Scholar. We captured total citations, h-indices (which

Hamermesh (2018) characterizes as combining both the breadth and depth of impact) and i10-

indices (which measure the number of papers with at least 10 citations) for each individual with a

Google Scholar profile.6 Unfortunately, there are a number of faculty members who do not have a

Google profile or have not made their profiles public. For these faculty members, we used multiple

imputation to fill in the missing citation data for some of our analyses and excluded the records




                                                            
5
    Nearly all of the individuals excluded on these grounds were employed by schools of public affairs and held juris
doctorates.
6
   The h-index is calculated by counting the number of publications for which a scholar has been cited by other scholars
at least that same number of times. For example, a h-index of 16 means that the scholar has published at least 16
papers that have each been cited at least 16 times. The i10-index is the number of publications with at least 10 citations.
For example, an i10-index of 12 means that 12 publications of the scholar have each been cited at least 10 times.

                                                               9
 
with missing data for other estimates of the same specifications. None of our results were

substantively changed by the modeling choices regarding missing data.

       Table 2 provides summary statistics on the distribution of faculty by departmental

affiliation, sex, and annual salary compensation. As these sample summary statistics make clear,

we were able to confirm each of our motivating observations. First, leading schools of public

affairs employ a large number of economists. The 33 leading public affairs departments in our

sample employed more than 100 economists, or 12 percent of the economists in the sample.

       Second, a disproportionate number of the economists employed by schools of public affairs

were female. As Table 2 illustrates, 19 percent of the faculty in departments of economics were

female; whereas 23 percent of the economists in departments of political science were female and

35 percent of the economists in schools of public affairs were female. In other words, the fraction

female among economists in schools of public affairs was nearly double the fraction female in

traditional departments of economics. This difference among economists between departments of

economics and public affairs was statistically significant by any common metric.

       Third, average salaries in schools of public affairs were lower than those in traditional

economics departments. On average--and without adjustment for faculty rank or institution

reporting differences--salaries were 33.5 percent higher in departments of economics than they

were in schools of public affairs. Among economists, average salaries were 11 percent higher in

departments of economics than they were in schools of public affairs.

                                       [Table 2 about here]


IV.    EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

       Of course, average salaries are not the best comparisons. Therefore, consider the hedonic

salary models reported in Table 3. In general, we estimated the following functional form,

                                                10
 
                     ln                                                       


where ln              is the log of annual salary for faculty member i in department d,  is

a vector of faculty characteristics, such as, departmental affiliation (school of public affairs

(omitted category), economics department, and political science department), field of

specialization (economist, political scientist, and other fields (omitted category)), female indicator,

professor rank indicator (assistant professor (omitted category), associate professor, and full

professor), and experience level of the faculty as measured by the log of years since their Ph.D.

degree;       is a vector of variables capturing various measures of faculty productivity, such as,

total citation count, h-index, and i10-index;  are university fixed effects; and lastly,         is the

error term.

       The first column in Table 3 shows a parsimonious model specification with university fixed

effects (which allowed us to control for systematic, unobservable differences by institution such

as differences in fringe benefits, salary reporting protocols or reporting years) and indicators for

departmental affiliation and discipline, but no other controls. This model indicated that the average

salary for economists in economics departments was 17 percent (the exponent of the coefficient of

0.154 = 1.17) higher than the average salary for economists at the same institution who were not

in economics departments, and 32 percent (the exponent of 0.154 + 0.124 = 1.32) higher than the

average salary for faculty members in schools of public affairs who were neither economists nor

political scientists (the omitted category). Thus, our first cut at the data suggested that economists

in schools of public affairs were paid at a significant discount vis-`a-vis those in traditional

departments of economics.

                                            [Table 3 about here]



                                                  11
 
              This pattern led us to hypothesize that salaries were lower in schools of public affairs

because the faculty members who chose to work in such contexts were systematically different

from those who chose to work in traditional departments of economics. Those differences could

have existed upon arrival (such as gender) or could have been influenced by context (such as

scholarly productivity). 


Alternative Explanation #1: Faculty Sorting by Gender

              It is clear from Table 2 that there is departmental sorting by gender. Moreover, it is well-

documented that the economics profession has had, and continues to have, problems with gender

equity.7 So, the apparent public affairs discount could simply reflect the greater share of female

faculty in schools of public affairs. To explore this hypothesis, the second column in Table 3

presents a model that included an indicator for female faculty member. As the table makes clear,

we found a significant, negative differential for female faculty members, but controlling for gender

did not eliminate the public affairs discount.

              Next, we considered a model that included not only an indicator for female faculty, but

also the interactions between gender and discipline (to allow for the possibility that there are

gender-linked salary differentials among economists, but not among political scientists or among

other public affairs disciplines) and the interactions between gender and department affiliation (to

allow for the possibility that bias is more strongly expressed in traditional economics departments

than in schools of public affairs). As column (3) of Table 3 illustrates, this model suggested that

female faculty members were paid significantly less than male faculty members regardless of

discipline or department. All of the gender interaction terms were jointly insignificant (F(4, 2110)

= 1.34, p = 0.25). Again, controlling for gender did not eliminate the public affairs discount.

    See, for example the discussion in Lundberg and Stearns (2019) and Ceci et al. (2014). See also Wu (2018).

                                                               12
 
Alternative Explanation #2: Faculty Sorting by Experience and Rank

              Maybe there were systematic differences between male and female faculty members or

between departments of economics and schools of public affairs with respect to faculty rank and

experience. The fourth and fifth columns in Table 3 present models that included faculty rank and

years since degree (in logs), and the interactions between these two measures of productivity and

the economist and political scientist indictors (to allow the effects of rank and experience to vary

by discipline).8 Because some of the records do not have year of degree, we report both a model

in which we dropped observations with missing data on experience (shown in column (4)) and a

model in which we multiply imputed years since degree using 100 imputations (shown in column

(5)). For observations for which years since degree was imputed, each interaction term was treated

as just another variable, meaning that the data were transformed and then the interactions were

imputed, as recommended in Von Hippel (2009) and Seaman, Bartlett, and White (2012).

              As Table 3 illustrates, the results shown in columns (4) and (5) were not sensitive to the

imputation. In both models, we found that controlling for years of experience and faculty rank

greatly reduced the magnitude of the difference between male and female salaries, but the gender

difference remained large and statistically significant. Again, all of the sex interaction terms were

jointly insignificant (F(4, 1930) = 0.51, p = 0.73 in column (4); F(4, 2099) = 0.74, p = 0.57 in

column (5)) suggesting that the systematic difference between male and female salaries was not a

function of discipline or departmental affiliation. Furthermore, this modeling change was

associated with a modest increase in the economics department premium, so there was no evidence

that the public affairs discount arose from sorting by sex or seniority.

  Although some argue that faculty rank is endogenous, excluding rank as a control can produce misleading
conclusions, particularly in the case of gender equity, showing bias where none exists and vice versa (Boudreau et al.,
1997).

                                                               13
 
Alternative Explanation #3: Faculty Sorting by Other Indicators of Research Productivity

       Experience and professorial rank are highly imperfect measures of scholarly productivity.

Suspecting that there were other dimensions of research productivity that could help explain the

gender differential and the public affairs discount, we turned our attention to the faculty citation

metrics available from Google Scholar--citation counts, h-indices and i10-indices.

       We note that many researchers do not make their Google Scholar profiles public.

Therefore, we were unable to collect citation metrics for more than one third of the researchers in

our analysis sample. Again, we relied on multiple imputation to fill in the blanks.

       Furthermore, we could not conclude that the citation metrics were missing completely at

random. As shown in panel A of Table 4, multinomial probit models indicate that the probability

that faculty members lacked a public Google Scholar profiles was an increasing function of the

number of years since their doctoral degrees. We found this pattern whether or not the model

included imputed values for years since degree. In addition, full professors appeared somewhat

more likely to have a public Google Scholar profile than assistant or associate professors, once we

controlled for differences in graduation date. Therefore, it was necessary to control for faculty rank

and years since degree in the imputation model for each of the Google Scholar metrics.

       The remaining panels of Table 4 provide reasons to believe that variations in the citation

metrics could at least partially explain the observed differences in salary by sex and departmental

affiliation. Although the variables were seldom individually significant, the hypothesis that the

female indicator and all its interactions were jointly zero was rejected at the 5-percent level for

each of the citation metrics. The hypothesis that the economics department indicator and the

interaction between female and the economics department indicator were jointly zero was rejected

at the five percent level for both the h-index and i10-index models, but not the citation count model,



                                                 14
 
suggesting that departmental affiliation matters for at least some of the citation metrics.

Intriguingly, where departmental affiliation is statistically significant (i.e., in the h-index and i10-

index models), the evidence suggests that scholarly productivity among male economists is lower

in traditional departments of economics than in schools of public affairs, all other things being

equal, while scholarly productivity among female economists is unrelated to departmental

affiliation. On the other hand, the h-indices and i10-indices were systematically lower for female

economists than for male economists in both traditional economics departments and schools of

public affairs, although the differential was smaller and only significant at the 10-percent level in

traditional departments of economics.

                                             [Table 4 about here]

        Next, Table 5 presents variations on column (5) of Table 3, which we added the citation

metrics and appropriate interaction terms. The interactions between gender and departmental

affiliation, which were uniformly negligible in preliminary analyses, have been dropped to avoid

over-parameterization.

        In the first column, we present a model that omitted observations without citation data. In

all other specifications, the citation-based indicators of productivity were multiply imputed to

address the problem of missing data. Because whether or not the Google Scholar data were missing

depended on the years since degree, it was necessary to use years since degree to impute the

citation metrics. As a result, all of these models exclude observations for which years since degree

was missing.

        As the table illustrates, we found a significant, positive and multi-collinear relationship

between the citation metrics and faculty salaries. As shown in column (4), each additional one-

unit increase in the h-index was associated with a one percent increase in faculty salary, all other



                                                  15
 
things being equal. Increases in citation count had no incremental effect on salary, once the h-

index and i10-index were taken into account, and increases in the i10-index were slightly negative,

holding the other citation metric constant (shown column (2)). However, when each of the metrics

was evaluated separately, there was consistent evidence that increases in citation led to increases

in salary (columns (3)-(5)).

                                             [Table 5 about here]

        Incorporating citation metrics into the analysis altered the estimated relationship between

gender and salary. The marginal effect of gender shrank, and in the imputed specifications became

statistically insignificant. In none of the specifications was the marginal effect of being a female

economist statistically significant at the 5-percent level (although it was significant at the 5-percent

level in the model where citation counts were not imputed, and therefore fewer highly experienced

scholars were included).

        Interestingly, the public affairs discount widened. As column (2) shows, controlling for

citation metrics as well as years since degree and faculty rank, we estimated that economists in

schools of public affairs earned at least 28 percent more than otherwise similar faculty members,

and economists in departments of economics earned 17 percent more than economists in schools

of public affairs. On the other hand, political scientists were better paid in a school of public affairs

than in a traditional department of political science, even after controlling for research

productivity. As Table 5 illustrates, political scientists in mainline political science departments

were paid 10 percent less, on average, than political scientists in schools of public affairs.

        We wondered if perhaps the public affairs discount arose from systematic differences in

the relative prestige of the various departments. After all, our sample was restricted to public

universities that are home to leading schools of public affairs--which does not necessarily imply



                                                   16
 
that they are also home to leading departments of economics or political science. One could argue

that the premium for political scientists in leading schools of public affairs could arise from

differences in departmental prestige (as in Ehrenberg, McGraw, and Mrdjenovic, 2006) although

it would seem difficult to make such a case for the public affairs discount vis-à-vis a less selective

set of departments of economics.

       Nevertheless, we explored this possibility as well, by adding two interaction terms to the

model. The first is the interaction between the economics department indicator and the US News

and World Report rankings for the university's department of economics; the second is the

interaction between the political science department indicator and the US News and World Report

ranking for the university's department of political science. (We do not add the main effects of the

departmental rankings because those are subsumed in the university fixed effects.) As the last

column in Table 5 makes clear, controlling for the departmental rankings added nothing to the

analysis.

       We wondered if the results regarding the vanishing gender differential and persistent public

affairs discount could be driven by the salary or reporting practices at an outlier university.

Therefore, we performed a jackknife-inspired sensitivity analysis of our preferred specification

(column (2)), by excluding one university at a time from the data file, re-imputing, and re-

estimating. In all cases, there was no systematic gender differential once citations were taken into

account, and the sign, significance and magnitude of the departmental premiums were largely

unaffected. (Tables available upon request.)

                                            [Table 6 about here]

       Lastly, we also wondered if the return to citations might be higher among economists than

among the other social scientists typically found in schools of public affairs. We found mixed



                                                 17
 
evidence on that front. As Table 6 illustrates, when we allowed for an interaction between gender

or discipline and the citation metrics, we found no evidence that the marginal effect was higher for

economists than for political scientists, but some evidence (from the non-imputed models) that the

marginal effect of an increase in citations was larger for these two social science disciplines than

for other disciplines found in schools of public affairs. Contrary to the findings of Sarsons (2017)

we found no reason to believe that the return to citations was systematically different for males

than for female faculty members in the institutions of higher education under analysis.



V.     CONCLUDING REMARKS

       Our salary study provides insight into fiscal practices at highly-ranked public universities

around the United States. In agreement with the literature reviewed, we found evidence of lower

average wages for women, as well as all faculty in departments that include a higher proportion of

women. The female differential disappeared when we controlled for citation record, but the

disciplinary and departmental differentials did not. We found some evidence that citation records

differed by gender, which is consistent with previous work by Dion, Sumner, and Mitchell (2018)

and Ferber and Brün (2011) suggesting that citation practices disadvantage female faculty

members. We also found evidence that economists had fewer citations, yet substantially higher

wages than their colleagues from other disciplines.

       Interestingly, our analysis did reveal a persistent pattern: economists in schools of public

affairs were paid at a significant discount, while their political scientists' colleagues were paid at

a significant premium, relative to their counterparts in disciplinary departments. In other words,

salaries across disciplines within schools of public affairs were more homogeneous than were the




                                                 18
 
salaries across disciplines between disciplinary departments in the same universities. Furthermore,

this pattern could not be explained by faculty sorting on gender.

       Two competing hypotheses could explain the schools of public affairs salary discount for

economists (and salary premium for political scientists). First, schools of public affairs could have

been trying to sustain some outdated, internal equity standard in the face of rising relative salaries

for economists (Curtis and Kisielewski, 2015). Buchanan and Tollison (1982) refer to this practice

as the homogenization of heterogeneous inputs.

       Second, both economist and political scientists who are employed at schools of public

affairs are fairly quantitative in nature--that is, their scholarly work is inherently applied and some

type of statistical modeling is common in their research. It is possible that the apparent public

affairs discount is really just a manifestation of an applied micro or public finance discount. This

would imply that there is an "applied discount" for economists who work at schools of public

affairs, while their political scientists enjoy an "applied premium."

       Regardless of which competing hypothesis might be true, one thing is for certain,

economists who chose public affairs departments experienced an estimated 18 percent salary loss

relative to their peers in departments of economics. Card, Mas, Moretti, and Saez (2012) argued

that relative perceptions of salary reduce job satisfaction for individuals earning below the median,

with individuals also reporting a higher likelihood of seeking employment elsewhere. In order to

facilitate intra-departmental cordiality, administrators may consider paying the economists on their

faculty a wage that more accurately reflects the relative pay of their peers in economics

departments.

Variable Type                             Variable Description
Annual Salary Compensation (log)          Dependent Variable : Annual salary in current dollars, as
                                          publicly reported by the respective institutions of higher
                                          education (IHEs). In cases where multiple salary figures
                                          were available, this indicator was full-time equivalent
                                          salary including reported benefits. The data represent the
                                          most recent reporting year as of July 2018 (which in most
                                          cases was 2017). Inconsistencies in reporting necessitate
                                          the use of IHE fixed effects for all salary models.

Productivity Measures                     Total Citation Count : Total number of citations.
                                          h-index : Characterizes faculty's productity in the field by
                                          combining both the breadth and depth of impact of their
                                          scholarly work (Hamermesh, 2018). The h-index is
                                          calculated by counting the number of publications for
                                          which a scholar has been cited by other scholars at least
                                          that same number of times. For example, a h-index of 16
                                          means that the scholar has published at least 16 papers
                                          that have each been cited at least 16 times.
                                          i10-index : Measures the number of papers with at least
                                          10 citations. For example, an i10-index of 12 means that
                                          12 publications of the scholar have each been cited at least
                                          10 times.
Notes: The productivity measures are from each faculty's Google Scholar profile as of November
2018. "Other Fields" include other fields whose faculty members are in the school of public affairs,
such as, sociology, demography, anthropology, etc.
