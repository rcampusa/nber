       PENSION FUNDING, PENSION ASSET ALLOCATION, AND CORPORATE FINANCE:

                      EVIDENCE FROM INDIVIDUAL COMPANY DATA



                                    Abstract


       This paper examines the relationship between U.S. corporations'

management of their pension plans and their management of the more familiar

aspects of corporate financial structure. The chief conclusion, on the

basis of data for 7,828 pension plans sponsored by 1,836 companies and their

subsidiaries, is that corporations do not manage the pension plans which they

sponsor as if these plans had nothing to do with the corporation. Different

responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different contexts, but

the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships between decisions

about pension assets and liabilities and decisions about the other assets

and liabilities of the firm.    At the same time, the pattern of these relation-

ships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar hypotheses that

have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature analyzing pension aspects

of corporate finance. Hence the conclusion from the data is also that the

connections between pension decisions and corporate financial decisions

in the more conventional   sense are, at least as yet, not well understood.

     PENSION FUNDING, PENSION ASSET ALLOCATION, AND CORPORATE FINANCE:

                       EVIDENCE FROM INDIVIDUAL COMPANY DATA


                               Benjamin M. Friedxnan*

       Private pension funds    now   constitute one of the largest pools of
investment   assets in the United States. Their total assets exceed $300

billion, and for the foreseeable future they are almost certain to grow

still further in relation to the overall size of the U.S. financial markets.

These funds already comprise by far the largest major category of institu-

tional investor in the U.S. corporate equity market, and the second largest

(after the life insurance industry) in the corporate bond market. As

private pension funds continue to account for a steadily growing share

of these key markets, their behavior becomes increasingly important to

the understanding of how the U.S. financial markets determine the yields

on, and prices of, financial assets.

       At the same time, both the assets held by private pension plans and

these plans' liabilities for future benefit payments are now large — and

growing —    in   relation to the non—pension assets and liabilities of the U.S.

private business sector. Many major corporations' pension assets and

pension liabilities represent substantial fractions of the net worth of

the company, and in some cases even bulk large in comparison to the

company's total assets. Because corporate equity shares therefore

represent ownership claims on two pools of assets, and obligations via

two sets of liabilities, shareholders clearly have a direct interest in

the company's pension plan in addition to the quantities that appear on
                                               —2—




 its balance sheet. The larger are the assets and liabilities of the
 company's pension plan, the greater is their role, along with the non—
pension    assets and   liabilities,   in   determining the sponsoring company's
overall   risk—return prospects. Hence private pension plans increasingly

matter not just for employees but for corporations' shareholders arid,

in the    event of default, corporations' creditors.
          The growing importance of pension plans' assets and liabilities

for nearly all constituencies within a typical corporation raises the

possibility that the corporation's overall financial position arid prospects

may influence its strategy for funding its pension liabilities, as

well as its subsequent allocation of these funds among alternative invest-

ment   assets,   in any of a number of ways. Companies may use      unfunded
pension   liabilities as a substitute for credit market debt, or alternatively

to extend overall indebtedness in conjunction with credit market debt.

Similarly, companies may invest pension assets so as to mitigate, or

alternatively to compound, the leverage and other risk—determining

characteristics    of their business. Then, too, there may be no connection

at all —perhaps because managements feel a responsibility to subordinate

the corporation's interest in its pension plan to the interests of the

plan's beneficiaries.

         Moreover, as private pension assets and liabilities continue to

grow in relation to the     balance sheet of the typical corporation, the
possibility   arises that the connection between corporate finance and
pensions may be as relevant for understanding the former as the latter.
If companies face limitations on the management of their pension assets
and liabilities (as they do under the 1974 Employee Retirement Income
Security Act), or if the treatment       for   tax purposes of any specific asset
                                             —3—




or   liability depends on whether it falls within the pension (as it

does under the current U.S. Tax Code), then        the   desired positioning

of   the   company's   consolidated pension plan and    balance   sheet may   not

be   attainable solely through actions executed in the pension plan. In
such circumstances companies may      take   at least some   features   of (or
constraints on) the pension plan      as   given in   making decisions about the

structure of their other assets and liabilities. More generally, a
company may act so as to determine the structure of its pension plan
and that of its balance sheet jointly.
       The object of this paper is to test empirically for interrelation-
ships along just these lines between U.S. corporations' management of

their pension plans and their management of the more familiar aspects

of corporate financial structure. (e motivation underlying this effort

is   to subject to empirical scrutiny some of the theoretical hypotheses

that have already emerged in the nascent literature of private pensions

and corporate finance. In addition, the goal is to examine the data

more   broadly, to allow other regularities to appear which may be suggestive
in the further development of theory describing these aspects of corpora-
tions' financial behavior.
           Because of the overwhelming heterogeneity of both       pension    arrange-
ments and financial structure within the U.S. corporate business sector,
as well as the profusion of powerful economic, regulatory, and other
institutional influences that have shaped the pension and general corporate
financial environments in recent years, any attempt to conduct such an
investigation using aggregated time-series data would be of limited value.
Instead, the analysis undertaken here relies on individual company data
assembled from the pension plan information that each plan sponsor
                                          —4—




 provides to the Internal Revenue    Service and the U.S. Department of Labor
 on Form 5500, used in conjunction with additional conventional individual
 company financial statistics contained in the Standard and Poor's
 Compustat file. The pension data are for plan year 1977, the only year
for   which a nearly complete Form 5500 file exists as of the time     of
writing.

         Section I describes the data and indicates the procedures used

for such steps as within-firm aggregation of multiple pension plans,

merging of the Form 5500 and Compustat files, and treatment of corporate

parent—subsidiary relationships. Section II, which focuses on pension

funding strategy, presents the results of a series of tests for relation-

ships between corporations' funding of their pension liabilities (the

total of which is taken as given here) and other characteristics of the

respective firms' business and balance sheet (also taken as given).

Section III, also on pension funding strategy, digresses to examine the

results of tests of the familiar hypothesis that corporations' decisions

in   this regard are oriented not to achieving fundamental financial
objectives but to smoothing their reported earnings statements over time.
Section IV, which focuses on     pension asset allocations, presents the

results of a series of tests for relationships between     corporations'
investment   of their pension assets (the total of which is taken as

given here) and other characteristics of the     firm's business and   balance

sheet   (also taken as given).   Section V generalizes the line of investiga-

tion pursued   in Section II by presenting results of tests for a joint
relationship between pension funding strategy and the corporation's
balance sheet, thereby allowing for the possibility that balance sheet
                                           —5—




decisions   may   not   be predetermined with respect to pension funding

decisions. Section VIbriefly sununarizes the paper's principal conclusions,
highlights some important caveats, and indicates directions for potential

future research.
 I. The Data
          The Employee Retirement Income     Security   Act of 1974 requires each

 pension benefit plan sponsored by a U.S. corporation to file a report

 ann, with the Internal          Revenue Service and    the   Department of   Labor,
 on Form 5500 (or Form 5500-C if the plan covers 100 or fewer participants).
 The form includes information about the plan's benefit structure, the
number and current status of the participants in the plan, the plan's
 income and expenses for the year, and the plan's beginning—of—year and
end—of—year assets broken down into a substantial detail of investment
categories. Each defined benefit plan must also file Form 5500 Schedule B,
which provides actuarial     information about the plan's accrued      liabilities,
including   its vested and   non-vested   liabilities separately, together with

other related items. The Appendix shows the format of Form 5500 and

Schedule B.
         The 1977 Employee Benefit Plan Sample     File   contains all 29,120 Form
5500 returns   submitted for   plan year 1977 and processed by      the Internal

Revenue   Service between July 1,   1978,   and June 30, 1979.1 Those returns
constituted    77.5% of the Form 5500 returns ultimately submitted for plan

year 1977. The 22.5% of the returns that are missing from the file are

heavily concentrated among smaller plans (as measured by asset size), how-

ever.2 Of the 29,120 returns included in the file, 4,694 either pertained
to   plans sponsored by non—profit organizations     or reported zero assets.
The   remaining 24,426 returns   form   the basic sample used in this paper.
         Table 1 shows the distribution of assets across this saxile of

24,426 plans. The combined assets for all 24,426 totaled $222 billion.3

The great majority of this $222 billion was concentrated in a small fraction

of   the plans. Nearly one-half of the plans had less than $1 million in

assets, and more than four-fifths had less than $5 million. By contrast,

the 22 plans with more than $1 billion in assets together accounted for

almost one-fifth of the total, and the 55 plans with more than $500 million

together accounted for almost one-third.4

          Because many   companies sponsor more than one pension plan — one
plan for salaried staff and another for wage earners, for example — the

24,426 plans in the sample represented only 15,098 sponsoring corporations.5

For purposes of testing hypotheses about relationships between pension asset

and liability decisions and corporate financial behavior in the conventional

sense, what presumably matters is not the assets or liabilities of any one

of a corporation's pension plans but the combined assets and liabilities

of all plans that it sponsors. Table 2 shows the distribution of the $222

billion in total assets across the 15,098 sponsoring firms in the sample.

As is to be expected, aggregating all plans sponsored by a single firm shifts

the distribution toward larger assets for each observation, although the

effect is quantitatively small.

        The most common form of pension plan in the United States is the

defined   benefit plan, but other forms (primarily the defined contribution
plan) exist as well. The distinction is relevant because the concept of
pension    "liabilities" has meaning only for defined benefit plans. For the

same reason, shareholders in a corporation have no direct financial interest

in how the assets of a defined contribution plan perform. Of the 24,426

plans in Table 1, 16,200 sponsored by 10,470 different companies, and

with $165 billion in assets, were defined benefit plans. Nevertheless,

856 of these plans failed to file Schedule B in time for the Internal

Revenue Service to process it, along with the corresponding Form 5500

return, before June 30, 1979. The remaining 15,344 plans, sponsored by

9,899 companies, reported $152 billion in cnbined assets, Table 3 shows

the distribution of these assets across the 9,899 firms.

          The information contained in Form 5500 is insufficient, of course,

to facilitate tests of hypotheses about            relationships   between pension asset

and    liability    decisions and   corporate   finance decisions in the conventional

sense. Some source of information about each sponsoring company's balance

sheet, as well as its income statement and other aspects of its financial

situation, is also necessary. Because many of the 15,098 companies sponsoring

pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample are either small or

closely held, however, obtaining such information on a comprehensive basis

would be impractical if not impossible. By contrast, most of the larger

companies       are included in the Standard & Poor's     Compustat file. A systematic

search,       based on a computer procedure supplemented with "by hand" inspection,
revealed      1,690 corporations included in the Compustat file that were sponsors

of 5,788 pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample.6

          Even so, simply matching Compustat firms with pension plan sponsors

would    still be inadequate.       The Compustat file reports balance sheets and

earnings statements for each included corporation on a consolidated basis

—that is, including all of the corporation's wholly owned subsidiaries.

From    the perspective of analyzing corporate financial behavior at the            level

of the relationships posited in this investigation, consolidation is pres.un-

ably    the   correct procedure. Matching Compustat firms          with   pension plan

sponsors      would be inadequate, therefore, without also consolidating plans
sponsored by each Compustat firm with plans sponsored by its subsidiaries
(if any). A laborious "by hand" search indeed revealed that 593 Compustat
firms   were sponsors -'--not directly,     but through subsidiaries —of 2,040

pension plans included in the 1977 Form 5500 sample.7 Of the 593 Compustat
firms   sponsoring pension plans through subsidiaries, 447 also sponsored

one or more plans directly.

          The fully aggregated and consolidated sample available for use in

testing for relationships between pension decisions and corporate financial

decisions therefore consists of 7,828 pension plans (including defined
benefit as well as other type plans, and, among defined benefit plans,
those that did and did not file Schedule B), with $153 billion in combined
assets, sponsored by 1,836 consolidated companies.8 Table 4 shows the
distribution       of the $153   billion of assets across the 1,836 firms.   Of

the 7,828 plans sponsored by consolidated Coxnpustat companies, 5,836 were

defined benefit plans, of which 5,670 filed Schedule B in time for Internal

Revenue   Service processing. Table 5 shows the distribution of these 5,670
plans' $110 billion of assets across the plans' 1,552 sponsoring firms.
A comparison of Tables 2 and 4,        and of Tables 3 and 5,   shows that the result

of not only consolidating subsidiaries into parent companies but also

excluding all plans      not sponsored by a Compustat firm (even through a sub-
sidiary) is to shift the distribution further toward larger dollar amounts
               9
per company.

II. Pension Funding Strategy

         In the most abstract conception of the incorporated firm, the assets

and   liabilities   of a corporation's defined benefit pension plan(s) are

just like the assets and liabilities that appear on its balance sheet.

Shareholders own both sets of assets, and they are responsible (to the

extent of their equity) for both sets of liabilities. Whether the firm's

management    acts so as to maximize the share price, to maximize expected
profits, or to achieve     yet some other objective, there is no need to dis-

tinguish between one pooi of assets and the     other, or between one group of
liabilities   and the other.

        Such an abstraction may fail to describe the world of U.S. corpora-

tions and their sponsored pension plans for several well-known reasons.'°

At the most practical level, the firm's flexibility on the pension liability

side is usually severely limited. Conventions of labor market practice,

reinforced by legal requirements and often by collective bargaining agree-

ments, restrict the range within which a firm and its workers can divide

total labor   costs   between current and deferred compensation. To the extent

that the firm's basic pension liabilities are predetermined from the perspec-

tive of financial decision making, therefore, its choice of pension

"liabilities" in this context refers only to that part of the basic actuarial

liability   in excess of the amount   of assets coimitted to the pension fund.

Hence decisions about pension "liabilities" in this sense are really decisions

about pension assets. Moreover, the firm's flexibility is limited here too,

in that its pension funding position must meet standards specified by the

nployee Retirement Income Security Act

        Wholly   apart fran such constraints, a variety of considerations may
lead the firm to see pension assets and liabilities as less than perfect
                                           —11—




substitutes for its other assets and        liabilities.   First, the implicit

cost   of "borrowing" by less than      fully   funding pension liabilities need
not be    identical, either before or after taxes, to the explicit cost of

borrowing      in the credit market.    In the extreme, the former "source of

funds" may be      available at times when the latter is not. Even       under   ordinary
circumstances,      the   scheduling of the "debt service" associated with the
two kinds of liabilities may differ in important ways. A second distinction
is that pension liabilities, unlike the firm's other liabilities in most

circumstances, are insured in a way that limits the firm's exposure. The

Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation insures corporations' pension liabil-

ities in full but, in the event of default, has a claim on only one-third

of the firm's assets. The tax treatment of pension plans provides a third

reason why the simple abstraction, in which one asset or liability is just

like any other, may not apply to actual corporations. Payments of funds

into the pension plan are deductible from the firm's income for tax pur-

poses, and earnings on assets held in the pension plan are excluded from

taxable income. Finally — although these four factors do not exhaust

the possible reasons for distinguishing pension versus         other   assets

and liabilities — shareholders         and potential shareholders may be   more

fully    aware of that part of a firm's liabilities which actually appears
on its balance sheet.12
         For   all of these familiar    reasons,   therefore, a corporation may not

behave   as   if it is indifferent between pension      and other assets, or between
pension and other liabilities. Hence instead of the usual net            worth constraint

         TA-TL      =     NW                                                         (1)
                                          —12—




where TA and TL are the firm's total assets and total liabilities,

respectively, and NW is net worth (assi.mted to be predetermined as of any

specific   time),   the   more relevant expression is


          PA+BA-PL--BL =            NW                                                  (2)



where PA and PL distinguish the assets and liabilities of the firm's defined

benefit pension plan(s), while BA and BL represent the assets and liabilities

that appear on the firm's balance sheet.13

          If the firm     were free to choose simultaneously each of these four
quantities, subject only to the net worth constraint, then its consolidated

"portfolio"    behavior would take the familiar form

              PA

                     =    c+BX                                                          (3)

             -BL


where X is a vector of       external factors determining the firm's responses,
Ct   is a vector of coefficients summing to unity, and B is a matrix of
coefficients with zero column sums. The most familiar empirical application
of   this conception is in a time—series context, in which Xwould include

primarily (often exclusively) the expected yields on the respective assets

and1iabilities. By contrast, in a cross—section context the elements of

X are firm—specific factors that are taken to be predetermined with respect

to the firm's      portfolio choice in the one time period under observation,
and that    (at least potentially) influence that choice. To the           extent    that
some of the firm's portfolio choices are predetermined with respect to
others,    however, some of the    elements   within the   left—hand   side of (3)
                                                —13—




belong    more properly       on the right. If the firm        decides     on its pension

assets and liabilities only secondarily, after deciding on its other

liabilities,        then   PA and PL may    depend on   BA and BL    as   well as the other

factors   included within X.
         One question        that immediately    arises in this context is whether

firms have     fixed targets for their total liabilities (PTJ +               BL)   so that
they    take on fewer pension liabilities as they have more liabilities on

their balance sheets or, alternatively, whether they systematically use

PL and BL together to achieve greater or lesser total leverage. Put in

another way, the question is whether the firm treats pension liabilities

and other liabilities as substitutes or conlements, although the sense

of substitutability versus complementarity involved here differs somewhat

from the usual one in which vector X includes specific time—varying yields

associated with PL and BL.

         The evidence from the 1977 Form 5500 sample is consistent with

comp].ementarity of PL and BL in this sense. Estimating the cross-section

         Further    analysis that controls for other influences in the spirit
of    (3), while maintaining the assumption that BL is predetermined with

respect to PL, supports this conclusion. Table 6 reports estimation results

for a series of regressions of the form


         PL     =       EL
                                                                                (5)


where X is, in turn, each of a series of variables describing the firm and

its operating environment. ice again, the positive relationship between

pension and other liabilities (both scaled by net worth) holds up regardless

of the choice of additional controlling variable.

         The specific results for the partial effects of the several controlling

variables are also interesting in some cases. Neither the growth rate nor

the trend-adjusted variability of the firm's earnings had a significant
effect on its pension liabilities. The 1977 rate of return on assets
affected pension liabilities positively, but the mean rate of return over

the past ten years did not. The negative effect of the volatility of rate

of return was marginally significant in the full sample, but not in the

subsample with large pension liabilities relative to the firm's total assets.

The firm's tax status had no significant effect. As would be expected, the

firm's labor intensiveness affected pension liabilities positively, arid the

fraction of the firm's pension plan participants who were still employed

affected pension liabilities negatively; but both effects were significant

in the full sample only.

         The failure of so many basic aspects of the firm's risk and return

situation to affect its pension liabilities supports the suggestion, made

above,   that   the firm does not actually choose PL in the usual portfolio

 sense. Instead, the firm may take PL as given — by labor market
 considerations, for example — so that its actual choice in this
 context is simply how much of its pension liabilities to fund. If the

 firm   were free to choose in this context, its portfolio problem would take
 the form




                    -BL      =   a+BX.                                           (6)
                -(PL - PA)


Moreover, if the firm decides only secondarily on its unfunded pension

liabilities (that is, on its pension assets in this context), then again

the possibility arises that (PL — PA) depends on BA and BL as well as on

any   or   all of the other factors included within X.

           The parallel question in this context is whether firms with large

amounts of debt on their balance sheet choose to have greater or smaller

amounts of unfunded liabilities. In this form the question bears a direct

connection to at least one prominent line of theoretical analysis of how

corporations'     pension funding decisions depend on their financial condition.

In   particular, Sharpe (1976)   has suggested that an important rationale for

firms to     fund their pension plans less than fully is the value of the
insurance provided by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) •15
In Sharpe's analysis the insurance written by the PBGC is equivalent to
a put option, and the firm's incentive is to maximize the value at the put.
A major implication of this line of reasoning is that firms    for   which the
probability of bankruptcy is nontrivial have an incentive to underfund their
pension    plans. The more highly levered a firm is, therefore —that is,       the
larger     is BL relative to NW, all other considerations equal — the greater
                                             —16—




is   the firm's incentive to underfurid its pension plan. In terms of the
current analysis, therefore, the Sharpe hypothesis suggest that BL and
(PL — PA) are complements.

          The   evidence from the   1977 Form 5500 sample       is   consistent with

complementarity not only     of   BL and   Pt,   as in (4), but also of BL and

(PL — PA).       Hence the data are consistent with Sharpe's analysis of the

pension funding decision. Estimating the cross—section regression

For the subsample of firms with PL/TA >             .03,   the corresponding results

are y =    .25, with t—statistic 9.3 (R2 = .13).              For the subsample with

Pt/TA >    .10,   the results are y =   .44,     with t—statistic 10.8 (R             .27).

that differ only in the assnption that the firm's choice variable is
unfunded pension liabilities rather than total pension liabilities.
Here Sharpe's analysis implies that aspects of the firm's operating
environment      that affect its probability of bankruptcy — variability of

earnings, for example — should        also increase the        firm's incentive to

underfund its     pension.   ice again, the strong          positive   relationship
between    (unfunded) pension liabilities and the firm's other liabilities
holds up regardless of the controlling variable. The results for the

 effects       of the individual controlling variables are again about              as in

 Table 6. In particular, neither volatility of earnings nor volatility
 of rate of return exhibits the significant positive effect that would

 be    consistent with Sharpe's hypothesis.

          Finally,      the form of both (7)        and (8)   assumes not only that the firm
takes    its    pension liabilities as given in deciding on pension funding, but

also    that the firm      takes   decisions solely on the difference (PL —            PA)

subject    to the constraint (S =           1.   The data consistently reject this con-

straint, however. Estimating (9) for the full sample yields (S = .60 and

                                                                              59)17     For the

y =    -.09,   with respective t-statistics 32.8 and —4.4 (2 =                .66).    For the

subsample with PL/TA >          .10,   the results are 6 = .66 and y =        -.16,   with

respective t—statistics 22.6 and —4.7 (R2 =                   .64).   The results of

estimating (10) with        any of the control variables shown in Tables 6 and                7

indicate similar values for iS and y,              and     values that are again consistent

with   those    found in   estimating (5) and (8).
         Hence the fLrm-to-fjrm variation in pension funding does not simply
reflect individual firms' decisions strictly about their unfunded liabilities.
                                                —18—




At   the margin, with       other   factors equal, a firm with an additional $1 of
pension liabilities typically funds only about 60 more in pension assets.
This marginal funding rate — marginal from one firm to the           next,   that is,
rather than     for   one   firm over   time — is also just equal to the average
funding ratio (.62) for all firms    the sample. In addition, the
                                           in

consistent finding of a negative y value in (9) and (10) indicates that
firms   with   greater amounts of non-pension liabilities fund their pension
liabilities less fully, to          the extent of about a l0 reduction in pension

funding for each $1 of additional non—pension liabilities. This result is

again consistent with Sharpe's analysis of the pension funding decision in

the context of the value of the put to the PBGC.

         The main conclusions that emerge from this consideration of the

firm's choice of pension liabilities and funding, on the asstunption that

the asset and liability totals on the firm's balance sheet are predetermined

with respect to its pension decisions, are (1) that pension liabilities,

either in total or in excess of funding, depend positively on the firm's

other liabilities; (2) that firms do not make decisions simply with respect

to their unfunded pension liabilities, but instead fund pension liabilities

less than one-for-one at the margin; (3) that funding of the firm's pension

liabilities depends negatively on its other liabilities; and (4) that,

apart from labor—specific characteristics like the firm's labor intensiveness

and the working—retired status of its labor force, basic aspects of the

firm's risk and return position have no apparent effect on its choice of

either total or unfunded pension liabilities.

III. The Earnings Smoothing Hypothesis

         The discussion of pension funding strategy in Section II focuses

on fundamental aspects of portfolio behavior: substitutability versus

complementarity of pension arid other liabilities, the degree to which pension

assets offset pension liabilities, and the role of other measures of risk

and return confronting the firm. From the perspective of any familiar theory

of corporate financial behavior, these considerations and others like them

are the principal determinants of the firm's pension decisions.

         By contrast, discussions of pension funding strategy by corporate

practitioners often emphasize different factors. In particular, in seeking

to explain why so many firms underfund their pension pians       despite   apparent

tax incentives to fund fully, corporate financial officers and other financial

market participants frequently cite the "hidden" nature of pension liabilities.

Because the pension plan is off the balance sheet, shareholders and others

may be at least partly unaware of the associated liabilities. The most

obvious implication of this assertion is that a firm may be able to raise

its share price by substituting pension liabilities for liabilities that

appear on the balance sheet, but recent research on the relationship between

stock prices and pension liabilities has provided evidence that typically
                                       18
warrants rejecting this proposition.

         A further implication of the idea that pension assets and liabilities

are "hidden" is that shareholders and other interested persons may judge

the firm's performance by its reported earnings, rather than by more com-

prehensive flow measures. Because contributions to a firm's pension plan

reduce   its reported earnings in the same way as any other expense item,
control over the timing of pension contributions enables firms to influence
the   time path of reported earnings. To    the   extent that the management seeks
                                      —20—




to report smoothly growing earnings over time, therefore, it may want to
increase pension contributions when business is strong and reduce them when
business is weak. Such actions need not change the total amount contributed

to the pension plan over time. Indeed, in the broader context that consol-

idates the firm's pension assets arid liabilities with its other assets and

liabilities, such actions change nothing at all. They have a purpose only

if some constituency, whose actions matter to the corporation, focuses on

the time path of reported earnings.

       This earnings smoothing hypothesis provides a potential explanation

for the pension underfunding puzzle to the extent that firms with unfunded

pension liabilities have more flexibility to adjust the timing of their

pension contributions than do firms with fully funded pensions. Restrictions

on pre-funding unaccrued pension liabilities prevent a firm with a fully

funded pension from making extraordinary increases in contributions, and

firms that simply decide to fund fully choose thereby to forego using the

potential flexibility in the opposite direction.

       Data from the 1977 Form 5500 sample provide evidence indicating

that firms typically do manage earnings in this way. For the entire sample

of firms with defined benefit plans, 70.0% had before—tax reported earnings

streams that were smoother, as measured by the normalized ten—year standard
deviation    around trend, than the corresponding consolidated earnings including

pension contributions. On an after-tax basis, with the included pension

contributions adjusted for additional taxes that the firm would otherwise

have paid, 70.5% of firms had smoother reported earnings than consolidated

earnings -

        Nevertheless, the data provide almost no support for the claim that
firms with underfunded pension liabilities are more likely to manage their
                                          —21—




reported earnings in this way. Table 8 shows the percentages of firms        with
smoother reported than consolidated earnings, comparable to the percentages

reported above, for a break-down of the full sample according to the ratio

of pension assets to pension liabilities. If anything, these distributions

seem to indicate that firms with underfunded pension liabilites are less

likely to engage in smoothing their reported earnings by managing their

pension contributions. Only for the two extreme subsamples —with funding

ratios below .10 or above .90 — does the relationship go in the hypothesized

direction.

        A more systematic examination of the data confirms this impression.

        In stan, the evidence does show substantial prevalence of the timing

of pension contributions so as to smooth reported earnings, but it does not

support the hypothesis relating this activity to the funding status of firms'

pensions. The explanation for the underfunding puzzle apparently lies
elsewhere.

IV. Pension Asset Allocations

       Private pension pians invest their assets in a way unlike any other

major category of institutional investors. For the aggregate of all pension

plans, nearly two—thirds of all assets held are corporate equities. Among

other major investor groups (apart from mutual funds), the corresponding

fractions are about one-fifth equities for the public pension plans sponsored

by state and local governments, one-sixth equities for fire and casualty

insurance companies, and one-ninth equities for life insurance companies
                                            19
(even including some "separate accounts")        Clearly there is something

unique about the investment choices made by private pension plans.

       To the extent that the assets in a corporation's defined benefit

pension plan "belong" to the sponsoring firm's shareholders, in the sense

that they and not the plan's beneficiaries stand to gain or lose according

to the assets' return, the heavy concentration of private pension assets in

equities is not surprising.0 By holding the corporation's shares in the

first place, shareholders have already expressed the desire for an equity

investment. Because of the pension plan(s) that the firm sponsors, however,

each such investment represents ownership in two pools of assets. If the

firm's pension plan holds debt securities instead of equities, then the

-shareholder's investment is no longer a pure (or even levered) equity but a

mixture of debt and equity claims.

       In the simplest abstraction like that used to motivate the discussion

in Section II, a corporation would not hold its pension assets in any form

other than the ordinary assets of its business —that is, in its own stock.

Legal restrictions preclude holding pension assets entirely in this form,

however, and also impose "prudence" standards that many firms interpret

to preclude investing pension assets entirely in equity securities even on
                                     —23—




a fully diversified basis. Once again, therefore, the extreme simplifica-

tion does   not adequately describe the behavior of actual corporations and
the pension plans that they sponsor. In addition, tax considerations appear
to favor holding equity assets outside the pension plan and   debt   assets in
the plan.21
         The discussion in Section II emphasizes the role of the firm's pension

assets and liabilities, along with the assets and liabilities on its balance

sheet,   in determining its overall risk and return posture. The allocation
of the pension assets among alternative investment vehicles   is a further

element in this calculus. For example, borrowing in the credit market

to finance additional (tax-deduction augmented) pension contributions has

essentially no risk implications for the firm if the pension plan then

invests these funds in debt securities, but such an action increases the

firm's risk if the pension plan invests in equities.22

         The dependence of the firm's riskand return posture on the allocation

of its pension assets raises in turn the possibility that these allocations

may depend on the firm's asset—liability structure in thesense of either

(1) or (2), or on other characteristics of the firm's business and

financial situation as introduced in (3), or on both. Sharpe's analysis

described in Section II, for example, suggests that firms with nontrivial

probability of bankruptcy have an incentive to maximize the value of the

effective put to the PBGC. In the context of pension asset allocation

decisions, therefore, the Sharpe hypothesis is that firms bearing

greater overall risk will tend to invest their pension assets more in

equities. Hence the more highly levered a firm is (as measured by

debt on the balance sheet or by unfunded pension liabilities), or the

greater is its risk exposure in other regards, the greater is the firm's
                                              —24—




incentive to invest its pension           assets   in equities.

         In the simple context of (3), the question of pension asset

allocation represents simply a disaggregation within the pension asset

total PA. By contrast, if the total amount of pension assets is predeter-

mined with respect to the allocation               as seems plausible in the

context of most corporations' decision procedures —then PA is the

constraining variable and       the   portfolio choice problem is of the form


             PA1

             PA2

                   =   a+BX                                                        (12)



             PAN


where the PA. are specific forms of pension assets, and              and B are again as

in (3). Table 9 presents the results of estimating this relationship,

for   the sample of all Compus tat firms sponsoring defined benefit plans,
in the somewhat different form

respectively, cis a vector of coefficients swnxning to zero, and y

         The one result that stands out in Table 9 is the negative relation-

ship between the allocation of pension assets to equities and the

variability of the firm's earnings relative to trend —a result that is

directly counter to the implication of Sharpe's hypothesis. Moreover,

this result holds regardless of the definition of earnings used (before

tax, after tax, with or without consolidation of pension contributions,

etc.), and   it also holds for subsaxnples limited according to the importance
             assets                                         23
of pension            in the firm's overall asset structure.     Hence firms

with greater business risk, as measured by greater volatility of earnings,

systematically seek to offset at least part of that risk by investing

their pension assets in instruments other than equities.

       It is interesting that several measures included in Table 9

do not appear to affect pension asset allocations. Despite the incentives

for taxable firms to hold high—yield assets in their pension plans and

low—yield assets on their balance sheets, as emphasized by Black (1980)

and Tepper (1981), the firm's tax status over the past five years had

no apparent impact at this level. Similarly, although the age and

related structure of the pension plan's beneficiary population affects

the time profile of liabilities under the plan, the current employment

ratio also had no effect. Finally, the firm's overall pension funding

ratio had no noticeable effect either — again in apparent contradiction

of Sharpe's analysis.

       It is also useful to note how two specific aspects of the results

shown in Table 9 carry over to the larger sample including Compustat firms'

defined contribution plans as well as their defined benefit plans. First,

the negative relationship between earnings volatility and the equity alloca-

tion was smaller in absolute magnitude, but statistically more significant,

in the broader sample.24 With cY(EBIT) as the control variable in (13), the
                                           —26—




estimated value of in the equity equation was —.11, with t—statistic
-4.0 (R 2 = .60). Second, although the current employment ratio of the
beneficiary      population   did not matter in the defined-benefit—only saxle,
it did in the broader sample. With AGE as the control variable, the
estimated   value of       in the equity equation was .014, with   t—statistic
         2 =          25
2.1   (R       .60)        Because a large AGE ratio typically reflects a younger

beneficiary population, a positive         value means   that plans with younger
workers   are typically more heavily invested in equities.          Hence pension

plans in which the beneficiaries stand to gain or lose according to the

return on the plan's invested assets do take account of the beneficiary

population's age structure in making asset allocation decisions, even though

plans in which the firm's shareholders stand to gain or lose from the

assets' return do not.

         The pension asset allocation and     the   pension funding ratio are two

major determinants of prospective risk and return for many         firms.   A third

important element in the risk and return structure, of course, is the debt

on the firm's balance sheet. The relationship among these several components

raises the possibility, therefore, that the firm's allocation of its pension

assets may also depend on its basic leverage. A relationship consistent

with the risk—offsetting strategy reported above, for example, would be for

highly levered firms to offset some of their leverage by holding debt

securities in their defined benefit pension plans.27 Alternatively,

under   either Sharpe 's PBGC put hypothesis or some form of "general
aggressiveness" hypothesis, firms content to have a more leveraged
position,   as   indicated by the liabilities on their balance sheets,
might further extend that risk posture by investing their pension assets
in equities.
                                            —27—




         Table    10 presents the results of an attempt to examine this question

in compact form by estimating the regression

                                                                                      (14)
         PAD+PAE          cL+YBL+BEQ+X

where BEQ is the book value of equity on the firm's balance sheet, and               all
other variables are as before. The estimated value of y is consistently

positive, in contradiction to either the Sharpe hypothesis or a "general

aggressiveness" hypothesis, indicating instead that firms with more

highly   levered balance sheets have some tendency to offset that leverage
by investing more or their pension assets in debt secuzities. 28             Somewhat

surprisingly, however, this positive relationship is statistically

significant (and     larger) in the broader     sample   including   defined contribu-

tion plans but not in the sample limited           to defined benefit plans.
         The estimated $ values shown in Table 10 support and extend the
findings shown in Table 9     in   several ways. First, the allocation      of pension

assets   to debt securities is positively related to any        measure of the
variability of earnings. It is         interesting that this effect, too,      is   always

larger   and more highly significant in the broader sample. Second, firms
with   high rates of return (to either assets or book equity) tend to invest

their pension assets more in equities and less in debt securities. Third,

the firm's tax status     apparently     has no independent impact on pension asset

allocation,   although allowing for it about doubles         the estimated magnitude

of the effect of balance sheet leverage. Fourth, after allowance for balance
sheet leverage, firms with yowiger pension beneficiary populations tend to
invest more in debt securities and less in equities, although the estimated
effect is smaller (as would be expected) and statistically insignificant

in    the broader sample including defined contribution plans.

          The main conclusions of this analysis of the allocation of pension

assets, on   the   assumption that not only the pension asset total but also

the   other principal elements of the firm's asset and liability structure
are predetermined with respect to that allocation choice, are (1) that firms
with more volatile earnings invest pension assets so as to offset their

ordinary   business risk by holding less equity and    more debt securities in

the   pension; (2) that firms with more highly leveraged balance sheets invest
pension   assets so   as to offset   this risk too, again by holding less equity

and more debt securities in the pension; (3) that firms earning high rates

of return adopt the opposite allocation strategy, investing pension assets

more in equities and less in debt securities; and (4) that firms' pension

asset allocation decisions also depend on the current employment status

of the pension beneficiary population, with employed (hence presumably

younger) beneficiaries leading firms with defined benefit plans to invest

pension assets less in equity and more in debt securities, but with just

the opposite effect for defined contribution plans.

V. The Corporate Balance Sheet

        The empirical analysis undertaken in Sections II and IV considers

first the firm's pension funding strategy, and then its pension asset

allocation, on the assumption that the   amount and nature of assets and

liabilities on the firm's balance sheet are predetermined with respect to

decisions about the firm's pension. Such a secondary role for pension

decisions in corporate financial structures may be plausible when the sums

involved are small in relation to the sponsoring firm's ordinary business

assets and liabilities. In an increasing number of corporations, however,

pension liabilities (and pension assets too, if the liabilities are fully

funded) are large in comparison to the assets and liabilities that appear

on the firm's balance sheet. Moreover, pensions are continuing to grow

more rapidly than general corporate assets or liabilities. The larger

pensions become, the more likely it is that firms make decisions about their

pension assets and liabilities and their other assets and liabilities

jointly.

        As the discussion in Section II already emphasizes, the combination

of legal requirements and established labor market practices sharply restricts

many firms' flexibility with respect to their pension liabilities. In

considering possible interrelationships by which the firm's pension assets

and liabilities affect its ordinary business decisions, therefore, a useful

place to begin is the possibility that the direction of influence in (4)

and (5) is backward. Estimating the reverse relationship, in which the firm

takes its pension liabilities as given in deciding how much to borrow on

its   balance   sheet,



        NW
             =    c+y    NW
                                                                            (15)
                                       —30—




yields   y =   .26, with t—statistic 7.8 (R2 = .04),   for the sample of all

Conipustatfirms sponsoring defined benefit plans, and y = .34, with
t-statistic 7.9 (R
                   2 =
                       .17) for the subsample in which each firm's pension
liabilities equal at least one—tenth of its total assets.29
        That estimating (4) in the reverse order (15) again leads to a
significant positive relationship is hardly surprising. What is more
interesting is that the positive partial relationship between pension
liabilities and other liabilities — that is, the relationship after

allowance for other controlling variables — also holds up on reversal
of the ordering. Table 11 presents results, analogous to those in
Table 6, of estimating the reverse of (5),

               =                                                               (16)


for the full sample and the sample with PL/TA > .10. ice again, the strong
positive value of y appears regardless of the choice of controlling variables.
         Although the focus of this paper is not on corporations' debt issuance,
except in    its relation to their sponsored pension plans, it is interesting

nevertheless to notice several of the      values in Table 11. First, the

growth of earnings had no effect on pension liabilities in (5), but earnings

growth negatively affects other liabilities in (16). This result also holds

for other definitions of earnings. Second, the mean rate of return either

on   assets or on equity (not shown in the table) had no effect on pension
liabilities in (5), but mean returns negatively affect other liabilities
in (16). Third, the variability of the firm's rate of return affected
pension liabilities negatively in (5), but return variability affects other
liabilities positively in (16), at least in the full sample.3° Fourth,

labor intensity affected pension liabilities positively in (5), at least

in the full sample, but labor intensity affects other liabilities

negatively in (16). Each of these influences is familiar in the literature

on   corporate choice of capital structures, and these results would perhaps
be of interest in an investigation of that subject. In the context of this
paper's focus on pensions, the main point is simply that the positive
partial relationship between pension liabilities and other liabilities
holds up after allowance for any of these separate effects.

         Similar   conclusions follow fran reversing the order of (7) and (8),

which treat not total pension liabilities but only the unfunded portion

as the relevant measure. Estimating the reverse relationship


         EL   =           PL-PA                                                           (17)


                                                    2
yields y = .50 with t—statistic 10.1                    =   .07),   for the full sample and
                                         2
y =   .61,   with t-statistic 10.8 (R        = .27) for the PL/TA > .10 subsample.31

Controlling for additional influences by estimating the regression


         BL               PL-PA
               =   cz+y                                                                   (1.8)




also yields consistently positive y values, and values roughly in line

with those shown in Table 11 and discussed above.

         Cmce again, it is useful to examine whether pension liabilities and

assets   matter separately in this context, or whether what matters is only
the difference, as in (17) and         (18).   Estimating the regression

         BL    =          PL      PA
                                                                                          (19)
                                           —32—




for    the full sample yields y = .49 and     (5   = —.51 with respective t-statistics

4.8 and —2.7 ('2 =      .05).   For the PL/TA > .10 sample, the corresponding

results are y = .58 and 6 = —.54, with respective t—statistics 6.1 and —3.1

(R2 = .17).     To the extent that firms make borrowing decisions in light

of their pension assets and liabilities, therefore, what matters is just

the unfunded pension liabilities.32 Moreover, these results too hold up

in the presence of other controlling variables like those included in Table

10.

         Finally, if firms   decide    on their pension assets arid liabilities

and on their other assets and liabilities in a fully joint way, then neither

the direction of influence assumed in the regressions presented in Section II

nor that assumed in (15) — (19) is strictly correct. Instead, a fully

simultaneous portfolio choice like that in (3) —or, if only unfunded

pension liabilities matter, (6) —would be the correct way to view the

firm's decision process. Table 12 presents results (values of ) for

estimating (3) directly, using one independent variable at a time. These

results add little to the analysis above, however. With the somewhat

marginal   exception of the earnings volatility measure, the estimation of the
full portfolio choice model does not reveal influences that affect both the
pension and   the   balance sheet.33
         The main conclusions of this analysis of the relationship between the
firm's borrowing decisions and     its   pension assets and    liabilities   are (1)
that the amount of liabilities on the firm's balance sheet is positively
related to the firm's pension liabilities; and (2) that what matters for
the determination of balance sheet liabilities in this context is just the
firm's unfunded pension liabilities rather than its pension assets and

liabilities   separately.

VI.     Concluding Remarks

         The final paragraph in each of Sections II - V summarizes in capsule

form the principal specific empirical findings of this paper, arid there is

no need to restate each one here. The unifying overall conclusion from

the data is that U.S. corporations do not manage the pension plans which

they sponsor as if these plans had nothing to do with the corporation.

Different responses appear to characterize firms' behavior in different

contexts, but the evidence persistently indicates clear relationships

between decisions about pension assets and liabilities arid decisions about

the other assets and liabilities of the firm. At the same time, the pattern

of these relationships is, more often than not, inconsistent with familiar

hypotheses that have emerged thus far in the theoretical literature

analyzing   pension aspects of corporate finance.
         At least three caveats are important, however. The most significant
is    that the measurement of pension liabilities is hardly uniform across

firms. To the extent that each corporation's management believes that

the value it reports for liabilities on Form 5500 Schedule B is the best

available measure of the firm's actual commitment or exposure, firm—to—

firm variation in actuarial assumptions need not affect the analysis here.

If managements make allowance for the differing actuarial assumptions,

however, then this analysis neglects a potentially important element.34

Further potential problems of a related nature also arise in connection with

the date and the method chosen for Schedule B valuation of pension assets.

         The second major caveat stems from the use in this paper of fully

consolidated firm data, incorporating all wholly owned subsidiaries, whenever

possible. No doubt many parent corporations do adopt a consolidated approach

to financial management. Even so, the possibility remains that many
                                      -.34 —




firms   handle such matters as pension decisions in a decentralized way,

or that some of the parent-subsidiary relationships consolidated here were

then (and may still be) too recent to have had much impact on the structure

of the subsidiaries' pension assets and liabilities.

         The third reason for caution in interpreting the results presented

here is simply that they reflect evidence from a cross—section of firms

(a quite comprehensive cross-section, to be sure) in one year only. Despite

its portfolio-theoretic approach, therefore, the analysis entirely omits

any account of effects due to changing yield relationships over time.

For the same reason, the analysis is also subject to all of the usual

problems associated with observing only one point in time. Was 1977 a

"typical" year, in any or all of the many senses that matter here? It is

never possible to answer such a question adequately. At the least, however,

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Pension Benefit

Guarantee Corporation were both very recent as of 1977, and neither may

yet have had its full impact on corporations' behavior.

         Each of these three reservations about the analysis presented in this

paper points to potentially fruitful directions for further empirical research.

Taking account of cross-firm variation in pension actuarial decisions, more

carefully treating the range of possible parent—subsidiary relationships,

and working with additional data as it becomes available would all be major

extensions of this work which could importantly alter the conclusions reached.

No doubt additional lines of investigation would provide new insights also.

This paper only begins to analyze the interrelationships connecting private

pensions and corporate finance. As private pensions continue to grow, in

both absolute and relative terms, those interrelationships will almost

surely become more powerful and more important for understanding financial

behavior.

* This   paper   is a part of the National Bureau of Economic Research study

 of private pension funds. I am grateful to Arturo Estrella and Joyce

 Manchester for research assistance; to them, Jay Light, and the

 participants in the National Bureau pension project, including especially

 Fischer Black, for many        helpful   discu.ssions and for comatents on an

 earlier   draft; and to    the National Bureau and the Alfred P. Sloan Founda-

 tion    for   research support.

1. The 1977 "plan year" for purposes of Form 5500 is either the 1977

    calendar year or the plan's fiscal year beginning in 1977. The plan

    sponsor has until seven months after the plan year ends to file the

    return.

2. A one—by-one inspection of the 384 plans reporting over $100 million

    in assets suggested few obvious omissions among large corporate

    sponsors.

3. By contrast, the Federal Reserve System's flow—of—funds accounts

    reported     total assets of private pension funds as $178 billion at
    yearend 1977 and      $198   billion at yearend 1978. The Form 5500 data
    therefore     confirm the widely acknowledged under-reporting in       the
    flow-of-funds sample.
4. The largest single plan, sponsored by General Electric Co., reported
    assets of $3.8 billion.
5. The great majority of companies sponsor five or fewer plans. The
    largest number of plans sponsored by any          one   company (excluding
    subsidiaries) was     63.
 6. The computer program that searches for Compustat matches was developed
      by Clint Cuxmnins; I am grateful to him for making the program available
 7. The key to this part of the matching process was the Directory of
      Corporate   Affiliations 1978 (Skokie: National Register Publishing Co.,

      Inc., 1978).       It would be difficult to overestimate the amount     of   pains-

      taking effort      devoted to this task by Arturo Estrella and Joyce
      Manchester.
 8.   Of the 1,836 consolidated plan      sponsors,   1,571 sponsored defined

      benefit plans.

 9. The pension sponsor with the largest amount         of   pension assets on a

      consolidated basis was American Telephone and        Telegraph   Co., with

      $18.4 billion in assets held in 3 plans sponsored by the parent

      company   and 26   plans sponsored by subsidiaries.

10. See, for example, the work of Black (1980), Feldstein and            Seligman
      (1981), Qldfjeld (1977), Scholes (1981), Sharpe (1976) and          Tepper
      (1981).
11. In many situations, a corporation's principal means          of   flexibility in

      this regard is its ability to choose what assumptions (interest rate,

      inflation rate, etc.) to use in calculating the actuarial value of the

      liabilities to be funded. See, for example, Pepper and Affleck (1974).

      A careful empirical study of corporations' behavior in this regard

      represents a potentially fruitful line of research, but one that lies

      beyond the scope of this paper; see Section VI below.

12. U.S. corporations must report, as a foothote to the balance sheet,

      the difference between vested pension liabilities and        the   level of

      pension   funding.    Neither total need be   stated   individually, nor   need
      the   corporation report its non—vested liabilities at all (except on
    Form 5500    Schedule B).
13. atever off—balance—sheet assets and liabilities the firm            has,  apart
     from PA and FL,    are included     in BA and BL   for purposes of this paper.
     See also   footnote 34 below on the definition of PL.
14. The sample for this regression, and         those   reported in the following
    discussion,    omits 13 firms for which net worth is sufficiently small
                   PL        FL
    that either         or        exceeds 3.0. The result of a significant

    positive relationship also appears (although with smaller y values)

    when   VL, the   firm's vested pension liabilities only, is used in

    place   of total pension liabilities FL. (The simple correlation
    between   VL and FL within       the total sample is .89.) It is interesting
    to note   that regressions of the form (4) and also (5) below, estimated

    with BA instead of NW as the scale variable, typically show a small

    negative value of y which is marginally significant at the .05 level.

    By contrast, most of the results reported in this paper are essentially

    invariant   to the choice of NW or BA as the scale variable; see footnote
    16 below for the one other case in which this choice makes a substantive
    difference.
15. See also the paper by Harrison and Sharpe in this volume.

16. Defined benefit plans report total assets explicitly on Form 5500

    and implicitly (as the difference between liabilities and unfunded

    liabilities)     on Schedule B. The two asset       measures need not coincide.

    For the 1977 sample, the simple correlation between the two is .92 in

    the disaggregated sample, and          .95 in the aggregated sample. The
    results reported here and below rely on the asset measure implicit in

    Schedule B because it is more likely to be consistent with the
      liability measure. Here, as in (4), using vested liabilities VL
      in place of PL also consistently results in a significant positive
      relationship,      but with smaller y values. In the regressions of the

      form (7) as well as (8) below, replacing NW by BA as the scale

      variable typically leads to small (in absolute value) values of 1

      of either sign, that are not statistically significant; see again

      footnote     14.
17.   The t—statistic associated with the explicit test of the null hypothesis

        = 1 is 28.2, easily warranting rejection at any               plausible   confidence

      level. For the two      subsample regressions      described inunediately below,

      the   analogous t—statistics are 19.2 and         11.9,   respectively.

18.   See especially Oldfield (1977) and Feldstein             and   Seligman   (1981), as

      well as the paper by Feldstein and Morck in this volume.                  It is
      always   possible, of course, that managements           make   decisions on the
      basis of believing that they can affect           the share price in this way

      even if that belief     is   false.

19. These aggregate data are from the Federal Reserve System's flow—of-

      funds   accounts   for yearend 1980. Although the proportions vary over

      time, primarily as a result of fluctuations in equity prices, the 1980

      values are not atypical.

20. See Pesando (1981) for evidence on beneficiaries' implicit sharing in

      these returns, however.

21. See Black (1980) and       Tepper (1981).
22. This statement abstracts from such factors as risk and                 maturity
      differences between the debt issued and           the   debt held.

23. For     the   subsample of firms   with   PA/BA >   .03, the value for CY(EBIT)
     in the equity equation is -.37, with t—statistic —2.5; for the

     subsample   with   PA/BA >   .10,   it is -.75, with t—statistic —2.2.

24. Again this result carried over to all measures of earnings.

25. The corresponding        values in the PAD and PAO equations were both

    negative, though not statistically significant.

26. This distinction between equity investment in the accumulation and

    the annuity phases of defined contribution pension plans corresponds

    to    what many participants in TIAA-CREF voluntarily elect when they
    switch    their pension reserves from CREF        to TIAA at or near the time
     of   retirement.

27. If the observations in the sample corresponded to different dates

     for the same firm, then      a positive relationship between     balance

     sheet leverage and pension asset allocations to debt securities

    would be evidence that firms behaved over time as Black (1980)

     and Tepper (1981) have suggested that they should for tax reasons.

     In a cross-section sample, however, no such inference would be

     warranted. At most, a positive cross-section relationship would

     indicate differences among firms in their extent of implementation

     of Black and Tepper's advice.

28. This positive relationship is opposite to what I found in earlier

     work based on a limited sample of Form 5500 and related data for

     plan year 1976.

29. Using vested liabilities VL in place of PL in (15) does not substan-

     tially affect the estimated y values, but does reduce the associated

     t—statistics; for the two samples reported above the results based

     on VL are, respectively, y =         .31,   with t-statistic 6.4 (R2 =   03),
     and y =     .26,   with t—statistic 5.0 CR2 =    .07).
30. The variability of the rate of return on equity affects other

     liabilities negatively in both the full sample and the PL/TA >         .10

     subsample.

31. Using vested liabilities VL in place of PL in (17) also consistently

    results in a significant positive relationship, but with smaller y

    values.

32. These results apply to the Schedule B value of assets. For the Form

     5500 asset totals, which need not have the same date as the liabilities

    reported in Schedule B, corresponding results are y = .46 and           = —.32,

    with respective t—statistics 8.9 and —4.9 CR2 = .06) for the full

    sample, and y = .58 and 5 = —.40, with respective t—statistics 8.7
                    2 =
    and —4.7 (R         .23) for the subsample.
33. The results for estimating (6) are comparable.

34. As Jay Light        points   out in his discussion in this volume, there is

    also a problem if managements use differing actuarial concepts in

    defining pension "liabilities"            or, even if a single concept is

    used,   if   that concept differs importantly from that assumed here.

    The concept of pension "liabilities" used here (as in all of the

    previous literature cited above) is the actuarial present discounted

    value of accrued obligations for future benefit payments. This

    concept is identical to the notion of "actuarial present value of

    accumulated plan benefits" as defined by the Financial Accounting

    Standards Board (FASB) in its Statement No. 35, adopted March, 1980

     (see especially pp. 6—9). What matters here, however, is what

    concepts managements used at the time when they submitted their
companies' reports for the 1977   plan   year.     the   basis   of a close

reading    of the pension handbooks and texts available at that time,
as well as the few available surveys of pension actuarial practice,
it is not possible to determine whether — or to what extent
managements relied on the concept used here,     which was later

formalized   by FASB-35, or the different net concept suggested by
Light, or yet some other interpretation. The question does bear
importantly on the empirical work in this paper, as well as in
all other empirical studies involving pension liability data before
FASB-35.
