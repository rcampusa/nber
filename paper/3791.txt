                 PERVASIVE SHORTAGES UNDER SOCIALISM




                              ABSTRACT

     We present a new theory of pervasive shortages under

socialism, based on the assumption that the planners are self-
interested.    Because the planners -- meaning bureaucrats in the

ministries and managers of firms --   cannot   keep the official
profits that firms earn, it is in their interest to create

shortages of output and to collect bribes from the rationed
consumers.    Unlike official profits, bribes are not turned over
to the state, and so shortages enable the key decision makers who

collect them to profit personally.    The theory suggests that an

increase in the official price of a good might reduce output.

The theory also suggests that market socialism is bound to fail

even without computational complexities facing the planners,

 1. Introduction.

        Shortage     of   goods is the single most pervasive phenomenon in socialist countries.

 Consumer goods ranging from necessities, such as food, to luxuries, such as cars and
                                                                                      gold, as
 well as many intermediate inputs, are typically in short
                                                          supply. Kornai (1979) and Weitzman

 (1984) argue that shortages as opposed to excess supply          of goods   distinguish socialism from

capitalism. In this paper, we offer a new explanation         of shortages under socialism.
        Standard explanations       of   shortages   of   goods under socialism are not completely

persuasive2. The classical explanation (Lange 1936) argues that shortages result from the

temporary difficulties in calculating equilibrium prices, which occur because convergence to

equilibrium takes time.      It is hard to take   this story seriously. In the Soviet Union, shortages

of some goods, such as automobiles, have lasted for decades, without any price increases.          The

planners simply do not raise prices to assure convergence to the market clearing equilibrium.

       Second,     it is often argued that distributional considerations lead socialist plannersto keep
down prices     of   some goods such as food (Weitzman 1977).                  Although distributional
considerations may explain shortages       of somegoods, such as food and housing, they are hardly
a general explanation. Why, for example,has the Soviet Union
                                                             always experienced a shortage
of such luxuries    as cars and owner occupied apartments? The government has long been
                                                                                        trying
to extract the excess savings from the rich, and raising prices        of luxuries   would have been   a
natural way   of doing this. It does not appear, then,      that fairness is the real issue.

       A third influential explanation      of shortages,    offered by Komai (1979), is that firms




    2For an excellent overview of standard explanations, as well as an
                                                                       ingenious new theory, see
Rolemberg (1990).
                                                      3
demanding inputs face soft budget constraints and so always want to get anything they possibly

can at any price. In Kornai's model, it is not so much that goods are underpriced. but that the

income    o the buyers is      effectively infinite.      This model may be appropriate for some

intermediate goods. But households face hard budget constraints, and therefore the systematic

shortages of many consumer goods remain a puzzle. Moreover, we claim below that the notion

that the socialist firm always wants to expand output is incorrect. Our explanation          of shortages

applies to consumer luxuries and necessities, as well as to intermediate goods.

         We argue that the reason for pervasive shortages is self-interested behaviorby ministry

bureaucrats who set the plan prices and output. These bureaucrats intentionally plan shortages

in order to encourage bribes from rationed consumers.          If markets cleared,   firms in an industry

could earn profits, but most     of these profits   would accrue to the state treasury, not to the firms

or the   ministries. The key feature    of socialism is that the decision makers     who determine the

prices and output   of firms   do not, to a first approximation, keep any of these profits. When,

in contrast, there is a shortage     of a good, the potential    customers try to obtain this good by

offering bribes and favors to the bureaucrats in the ministry (and to the managers             of firms).
These bribes tend to be much larger than the share          of official profits that the bureaucrats   and

the managers are allowed to keep. And because these bribes are not official transactions, none

of them go to the treasury. As a result, the industry is better off creating a shortage of the

goods and collecting the bribes than making official profits it cannot keep. We show that, for

a variety of regulatory schemes, socialist firms will always produce a level of output entailing

a shortage at official prices.

         Our paper is an application      of the    general principles   of rent-seeking,   introduced by
                                                     4
Tultock (1967), Krueger (1974), Posrier (1975),and Bhagwati (1982). The literature on central

planning has long recognized that price distortions can lead to Tuilock-like welfare losses as

people waste time queueing for the goods (Stahl and Alexeev          l985)   This literature has taken

underpricing as exogenous, however. The idea of our paper is that underpricing and shortages

are the result of the rational choice of the key decision makers, who collect the rents that result

from shortages. Although we focus on shortages in socialist countries, thepoint that bureaucrats

create artificial barriers to private transactions in orderto collect bribes is more general. Many

laws and regulations in less developed and even developed countries have the same effect.            It
seemed useful to us to bringout the implications of this general principle for the most
                                                                                        pervasive
feature   of socialism:   the shortage   of goods.
          The next section of the paper discusses the objectives   of a socialist industry and presents
our explanation    of pervasive   shortages. Section 3 discusses somespecific types of restrictions

that the center might impose on the socialist industry to control bribery and raise output. We

show how difficult it is to avoid shortages. Section 4 concludes with some general implications

of this theory for socialist and market economies, and     paricularly for market socialism.




2. The objective function of a socialist industry.

          To describe its objective function, we must first define what we mean by        'a socialist
industry.' We define a socialist industry as the combination of the firms in the industry and the

ministry that supervises them. We assume that this industry has some demand curve and some

cost curve. The objective function of this industry is the objective function of the bureaucrats
                                                     5

in the ministry and the managers of firms. Importantly, we assume that the bureaucrats and the

managers collude to pursue their common objective function. As a result, we do not focus on

the potential conflicts between the bureaucrats and the managers.                  Our view is that the

bureaucrats in the ministry and the managers             of the firm have the    same broad objective --

namely to enrich themselves at the expense        of their customers -- and they bargain      efficiently on

how to divide the surplus. One example           of this   is   that the ministry gives the orders and the

firmsjust follow them as best they can.

       Given this view     of a socialist industry,it is not important whether it consists of just one
or of several firms. Even      if thereare several   firms, the bureaucrats in the ministry will enforce

collusion between them, and they will act as a monopolist. In particular, the bureaucrats will

not allow these firms to compete for bribes. This assumption is quite natural: the ministry has

a great deal of control over prices and outputs of the firms it supervises, and it is in the long run

interest   of the   managers   of the   firms as well to make sure that the monopoly allocation is

sustained, In short, we are assuming that the industry consists              of one decision    maker, who

expresses the combined interest         of the bureaucrats      and the managers. and whom we shall call

'the industry."

           What is the objective function of this industry'? Typically, the industry does not keep any

of the profits it earns from    selling its output at official prices, since the tax rate by the central

authorities is close to 100 percent. The argument made to justify the expropriation               of profits

is that the state owns the firms and       so is entitled to the profits. Even    if the   industry can keep

some   of the     profits, virtually none     of them    accrue to the managers and to the ministry

bureaucrats. Official profits are of no value to the decision-makers. Such taxation of profits
                                                   6

implies, in particular, that the industry has no interest in charging an official price equal to the

monopoly price and supplying the monopoly output. Nor does the industry have any interest

in producing     a competitive output at a competitive price,   since the profits on the inframarginal

units again accrue to the state. A socialist industry gets no or virtually no benefits from earning

legal profits.

        The only way that the industry can get anything for itselfis by having a shortage of the

good it produces and then collecting the rents from the quantity-constrained buyers in the form

of bribes.   When there is a shortage, buyers' valuation     of the good     exceeds the official price,

and so they are willing to stand in line, lobby the firm and the ministry, and most importantly

pay bribes to get the good. Of course, to the extent they lobby and stand in line, the buyers do

not benefit the industry. But to the extent that the shortage brings in bribes, the
                                                                                    industry
benefits from a shortage. The advantage        of bribes   over profits is   of course that bribes are
hidden and therefore are not turned over to the treasury. As long as the tax rate on official

profits is high enough that the managers and the bureaucrats would prefer to collect the bribes

even despite all the waste associated with queueing and lobbying, they would try to create a

shortage. The industry's objective, briefly stated, is to maximize the bribes.

       If we denote the inverse demand curve of the industry by D(Q) and the official price by
P, the objective   function of the industry is given by

(1) D(Q)*Q - P*Q

This objective function, for an arbitrary P and Q, is given by the rectangle in Figure I. We are

assuming that the true price the industry charges the buyers is D(Q)         —   the reservationprice of

the marginal buyer -- and that this price consists   of two parts.   The first is the official price P.
d
                                                    7
and the second is the bribe D(Q) - P. The rents that this industry collects are the productof the

bribe per unit of output times the output.

        l'here is a simple way to think of this objective function. The first term, D(Q)*Q             j
simply the revenue that any industry would collect      if the   market cleared   at the output Q, which
we will denote by R(Q). However, the cost to a socialist industry is very different from the cost

to a private industry. The real cost function does not even enter the objective function (1). As

Kornai has pointed out, the socialist industry does not care at all about the cost of its inputs,

since these inputs are effectively paid for by the state. With a close to 100 percent profits tax,

the official cost of the inputs only trivially affects the fortunes of the bureaucrats and the

managers in the industry. Instead, the official revenues of the firm, P*Q, are the cost to the

managers and the bureaucrats5, The higher the official price for its output, the lower are the

bribes that the industry can collect per unit   of output,and so the higher the effectivecost of this
output. This is the key assumption that drives our view          of shortage: the   official revenues are

a drain to the bureaucrats and managers; they are just like the production cost or an excise tax

to a private firm. Once this point is recognized, the objective function of the
                                                                                industry given by

(1) is just the revenue minus the cost.

       In writing down this objective function, we are making several specific assumptions.

First, we are assuming that bribes are collected efficiently. Customers don't stand in line or



     3We make the assumption that the true costs do not enter the objective function for realism.
We could easily assume that these costs iTi fact enter the objective function because some or all
of the costshave to be paid in bribes, or because the industry faces someprofitability constraints
(as we assume below). These assumptions will change the exact solution to the industry's
problem. However, the result that the industry will try to crcatc a shortage is preserved under
alt these altemative assumptions.
                                                   8

inefficiently lobby the producers, they just pay the bribe D(Q) - P. This assumption is obviously

unrealistic, since we observe queues, lobbying and other inefficient behavior as well as bribes

in socialist countries. We do not need such a strong assumption, however. We need to assume

that the tax rate on official profits is high enough that the industry tries to collect bribes rather

than official profits.   Even   if there are   some restrictions on bribery that lead to queues in

equilibrium, the objective function will    be similarto (I), and we will still get the result that the

industry wants to create a shortage.

        Second, we are assuming that there is no price discrimination in bribes. Every customer

who wants the good pays D(Q)           P.   If price discrimination in bribes     were perfect, every

customer would pay his reservation price in the form      of bribes,   and there would be no shortage

at the official price, But as long as price discrimination is not perfect, there will be a shortage.

In section 3, we present an example in which the industry imperfectly price discriminates

between buyers by setting high bribes but allowing some queues as well.

        Third, as we already mentioned, the ministry precludes bribe competition between

producers, so in equilibrium bribes are chosen monopolistically.               If bribes were chosen

competitively, producers would cut bribes competitively until they reached 0. Unlike market

economies, however, where price competition is intense, socialist economies have a natural

collusion device, namely the ministries.

        Once the objective function (1) is granted, our main point follows immediately. The

industry maximizes the value     of the bribes,   and this value is zero   if markets clear.   The only

                                                                                      --
way this industry can get anything to itself-- meaning to its bureaucrats and managers is by

having a combination     of the quantity and the official price that creates a shortage. Only if there
                                                      9
is a shortage      will the value   of bribes   be positive. Shortage is thus not just the coincident

consequence     of the difficulty of socialist calculation;   it   is the most generic consequence of the

true objectives    of socialist industries.

          Figure    2    illustrates what an unrestrained socialist industry would like to do.

Differentiating (1) with respect to Q holding the official price constant, we obtain the first order

condition for the industry for the case where the official price is given exogenously:

(2) R'(Q)      = P.
If the industry takes the priceas exogenous, it will set the marginal revenue equal to the official
price.     This result   is immediately obvious    once it is recognized that the official price is the

marginal cost of the socialist industry. Equation (2) explains the indifference curves            of the
socialist industry presented in Figure 2. These indifference curves peak our at their intersection

with the marginal revenue curve, and decline on both sides of it. Figure 2 illustrates that if the

industry could pick both its price and the quantity it produces, it would set the price equal to

zero (to minimize what it perceives to be its marginal cost), and set the outputat the point where

the marginal revenue from producing more is equal to zero. Again, this result is obvious once

it   is realized that the official price is the marginal cost of the industry.

          More generally, Figure 2 illustrates that starting from any market clearing price/output

combination, the industry always wants to cut both its official price and its output. The industry

wants to cut its price because lower official prices for a given output simply raise the market

clearing bribes. And the industry wants to cut its output at a given price for precisely the same

reason that monopoly wants to cut output from the competitive level at a given marginal cost:

marginal revenue curve is to the left of the demand curve. By cutting output from the market
     ? .9,i,9iJ

clearing level, the socialist industry increases the value of the rents it collects. This socialist

industry always wants to move southwest from the market clearing position, i.e. to create a

shortage. If the plan imposed irons the center is so tight as to force the industry to be on the

demand curve, the market would clear and no bribes would be collected. But if the socialist

industry has any discretion whatsoever to renegotiate the plan so as to move southwest from a

point on the demand curve, it would do so and thereby create a shortage. This is the central

proposition   of this paper.
         This result casts doubt on Kornai's (1979) argument that because socialist firms do not

pay for their inputs, they have an incentive to expand ad infinitum. Perhaps they have an

incentive to get all the jtptij they can lay their hands on, since they don't pay for them and

maybe can sell them. But       jp     expansion is not costless to socialist firms, because it limits

their ability to collect bribes. As these firms expand, marginal revenue falls and        at some point
it falls below   the true marginal cost to these firms, which is the official price. Since socialist

firms have a well-defined objective of maximizing the value of bribes, they have the incentive

to restrict output to the level wltere the marginal revenue equals to the marginal cost they face;

and this output certainly is not infinite.

         The message of this section, then,   is   that a socialist industry has a very strong incentive

to create a shortage. So long as it has some discretion over its price and output, it will do so.

Of course, we do not really believe that the socialist industry will get its maximum bribes and

charge   a zero official price.   The central authorities will then run an enormous deficit as well

as face enormous pressure from consumers to interfere in some ways. In the next section, we

will discuss some plausible forms of such interference and their implications,
                                                   Il
3. Restrictions on the industry.

       This section does not describe the optimal regulatory scheme for the central planners.

The optimal regulatory scheme would probably let the industry keep enough of its profits that

it chooses   to collect profits on the official market ratherthan in the form of bribes. We are also

reluctant to pursue the optimal regulatory framework because we do not believe that this is the

true objective   of the   central planners. As we have argued, bureaucrats in the ministries and

hIgberj share in the bribes collected by the industry.      As a result, to a significant extent they

are captured' by the industry and so have no incentive to eliminate the bribes (Stigler 1972).

Nonetheless, it is plausible to think that central authorities are under some political pressure

from the consumers, especially the consumers        of intermediate   goods, to limit the shortages

They are probably also under budgetary pressure to collect someofficial profits. In these cases,

they might try to impose some constraints on the industry. In this section, we examine two

interesting types of constraints: price setting by the center and minimum profit requirements.



Price setting by the center

       What happens when the center sets the price for the industry is clear from equation (2),

and is illustrated in Figure 3. The industry sets output at the point where the marginal revenue

is equal to the official price. Because output    at this point is below demand, there is a shortage
and the industry collects positive bribes. In this case, the industry would want the price to be

set at as low a level as possible, since the bribes are maximized at the zero (or even negative)

price. But even    at higher prices, there are   shortages. The center could set the price equal to

the marginal revenue at the competitive output level. In this case, the industry would produce

               %4,)

                                                   12

the efficient output level, the effective price (including the bribe) would be equal to thc markct

clearing price, but the official price would be below that level.

         What happens when central authorities raise prices to reduce shortages? In this modei,

the effect   of raising   prices is   jgce rather than to raise output, since a higher marginal
revenue corresponds to a lower output. The reason is that the official price of output is the

marginal cost to the socialist industry. Raising official prices is just like raising the marginal

cost, and so leads to a reduction in output. Because higher official prices lead to losses of bribes

on the marginal units, it pays the industry to cut its output. An official price increase thus has

the perverse effect   of reducing      supply as the industry struggles to keep up the value   of the
bribes, A price increase does not solve the problem        of shortages.
         Of course, the center could address this problem by imposing both the price and the

minimum quota that the industry must sell.        If this quota is high enough to put the industry on
its demand curve, there is no way it can collect bribes (unless it can destroy output -- which

sometimeshappensin the USSR). If, however, there is a shortage at the official quota output,

the industry can collectsomebribes.        It can try to collecta bribe from each consumer, equal   to

the difference between the marginal valuation at the quota output and the official price at that

output. Altematively, the industry can try to price discriminate between consumers, collecting

bribes from those with high value       of time, and leaving those with low value of time standing in
tine. tn this case, we wilt observe both bribes and queues in equilibrium. The analysis of the

various price discrimination devices that the industry can employ is beyond the scope          of this

paper.    However, it is worth noting that       if the industry must   meet an output quota, output

obviously wilt not fall in response to a price increase.

 Minimum profit constraints

          Central authontses might    try to limit bribery by imposing a minimum profit constraint
 on the industry, but letting it choose the price and the output, We have already shown that,          if
 left to its own devices,    the industry would charge   a zero official price and collect huge bribes.
 It would consequently       run a large loss on the official account, which, with a soft budget

 constraint,it does not care about. One way that the central authorities can raise prices indirectly

is to harden the budget constraint.

          Suppose the center demands from the industry an official account profit of at least A:

(3)p*QC(Q)>            A,

where C(Q) denotes the official cost of producing the output Q. The minimum required profit

could be zero, but it also could be positive or negative.

         If we substitute   (3) into (1), the objective of the industry becomes to maximize

(4) D(Q)*Q     - C(Q) - A.
Taking the first order condition, we find that at the maximum level of bribes, it must be that:

(5) R'(Q)   = C'(Q),

i.e., the marginal revenue     is equal to the marginalofficial cost. The
                                                                          industry subject to a   profit
constraint always chooses monopoly outputregardless         of the level of the constraint   (see Figure

4).   It then chooses the lowest price for which   its official profits are exactly equal to the amount

that it has to earn The effective price to the consumers is the monopoly price, but it is
                                                                                          split
between the official price that assures the industry the required level of
                                                                           profits and the bribe.

The reason for lower shortages, however, is not a higher output but a higher price: the output

stays the same at the monopoly level.        A harder budget constraint only redistributes profits

between the industry and the treasury; it does not affect output.     if the central authorities want
a high output, they should set a low official price and let the firm run large losses on the official

account. This sometimes happens in socialist countries.



4. Conclusion.

       We have presented a model of shortages in socialist economies intentionally created by

an industry -- meaning bureaucrats in the ministry and managers of firms -- trying to collect

rents in the form   of bribeswhen they cannot keep the official profits. This theory suggests that
because public ownership    of firms and the resulting   expropriation   of official profits is endemic
to socialist economies, so will be the shortages. In contrast, because firms and their profits are

owned privately under capitalism, capitalist producers would always wish to collect official"

profits by charging higher "official prices. At a given price, a capitalist producers would want

to sell more, leading to what Weitzman (1984) calls excess supply" of goods. Our model thus

accordswell with the central distinction between capitalism and socialism stressed by Kornai and

Weitzman: "excess supply      of goods under capitalism     and excess demand under socialism.

       The issueof who keeps the profits is germane to publicly held firmsin market economies

as well. It is often said that public monopolies underpricc output and so create shortages.         In
many countries with public phone companies, such as l3razil and France, it takes a long time to

get a phone line, and a bribe helps to get it faster. Since public monopolies and their managers

cannot keep a large share of the profits they generate, it is not surprising that they create a

situation so conducive to the collection   of bribes and   favors more generally.

       The major theme of our analysis         is   that the planners socialist economies are self-

interested. This assumption contrasts sharply with the one usually made in the debate on market

socialism.   Since Barone (1898), both opponents and advocates              of market socialism   have

assumed a benevolent central planner. As a result, the market socialism literature has focused

on the complexity of the computational task facing this benevolent planner        (eg.,   Lange 1936).

If, contrary to the assumption of this literature, central planners are self-interested, then the

possibility of efficient resource allocation under market socialism is in much greater doubt. For,

as we have   shown,   it is in the interest of such planners to cut output and to create price
distortions. In direct contrast to Lange's (1936) claim that monopolistic output restrictions are

the likely productof market economies, we have shown that such restrictions are likely to          Lake

place under socialism. Even without computational complexities, socialism with self-interested

planners will not result in efficient resource allocation.

       How big the inefficiencies are depends largely on how the rectangles resulting from

shortages are allocated.   If the rectangles are fully collected     as bribes, as we have generally

assumed in this paper, then welfare losses will          be small, If,   however, these rectangles are

largely wasted in queues and other inefficient rent-seeking, then the welfare losses from

shortages will   be much higher.    The time spentin queues will largely be taken out         of work.

Moreover, when procuring goods takes time, people might have a very low incentive to work

rather than look for goods, which   ofcourse   leads to lower output.     If a follow-up paper (Shleifer
and Vishny 1991), we arguethat the general equilibrium effects of inefficient rent-seeking, such

as queueing, may be much larger than even the Tullock rectangles would suggest.
