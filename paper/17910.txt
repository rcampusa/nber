Churn, defined as replacing departing workers with new ones as workers move to more productive
uses, is an important feature of labor dynamics. The majority of hiring and separation reflects churn
rather than hiring for expansion or separation for contraction. Using the JOLTS data, we show that
churn decreased significantly during the most recent recession with almost four-fifths of the decline
in hiring reflecting decreases in churn. Reductions in churn have costs because they reflect a reduction
in labor movement to higher valued uses. We estimate the cost of reduced churn to be $208 billion.
On an annual basis, this amounts to about .4% of GDP for a period of 3 1/2 years.

        Hires occur for two reasons - to grow a business and to replace those who have left.

Hiring can be for expansion or it can be associated with churn. Analogously, separations reflect

a decrease in the size of the business or the departure of a current employee who is replaced by a

new employee. The importance of churn, growth hires, and employment-decreasing separations

changes over the business cycle in a logical way.

        Churn is an important part of employment dynamics, allowing workers to move to their

most productive use. Although churn has no direct effect on employment growth since for every

worker who separates another worker is hired into the business, understanding churn helps

provide a clearer picture of what happens to the labor market when the economy slows and when

it recovers.

        We present empirical evidence on churn from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover

Survey (JOLTS) microdata. Churn is procyclical. Churn declines during recessions because

separations, which during good times would have been associated with a replacement hire, are

allowed to go unfilled during recessions. As a result, employment declines. Churn also declines

during recessions because workers become reluctant to quit their jobs, and in response businesses

reduce their hiring. Hiring declines during recessions. During the 2007-09 recession, four-fifths

of hiring reductions were associated with reduced churn, not with reductions in job creation.

        Recession-induced decreases in churn are important because they are likely to reduce the

effectiveness with which the labor force operates. Churn moves workers from less productive

uses to more productive ones. The cost of lower churn can be substantial if the reduced

movement of labor that occurs during recessions is permanent or long lasting. We estimate that

the cost of reduced churn is about two-fifths of a percentage point of GDP annually throughout

the three-and-one-half year period since the beginning of the recession.



                                                1
I. An Accounting Framework

         Hires occur in businesses that are expanding, contracting, or staying the same size.

Define HE, HC, and HZ as hiring in expanding, contracting, and zero change businesses, and

define H as total hires in the economy: H = HE + HC + HZ. Similarly, separations S occur in

businesses that are expanding, contracting, or staying the same size, such that S = SE + SC + SZ.

         In expanding businesses, hires can be decomposed into growth hires HGE and

replacement hires HRE. For example, a business that expands by three may hire seven workers

and lose four workers to quits, layoffs, or retirement. The four workers hired to replace the

separating workers are replacement hires (HRE), and the remaining three workers are hires to

grow the business (HGE).1 Note that growth hiring in expanding businesses is the same as job

creation. Also note that the number of replacement hires in expanding businesses HRE is equal to

the number of separating workers in expanding businesses SE.

         In contracting businesses, separations can be decomposed into separations that decrease

the size of the business SDC and separations that are replaced by hired workers SRC. The number

of replacement separations in contracting businesses is the same as the number of workers hired

in contracting businesses, SRC=HC, and separating workers to decrease employment in the

business (SDC) is the same as job destruction. To complete the accounting framework, the

number of hires in zero growth businesses, HZ, is identical to the number of separations in zero

growth businesses, SZ.



1
  Ideally, growth hires and replacement hires could be defined at the “job” level within businesses. For example, if
four secretaries quit and the business hires two secretaries and five computer programmers, one may want to say that
only two secretary positions are being replaced, and the five computer programmers are growth hires. The JOLTS
data do not permit an examination at this level of detail. All workers are treated alike when measuring hires into and
separations from the business.

                                                          2
       Churn is defined as the hires and separations that offset each other within a business.

Define CHE, CHC, and CHZ as churn in expanding, contracting, and zero change businesses:

(1)    a.      CHE = HRE = SE

       b.      CHC = HC = SRC

       c.      CHZ = HZ = SZ.

Total churn in the economy is CH = CHE + CHC + CHZ. Additionally,

(2)    a.      H = HGE + CH

       b.      S = SDC + CH.



II. The Dynamics of Hiring and Separation During Recessions

       The net change in employment, using (2a) and (2b), is H - S = HGE - SDC. Note that total

churn CH, which is a part of both total hires and total separations, does not affect net

employment growth H-S. However, understanding the business-cycle pattern of churn gives a

richer picture of what happens during recessions.

       As the economy slows and businesses decrease their hiring, separations that would have

been matched by hiring during good times remain unfilled and churn can turn into employment-

decreasing separations. Conversely, when separations rise as the economy slows, hiring that

would have expanded the size of the business during good times becomes churn. If the first

mechanism is dominant, then churn would fall during recessions. If the second is dominant, then

churn would rise.

       It is also possible for churn to change without any change in job creation or job

destruction. For example, businesses could go from hiring and separating, say, ten percent of

their workers per quarter to hiring and separating five percent per quarter, which is especially



                                                  3
likely if the quit rate declines during downturns. Another complication is that separations are

comprised of both quits and layoffs, which operate differently in recessions. Quits are worker-

induced separations that fall during recessions, whereas layoffs are employer-induced

separations that tend to rise in recessions.2

         Growth hires are expected to decline and separations that decrease the size of a business

are expected to increase during recessions. Similarly, there should be fewer expanding

businesses and more contracting businesses during recessions. There is no clear prediction

regarding the net change of zero-growth businesses, since some expanding businesses will

become zero-growth businesses and some zero-growth businesses will become contracting

businesses.



III. The JOLTS Data and Descriptive Statistics

         The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) is a monthly survey that

produces data on hires, separations, and job openings (for information on the JOLTS, see

http://www.bls.gov/jlt/). The JOLTS is composed of a random sample of 16,000 business

establishments, of which approximately 10,500 provide data on a regular basis. We use JOLTS

microdata from December 2000 through June 2011. Although the JOLTS data are reported

monthly, the estimates reported here are based on a quarterly frequency, since we believe that

churn is best measured over the longer period.3

         JOLTS microdata are used to classify establishments as expanding, contracting, or zero

growth and thereby obtain all of the relevant information to estimate equations (1) and (2). The

the 2007-2009 recession.
3
  A quarter seems an appropriately short enough period to link a hire to a separation but not so short as to render the
notion of churn meaningless.

                                                           4
seasonally adjusted time series of the five components of equation (2) are given in Figure 1. The

estimates of total hires and total separations resemble the published JOLTS data, and the

estimates of job creation (HGE) and job destruction (SDC) resemble the published data from the

BLS Business Employment Dynamics (BED) program.4

         Figure 1 documents several interesting findings about churn. First, churn is procyclical.

Over the entire 2001:Q1 – 2011:Q2 time period of our sample, the correlation between the

amount of churn in the economy and the unemployment rate is -.96. The correlation between

churn and net employment growth is .43 (and is .79 over the time period 2001:Q1 – 2009:Q2).

Second, during the mid 2000s, churn is 65 percent of total hires.5 Third, churn fell dramatically

during the 2007-09 recession, from 8.3 million in 2007:Q4 to 5.3 million in 2009:Q2. This is a

decline of 36 percent over 6 quarters. During the same time period, hires fell by 3.8 million.

Thus 79 percent of the steep decline in hires during the most recent recession can be attributed to

a decline in churn. Although job creation falls as well, changes in job creation are only about

one-fourth as important as changes in churn in explaining what happened to hiring during the

2007-09 recession.




4
  Two details warrant mention. First, our estimates of quarterly hires and separations are approximately 12 million
during the mid-2000’s, which is less than the approximately 15 million implied by the published monthly statistics.
The primary reason for this discrepancy is that the published statistics are based on tabulated microdata plus imputed
hires and separations from unobserved births and deaths. We ignore this latter component. Second, our estimates of
HGE and SDC are not strictly comparable to the quarterly BED statistics. Our quarterly JOLTS data are for the total
nonfarm economy, whereas the BED data are for the total private economy. Furthermore, as noted by Davis,
Faberman, Haltiwanger, and Rucker (2010), there are differences between the BED and the JOLTS that suggest
caution when comparing statistics from the two different data sources.
5
  This finding is similar to the existing literature. Looking at quarterly statistics from the U.S. labor market,
Anderson and Meyer (1994, Table 13) find that 69 percent of hiring is churn, Burgess, Lane, and Stevens (2000,
Tables 1 and 2) find that roughly 70 percent of hiring is churn, and the statistics cited by Davis, Faberman, and
Haltiwanger (2006, Table 1) suggest that between 42 and 72 percent of hiring is churn.

                                                          5
IV. Hiring, Churn, and the Business Cycle

         To better understand the dynamics of churn, we turn to Table 1. The statistics in Table 1

compare 2007:Q4, the start of the most recent recession, to 2009:Q1, the labor market trough of

the most recent recession.6 The statistics in the first two columns of Table 1 are from the

seasonally adjusted time series underlying Figure 1.7

         The large decline in churn that happened during the most recent recession is documented

in Table 1. The magnitude of churn was 8.3 million in 2007:Q4, and fell by 2.4 million to 5.9

million in 2009:Q1. There are two forces contributing to this large decline: the number of

establishments with churn fell from 1.9 million to 1.6 million, and the average size of churn

within an establishment, conditional on having churn, fell from 4.44 to 3.78. A formal

decomposition attributes 52 percent of the decline in total churn to the decrease in the number of

establishments and 48 percent to the decrease in the average size of churn.

         The decline in churn occurs in all types of establishments: expanding, zero growth, and

contracting. The bulk of the decrease in churn, 70.5 percent, occurs in expanding

establishments. 70 percent of the decline in churn in expanding establishments is due to a fall in

the number of expanding establishments with churn (from 689 thousand to 479 thousand), and

30 percent is due to a decline in the average size of churn, conditional on churn, within

expanding establishments (from 6.02 to 5.15). Churn declines in expanding establishments

because quits fall. When the economy enters a recession, expanding businesses have fewer

replacement slots to fill so churn decreases.




6
  The peak and trough differs for each series in Figure 1. 2007:Q4 is the last quarter of substantial positive net
employment growth, and the trough of net employment growth is 2009:Q1.
7
  Our longer working paper (Lazear and Spletzer, 2011) uses longitudinal microdata to estimate the gross changes
underlying the net changes presented in column 3 of Table 1.

                                                         6
        It is worthwhile to note that the average number of growth hires per establishment in

expanding establishments did not change during the onset of the recession (3.04 in 2007:Q4,

3.08 in 2009:Q1), although the number of establishments that are expanding declined

substantially. Thus the average expanding establishment is still expanding by the same amount

at the trough relative to the peak, but the amount of churn associated with this expansion is much

less.



V. Discussion

        When a shock like that suffered during a recession reduces the demand for labor, the

optimal size of the business declines. This leads to decreased churn through two channels. First,

businesses reduce their hiring during recessions, which reduces the number of separated workers

whom they replace. This leads to a decrease in churn as well as an increase in separations that

decrease the size of the business. Second, as seen in the published JOLTS data, quits decline as

the economy slows. This will lead to a corresponding reduction in hires necessary to replace the

separations, and churn declines. During the last recession, most of the reduction in hires

reflected a decrease in churn rather than a fall in job creation.

        The reduction in churn that occurs during recessions has implications for output. In the

period beginning with the first quarter of 2008, churn was depressed by about 2.3 million per

quarter through the last date available (2011:Q2). Under a number of assumptions,8 we estimate

that the loss in output during the recession and its aftermath resulting from reduced churn



8
  Using estimates from Fallick, Haltiwanger, and McEntarfer (2011), the median wage change for workers who
change jobs and are re-employed the same quarter or the next quarter is 8.56%. If this reflects the typical gain in
productivity (not wage) from a move, then the average quarterly productivity gain from a job change is about $1000.
Multiplying this times the number of changes that would have occurred since the beginning of the recession, but did
not because of reduced churn, yields an estimate of about $208 billion total lost over the 14 quarters starting in
2008:Q1. Dividing by average annual GDP over this period results in .4% on an annualized basis for 3½ years.

                                                        7
equaled $208 billion. On an annual basis, this amounts to about .4% of GDP for a period of 3½

years. Although there are a number of assumptions required to obtain this estimate, we believe

they are reasonable ones. As a consequence, we conclude that reduced churn, which results in a

failure to allocate workers to their most productive uses, produces a significant unmeasured

additional cost of recessions.
