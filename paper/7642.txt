                                            ABSTRACT

       To the extent that trade policy affects trade flows between countries, the ramifications can
be far-reaching from an economic growth perspective. This paper examines one aspect of these
ramifications, namely the impact of changes in the extent of trade between countries on changes in
the rate of reduction in the size of the income gap that exists between them. Export and import data
are used as the criteria for determining bilateral trade between major trade partners, resulting in the
creation of 127 pairs of countries on the basis of export data and 134 pairs on the basis of import
data. An increase in trade between major trade partners - and in particular, increased exports by
poorer countries to their wealthier partners - is shown to be related to an increase in the rate of
convergence between the countries.

                                     I. INTRODUCTION
       In a world that exhibits non-decreasing income gaps (and in many cases, increasing gaps)

between most of the countries, there is nonetheless a small minority of countries exhibiting

income convergence. Not all of these instances of convergence are among the wealthy countries,

nor is it the case that all of the wealthy countries exhibit convergence.

       In contrast to the conventional wisdom, convergence among the relatively developed

countries is far from a robust phenomenon (Ben-David, 1995). Some countries converge with

others, but not with the remainder. Other countries converge with yet different countries, but also

not with most. In short, a random grouping of the more developed countries will not yield

income convergence in more instances than it will yield non-convergence.

       Thus, if one focuses on the non-poor countries, can a thread be found that ties together

the groups of converging countries in a manner that distinguishes them from the larger array of

non-convergence groups? This paper explores the contribution of international trade to the

convergence process.

       Why should greater openness between countries be related to income convergence

between them? The traditional trade and traditional growth theories do not provide much

guidance in this regard.    From the perspective of traditional trade theory, the factor price

equalization proposition shows how      when certain restrictions are met    free trade can lead to

the equalization of factor prices. But this does not necessarily imply the equalization of incomes.

From the perspective of traditional growth theory, the Solow model can yield income

convergence, but this occurs within a closed economy framework without the need for trade. The

more recent endogenous growth models that deal with trade concentrate primarily on explaining

steady state growth rates and there is little emphasis on explaining convergence in levels.



                                                1
       So what might be the intuition underlying the possible link between trade and

convergence? It is probably not unreasonable to assume that greater openness is related to

increased competition, both at home and abroad, for domestic firms. The resultant sink or swim

environment makes it crucial for affected firms to absorb foreign knowledge and ideas. Hence,

greater openness is presumably tied to increased knowledge spillovers between countries. To the

extent that knowledge levels among countries converge to a common level, then intuition

suggests that this might lead to a convergence in the developmental levels of countries as well.

Grossman and Helpman (1991) and others have used the size of trade volumes as a proxy for the

extent of knowledge spillovers between countries. Ben-David and Loewy (1998) incorporate this

intuition into a model that details both the transitional, as well as the steady state, impact of trade

policy on convergence and growth in per capita output. The model shows how movement

towards free trade leads to higher trade volumes between the liberalizing countries, a reduction

in income differentials among the liberalizers, and to faster growth.

       This paper focuses on the empirical facets of this issue by examining 127 country pairs

created on the basis of exports, and 134 country pairs created on the basis of imports. In each

case there will be a source country that is paired with one of its major trade partners. The goal

will be to examine how changes in trade relationships over time can lead to changes in the

degree of income disparity among countries.

       The following section provides some background and discusses related studies. Section

three details the relationship between changes in trade and changes in the rate of convergence

within trade-based groups of countries.         Section four focuses on the trade-convergence

relationship within a bilateral setting. Section five concludes.

                         II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
       The upsurge in growth-related research in the past decade has included a number of

important contributions that have focused on the relationship between international trade and

output growth and convergence. Work that is directly related to the analysis below includes Coe

and Helpman (1995), for example, who focus on the impact of R&D spillovers on productivity

growth.   They find that a country’s productivity levels are affected not only by its own

investments in R&D, but also on the investments made by its trade partners. Keller (1996)

disputes the importance of the bilateral trade relationships in the Coe and Helpman study, though

his other work (Keller, 1997) also concludes that there does appear to be a general spillover

effect emanating from foreign R&D. Dollar (1992), Edwards (1993), Harrison (1995), Sachs and

Warner (1995), and Henrekson, Torstensson and Torstensson (1996) focus directly on the impact

of trade openness on economic growth and find a positive relationship between the two.

       This study extends past research by Ben-David on the relationship between international

trade and income convergence. The issue of causality (i.e. is it the increased trade that causes

income convergence, or is it increasing income similarity between countries that causes increased

trade?) was explored during the initial phase of the research by establishing evidence on the

existence of the link between trade agreements and convergence. By choosing a small number

of countries that decided to formally liberalize trade, Ben-David (1993) was able to examine the

degree of disparity prior to, during, and following the implementation of the trade reforms. In

each of these instances, no income convergence was apparent during the decades prior to the

reduction of trade barriers. As the countries began their liberalization, income gaps began to fall,

and they continued to remain below the pre-liberalization levels in the years following the end

of the reform process.



                                                 3
       To the extent that these agreements to liberalize trade are viewed as exogenous events,

this result is important, for it provides support for the hypothesis that it is the movement towards

freer trade that led to the convergence and not the other way around. Different groups that

embarked on liberalization at different times began to converge during their respective time

frames and not earlier or later.

       This research on the impact of trade liberalization on incomes also showed a strong

positive relationship between the degree of openness and the volume of trade. For example, the

United States and Canada instituted a series of major trade reform measures between 1965 and

1973. These began with the implementation of the auto agreement between the two countries

in 1965 and continued with much broader reforms during the years 1968 through 1973 as the

Kennedy Round agreements were implemented (Preeg, 1970).

       As is indicated in Figure 1, the liberalization of trade between the two countries had a

marked effect on trade between the two. The figure plots the ratio of bilateral trade to total GDP

of the two countries between 1948 and 1988 as well as the average trade-output ratio for the pre-

reform period (1948-1965) and the average trade-output ratio for the post-reform period, (1974-

1988). Trade grew at roughly the same rate as output prior to the reductions in trade barriers in

1965. The liberalization was accompanied by a substantial increase in trade. Upon completion

of the Kennedy Round reforms, the trade ratio stabilized once again      at a level nearly twice the

pre-reform level.

       The formation of the European Economic Community (EEC) in the late 1950’s and its

expansion in the early 1970’s provides another example of the impact that trade reforms may

have on the volume of trade. The six founding countries of the EEC began to liberalize trade




                                                 4
with one another over a decade before the Community was actually formalized.1 Marshall Plan

aid in the late 1940’s was tied to the implementation of trade reforms. The reforms continued

throughout the 1950s with the signing of the additional agreements between the six original EEC

countries and culminated in the formation of the Economic Community which implemented a

series of further tariff and quota reductions. By the early 1970s, most trade barriers between the

countries were gone, and as the top panel in Figure 2 shows, the trade-output ratio               which rose

substantially until then       leveled off.

          In 1973, the Community expanded with the inclusion of three new members.2 EEC

imports from the three countries prior to their inclusion into the Community (shown in the middle

panel of Figure 2) was relatively constant. The import-output ratio rose steadily following

membership in 1973. And finally, for comparison purposes, imports from the United States,

which was not a partner to the Community’s liberalization measures, did not display the kind of

changes that the liberalizations rendered the partner countries. The bottom panel in Figure 2

shows that EEC imports from the U.S. remained fairly stable throughout the postwar period.

          While there are clearly many other factors that effect the extent of trade between

countries, trade liberalization appears to be a primary contributor in this regard. As the above

examples indicate, prior to, following, and in lieu of trade reforms, there is very little evidence

of substantial change in the extent of trade between countries. On the other hand, as countries

become more open, the extent of openness is reflected in the extent of trade between them. This

relationship will be utilized within the context of the following question: what kind of an effect

can the extent of openness, which will be proxied for here by the extent of trade, have on the

degree of income disparity between countries?

        Ben-David (1996) examined the liberalization-convergence link by focusing on non-poor

countries (which were defined as countries with per capita incomes of at least 25% of the United

States, the lead country in 1960). For each of the resultant 25 source countries                   as they will

be referred to here      an export-based group was created that included all countries importing at

least 4% of the source country’s exports. Similarly, a 4% cutoff point was used to determine

each source country’s import-based group.3

        By grouping together countries that are major trade partners of one another, the study

showed a very high incidence of income convergence within the trade-based groups. As a

reference point for determining the uniqueness of the trade-based convergence results, the same

countries comprising the trade-based groups were grouped and regrouped repeatedly on a random

basis and did not exhibit a prevalence of convergence outcomes                 supporting the earlier results

that, while convergence may be found among the more developed countries, it is more of an

infrequent finding than a frequent one.

        These earlier studies by Ben-David established that grouping countries according to cross-

sectional trade criteria (at a given point in time) produces convergence results considerably more

often than do random grouping of countries. What is still not clear, however, is why some trade

groups converged faster than others. That issue is the focus of this paper. It delves deeper into

the trade-convergence relationship by asking whether changes in the extent of trade over time

between any set of countries are related to changes in the extent of income convergence over

  The source countries and their main trade partners are listed in Appendix Table A1. Discussion of the selection
criteria may be found in Ben-David (1996).

time between these countries.              In other words, did trade-based groups of countries that

substantially increased their trade over a 26 year period also experience faster rates of

convergence than those trade-based groups that only marginally increased their trade?



                                 III. INTRA-GROUP CONVERGENCE
           One possible way to examine this question is to calculate the ratio of each group’s total

internal trade to the group’s total GDP and determine whether this ratio is related to the group’s

convergence coefficient (which Ben-David, 1996, denotes as φ). A negative relationship might

be interpreted as an indication that heightened trade coincides with income convergence.

           The main problem with a test of this kind is that small countries tend to trade a much

larger fraction of their incomes than do large countries.             Therefore, any cross-sectional

relationship between a group’s trade ratio and its convergence coefficient might reflect the

preponderance of small countries within groups rather than a trade-convergence relationship.

           An alternative way to examine the magnitude of trade’s impact on convergence would be

to look at each group individually and examine the behavior of its intra-group trade as well as

the behavior of its intra-group income differentials over time, and then to determine the extent

of the relationship between the two.

           The total volume of intra-group trade was calculated for each of the 25 export-based and

25 import-based trade groups, for each of the years between 1960 and 1985.4 To get a measure

of how intra-group trade grew (if at all) relative to the group’s total output, the total intra-group

trade was divided by the group’s aggregate GDPs.5 This ratio, represented by the variable Rik,t

(where i is the group’s source country and k identifies the group as being import-based or export-

based) was calculated for each of the 50 groups for each of the 26 years.

          In Equation (1), each group i’s trade ratio at time t is regressed on trend (Tt).

                                                                                                  (1)



As is evident from the results in Table 1, these ratios were found to have increased significantly

over time for every one of the groups. The question is, were these increases larger for the groups

that converged the fastest?

          Groups exhibiting convergence would be expected to have declining standard deviations

(σik,t) while diverging groups should have increasing standard deviations.6 These are in fact the

results from an estimation of Equation (2),

                                                                                                  (2)

the specified time period. A relationship between the two trend coefficients, in the form of

should provide some evidence of whether groups that had the largest increases in trade (that is,

the largest α2,i
             k
                ) were also those that converged the fastest (i.e. had the most negative β2,i

where                           .    To eliminate the need to explicitly account for fixed effects,

Equation (4) is differenced, yielding

where Dxki,t is the log difference between xki,t and xki,t-1 for x = {σ, R}. The sign of λ1k, which was

the trend coefficient in Equation (4), indicates income convergence (if negative) or divergence

(if positive) within the groups.             Since aggregate output appears in the numerator used in

calculating σik,t and in the denominator of the trade ratios, Rik,t, the differenced lagged variable,

DRik,t-2 is used instead to avoid an overlap of the periods.7

         The data for the 25 trade-based groups is pooled (once for the exports and once for the

imports) and Equation (5) is estimated. The results appear in Table 3. The significantly negative

intercept, for both the export and the import estimations, indicates that the trade groups exhibit

income convergence            which is consistent with the convergence results from Ben-David (1996).

The addition here is λ2 the estimated coefficient for the variable DR which measures the

contribution of changes in intra-group trade towards changes in intra-group disparity. These

estimated coefficients for the trade ratios are significantly negative for both exports and imports.




7
 Specifically, since Dσik,t includes σik,t-1 and DRik,t-1 includes Rik,t-1, then an overlap would exist for period t 1. Hence
DRik,t-2 is used in Equation (5).


                                                             9
The implication of a negative λ2 is that increases in the extent of trade lead to further reductions

in the income differentials among the trade group members.



                                   IV. BILATERAL CONVERGENCE
         Rather than focus on the trade groups in their entirety, it is possible to add a measure of

precision to the analysis by focusing on the bilateral relationships between each of the source

countries with each of their primary trade partners. The volume of bilateral trade between each

source country i and each of its primary trade partners (j) is divided by the source country’s total

GDP. The log of this ratio, Rikj,t, is calculated for each of the 127 export-based pairs of countries

and each of the 134 import-based pairs for each of the 25 years. The income gaps, Gikj,t (which

now replace σik,t in the analysis), measure the annual differences of the logs of real GDP per

worker between each source country and each of their main partners. In the event that the source

country is wealthier, then Gikj,t is positive. Otherwise, it is negative. Pairs exhibiting convergence

would be expected to have declining income gaps (in absolute terms) while diverging groups

should have increasing gaps.8

         The version of Equation (5) estimated in the bilateral case is




8
  Note that, while country j might be one of country i’s primary import partners, it is also possible that country i is
a primary import partner of country j (with a similar type of overlap possible for export pairs as well). There are
25 such instances of overlap in the import case and 27 in the export case. In these instances of overlap, the
numerator of Rikj,t will be the same as the numerator of Rjki,t. Not so the denominator, which reflects the source
country’s aggregate output level. Hence, Rikj,t≠Rjki,t and in the analysis that follows, all of the import and export-based
pairs are used. However, to the extent that the inclusion of all pairs leads to any bias in the outcomes, each of the
following tests was rerun twice more: once with just one-half of the overlapping pairs, and then again with the other
half of the overlapping pairs. None of the results reported below are sensitive to these omissions, hence only the
overall results are reported.


                                                           10
                                                                                            (6)



where the variable DUMijk equals unity if the initial level of income of the source country is

greater than that of its partner country, i.e the income gap is positive. DUMijk equals zero when

the initial income gap is negative.

       The baseline case in Equation (6) is one where the source country is initially poorer than

its partner country, i.e. DUMijk=0. When the income gaps are negative, convergence is indicated

when the gap become less negative over time. That is, λ1 should be positive in the event of

convergence. The opposite is true for instances when the source country is wealthier (DUMijk=1).

In this case, convergence is indicated when the gap falls over time and the sum (λ1+η1) is

negative.   To the extent that increased trade intensifies the convergence process, then the

expected signs would be λ2 > 0 and (λ2+η2) < 0.

       Equation (6) is estimated for all of the 127 country pairs based on exports and all of the

134 pairs based on imports. The results are reported in lines 1 and 4 of Table 4. Since there

are a sizable number of country pairs characterized by income gaps that are always positive

or always negative    throughout the entire sample period, it is possible to re-estimate Equation

(6) separately for the positive-gaps-only cases and the negative-gaps-only cases. In these cases,

given the uniformity of the sign of the dependent variable, the equation can be estimated without

the need for dummies. The results of these estimations in the export case are reported in lines

2 and 3, while the import results appear in lines 5 and 6.

       For both exports and imports, the intercepts (λ1) are significantly positive for negative

income gaps and significantly negative (λ1+η1) for pairs of countries with positive income gaps

  which implies that the bilateral income gaps between the trade partners are falling over time.

These results are also evident in the negative-gaps-only cases as well as in the positive-gaps-only

cases, for both exports and imports. Thus, the results from these estimations support the earlier

outcomes that countries that trade extensively with one another exhibit significant convergence.

       Does an increase in these already large trade flows lead to an increase in the speed of

income convergence? Recall that in the case of negative income gaps, a positive λ2 indicates that

increases in the trade-output ratios lead to less negative income gaps       i.e. faster convergence.

In line 2, when the source country remains poorer throughout the sample period, increased

exports by the poorer source country to the wealthier partner country significantly speed up the

convergence process. When the source country is the wealthier of the two, the results reported

in line 6 indicate that increased imports by the wealthier source country lead to significantly

faster convergence    a result that corroborates the findings in line 2 (which represent the flip side

of the same coin). In short, increasing the flow of trade from the poorer country to the wealthier

country (be they the poorer source country’s exports or the wealthier source country’s imports)

speeds up the convergence process.

       The results regarding trade flows in the other direction are not as conclusive. On the one

hand, there are the results from line 3 indicating that increased exports by the wealthier source

country in fact widen the income gap, or at least act to diminish the convergence that is reflected

in the intercept. On the other hand, the results in line 5 provide weak evidence (they are not

significant) that when the poorer source country increases its imports, the income gap falls

further. These two outcomes are not consistent with one another. Furthermore, an examination




                                                 12
of the mixed gap estimations in lines 1 and 4 also do not suggest a significant contribution of

trade flowing from the wealthier country to the poorer country.9

         There is a problem, however, with the above estimations of Equation (6) and it has to do

with the independence of the observations. Specifically, each source country has more than one

major trade partner and many of the major partners of one country are also major trade partners

of additional countries. Since Gij,t = yi,t          yj,t, where yi,t is the log output per worker in country

i, then any two error terms such as vij,t and vik,t, which are both related to country i, might be

correlated. In the event that the error terms are correlated, then the estimated standard errors of

the coefficients are inconsistent           though the estimated coefficients themselves are consistent.

One way to avoid this problem would be to estimate Equation (6) using a subsample of country

pairs in which each country would appear no more than once. The question is: which country

pairs should be chosen and how might it be possible to determine whether the results of the

estimations described in Table 4 are really representative of the bilateral convergence process?

         The country selection algorithm adopted here is as follows. The first source country, i,

is chosen randomly from the list of 25 source countries. A partner country, j, is then chosen

randomly from the list of i’s major trade partners. Having selected the first pair, countries i and

j are removed from the list of available countries (for future selections). The selection process

is then repeated for the next pair of countries. As the list of selected pairs begins to grow, some

source countries may be chosen for whom all of the trade partners have already been selected.

These countries are then also omitted from the sample of available source countries. This process




9
 Recall that not all of the source countries are major trade partners and not all of the major trade partners are source
countries. Hence there is room for discrepancies in comparisons of results for poorer source country exports vs
wealthier source country imports and for poorer source country imports vs wealthier source country exports.


                                                          13
continues until the last source country    for whom there remains at least one available partner

country    is chosen.

       This selection algorithm yields a sample size of between 8 and 13 pairs of countries, each

of them different. If the selection process is repeated often enough, and Equation (6) is estimated

each time, it then becomes possible to examine the distribution of each coefficient and to

determine the degree of accuracy of the findings reported in Table 4.

       Herein lies another issue. How closely do draws averaging 11 pairs per sample reflect

the 100+ import and export pairs that represent all of the major bilateral trade relationships

between the non-poor countries? In other words, a country like the United States, which is a

major export partner in 24 out of the 127 export-based pairs (or 19% of the pairs) can only

appear once in each sample, either as a partner, or alternatively, as a source country. Thus, it

will appear in only one of the roughly 11 trade pairs that are randomly drawn. On the other

hand, a country like New Zealand, which is a major export partner of only one other country

(Australia) has a higher probability of being included in the random samplings than in the overall

group of pairs.

       This is illustrated in Figure 3, which provides a comparison between the squares (which

represent the actual number of appearances as a percentage of the total number of pairs, 127) and

the triangles (which represent the number of appearances in 1000 sample draws of all possible

pairs). Countries that appear often as major trade partners are under-represented in the random

sampling while countries that appear less frequently as major trade partners tend to get over-

represented in the sample draws. By truncating the random sampling process at 4 pairs per

sample (represented by the diamonds in the figure), it is possible to get pairings that more closely

resemble the actual frequency of appearance.



                                                14
       Thus, Equation (6) is estimated for each of 1000 random truncated samplings of four

pairs. The cumulative distribution of each of the estimated coefficients for the export-based pairs

appears in the four panels of Figure 4. The non-zero vertical lines are drawn at the values of the

overall export estimation that appear in line 1 in Table 4. As is evident in the figures, the

estimated coefficients in Table 4 are fairly close to the median of the plotted distributions. This

is also the case for imports in Figure 5.

       Moreover, the number of coefficients that are significantly different from zero at the 10

percent level   listed in Table 4 in the two lines below each of the Equation (6) estimations

also tends to corroborate the overall estimation results. Recall that for negative income gaps,

convergence requires positive signs for λ1 and λ2 while in the case of positive income gaps, the

required signs for η1 and η2 are negative.

       Starting first with the intercept      which provides an overall indication of convergence

among these bilateral trade pairs          in the case of exports, 343 of the estimated λ1’s are

significantly positive while only 37 are significantly negative. The estimated η1’s on the other

hand, are mainly negative. The results are similar for the similar-gap estimations of lines 2 and

3 as well as for the three import estimations. In other words, there appears to be very strong

evidence of convergence among the trade-based pairs of countries.

       As for the question of the relationship between increases in the extent of trade and

increases in the speed of convergence, the evidence from the random groupings provides support

for the relatively strong earlier findings that increased trade flows from the poorer country to the

wealthier country increase the speed of convergence between the two. The evidence from the

random groupings also provides support for the earlier findings of an ambiguous impact of

increased trade flows from the wealthier country to poorer country.

                                      V. CONCLUSION
       This paper focused on the relationship between trade and income convergence over time.

Changes in the extent of trade (among heavy traders) appear to have an effect on the degree of

income disparity among countries.      Increases in intra-group trade intensified the speed of

convergence among the group members.

       Breaking up the groups into the individual pairings of source and partner countries serves

to sharpen the findings. The bilateral pairs continue to exhibit significant convergence   be they

export-based or import-based pairs. Increased trade by the countries appears to further strengthen

the convergence when the flow being increased is from the poorer partner to the wealthier

partner. This result holds irrespective of whether the source country is the wealthier or poorer

trade partner.   Increased trade flows in the other direction, however, do not appear to be

conclusively related to changes in income convergence.
