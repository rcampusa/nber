              The Administration Tax Reform Proposal and Housing


                                  ABSTRACT




      This paper estimates the likely impact of the Administration tax reform
plan on housing. Our analysis incorporates two general equilibrium impacts ——
a one percentage point decline in the level of interest rates and a decrease in
the property tax rate on principal residences —— and corrects errors regarding
discount rates and refinancing in the basic rental model.

      A 7 percent increase in market rents (11 percent without the decline in
interest rates) is projected. Consideration of the individual components of
the Administration plan suggests that the only significant negative provision
is the cut in the personal tax rate from 0.53 (including a 6 percent state and
local rate deductible at the Federal level) to 0.41. Without this cut (and the
decline in interest rates which is largely attributable to the cut), market
rents would fall by 6 percent. Rents rise only because rental housing is a
negatively taxed asset in the sense that a tax cut lowers the supply of the
asset.

      The general—equilibriwn effects will offset the negative direct effects——
the cut in marginal tax rates and loss of deductibility of property taxes —— on
owner—occupied housing in the aggregate. However, this housing will generally
be cheaper for households with incomes below $40,000 —— especially below
$25,000 —— but will be more expensive for those with incomes above $60,000.
This constitutes an improvement in both efficiency and equity because under
current law the price of owner housing services is far lower for high income
households than for low income households. Homeownership rates should increase
by 2 to 3 percentage points for households with incomes below $40,000 and 1 to
2 percentage points in the aggregate.

                 The Administration Tax Reform Proposal and Housing

                      Patric H. Hendershott and David C. Ling



       In May 1985, the Administration finally endorsed a specific tax reform

proposal. This was at least the fifth major proposal advanced, following

Hall—Rabuska, Bradley—Gephardt, Kemp—Kasten and the Treasury Department.1

Analyses of the Administration plan by Downs, Follain, the Homebuilders (NAHB,

1985b) •   and Maisel and Quigley have already appeared; however, little

agreement exists among them. To illustrate, both Downs and Follain expect a 7

percent increase in rents, but the NAHE anticipates increases of 20 to 25

percent or more. None of these incorporates a change in the level of interest

rates. Maisel and Quigley agree with NAHB if interest rates do not change, but

because they anticipate a 2.6 percentage point rate decline, they expect a mere

3 percent rise in rents.

       The wide range of estimated impacts alone suggests value in further

analysis. In addition, several features of the underlying models commonly

employed seem inappropriate, and neither zero nor the 2.6 percentage point

decline in interest rates is reasonable. Correcting these features and

incorporating a plausible decline in rates will lead to a better understanding

of the Administration plan and its likely impact on housing.

      The basic rental model has two shortcomings. First, the stream of tax

depreciation allowances is discounted by the same rate used to discount the

risky net operating income stream. Finance theory suggests that near—certain

cash flows should be discounted by a near risk—free rate and risky cash flows

by a risky rate. Second, additional borrowing to prevent the debt ratio from

falling below its optimal level is not allowed. Prohibition against additional

borrowing creates artificial gains from trading. Analyses of owner—occupied

housing have one common deficiency. Elimination of the deductibility of
                                           —2—



 property taxes will not reduce demand to the extent implied in existing models

 because property tax rates (and the Supply of local services) will be reduced

 to some extent in response   to   the loss of deductibility.

         All the major tax reform proposals advanced to date will lower interest

rates, although the magnitude of the decline will vary with the specific

proposal (Hendershott, 1985) .     Reductions in investment incentives, such as
elimination of the investment tax credit and decreases in tax rates at which

households deduct interest expense, will lower real capital outlays and thus

the demand for funds; reduced taxation of returns to savers will increase the

supply of funds. On both accounts, interest rates will decline.2 The NAHB

recognized this in their analysis of Bradley—Gephardt, Kemp—Kasten and the

original Treasury plan (l985a, p. 30) but not in their more recent study.

Maisel and Quigley have recently joined us (l984c, 1985) in contending that

rates will fall, but they threaten to give the position a bad name with the

enormity of their assumed decline. A single percentage point decline is

plausible (Hendershott, 1985) and is assumed in the calculations reported

below.

         The paper is divided into three sections and a summary. The first two

deal with the measurement of equilibrium rents, for owner and rental housing

respectively, under both current law and the proposed reform. A tax reform can

alter asset prices, investor rates of return, and/or equilibrium rents

(explicit for rental housing, implicit for owner housing) .     While all three

variables might be expected to change, the primary adjustment will come in

rents because capital market equilibrium and production costs, respectively,

drive rates of return and asset values.3 The third section reports the

estimated impact of the reforms on these rents and on the homeownership rate.

                              I. Owner—Occupied Housing

      Three 'prices° of owner—occupied housing services are relevant: the

average price which influences the tenure—choice decision, the marginal price

which determines the quantity demanded assuming the household choices to own,

and the "constrained" price for households that find owner housing unaffordable

in the sense that they cannot purchase the optimal amount dictated by the

marginal Price. How these prices would be measured under both current law and

the Administration plan is the subject of this section.



                A. The Price of Owner—Occupied Housing Services

      Households will purchase sufficient housing so that the rents from the

last dollar spent plus the expected capital gains on that dollar equals the

costs of obtaining the rents and gains. The costs included financing, upkeep

and property taxes. Put another way, households will purchase sufficient

housing so that the present value of all the after—tax cash flows, including

the implicit rents, generated by the last dollar of house equals the equity the

household supplies to obtain that dollar of house. If the rents and house

price are expected to grow at rate —d (inflation less depreciation), v portion

of the house is debt financed at rate i and the outstanding loan balance in

period t is Lt. the annual maintenance and property tax rates are in and t,    the
household is in the T   marginal   tax bracket and has a required after—tax return

on equity invested in the house of e, and the household expects to hold the

house for N years, the rental cost of owner—occupied housing services from one

dollar of housing can be deduced by solving equation (1) for H:

                                                        +                  LN

 For   the first dollars of house purchased, the right side of the equation

 exceeds the left because R is initially high. However, R declines as more

 dollars are purchased; eventually equality holds and the demand of the

 household is determined.

        Equation (1) can be simplified in a number of illuminating ways. First,

 assume all—equity financing (v and all L's equal zero). The equation reduces

to

                      R. ea_n÷d+m+ (l—T)t
                           1                                           P



where ea is the required return on all—equity financed houses. The j

subscripts, which were not included in equation (1) for simplicity, allow for

ea and r, and thus R, to vary across households (the other variables also

likely vary, but not in a systematic way). Next, allow for debt financing in

which the loan—to—value ratio is continuously maintained at v. In this case,

L = v(l+lr_d)t_l, AL = v(r—d)                (l+lr.d)t and


                      P.. =    r.J   —   w   +d   + m +       (l—T)r ,                         (2)
                       J                                               p

where r. =   v(l—r.)i+(l—v)e.            is the "weighted average cost of capital."

       In general, i is interpreted as the risk—free debt rate of maturity N.

This is less than the commonly employed home mortgage rate because the latter

includes premiums to compensate lenders for the prepayment and default options

that households will, in an expected value sense, exercise systematically to

the detriment of lenders. If one were to include these premiums as negative
                                                   —5—



 cash flows in equation (1), then one should also include the present value of

 these probable gains from exercising the options as positive cash flows. We

 assume fair premiums in the sense that the cost and value of the options

 cancel.

        The equity rate can be expressed as the after—tax debt rate plus a risk

premium, p, which we assume for. simplicity to be constant across households:


                          e. =
                           J
                                 (l—r.)i
                                    J
                                               +   p.                                          (3)



Because the risk per dollar of equity investment is less on all—equity financed

investments than on partially debt—financed investments,

                           a                           a
                          e. =
                           J

                                               +   p



where           Note that if p p/(l—v), then r. =                  e.   In our analysis, we

follow the weighted—average cost of capital approach, but we modify (3) to

reflect the attractiveness of tax—exempt securities to high—income households:3

where 1e the exempt rate, is assumed to equal 0.7± under current law and 0.78i

under the Administration plan (Hendershott, 1985)

        In our empirical work, equation (1) is solved for R, after applying a 6

percent selling cost. We assume N = 8 (years), it                  = 005,   a 0.012 depreciation

rate on the structure which is 0.83 of the total investment so d =                   .01, r =
                                                                                               p
0.012, m =   0.035, and a 30—year amortizing debt—instrument initially financing
80 percent of the house at an 11 percent rate. The risk premium,                    p,   for   this

equity investment which rises from 20 percent of the initial property value to,

under our other assumptions, 45 percent of the value after 8 years is assumed

to be 0.075.
                                            —6—



      Equation (1) presumes that households can purchase the optimal quantity

of housing. More specifically, the household is presumed to be able to make a

down payment of 20 percent of the value of the economically optimal house and

to have sufficient income to qualify for a loan for the remaining 80 percent.

Other combinations of equity and debt would not appreciably alter the results,

but what about households that cannot achieve any combination (households that

find housing "unaffordable")? These households could be renters or they could

own a smaller house than the optimal, in which case the left side of equation

 (1) is less than the right and the calculation of R is not meaningful. To

account for such households, initial monthly mortgage and property tax

payments, net of tax savings, are also computed. In these calculations, the

current 0.12 mortgage rate is used, not the 0.11 risk—free rate.

      The tenure decision of households involves a comparison of the cost of

obtaining housing services from owner—occupied housing relative to the cost of

obtaining the same services from rental housing. One might be tempted to

simply take the R. from equation (1) and compare it with the equilibrium rents

in the rental market. However, the cost of obtaining the average dollar's

worth of owner—occupied housing services, not the marginal dollar, is required

here. Thus the t.      for   this calculation must be redefined as the average tax

rate at which housing related expenditures, including forgone interest on

invested equity, are deducted (Hendershott and Slemrod, 1983)



              B. The Administration Plan and Owner—Occupied Housing

      The Administration plan would alter the rental cost of owner—occupied

housing in three ways. First, property taxes would no longer be deductible at

the federal level; the l—t multiplying r in equation (1) becomes unity.

Second, marginal federal taxes are cut —— from a maximum of 0.50 to 0.35 or by

0.15 ——   generally   lowering the tax rate at which interest is deductible in (1)
                                        —7—



and raising e in (3). However, the loss of the deductibility of state and

local taxes partially offsets this decline; with an assumed maximum state and

local rate of 0.06 deductible against federal taxes under current law but not

under the reform, the decline in the maximum t   in   equation (1) is only 0.12.

Third, interest rates will decrease by a percentage point, and e will also

decline via (3) -

      Because the tax rates relevant to both the quantity—demanded and tenure—

choice decisions vary widely across households, the rental costs are computed

for three types of households at five income levels. The households considered

are: married filing jointly with one earner and two dependents, married filing

jointly with two earners and no dependents, and single with no dependents. A

variety of income tax rates have been computed for these households assuming

adjusted gross income (AGI) of $17,500, $27,500, $40,000, $70,000 and $130,000.

To hold resources constant, owning households with AGIs, assuming they rented,

are compared to renting households with the same AGIs. Separate data are

calculated for renting and owning households. The calculations assume:

(1)   the nonsingle households have average fringe benefits and nonhousing

      itemized deductions (excluding State and local income taxes) of their

      income classes (based on 1982 Statistics of Income data) ;    single
      households are assumed to differ in that their other miscellaneous

      deductions are only half of their income classes and they have no excess

      medical deductions,

(2)   owning households purchase houses of dollar value equal to twice

      their AGI5 and pay property taxes equal to 1.2 percent of their house

      values,

(3)   the second spouse income in two earner households is assumed to        account

      for 40 percent of total income,
                                       —8—




 (4)   the average loan—to--value ratio over the assumed 8—year holding period

       is 70 percent (the calculations are not sensitive to this assumption)

       and

 (5)   marginal state and local income tax rates are 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, and

       6.0 percent of state taxable income for households with Ads of $17,500

       through $130,000 respectively, and states allow the same deductions for

       computing AOl and the same itemized deductions from AOl to calculate

       state taxable income as the federal government does.

       The first section of each panel in Table 1 provides the renter and owner

marginal tax rates and the tenure choice tax rate at different income levels

under current law.4 The total marginal rate for both owners and renters is the

marginal federal rate plus the assumed state and local rate marked down to

reflect its deductibility at the federal level.5 The second sections provide

comparable data for the Administration plan. This plan would modestly raise

Ads by counting the first $120 of health insurance benefits as income and

significantly increase taxable income by eliminating deductions for state and

local income, sales and property taxes. On the other hand, the exemption for

self, spouse, and dependents would be almost doubled to $2,000, and marginal

federal tax rates would be lowered generally.

       The marginal tax rates relevant to the quantity of owner—occupied housing

demanded range from 18 to 41 percent for married households with one wage

earner and two dependents (HH1). These rates are slightly higher than the

corresponding current law marginal rate at the lowest income level considered,

reflecting the initially higher 15 percent federal rate and the lack of

deductibility of state and local income taxes at the federal level. At income

levels above approximately $25,000, the marginal rates for owners under the

reform are roughly a sixth lower than current law.
                                         —9—



      Married households with two wage earners and no dependents (HH2) are

typical of many first—time home buyers. While the average tax burden of these

households differs from HH1 under both current law and the reform, the second

panel of Table 1 reveals that marginal rates are identical for the two

household types under current law and nearly so under the reform. The loss of

two exemptions at the $40,000 AGI level is just enough to leave HH2 owners in

the 29 percent marginal bracket (versus 19 percent for HH1 owners)

      Marginal rates are quite different for single households with no

dependents (HH3) ,   ranging from 22 to 53 percent for owners under current law.
These rates are nearly half again as high (except at the highest income level)

as the current law rates for HI-Il owners. The Administration plan would reduce

these marginal rates approximately 20 percent at all income levels.

      Next consider the tax rate relevant to the tenure choice decision: the

average rate at which housing related expenses are deducted. For all

households but those at the lowest income level considered, the tenure choice

tax rate lies between the marginal tax rates for owners and renters under

current law. Tenure choice tax rates that are below the owner marginal rate

would be the rule, rather than the exception at low to moderate incomes under

the reform proposal because deductions for excess medical expenses and other

"miscellaneous" items would be effectively eliminated or greatly reduced. No

state and local tax deductions would be allowed and consumer interest expense

would be limited for high income households. Moreover, the zero bracket amount

would be raised to $4,000. These changes would typically result in wasted

housing—related deductions (because the zero bracket amount exceeds nonhousing

itemized deductions) except at higher incomes, and thus the tenure—choice rate,

a weighted average of zero and the marginal tax rates, would be less than the

marginal rate. The average cost of owner housing will therefore tend to rise.

                                 11. Rental Housing

       Analysts generally assess the impact of tax reforms on rental housing by

 asking how the reforms would alter the required initial rents on a prototype

 residential project. The answer is obtained by manipulating an equality

 between the equity investment in the project and the present value of the cash

 flows the project is expected to generate. This procedure is described below

with particular care being given to the choice of discount rates employed and

 financing assumptions made.



                        A. The Equilibrium Level of Rents

      Equation (1) must be modified in a number of ways to make it applicable

to rental housing. First, the rent and maintainance terms must be multiplied

by l—T, the former being taxed and the latter deductible. Second, tax

depreciation allowances can be deducted so rz must be added, where z, the

present value of the deductions, is defined by

dx is the deduction on a dollar initial investment in structures, and x is the

appropriate discount rate. Third, a tax is due upon sale so TAXC/(l+e)N must

under current law, and B is the selling cost as a proportion of asset value.

The first term is the recapture of accelerated depreciation (N is the minimum

number of years over which the property can be depreciated and N is the

minimum of N and N*) , and the second term is the gains tax applied to the sale

price net of the adjusted basis. Finally, construction period interest and
                                           —"-


property taxes (CPIT) must be accounted for and all the terms must be

discounted additional periods to account for the lag between construction and

operation. Hendershott and Shilling (1982a) provide a discussion of the

nitty—gritty on most of these points.

      Our methodology for computing rent levels under current law and the

Administration proposal differs from that typically employed by real estate

analysts in two key respects. First is the discount rate Cx) used in

calculating the present value of tax depreciation allowances. Financial

economists argue that the relatively Certain depreciation deductions should be

discounted at a lower (less risky) discount rate than the relatively risky

opering incomes (Brealey and Myers, 1984, p. 559). By a lower discount rate,

.e ,aear, srmething less than the weighted—average cost of capital, say the 8—

year tax—exempt rate, and far less than the required equity return, e. Of

course, one ..c'Lld discount all cash flows by the same rate, call it d, that

lies between e   rid   i   and gives the same V value.

      What differ'nce does it make whether one discounts all cash flows by d or

some by e and some         1e? As long as tax reforms don't alter the pattern and

relative importance of tax depreciation allowances, it doesn't make any

difference. But the Administration proposal would substantially change the

depreciation write of f pattern, shifting from the front—loaded ACRS to back—

loaded systems (but with more than 100 percent writeoff owing to the indexation

of the depreciable base). Whether the present value of the new tax

depreciation schedule is better or worse (or how much worse) than ACRS depends

crucially on which discount rate is used. Too high a discount rate would

discriminate against the later Administration deductions, while too low a rate

would favor them. Real estate analysts have been using the highest possible

rate, the required return on equity.
                                      —12—



      Another issue is the treatment of debt and equity in the model. At the

margin (or at the optimal loan—to—value ratio) ,   the after—tax cost of debt
equals the cost of equity. The "average" cost of debt is, of course, "cheaper"

because the debt is on average less risky. By using a two—tiered pricing

approach, a low cost for debt and high cost for equity, the models are very

sensitive to the loan—to—value ratio. In the models, the initial loan—to—value

ratio is generally set at a plausible 70 to 80 percent level, but the loan is

then presumed to amortize. Given that the asset value is generally assumed to

inflate, the actual loan—to—value ratio falls significantly over time. After

five years, the ratio on a property inflating at 4 percent per year financed

with a 12½%, 25—year, 75% loan—to—value, fixed—rate mortgage would be 59%;

after ten years the ratio would be 45%. Holding the equity rate constant, when

it should be falling because the risk on the average equity dollar is falling,

results in discounting distant cash flows, especially near—certain tax

depreciation allowances, at too high a rate.

      If a loan—to—value ratio of, say, two—thirds is optimal, letting the

loan—to—value ratio decline to 59 percent after 5 years and 45 percent after 10

years could cause a significant economic loss to equity investors. Their

obvious response would be to renegotiate a higher loan ——   to refinance. But
this response is not allowed in the typical real estate valuation model. The

Only way to reestablish a high loan—to—value ratio is to trade the property.

Thus the "gains from trading" properties in these models include gains from

reestablishing the optimal loan—to—value ratio, as well as from establishing a

higher depreciable base. These gains must, of course, be weighed against sales

costs and capital gains taxes at the time of sale.

     Under the Administration plan, trading would be far less rewarding than

under current law. There are fewer gains from establishing a higher base

because the base is already indexed and depreciation is not frontloaded. As a
                                          —13—




 result, "optimal expected future trading is minimal. If, however, trading is

 the only way to reestablish the desired loan—to—value ratio, trading will occur

 even if pure trading is unprofitable. Thus prohibition of refinancing, like

 the single discount rate assumption, could discriminate against the

Administration reform proposal.

         Many of the empirical assumptions were stated above. The depreciation

rates differ slightly from owner—occupied housing owing to different land—to—

value ratios and expected behavior of tenents. The depreciation rate for the

asset price is Set at 0.025 and for the rent stream is 0.0175. Also t         + m is
                                                                          p
0.045. The holding period is determined endogenously as that which minimizes

the rental price (Hendershott and Ling, 1984b).



                    B. The Administration Plan and Rental Housing

         A comparison of the depreciable—real—estate provisions of current law and

the Administration proposal is given in Table 2. Whether the individual

changes would be beneficial or harmful to real estate is of interest. The

Administration plan lowers the assumed tax rate from 0.53 to 0.41. Most

industries (and households) benefit from tax cuts, Only if an industry is

currently negatively taxed (would be less profitable if it werent taxed at

all) ,   would a tax cut be harmful.

         The proposed capital gains treatment is almost certainly more favorable

than that under current law. Consider land first. Fifty percent of the

lowerd regular rate (.5x.41 = .205) is marginally less than forty percent of

the current rate (.4x.53 =    .212).   Moreover, unless land increases in real

value, no tax would be paid. Thus capital gains on land are certain to be

taxed at a lower rate. Capital gains taxes on structures will also probably be

lower. Approximating dx as constant over time, the tax will be
                                                          —14—



                                                      N          *   N

 where   it       is   the general CPI appreciation rate. Compare this expression with

 the tax liability under current luW as measured in equation (4) .            If
 depreciation allowances were not accelerated [the first sum in (4) is zero and
                                                                                          *
 dx = d] and real estate appreciates at the general inflation rate (it             = it

 then   a significant tax liability exists under current law because the

 depreciation basis is not indexed, but no liability would be incurred under the

 Administration plan. If accelerated depreciation does exist (dx)d), a

 liability will be incurred under the reform, but a far greater liability would

 exist under current law owing to recapture at regular rates. Only if real—

 estate inflation far exceeds general inflation would a greater capital gains,

tax exist under the reform than under current law.

         Turning to the timing of deductions, the present value of tax

depreciation allowances under the Administration plan in a five percent

inflation world, using a 9 percent nominal after—tax discount rate, is the same

0.61 per dollar of property that the value is under current law. That is, with

five percent inflation, the Administration plan is as generous as current law.

Because other analysts apply a much higher discount rate, they find the

depreciation change to be negative for real estate. We have argued against use

of a higher discount rate for the near riskiess depreciation deductions and

believe the correct rate currently is just under 9 percent.

        The altered treatment of CPIT is a slight negative; rather than being

written off over 10 years, these expenses would be capitalized under the

Administration plan and written off over 28 years. Again using a 9 percent

discount rate, the present value would fall from 0.036 per dollar of property

to 0.030.
                                      —15—



       Under current tax regulations, all investments of individuals and

 partnerships, other than investments in real estate, are subject to 'at—risk"

 limitations, i.e., a taxpayers's loss for any taxable year is limited to the

 amount the taxpayer has invested or has at—risk in the investment. Generally,

 the amount at—risk is the sum of the taxpayers' cash contributions to the

 activity and amounts borrowed for which the taxpayer has personal liability for

 repayment (recourse debt only). The amount at—risk is increased by the

 taxpayer's share of taxable income and subsequent cash contributions and is

decreased by his share of tax losses and cash distributions.

      The Administration plan would make income—producing real estate subject

to at—risk rules. Because most real—estate investments are highly leveraged

with nonrecourse mortgage debt and have generous depreciation allowances,

significant losses can be incurred in the initial years of the investment. If

interest rates (and loan—to—value ratios) are high enough, these losses will

cumulate to more than the investor's equity contributions, in the absence of

altered investor behavior, and some tax losses will not be deductible in the

year in which they are incurred.7

      Current law limits investment interest expense to $10,000 plus net

investment income8, but most real estate related interest expense (net leased

property and land being the primary exceptions) is exempt from this limitation.

The Administration plan would decrease the maximum current deduction for

investment interest expense to $5,000 plus net investment income and would

include both consumer interest expense and interest expense on limited

partnerships in the interest limitation. The impact of including the latter

would be partially offset by the expansion of net investment income to include

the taxpayer's share of income from limited partnerships (and his distributive

share of income from Subchapter S corporations in which the taxpayer does not

actively participate in management). The plan would be phased—in beginning in
                                           —16—



 1986, with only 10 percent of newly limited investment interest initially

 subject to the limitation. In each of the subsequent nine taxable years, the

 percentage would be increased by 10 percentage points.

       With a 12% mortgage interest rate and a 75% loan—to—value ratio, the

Administrations at risk and investment interest provisions would not bind on

investors and thus could not impact on rents. Even with an 85% loan—to—value

ratio, the provisions would not bind if interest rates declined by a percentage

point. Moreover, while the provisions would clearly bind in a higher inflation

and interest rate environment (in which case the depreciation and capital gains

provisions of the Administration plan would become even more attractive

relative to current law) ,   behavioral   responses by investors would virtually

eliminate any negative impact.

      The most likely behavioral response of investors to a binding at—risk

provision would be to assume some personal liability for mortgage indebtedness,

either at purchase or subsequently as needed, to ensure full deductibility of

tax losses when they are incurred. The assumpt1on of personal liability for

losses beyond the actual equity does transfer some risk from the lender to the

investor. However, the lender would presumably be charging for this risk: an

85 percent loan costs more than a 75 percent loan. Thus, the increased risk of

the investor and the resultant higher required return on equity is roughly

balanced by a lower loan rate; equilibrium rents would not rise noticeably.

Because the investment interest limitation applies only to limited partnerships

(and passive interests in Subchapter S corporations) ,    the   likely response to

binding interest limitations would be a change in the ownership form to general

partnerships and sole proprietorships.

                                      III.    Results

       The results are discussed in three parts. First, the equilibrium change

 in rents is computed. This is the relevant statistic for inclusion in both the

 tenure—choice and quantity—demanded (for those who rent) decisions. Second,

the likely impact of the reform on homeownership rates for households at the

five income levels are reported. Third, percentage changes in the rental price

for owner—occupied housing services are provided.



                         A. The Equilibrium Rent Level

      The top part of Table 3 contains calculations of the impact on "rents' of

 (1) all provisions of the Administration plan except the personal tax rate cut

and (2) the cut in the personal tax rate. The basic valuation model is varied

in two dimensions: the refinancing assumption and the discounting method. The

first calculation assumes zero refinancing; the others allow for Continuous

refinancing. More specifically, in the first variant the project is initially

financed with a 75%—25 year 11 percent amortizing loan. In the other

calculations, the loan is two—thirds of initial value and then stays at two—

thirds of value over time.

      As for discounting, the first two calculations are based on a single

0.152 discount rate, calculated as the ten—year tax—exempt rate ——   0.7    times

our 0.11 interest rate ——   plus   a risk premium of 0.075. The remaining

calculations follow the dual—discount method; the exempt rate plus 0.01 is

used for the relatively certain tax depreciation and construction period

interest and property tax write—offs, and a higher 0.239 equity rate is applied

to the other cash flows. This equity rate is that which, in conjunction with

the 0.087 tax—exempt rate, gives the same present value of the cash flows under

current law as does the single 0.152 discount rate.
                                      —18—



      Note the difference the model changes make: going from zero refinancing

and a single discount rate to continuous refinancing and the dual rate lowers

the projected increase in residential rents from 12% to —6%. Taking the

continuous refinancing first attributes 15 of the 18 point decline to the dual

discount rate and only 3 to the refinancing; taking the dual discount rate

first would lay 12 of the points on the discount rate and 6 on the refinancing.

      The next number in Table 3 is the estimated impact on residential rents

of the cut in the personal tax rate from 0.53 (a fifty percent Federal rate

plus a deductible six percent State and local rate) to 0.41. The result is a

15 percent increase in rents. This sharp increase in response to a tax cut

illustrates just how negatively taxed rental housing is under current law.

Because a major goal of tax reform is to improve economic efficiency by taxing

different sources of income and returns from capital assets more equally, one

would anticipate that negatively taxed activities would not fare well.

      Results for the full impact of the plan, both with and without a one

percentage point decline in interest rates, are then reported. With the rate

decline, the increase in rents is 7 percent. This rise is modest, especially

in light of the fact that renters are scheduled to receive most of the personal

tax Cut contained in the Administration plan. For two of the three household

types, the average tax rate will fall by 0.021 or more at the $17,500 level-and

by larger amounts at higher income levels. That is, even if these households

spend 30 percent of their incomes on rent, they would be able to continue to

rent the same units (would spend .3 x .07 = .021 on rent) and still purchase

the same amount or more of other goods and services. For the third household

type (married, two earners, no dependents) ,   the tax cut is lower (the cut would
be about as great if for the other household for two—earner households with two

dependents).
                                       —19—



       The last nunther in Table 3 is a crude rent calculation for commercial

 properties. These properties are treated less favorably under current law than

 residential properties are because a different recapture provision causes most

 investors to choose straight—line depreciation. Thus, a switch to a new tax

 regime that treats residential and commercial properties symmetrically will

have a less negative impact on commercial properties than on residential. The

Administration plan should actually be slightly favorable to commercial real

estate (initial net operating incomes will be lower after enactment of the

reform than before).

                                B. Tenure Choice

      Because the Administration plan both raises the zero bracket amount and

reduces nonhousing—related deductions, some housing deductions will be wasted.

This increases the average cost of obtaining services from owner—occupied

housing. However, the increase is generally less than the 7 percent computed

increase in rents, so the homeownership rate will tend to rise.

      To deduce the expected change in homeownership, the equation estimated by

Hendershott and Shilling (l982b) is employed. This equation relates the odds

of owning to the average cost of housing services in the two tenure modes. The

resulting changes in homeownership rates for the three household types at the

five income levels are listed in Table 4. As can be seen, the rate generally

rises, but the increase is minimal at higher income levels (above $60,000)

Moreover, for single households the rate would decline slightly at incomes

above-about $30,000. A one or two percentage point increase in the aggregate

homeownership rate is likely.
                                       —20—




                           C.   Owner—Occupied Housing

      Table 5 contains percentage changes in the rental price for owner—

occupied housing services for the three household types at the five income

levels. Table 6 lists the percentage change in the after—tax cost of mortgage

and property tax payments. Each reports results for the current level of

interest rates and a one percentage point decline. Only the calculations based

upon the reasonable decline in rates are discussed; the other numbers are

reported for comparison purposes only. Each table also reports results for an

increase in the net—of—tax property tax rate (a constant rate but lost

deductibility) and a constant net—of—tax rate (a decline in property tax rates

to offset the loss of deductibility)

      In the absence of affordability constraints, the rental price, after—tax

income and tastes determine a household's demand for housing services. As can

be seen in the top panel of Table 5, the rental price falls for low and middle

income joint filers even without a decline in property tax rates. For single

earners with two dependents, housing demand will rise at income levels up to

about $35,000; for two—earners with no dependents, the cut of f is about

$50,000. In contrast, the price will rise for virtually all single owning

households arid the percentage increase exceeds 10 percent for those with

incomes above about $55,000. This is because marginal tax rates are cut more

sharply for singles, especially at higher income levels.

      Where affordability is a problem, after—tax mortgage and property tax

payments are a useful measure of "price'. The percentage changes of these,

shown in Table 6, have the same general pattern as the percentage changes in

rental prices in Table 5. The difference is a light1y greater increase for

high—income joint filers and a near doubling of the increase for singles at all
                                       —21—



levels. The near doubling follows from the base upon which percentage

increases are computed being about half as large for the payment calculation as

for the rental price calculation.

        The net—of—tax property tax rate is the price of obtaining municipally—

provided services (Tiebout, 1956). Should the price rise owing to a reduction

in federal deductibility, the demand for these services will decline and a call

for a cut in the property tax rate will arise. In the limit (a perfectly

elastic demand for municipal services) ,   the property tax rate will decline
sufficiently to offset the reduced deductibility. The second panel of Tables 5

and 6 present this limiting case. The expected result falls somewhere between

the lower—interest—rate portions of the top and bottom panels.

        The net impact of the changes for owner—occupied housing is difficult to

discern. There are far fewer single owning households that joint filers, and

median household income is under $30,000. On the other hand, the median income

of owners, especially joint—filers is probably about $40,000. Moreover, higher

income households obviously spend more on housing than lower income households

so even if more households experience price declines than increases, the total

demand for housing by owners could decline. Overall, we expect no change in

the quantity of housing demanded by existing owners and a slight increase in

total owner demand owing to a small projected increase in the homeownership

rate.
                                           —22—




                                      IV. Summary

      Our analysis of the impact of the Administration tax reform proposal

differs from that of most others in a number of important respects. First, two

general—equilibrium effects have largely been ignored in earlier studies:             (1)


the level of interest rates will decline by a percentage point in response to

both a decline in the demand for funds to finance real capital outlays and an

increase in the supply of funds and (2) the property tax rate on primary

residences will decline because the loss of the deductibility of property taxes

raises the price of municipally—supplied services and lowers the demand for

them. Second, the basic rental housing model is misspecified in two ways:              (1)


risky net operating income and near—riskiess tax depreciation cash flows are

discounted at the same rate and (2) refinancing to keep the loan—to—value ratio

near its optimal level is prohibited, thereby creating artificial gains from

trading.

      Our results differ significantly from those of most studies. The

general—equilibrium effects on owner—occupied housing ——       the one point decline
in interest rates and the decline in property tax rates ——       will   offset the

negative direct effects ——   the   Cut in marginal tax rates and loss of

deductibility of property taxes ——    in   the aggregate. There will, however, be

distributional effects. Owner—occupied housing will generally be cheaper for

households with incomes below $40,000 ——     especially   below $25,000 ——   but   will

be more expensive for those with incomes above $60,000. This constitutes an

improvement in both efficiency and equity because under current law the price

of owner housing services is far lower for high income households than for low

income households. Flomeownership rates should increase by 2 to 3 percentage

points for households with incomes below $40,000 and 1 to 2 percentage points

in the aggregate.
                                       —23—



        A 7 percent increase in market rents (11 percent without the decline in

interest rates) is projected. Consideration of the individual components of

the Administration plan suggests that the only significant negative provision

is the cut in the personal tax rate from 0.53 (including a 6 percent state and

local rate deductible at the Federal level) to 0.41. Without this cut (and the

decline in interest rates which is largely attributable to the cut), market

rents would fall by 6 percent. Rents rise only because rental housing is a

negatively taxed asset in the sense that a tax cut lowers the supply of the

asset. Given that a major motivation of tax reform is to improve efficiency

and equity by taxing different sources of income and returns from assets more

equally, the 7 percent increase in rents (and the expected 2 percent decline in

"rents" on commercial property) is surprisingly low.

        The special provisions of the tax plan ——   the elimination of tax—exempt
financing, of the deductibility of interest for second homes, and of the

special treatment of low—income housing —— have not been analyzed. These

provisions do not affect market rents generally, and much of the benefit from

the provisions is not even targeted to especially needy households. Part of

the benefits are captured by developers, builders, and lenders, and the

deductibility for second homes provides significant benefits only for

households with second homes valued above $100,000. Finally, even the

"targeted" programs are known to be poorly targeted (Gainer, 1985 and Olsen,

1982)

                                    FOOTNOTES



 1For our analysis of the first three proposals see Hendershott and Ling

 (1984c); the Treasury plan was considered in Hendershott and Ling (1985).



2The interest sensitivity of foreign net saving to international interest rate

differentials. However, the tendency for foreign central banks to move their

interest rates with American rates, the large role the U.S. plays in world

capital markets, and differences in preferences and risks across national

boundaries all ensure that a significant decline will occur.



3Even with low supply price elasticities, long—run price changes are small

relative to long—run rent changes. Short—run price changes will also be small

if investors anticipate future rent increases, which they will almost certainly

do in light of the wide publicity given the most outlandish rent increase

numbers. On both of these points, see Fiendershott and Ling (l984a).



4Alternatively, we take into account the gains from optimally trading taxable

bonds [see Hendershott's application (1985) of Constantidines and Ingersolls

analysis (1984) to the determination of tax—exempt coupon].



5These calculations follow the methodology of Hendershott and Slemrod (1983).



6For example, under current law the marginal federal tax rate for the $17,500

AGI owner is 14 percent. With a 3 percent state and local rate, the total

marginal rate is equal to .14 + (l—.14) .03 =   .166.   For the $17,500 renter, the

total marginal rate (.19) is the federal marginal rate of 16 percent plus the

full 3 percent state and local rate because this household does not itemize.

7Disallowed losses for real estate investments would generally be carried

forward until the year of sale because the amount at risk during the operating

years will usually not otherwise increase; only when principal repayment of

debt exceeds tax depreciation will taxable income exceed cash distributions.

In the year of sale, loss carry forwards can be written off against ordinary

income to the extent that gains from the sale increase the at—risk basis, i.e.,

the capital gain (net selling price minus the adjusted basis) is greater than

sales proceeds or the selling price less the outstanding mortgage balance.

This will usually be the case because the rate of tax depreciation will

generally exceed the rate of mortgage principal amortization. Thus, tax
