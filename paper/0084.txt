In this paper we study two methods for finding confidence limits for the
simple median. One method is the new parame1ic procedure based on the
sign test, and the other is derived in the paper. The tv methods are
canpared asmiptoticaily and also for snail samples.

                                 I. Introduction


      Recently   there has been a great deal of interest        in robust   estimators
of   location and regression paraneters. Many of the better estimators are
not really suitable for hand calculation (see Andrews et al. (1972)); the
sample median, hever, is a reasonable estimator of location that is
readily computed by hand. Once a point estimate has been computed, it is
natur1 to seek confidence limits for the estimate; the purpose of this
paper   is   to examine two   alternative   methods for setting robust confidence
intervals for the sample median.
                                 II. The Procedures
      The first procedure we will examine is the nonparamEtric procedure
based on the sign test. This is a well )<na.n procedure, described in many
places   (e.g. Thompson (1936), Scheffe (1943), Noether (1949), Dixon (1953),

Fraser (1957)). Let      X1,. .. ,X   denote the order statistics of the sample and

  the sample median. The nonparanetric confidence interval of level x for X

is (XrX r+l' where r is chosen           so   that the probability of fewer than r

successes in a binomial with paraneters (,n) is less than             or   equal to

Nair (1940) and McKinnon (1964) have          tabled r as   a function of n for the 5%

and 1% levels. It turns        out   that for the 5% level rl until n:9, and for the

1% level r=l until nl2. Thus the nonparanetric procedi.z'e cannot be considered

robust for n less than 9 or 12 (since gross erors may affect the length of
the interval violently for small n). Incidentally, it is worth noting that

the fonm.ilas based on the norma]. approximation to the binaiiial, r = . - vci for
the 5% interval, and
                                                      —2—




r        -   1.3   v for the 1% interval (where r                     i rounded   to the   closest

integer) (see Nair-l940) work well for n > 10 (they are conservative)

and   can safely       be used if tables are not available.

               second procedure we shall examine is robust for n > 5.

The   random quantity MS is sorrtimes called the interquardle range, or the
rnidspread (ftkey-l970). We define our confidence interval by

        (X —   t'(c,n)    MS       ,    X    +   t'(ct, n) MS)    ,                            (1)



where t G ,n) is         chosen to achieve the desired level. In other words, we
mimic student's interval, but with robust estimates of scale and location.
This interval has been studied in the past: Rirnbaurn (1°70) derived distri-
bution free bounds for t'(c,n), which are unfortunately far too conservative;
]avid and Johnson (1956) studied this interval when sampling fraTL a nonrial
distribution; and Weisberg (1973) studied generalizations of thic interval.
There are two main problems with this interval: 1) clearly t'(c,n) will vary
from distribution to distribution. In other words a single
                                                      —3—



set of t(c,n) values will not insure c level intervals for all
distributions. To sie extent Student's interval has the same prcblern
although is widely used. 2) For any specific population, how do we
determine       t"(cL,n)? The exact determination of t(c,n) involves a 3 dimensional

integral, which can pose severe numerical difficulties. Both problems can be
side-stepped                                           level c is approximately
                     simultaneously by choosing t '( c,n) so              that

achieved at the Gaussian distribution. Since the median is relatively more
efficient in non-Gaussian situations, we would hope that this method will insure
a conservative interval As a first step toward approximating t ( a ,n), we iore
n   and   use   asymptotic         theory.
                                             III. Asymptotic Theory

          Let N( ,a2) denote the nor'ir2L law with mean p and variance 2 Let F ()
denote   the cdf of the synuitric distribution from which we are sampling, and
let   F'() = f(.). Then it is easily shan (Craner-1946) that
                                         1
          /n X + N        (0, [2fO)T2                                                    (2)

By sy1Turtry and the law of large nuirers, we also have
        p
      MS     -

It follows at once that

If        denotes the . percentage point of the nornal distribution, this                suggests
that we can       calibrate         our      interval for the normal distribution by taking
      t'(ct,n) =          Z    —     —         ——              Z   .9Li                 (14)

      The factor           .94 is sufficiently close to               1 that we can           discard it,
so   we suggest the approximation

        t'(c,n)            t(c,n),                                                                          (5)

where   t(c ,n) denotes the - percentage point of Student s t distribution on
n degrees of freedom.

In order to compare the -two intervals, we shall consider v (expected length).
for the interval (1) this is

      For       the nonparametric interval, /Fi                   (expected length) is
                                                                                                                  •

where   r1 is tabled, and approximately r1                              -

Clearly the asymptotic length of interval (1) is

and it's asymptotic level is

(at least asymptotically) so long                 as it      is asymptotically inefficient with

 Ne'c we consider the contaminated normal distribution, where we have

The   equation
        (l-p)         (x) +   p    (.) = .75           is easily solved by Newton's method   and leads
to the   inefficiencies given in Table                     I.
These results suggest that in moderate contamination with fat tails, the interval

(1) is probably         conservative             and   not very inefficient asymptotically, although
for a large contamination fraction it may become very inefficient. (p .25,
k .01 is equivalent to p .75, k 100, fran the definition of the contaminated
normal).

Gross    (1971) perfonid a Monte Carlo experiment for a wide variety of estimators.
Airpng other quantities, he estimated t(ct,n) for a = .05 under various sampling
distributions. His results are given in Table II. David and Johnson (1956)
considered the statistic     , and found approximations to the percentage points
of its distribution. From their results, we can derive the values of t'(cx,n)
for a = .05 and a = .02 under normality. These results are given in Table III,
together with the ratio of t                      to Student's t.

The results presented in Table        II and   III   suggest that using   t'(ct,n)

t(a ,n) is indeed a conservative procedure, for a             .05 and n 10, but

Table     II suggests that this need not hold for n < 10       or a = .01.     To examine

this,     I conducted a I'bnte Carlo experiirnt under the      norTnal distribution    for
n   5, 7, 9, 11, 21, 41 (I used respectively 6000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000 and
700 replications). Since the results are merely meant to provide a crude

approximation to t(cx ,n), I will not describe the experiment in detail (It was

carried    out in the TROLL system using a Box-Mueller nonnal generator. A standard
variance    reduction techniaue (stinEs referred to as "swindling't) was              employed

(Holland 1975). The results are presented in Table IV, together with the relevant
t values. The irregular behavior as n increases is not due to sampling
error, but to the irregularities in the definition of MS. Eom Table IV we
see that the approximation t'( .05 ,n)          t( .05 ,n) breaks down for n <10, and that
the approximation is never very good for a = .01. We propose the following
rules for t(a,n):
For a       .05: if n > 10 use Student's t. If n <        10, use 7.5 —

for   a     .01: first, find t(.05,n). Then set
                                  2 t(.05,n) if n < 15
                  t(   .01,n)=
                                 1.5 t(.05,n) if n > 15


Nai that we have approximate values of t'(a,n) even for small n, we examine
the lengths of the two intervals for small n. As already noted, the 5% non-
parametric interval is robust only for n > 10, and the 1% only for n >               12.   Our

first results for the 5% intervals are again taken from Gross (1971). They are
presented in Table V.

These results suggest that for nl0, the interval (1) may be superior in

fat-tailed   situations. To examine this   further,   we turn to the contaminated normal
distribution. Gastwirth and Cohen (1970) have tabled expected values of order
statistics for son contaminated normal distributions. The results of Table VI
are dervied fran their table.

Again, we see that for small n and contaminated situations, the interval
(1) may be shorter than the nonparanEtric interval.

                                             V. Exanle

       As an example, we compute the two intervals for a specific set of data,
together with Student's interval. The data are differences in the weights of
matched pairs of rats undergoing a certain experiment, and were collected at
Harvard. The        order statistic is —75, —54,            —51, 0, 5, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22,
22,   29, 38, 41 with n          15.

      We find

      X 15, MS          22—0 =    22,    v        3.87

      The 5% level t value is 2.13 so the interval (1) becomes 15                     12 =   (3,     27)

The nonparainetric interval is (0,22).

      The sample      mean is    3.4 and     the sample standard     deviation   is 33.7 so Student's
interval   is   3.4     9     (-5.6,     9.4). A normal plot shows that        the   data are
clearly   not a sample fran a normal distribution, so in this case, either robust
interval is     preferable     to Student' s interval.

                                         VI. Conclusion
      It is    necessary to go to a great deal of trouble to get a robust
              not

confidence interval with reasonable properties. For n > 20, the nonparemetric
interval based on r = - V, or r = - 1.3 1/n is very good. For 10 < n < 20
either the nonparenrtric interval, or                     t(a,n)MS is reasonable. If .5      <   n   <   10,
the interval          t(c,n)MS         is plausible. A simple approximation to t (c,n) is:
                                                                > 10
