                                           ABSTRACT

We measure provider coverage networks for plans on the Massachusetts health insurance exchange
using a two measures: consumer surplus from a hospital demand system and the fraction of population
hospital admissions that would be covered by the network. The two measures are highly correlated,
and show a wide range of networks available to consumers. We then estimate consumer willingness-to-pay
for network breadth, which varies by age. 60-year-olds value the broadest network approximately
$1200-1400/year more than the narrowest network, while 30-year-olds value it about half as much.
Consumers place additional value on star hospitals, and there is significant geographic heterogeneity
in the value of network breadth.

Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


Introduction

Insurance plans that only allow coverage for a limited set of providers (often called “limited”
or “narrow” network plans) are growing in popularity, especially in the new health insurance
exchanges created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. These networks, which can steer
consumers to lower cost providers, have been proposed as a solution to rising health care
costs.

Yet there is little evidence on how consumers value such provider coverage networks, since
consumers (e.g. in employer-sponsored plans) have not typically chosen from among many
different provider networks; this is changing with the creation of the exchanges. Variation in
networks allows us to determine the value consumers place on plan attributes, including
network breadth. There are at least two ways to examine consumer valuation of these
networks. First, with the provider demand system method, consumers’ value of a network is built
up from a model of consumer demand for providers. Once the demand system for the
providers has been estimated, the value of various provider networks can be simulated. That
is, consumers’ valuation for insurance networks can be derived from their demand for health
care providers. Second, with the insurance choice method, we can measure consumers’ demand
for insurance networks directly from their choice of insurance plans that vary in network
breadth.

We examine consumer valuation of provider coverage networks with both the provider
demand system and insurance choice methods. We use data from the Massachusetts Health
Insurance Exchange (HIX) and the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD). With
the APCD, we develop a model of consumer demand for hospitals, and then use the model
to simulate the value of provider coverage networks. We then use choices from the HIX to
determine the value consumers place on provider coverage networks at the point of
insurance choice.

Our results indicate that simple measures of network breadth can predict consumer choices.
The consumer surplus of different networks estimated from our hospital demand system is
highly correlated with a simple measure of fraction of population admissions that would be
covered by the network. We find that WTP for network breadth varies by age, with 60-year
olds valuing the broadest versus narrowest network at $102/month more using the
consumer surplus measure and $123/month using the fraction of admissions measure.

While limited network plans have increased attention as a result of healthcare reform, they
are not novel: managed care plans in the 1990s used limited provider choice as a method to
reduce cost (Cutler, McClellan, and Newhouse 2000). Limited network insurance plans can
reduce costs in a variety of ways: they can include only lower cost (per unit price) providers,
they can include only lower utilization providers (i.e. variation in provider style), they can

enable insurers to bargain more effectively with providers, and they can enable insurers to
select a healthier pool of enrollees.1 The focus of this paper, though, is not on how these
plans lower costs but on how consumers value these plans.

Our analysis builds on previous literature. For employer-sponsored health insurance, Ho
(2006) estimates a model of hospital demand, and then a model of insurance plan choice
conditional on the hospital network offered. Her model of insurance plan choice represents
a composite of employer choice and search as well as individual choice. In our paper, we
directly examine consumer choice of insurance plans in an exchange setting, with posted
prices. More recently, Gruber and McKnight (2014) examines financial incentives for
Massachusetts state employees to choose plans with limited networks that led about 10% of
eligible employees to change switch plans. They find that switching to limited networks
reduced spending on medical care, with the reduction attributable to both a change in the
quantity of services used as well as the price paid per service.

In addition to the impact on costs, narrow networks have the potential to shape insurance
markets in a number of ways. First, narrow networks may allow carriers to differentiate their
products, allowing them to charge a premium in the absence of strong brand preferences
(Starc 2014). On the other hand, the ability to sell a narrow network product may lower
barriers to entry, and additional entrants can lower premiums (Dafny, Gruber, and Ody
2014).


       1. Data

We use data from the Massachusetts All-Payer Claims Database (APCD) and the
Massachusetts HIX Commonwealth Choice program.2

1.a HIX Choices

The Massachusetts HIX was created by the 2006 health reform and was a model for the
ACA HIXs. The HIX is described in detail in Ericson and Starc (2012a, 2012b). Our data is
transaction-level data from Nov 2009 -Feb 2010 for individuals who purchase single
coverage from the unsubsidized3 market. This dataset captures only individuals who enroll in


   1
     See Shepard (2014) for evidence of adverse selection on network breadth in the Massachusetts Commonwealth Care market. The
Commonwealth Care market is distinct from the market we examine in our paper—Commonwealth Choice. Both are health insurance
exchanges. Commonwealth Choice was the unsubsidized market that offered various tiers of plan quality (bronze, silver, gold).
Commonwealth Care was the subsidized market that offered a single standardized benefit package but allowed variations in network breadth.
Both were superseded by the ACA exchanges.
   2
     We supplement this data with information from the American Hospital Association, CMS’s National Plan and Provider Enumeration
System, and hand collected data on provider network coverage.
   3
       In this time period, subsidized insurance was offered in the separate Commonwealth Care market.



                                                                  Page 3
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


the HIX for the first time during this time period; it contains one observation per person,
for the month in which they first enrolled.

Consumers pick a plan from the set of plans available to them at posted prices, which vary
by age, zip code and family size. Plans were grouped into tiers of actuarial value (bronze,
silver, and gold); the actuarial values of the tiers is slightly different from the ACA’s tiers. 4
Six insurers (listed in Table 1) offer plans on the HIX during our time frame, and must offer
a plan in each tier.5

To identify price sensitivity, we use the fact that preference are continuous in age but prices
jump at round numbered ages (e.g. 30, 35, 40, etc.) We discuss, justify, and apply this
identification strategy in detail in Ericson and Starc (forthcoming).

1.b Hospital Claims and Coverage

We examine provider coverage networks for acute-care hospitals for adults in Massachusetts.
Using the 2012 American Hospital Association (AHA) database, we select the set of general
medical and surgical hospitals, excluding long-term care, rehabilitation, children’s, and
Veterans Affairs hospitals. We are left with a list of 60 hospitals.

We then hand-collected data on whether each hospital was in network6, for all six carriers in
our HIX data from the HIX website. In addition, we separately coded Fallon Select and
Fallon Direct plans—both offered by Fallon, but with different networks.

We then use the APCD data to construct “admission events” for six diagnosis categories:
cardiac, cancer, neurological, digestive, labor, and newborn baby. We use the ICD-9
diagnosis codes in Ho (2006), reproduced in Table A.1. We use all commercial payers (e.g.
excluding MassHealth, Medicare) and select all claims that have either and admitting
diagnosis or primary diagnosis in one (or more) of these categories. We keep only claims
with admission dates between Jan 1st, 2009 and Dec 31st, 2011. We link these claims to our
list of acute care hospitals based on the National Provider Identifier (NPI) with further
details in the appendix.

We aggregate claims into admission events. If an individual’s first admission is on date t, we
group all of their claims with admission dates between t and t+30 into one admission event.

4
    In the 2009 the plans were simply grouped into tiers; beginning January 2010, the cost-sharing characteristics were standardized within
seven product tiers: Gold, Silver-High, Medium and Low, and Bronze-High, Medium, and Low. Standardization unbundled the choice of
plan into a choice of cost-sharing characteristics (tier), and a choice of insurer (with a provider coverage network and premium specific to
that insurer). Standardization and its effect on choice are described in more detail in Ericson and Starc (2013).
     5
         Health New England is omitted as it only covers part of the state.
     6
    Circa 2013, the Connector had a web-based tool that allowed users to restrict search results to plans that included that hospital in
network.



                                                                      Page 4
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


An individual can have multiple admission events: someone with 3 claims with admission
dates t, t+15, t+40 would have two admissions events: a t to t+30 admission event and a
t+40 to t+70 admission events. For each admission event, we assign the hospital based on
the modal hospital over the claim lines; similarly we assign the modal admitting diagnosis
and primary diagnosis.

We use data from all commercial payers. The HIX market we study is a small (but growing)
part of the carriers’ book of business, and our measures will not be contaminated by the
choices of consumers choosing within the exchange.

    2. Construction of Network Measures

2.a. Hospital Counts and Covered Fraction of Admission Events

We quantify the breadth of insurer-hospital networks in a number of ways. Our simplest
measure simply takes the number of hospitals in network as a percentage of hospitals in
Massachusetts. This measure ranges from nearly one-third (Tufts Select) to nearly all
hospitals (BCBS). In order to account for differences in demand across hospitals, we utilize
the APCD data. First, we construct a measure of the fraction of admissions that would be
covered by a carrier network. The results are in Table 1, and confirm our priors. BCBS
offers the most generous network, with 98% of hospitals in network. The Tufts Select
network, an early narrow network, has the lowest coverage measure. Fallon Select’s network
is broader than Fallon Direct. We can further decompose the measures by individual
diagnosis, but all of the measures are highly correlated. The second column constructs a
similar measure that restricts to academic medical centers.

2.b Consumer Surplus from Hospital Choice Model

We can take the claims data even more seriously and construct measures of network total
expected consumer surplus from a network, which we will call the “hospital choice measure”
for simplicity. By utilizing methods from the hospital merger literature (see Capps, Dranove
and Satterthwaite 2003 and Gowrisankaran, Nevo, and Town, forthcoming), we can infer
consumer valuations of networks from their choice of hospitals. These measures will more
accurately capture the nonlinearities generated by “star” hospitals or systems who may
bargain together.

To estimate the hospital choice measure, we assume that an individual i with diagnosis
category d has utility of hospital h given by:

                                                                          ,




                                               Page 5
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


where       is a hospital-diagnosis specific fixed effect, and          is the distance (in
miles) from the individual’s zipcode to the hospital’s address (see Empirical Appendix).7 The
diagnosis category corresponds to one the six previously defined categories (cardiac, cancer,
neurological, digestive, labor, and newborn baby). Given this model and the assumption
that      takes on a type-I extreme value distribution we can estimate the parameters of this
model from the data on hospital chosen, broken down by each diagnosis category, using a
conditional logit model of choice.8

Having estimated the parameters from the hospital choice model, we can then generate the
consumer surplus from a given hospital network. We construct these measures separately for
each diagnosis category, as the perceived quality of a hospital may vary by diagnosis. The
consumer surplus of a network j for a diagnosis category d for consumer i:

                 log 1                   exp                                                                                                ,

where                is an indicator for whether the hospital is in j’s network. We z-score
normalize these measures within each zipcode. We then average the 6           measures into a
single     measure using demographic (age and gender) specific diagnosis weights. Table 1
presents the average     across all consumers. This variable is scaled differently than our %
of admissions covered, but generates a similar ranking of network breadth.

This measure of consumer surplus that varies within insurer: for instance, some individuals
live close to hospitals covered by Fallon while other individuals live further away. Our new
measure will give a higher network valuation for Fallon to the first set of individuals. This
measure will allow us to see whether consumers separately value this measure of plan
network over and above the value they place on the insurer’s overall network (including, for
instance, other providers such as individual physicians). Our goal is to consider a variety of
different network measures, rather than relying on a single measure. We will show that all of
these measures have similar implications for consumer valuation of networks.

       3. Estimating Insurance Demand

From individuals’ insurance choices, we estimate multinomial logit models of the form:

                                                           ,                                                     ,      (Equation 1)


   7
     This model could be generalized in a number of ways: for instance, we could allow            to vary by more narrowly defined diagnosis
categories (such as by ICD-9 code rather than by 6 groups).
   8
     Individuals may have limited network insurance plans that do not cover certain hospitals, thereby removing it from the consumer’s
choice set, or tiered network plans that impose additional cost-sharing for certain hospitals. This likely biases down our estimate of the value
of the highest utility-giving hospitals, since limited network plans typically exclude the hospitals for which there is higher demand. We believe
the bias is relatively small, given that our time period of admissions predates the growth of limited network insurance plans and uses the
commercially insured population (typically, employer-sponsored plans).



                                                                    Page 6
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


where the utility of plan j for person i is given by , the premium (which varies by age) is
given by , and the network measure for plan j is given by                . We include a vector
of other plan characteristics (tier, actuarial value) as  . The error term    is assumed to
take a Type-I extreme value distribution, giving a standard logit model of choice.

Following our previous work (Ericson and Starc, forthcoming), we identify using
discontinuities in pricing by age. Thus, we let price sensitivity vary continuously by age
through the term           ,    ; here we implement the interaction as a linear function; our
previous work found this to be a reasonable choice.

We first estimate a version of Equation 1, in which in lieu of including a measure of the
insurer’s network in the utility model, we simply include an insurer-specific fixed effect .
This measure is plotted on the y-axis of Figure 1, with Blue Cross/Blue Shield’s network’s
utility normalized to zero. On the x-axis of Figure 1, we plot one of our measures of
network breadth, the percent of hospital admission events that would be covered by the
insurer’s network. It is encouraging that there is a clear relationship between our estimated
utility of plan networks and the percent of admission events covered. The graph plots a
linear fit, which has an R2 of 0.75; with just these six points, we reject the null hypothesis of
no linear relationship between the two measures at p<0.05.

The results of our basic choice models are in Table 2, Panel A. The model in the first
column measures the breadth of networks using the percentage of hospital admissions that
would be covered by a given plan; it ranges from zero to one. We can interpret the
coefficient by dividing by the price coefficient and multiplying by differences in the network
measure. We can calculate a consumer’s WTP for network A versus B as follows:

                                 ,

Note that price sensitivity   varies by age, so WTP for networks will also vary by age.

For example, take the % Admits Covered measure: BCBS covers 59 percentage points more
hospital admissions in the APCD data than the Tufts Select network. If we divide by age-
specific and multiply by 0.59, we have a measure of WTP for the BCBS network relative
to the Tufts Select network. For a 30-year-old consumer, we estimate a WTP of $68/month
for the broader BCBS network; for the less price sensitive 60-year-olds, we estimate a WTP
of $123/month. In Panel B of Table 2, mixed logit models— which estimate population
heterogeneity in price sensitivity — imply similar valuations.

The hedonic regressions in Table 4 imply that compared to Tufts, BCBS charges $51/month
more for 30-year olds and $137/month more for 60 year-olds, which lines up closely with
our estimates of the WTP per month.


                                              Page 7
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks



We examine a coarse measure of hospital quality: in column 3, we use as our network
measure % of admissions at academic medical centers that would be covered. This measure
is nearly perfectly correlated with the measure based on all hospitals. Thus, our WTP for
network breadth are virtually identical; while we estimate a smaller , this is offset by larger
variation between networks in this measure (i.e. a difference of 81 percentage points for
BCBS versus Tufts, compared to only 59 in the % of all admissions measure.)

Finally, we consider        , the consumer surplus measure from the hospital demand system,
as our network measure. With this measure, the value of networks will vary across
individuals. Using the average        for BCBS and Tufts, this specification implies a valuation
for the broader BCBS network of $57/month for 30-year-olds and $102/month for 60-year
olds. This result is very similar to the % of admissions measure.

Table 3 explores heterogeneity, as well as additional measures of network breadth. Column 1
lets network valuation vary by age and gender. The interaction between % Covered and
Female suggests that women value network generosity more, though it is imprecisely
measured and not significantly different from zero. We do find an age-trend in valuation,
with about 30% higher at age 60 than at age 30. (Note, also varies by age).

Turning to geography, we interact our network measure with the hospital referral region
(HRR) of the consumer purchasing insurance. Consumer valuation of networks is higher in
the Boston HRR than in Worcester or Springfield. Given the set of hospitals in Boston, we
think this is intuitive. It also has important implications for pricing across geographic
regions.

One salient measure of network quality to consumers may be whether a large, prominent
hospital is included in the network. In our setting, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),
one of the core Partners Healthcare hospitals, is an obvious example. (The Massachusetts
hospital market has been subject to increased antitrust scrutiny due to the potential market
power wielded by Partners.) In Table 3, Column 3 we include an indicator variable for
whether MGH is in network. The results imply that a 30-year old9 will also pay $32/month
more for a plan with MGH in network, even controlling for the breadth of the overall
network. This is consistent with “star hospitals” being able to command a premium.

Distance is also an important determinant of hospital demand: consumers are most likely to
go to the hospital closest to them. In Table 3, Column 3 we replace our network measure
with a simple indicator for whether the nearest hospital is in network. Using this as a proxy
for network quality, the results imply that a 30-year old is willing to pay $26 more/month for


  9
      A 60-year old is roughly half as price sensitive, so these numbers can be multiplied by 2 to approximate a 60-year-old’s WTP.



                                                                   Page 8
Measuring Consumer Valuation of Limited Provider Networks


a plan with the closest hospital to their zipcode in network. However, the indicator is not
statistically significant from zero when the percent of admissions covered is also included in
the model.

Finally, we limit our analysis to individuals in the Boston HRR and estimate a hospital
demand model from these individuals alone. Table 4 first replicates the final conditional logit
specification from Table 2 for this Boston-only sample. Then, column 2 includes insurer-
specific fixed effects . Once we do this, our estimate of the additional weight consumers
place on network quality (       ) becomes smaller in magnitude and is much more imprecisely
estimated. The 95% confidence interval is consistent with consumers either placing zero
weight on the measure, or placing similar weight (0.4) as estimated in column 2.

These results indicate it is difficult to separately identify the weight consumers place on this
particular measure of network breadth from their valuation of an insurers’ network more
generally. We may not have enough geographic variation within the Boston HRR to capture
the separate effect of networks. Moreover, insurer networks have more components than
hospital coverage—such as which physicians are included in network. These are likely valued
by consumers, correlated with the overall hospital network, but not well captured by our
measure using distance from hospitals. Finally, the results are also consistent with
consumers simply using brand as a proxy for network quality. (This would also be consistent
with the similar valuations of the two Fallon networks seen in Figure 1.)

        4. Discussion and Conclusion

The literature on insurance demand has largely focused on the financial features of plans,
rather than their networks. By contrast, this paper highlights the importance of non-
pecuniary features of plans. Determining how consumers value networks has important
implications for the competitiveness of exchanges and network adequacy regulation. We
measure the value consumers place on network breadth, and find that consumers value
broader networks using a variety of measures. However, it is unclear whether consumers
value—or even observe—geographic variation in network quality in the Greater Boston
area. They may use brand name as a proxy for network quality.10 Furthermore, “star”
hospitals are valued by consumers above and beyond the overall network measure.

Consumer valuation of networks may vary by context. The enrollees in the unsubsidized
HIX we study are all above 300% of the poverty line; willingness-to-pay-may be lower for
lower-incomes. In order for consumers to value network breadth, they must be able to



   10
      We know that consumers do not necessarily weight product characteristics as economic theory would predict (Abaluck and Gruber
2010). Similarly, they may not be able to evaluate network differences accurately because they do not have easy access to network information
or cannot do the (complex) calculation.



                                                                  Page 9

observe it: in contexts where brands are unfamiliar and/or it is difficult to access network
information, consumers may not appear to value networks.

          ∗                       , where X includes actuarial value, tier, and year (2009 v
2010). “Annual WTP Relative to Blue Cross” for a 30-year old results from dividing the
insurer-network fixed effect by          30 . The graph includes 95% confidence interval
bars, calculated by the delta method, around each WTP measure. The line shows a linear fit
of the WTP measure to percent of hospital admission events covered.

A1. Construction of Claims
From the APCD, we keep claims whose service provider is located in Massachusetts. We
then merge each claim’s Service Provider National Provider Identifier (NPI) with the CMS’s
National Plan and Provider Enumeration System Downloadable file (NPPES 2014-07-13
edition). To link these claims to hospitals, we keep matched APCD- NPPES records that
have a National Uniform Claim Committee healthcare taxonomy code beginning in 282 (a
broad category that includes General Acute Care Hospitals, but also other hospitals; see
http://www.wpc-edi.com/reference/ for more details). We additionally hand select hospitals
(Heywood, Marlborough, St Vincent, St. Anne’s) based on the NPPES Provider
Organization Name that were included in our AHA-identified hospital list but did not meet
our taxonomy code criteria. Based on the NPI, Provider Organization Name, and Provider
Business Practice Location fields, we hand link these records to our AHA-identified
hospitals.
