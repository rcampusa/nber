The Effect of New Drugs on Mortality from Rare Diseases and HIV
Frank R. Lichtenberg
NBER Working Paper No. 8677
December 2001
JEL No. I1, O3, L6



                                              ABSTRACT

        I investigate the effect of large increases in the number of drugs available to treat rare diseases
and HIV on mortality associated with them. Mortality from both diseases declined dramatically following
increases in drug approvals.
        Before the Orphan Drug Act went into effect (between 1979 and 1984), mortality from rare
diseases grew at the same rate as mortality from other diseases. In contrast, during the next five years,
mortality from rare diseases grew more slowly than mortality from other diseases. I estimate that one
additional orphan drug approval in year t prevents 211 deaths in year t+1 and ultimately prevents 499
deaths, and that about 108 thousand deaths from rare diseases will ultimately be prevented by all of the
216 orphan drugs tha t have been approved since 1983. Deaths are more closely related to the number
of orphan product designations (which include experimental drugs) than they are to the number of
approvals.
        Consistent with previous patient- level studies of HIV, I find that new drugs played a key role in
the post-1995 decline in HIV mortality. I estimate that one additional HIV drug approval in year t
prevents 5986 HIV deaths in year t+1 and ultimately prevents 33,819 HIV deaths. HIV drug approvals
have reduced mortality both directly and indirectly (via increased drug consumption). HIV mortality
depends on both the quality and the quantity of medications consumed, and new drug approvals have a
sizeable impact on drug consumption: one additional HIV drug approval in year t results in 1.2 million
additional HIV drug units consumed in year t+1 and ultimately result in 3.6 million additional HIV drug
units consumed.

         During the last two decades, there have been large, sudden increases in the
number of drugs available to treat two kinds of diseases: “orphan” (rare) diseases, and
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). As Figure 1 indicates, the average annual
number of drugs for rare diseases brought to market during 1983-1999 was twelve times
as great as it was during 1973-1982 1 , and the average annual number of HIV drugs
brought to market during 1994-1998 was three times as great as it was during 1987-1993.

         These increases occurred for different reasons and under different circumstances.
The increase in drugs for rare diseases occurred because Congress passed the Orphan
Drug Act in January 1983. The increase in drugs for HIV occurred because AIDS was
first reported in 1981, was identified as being caused by HIV in 1984 2 , and (in the 1990s)
the average length of time required to develop a drug was about 15 years. 3

         Both increases provide a good opportunity to investigate the effect of
pharmaceutical innovation on mortality. In this paper I investigate the effect of increases
in the number of drugs available to treat these diseases on mortality associated with them.

Econometric framework

         I hypothesize that mortality in year t is inversely (and linearly) related to the stock
of drugs available by the end of year t-1:

         MORTt = α – β DRUG_STK t-1                                                                  (1)

where MORTt is a measure of mortality (the number of deaths or life-years lost) in year t
and DRUG_STK is the stock of drugs available by the end of year t-1. 4 I consider two
alternative hypotheses about DRUG_STK.

  β is the effect of changes in the stock of drugs on mortality. The variance of the least-squares estimator of
β is inversely related to the variance of DRUG_STK: the greater the variability of DRUG_STK, the more
                                                                                                              4

          The first is that it is simply the sum of the number of drugs approved by the FDA
for the disease in all previous years:

          DRUG_STK t-1 = FDAt-1 + FDAt-2 + …                                                         (2)

where FDAt-1 is the number of drugs approved by the FDA in year t-1, etc. Equations (1)
and (2) imply that

          MORTt - MORTt-1 = - β (DRUG_STK t-1 - DRUG_STK t-2 )
or

          ∆ MORTt = - β FDAt-1

where ∆ MORTt (= MORTt - MORTt-1 ) is the increase in mortality between year t-1 and
year t. Multiplying both sides by –1,

          - ∆ MORTt = β FDAt-1                                                                       (3)

The reduction in mortality (- ∆ MORTt ) is proportional to the number of drugs approved
in the previous year.
          The second, more general, model of the stock of drugs is

          DRUG_STK t-1 = FDAt-1 + (1 - δ) FDAt-2 + (1 - δ)2 FDAt-3 + …                               (4)

where δ (0 < δ < 1) represents the depreciation (or obsolescence) rate of drugs. If δ = 0,
this reduces to the previous model (2). If δ > 0, recent FDA approvals have a larger
impact on the current stock of drugs than approvals in the distant past. Substituting (4)
into (1), and subtracting (1 - δ) times the lagged value of the resulting equation from
itself,

          MORTt = αδ - β FDAt-1 + (1 - δ) MORTt-1                                                    (5)

The regression of mortality on FDA approvals in the previous year and its own lagged
value will yield estimates of the parameters β, δ, and α.5 From these one can estimate


precise (reliable) the estimate of β. Since there were large changes (increases) in the stocks of drugs for
both diseases, it should be feasible to obtain precise estimates of β.
5
  A statistically significant β implies that FDA approvals “Granger-cause” mortality.
                                                                                         5

both the short-run and long-run impacts on mortality of changes in the number of FDA
approvals: the short-run impact is β and the long-run (cumulative) impact is (β / δ).

Orphan diseases

       The Orphan Drug Act (P.L. 97-414) amended the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act as of January 4, 1983, and additional orphan drug amendments
were passed by Congress in 1984, 1985 and 1988. The 1983 Orphan Drug Act
guaranteed the developer of an orphan product seven years of market exclusivity
following the approval of the product by the FDA. It also provided a tax credit,
and established a clinical research grants program, whereby researchers may
compete for funding to conduct clinical trials to support the approval of drugs for
rare diseases.

       Congress passed the Act because it found that

       (1) there are many diseases and conditions, such as Huntington's disease,
           myoclonus, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease), Tourette syndrome, and muscular
           dystrophy which affect such small numbers of individuals residing in the
           United States that the diseases and conditions are considered rare in the
           United States
       (2) adequate drugs for many of these diseases and conditions have not been
           developed
       (3) drugs for these diseases and conditions are commonly referred to as "orphan
           drugs"
       (4) because so few individuals are affected by any one rare disease or condition, a
           pharmaceutical company which develops an orphan drug may reasonably
           expect the drug to generate relatively small sales in comparison to the cost of
           developing the drug and consequently to incur a financial loss
       (5) there is reason to believe that some promising orphan drugs will not be
           developed unless changes are made in the applicable Federal laws to reduce
           the costs of developing such drugs and to provide financial incentives to
           develop such drugs
       (6) it is in the public interest to provide such changes and incentives for the
           development of orphan drugs.

The original definition of "rare disease or condition" in the Orphan Drug Act was
amended in October 1984 by P.L. 98-551 to add a numeric prevalence threshold to the
definition:
                                                                                                             6

         "...the term rare disease or conditio n means any disease or condition which
         (a) affects less than 200,000 persons in the U.S. or (b) affects more than
         200,000 persons in the U.S. but for which there is no reasonable
         expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a
         drug for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S.
         of such drug."

         The FDA publishes a list of products that are currently designated as
orphans by the Office of Orphan Products Development
(http://www.fda.gov/orphan/designat/list.htm). The list includes the generic and
trade names of the drug, its sponsor and indication(s), the date it was designated,
and, for those products that have also been approved for marketing, a marketing
approval date. As of 6/18/01, the list included 1089 designated products, 216 of
which had been approved for marketing. 6 Orphan drugs (and biologicals) that
have been designated but not yet approved are considered experimental.
Insurance companies will generally reimburse for orphan products that have been
approved for marketing, but may not reimburse for products that are considered
experimental. 7

         Figure 2 displays the number of orphan designations and approvals, by
year. The mortality data I will examine begin a few years before the Orphan Drug
Act (in 1979), but 1983 is the first year in which any designations or approvals
were recorded. I therefore imputed the values of designations and approvals
shown for the years 1979-1982. According to the FDA, fewer than one orphan
drug came to market per year in the decade prior to the Act, so I assumed there
was one approval per year during 1979-1982. Since the ratio of designations to
approvals after 1983 is about 5, I assumed there were five designations per year
during 1979-1982.




6
  There is a separate designation (and marketing approval) for each indication of a drug. Aldesleukin, for
example, has five designations and two marketing approvals. Thus, the frequencies of designations and
approvals we will analyze may be viewed as drug frequencies, weighted by the number of indications for
which a drug is designated or approved.

                                                                                                            7

           I obtained data on mortality from rare and other diseases from the Center
for Disease Control’s 1979-1998 Compressed Mortality File (CMF)
(http://wonder.cdc.gov/mortsql.shtml). This file contains data on the number of
deaths, by cause (ICD9 code), age (and other characteristics) and year. Perhaps
the theoretically ideal procedure would be to link the drug data to the mortality
data at the individual disease level. For example, Gaucher disease is a listed
indication of some of the drugs in the orphan products database, and the term
“Gaucher” occurs within two ICD9 codes (272.7 and 330.2) of the “ICD9 Finder”
of the CMF. However in many cases it is difficult or impossible to determine the
ICD9 codes to which orphan products correspond. Moreover, the cause of death
recorded on death certificates—the underlying basis for the CMF—is known to be
subject to error, and presumably, at lower (more detailed) levels of classification,
the probability of error is greater.

           I therefore pursued an alternative approach: analysis of all rare diseases
combined. Data on drugs for all rare diseases combined were shown in Table 2. I
calculate deaths from all rare diseases combined by calculating the total number
of deaths in each year from all of the (approximately) “2-digit” ICD9 diseases
that caused less than 2000 deaths in that year. 8 2000 deaths appears to be a
reasonable threshold since rare diseases are defined as diseases that affect less
than 200,000 persons in the U.S., and the overall U.S. morality rate is
approximately 1%.

           Figure 3 presents annual data for 1979-1998 on the number of deaths from
rare diseases (based on this definition) and from all other diseases. Between 1979
and 1984, the number of deaths from rare diseases increased at a faster rate than
the number of deaths from other diseases: 2.0% vs. 1.3% per year. However in
the following decade, the number of deaths from rare diseases declined at a rate of
3.1% per year, while the number of deaths from other diseases increased at 1.2%
per year. Deaths from rare diseases increased slightly from 1994-1998. Data on


8
    There are 108 “2-digit” diseases; about half of these diseases cause fewer than 2000 deaths per year.
                                                                                                        8

orphan drug designations and rare disease deaths (plotted on an inverted scale) are
superimposed in Figure 4.

           Although I don’t have annual mortality data for rare vs. other diseases for
years prior to 1979, I thought it would be useful to examine relative mortality
over a longer period, and using an alternative definition of rare diseases. Figure 5
shows the number of deaths from rare diseases and other diseases in 1970, 1980,
and 1995 (computed from the Vital Statistics--Mortality Detail files for those
years); in this figure, rare diseases are defined as diseases causing fewer than
5000 deaths per year. Consistent with the findings above, mortality from rare
diseases increased between 1970 and 1980 (albeit more slowly than mortality
from other diseases), but declined about 20 percent from 1980 to 1995.

           One can perform a simple, formal test of the hypothesis that the
relationship across diseases between initial mortality and subsequent growth in
mortality changed in 1984, by estimating the following regressions 9 :

           ln Ni,1984 - ln Ni,1979 = αPRE + βPRE ln Ni,1979

           ln Ni,1989 - ln Ni,1984 = αPOST + βPOST ln Ni,1984

where Ni,1984 represents the number of deaths caused by disease i in 1984, etc.
The estimate of βPRE is not significantly different from zero, indicating that,
between 1979 and 1984, mortality from (initially) rare diseases grew at the same
rate as mortality from other diseases. In contrast, the estimate of βPOST is positive
and significant, indicating that, between 1984 and 1989, mortality from (initially)
rare diseases grew more slowly than mortality from other diseases. This finding
seems particularly noteworthy, since growth is often inversely related to initial
size due to “regression towards the mean”.

           Estimates of models of mortality from rare diseases are presented in Table
1. Column 1 shows the regression of the number of deaths on current orphan drug


9
    Moreover, this test does not rely on the accuracy of a specific size cutoff, such as 2000 deaths.
                                                                                        9

approvals and the lagged number of deaths. Column 2 shows the regression of
the number of deaths on lagged orphan drug approvals and the lagged number of
deaths. This corresponds to eq. (5) derived earlier. As one might expect, the
second equation fits better than the first: deaths in the cur rent year depend on the
number of approvals by the end of the previous year. The coefficient is negative
and significant at the 5% level. The estimates imply that one additional orphan
drug approval this year will prevent 211 deaths next year and ultimately prevent
499 deaths. I estimate that about 108 thousand (216 drugs * -499 deaths/drug)
deaths from rare diseases will ultimately be prevented by all of the 216 orphan
drugs that have been approved since 1983.

       Column 3 shows the regression of the number of deaths on the lagged
number of orphan product designations, as opposed to approvals. As discussed
above, products that are designated but not approved are considered experimental,
and are presumably available to fewer patients. Deaths are more closely related to
the number of designations than they are to the number of approvals: the
coefficient on lagged designations is significant at the 1 percent level. One
additional designation this year will prevent 40 deaths next year and ultimately
prevent 130 deaths. Although deaths prevented per designation are smaller than
deaths prevented per approval, the estimated number of deaths ultimately
prevented by all designations since 1983 (141 thousand = 1089 designations * -40
deaths /designation) is about one-third greater than the estimated number of
deaths ultimately prevented by all approvals since 1983 (108 thousand).

       Column 4 shows the regression of the number of deaths on the lagged
number of designations and a time trend. While there is no clear theoretical
justification for including a time trend in the mortality model, I report this
equation to show that the coefficient on lagged designations remains highly
significant when a time trend is included; the inverse relationship between deaths
and designations is not a “spurious correlation”.
                                                                                                    10

        Both approvals and designations are included in the regression in column
5. Due to the reasonably high positive correlation between these variables
(evident in Table 2), distinguishing between their effects is difficult. But the
estimates of this equation lend further support to these conclusions: both
approvals and designations have a negative impact on mortality, and the marginal
effect of approvals is larger, but less reliably estimated.

        The equations in columns 6 through 10 are similar to those in columns 1
through 5, but instead of the number of deaths, the dependent variable is the
number of life- years lost before age 75. If a person dies from a rare disease at age
50, for example, then he has lost 25 years of life.10 The overall pattern of these
estimates is similar to that of the earlier estimates, although the implied reduction
in mortality is greater. For example, column 8 implies that one additional
designation this year will save 748 life- years next year and ultimately save 3689
life- years. Life-years ultimately saved per death ultimately prevented is 28.4 (=
3689 life- years / 130 deaths), which is much greater than 15.8 (= 75 – mean age at
death from rare diseases). Evidently, this is because designations increase age at
death as well as reduce the number of deaths, although the former effect is not
statistically significant.

HIV

        Several excellent studies have examined the impact of new drugs on HIV
mortality at the patient level. For example, Palella et al (1998) analyzed data on
1255 patients who were seen at nine clinics specializing in the treatment of HIV
infection in eight U.S. cities from January 1994 through June 1997. They found
that mortality among the patients declined from 29.4 per 100 person-years in 1995
to 8.8 per 100 person-years in the second quarter of 1997, and that this decline
was attributable to the use of more intensive antiretroviral therapies. Mocroft et al
(1998) analysed data from a prospective, observational, European, multicentre
cohort of 4270 HIV-1-infected patients. They found that death rates at the

10
  During the period 1979-1998, mean age at death from rare diseases was 59.2, and from other diseases
was 70.8.
                                                                                                     11

beginning of 1998 were less than a fifth of their September, 1995 level, and that a
large proportion of the reduction in mortality could be explained by new
treatments or combinations of treatments.

           Here I will re-examine the impact of new drugs on HIV mortality at the
aggregate level during the period 1987-1998. It is interesting to know whether the
effects identified from painstaking analysis of large micro datasets can be
detected from aggregate data. Also, my analysis, unlike the micro studies cited,
will include the period of rapidly increasing HIV mortality as well as the period of
declining HIV mortality. In addition, I will investigate the interrelationships
between drug approvals, drug consumption, and mortality.

           My objective is to estimate eqs. (3) and (5), using data on HIV mortality
and HIV drug approvals. I obtained annual data on the number of U.S. deaths
caused by HIV (ICD9 code 042) for the period 1987-1998 from the Compressed
Mortality File. 11 These data are displayed in Figure 6. Between 1987 and 1995,
the number of HIV deaths more than tripled, from 13,151 to 41,388. Fortunately,
however, this eight- year increase was completely reversed in the fo llowing three
years: the number of HIV deaths in the U.S. fell to 12,459 in 1998.

           To compute the number of HIV drugs approved by the FDA, by year, I
needed (1) to identify all drugs that have HIV as an indication, and (2) to
determine the FDA approval dates of those drugs. I used the Drug Indications
Master Table in First DataBank’s National Drug Data File
(http://www.firstdatabank.com/drug/index.html) to identify drugs that have HIV
as an indication. I obtained FDA approval dates from the FDA Orange Book
(http://www.fda.gov/cder/ob/default.htm) and unpublished FDA data. The drugs
are listed in order of date of FDA approval in Table 2.




11
     1987 is the first year in which any HIV deaths are recorded in the Compressed Mortality File.
                                                                                         12

       The number of HIV drugs approved, by year during the period 1987-1999, is
shown in Figure 7. During 1987-1993, only 4 HIV drugs (0.57 drugs/year) were
approved. During 1994-1998, 10 drugs (2 drugs/year) were approved.


       Recall that the simplest mortality model (based on the assumption of zero
depreciation) implied that the reduction in mortality is proportional to the number of
drugs approved in the previous year. Annual time-series data on the reduction in HIV
deaths and the number of HIV drugs approved in the previous year are plotted in Figure
8. There appears to be remarkably strong correlation. Both series were essentially
constant from 1988 to 1993; both increased significantly from 1993 to 1996; and both
declined from 1996 to 1997.


       Estimates of eq. (3) confirm the existence of a strong direct correlation between
mortality reduction and lagged FDA approvals. The estimated relationship is (t-statistics
in parentheses):

       -∆ MORTt = -6328 + 6093 FDAt-1                        R2 = .7378
                  (3.40) (4.74)

The probability value associated with the FDAt-1 coefficient is .0015, indicating that we
can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship at the 99.85% level of significance. The
R2 value indicates that the number of FDA approvals explains almost three-fourths of the
annual fluctuations in the reduction in HIV mortality. The point estimate of the FDAt-1
coefficient indicates that the annual number of HIV deaths is reduced by 6093, on
average, by one additional HIV drug approval.


       Estimates of other, more general, models of HIV mortality are presented in Table
2. Column 1 shows the estimate of eq. (5), in which the depreciation rate is not
constrained to equal zero. The estimated FDAt-1 coefficient is similar to its value in the
restricted equation, which is not surprising since the restriction cannot be rejected. The
equation implies that one additional HIV drug approval this year will prevent 5986 HIV
deaths next year and ultimately prevent 33,819 HIV deaths. Column 2 includes a time
                                                                                                   13

trend; its inclusion has essentially no effect on the estimates. In column 3 the dependent
variable is the log rather than the level of the number of deaths. 12 The estimated FDAt-1
coefficient is also highly significant in this version, but the implied short-run and long-
run marginal effects of FDA approvals on mortality (evaluated at the sample mean values
of MORT and FDA) are slightly sma ller than they are in column 1.


           Data provided by IMS Health Global Services (http://www.ims- global.com/) on
the total number of units of HIV antivirals sold in the U.S. enable me to analyze the
interrelationships among quantity of drugs (number of units), “quality” of drugs (assumed
to be an increasing function of DRUG_STK), and mortality. Column 4 includes the log
of the number of HIV prescriptions (n_rx) but excludes FDAt-1 . The coefficient on
ln(n_rx) is negative and highly significant: HIV mortality is strongly inversely related to
the quantity of HIV drugs consumed. Column 5 includes both drug quantity and drug
quality variables. The coefficient on drug quantity declines more than 50 percent in
magnitude, and is no longer significant. The drug quality variable (FDAt-1 ) declines too,
but by less than a third, and remains significant at the 7 percent level. This suggests that
mortality depends to a greater extent on drug quality than it does on drug quantity, and
also that quality and quantity are positively correlated. The relationship between quality
and quantity—the impact of approvals on drug consumption—is examined in column 6.
The dependent variable is the log of the number of prescriptions (in thousands of units).
The regression indicates that new drug approvals have a sizeable impact on drug
consumption. One additional HIV drug approval this year will result in 1.2 million
additional HIV drug units consumed next year and ultimately result in 3.6 million
additional HIV drug units consumed. The regressions in columns 4-6 jointly indicate that
drug approvals reduce mortality both directly and indirectly (via increased drug
consumption), as depicted in the following diagram:

     Because FDA t-1 is 0 in some years (see Figure 5), we cannot also take the log of FDA t-1 .

Summary and conclusions

       I have investigated the effect of large increases in the number of drugs available
to treat rare diseases and HIV on mortality associated with them. Figure 9 indicates that
mortality from both diseases declined dramatically following increases in drug approvals.
       Before the Orphan Drug Act went into effect (between 1979 and 1984), mortality
from (initially) rare diseases grew at the same rate as mortality from other diseases. In
contrast, during the next five years, mortality from (initially) rare diseases grew more
slowly than mortality from other diseases. I estimate that one additional orphan drug
approval in year t prevents 211 deaths in year t+1 and ultimately prevents 499 deaths, and
that about 108 thousand deaths from rare diseases will ultimately be prevented by all of
the 216 orphan drugs that have been approved since 1983. Deaths are more closely
related to the number of orphan product designations than they are to the number of
approvals.
       Consistent with previous patient- level studies of HIV, I find that new drugs
played a key role in the post-1995 decline in HIV mortality. I estimate that one
additional HIV drug approval in year t will prevent 5986 HIV deaths in year t+1 and
ultimately prevent 33,819 HIV deaths. HIV drug approvals have reduced mortality both
directly and indirectly (via increased drug consumption). HIV mortality depends on both

the quality and the quantity of medications consumed, and new drug approvals have a
sizeable impact on drug consumption: one additional HIV drug approval in year t results
in 1.2 million additional HIV drug units consumed in year t+1 and ultimately result in 3.6
million additional HIV drug units consumed.
