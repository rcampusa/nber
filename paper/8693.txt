                                              ABSTRACT


        This paper presents a model of political competition with campaign contributions and informative
political advertising. Policy-motivated parties compete by selecting candidates and interest groups provide
contributions to enhance the electoral prospects of like-minded candidates. Contributions are used to
finance advertising campaigns that provide voters with information about candidates’ ideologies. The
model embodies rational behavior on the part of all actors, is analytically tractable, and has a unique
equilibrium. The paper uses the model to analyze the welfare economics of contribution limits. Such
limits are shown to redistribute welfare from moderate voters to interest group members. They may or
may not raise aggregate welfare.

1         Introduction

This paper presents a model of political competition with campaign contributions and informative

political advertising. The model incorporates three groups of political actors; parties who select

candidates, interest groups who contribute to candidates, and voters who vote for candidates.

Campaign contributions are position induced in the sense that interest groups give to enhance the

electoral prospects of like-minded candidates (as opposed to buying policy favors). Interest groups’

contributions are used to finance advertising campaigns that provide voters with information

about candidates’ ideologies. The model embodies rational behavior on the part of all actors, is

analytically tractable, and has a unique equilibrium.

        In light of the explosion of theoretical models of electoral competition, the reader might be

forgiven for questioning the value of yet another one.1 The development of this model is motivated

by a desire to analyze issues in the financing of political campaigns. The appropriate regulation of

campaign contributions is an important topic in the United States, with significant dissatisfaction

with the current system and many proposals for reform. To analyze such proposals, one needs

a framework that adequately captures the role contributions play in elections. As commonly

understood, this role is to finance the provision of information about candidates to voters. From

a social viewpoint, this means that contributions should help produce more informed choices.

Moreover, their presence should provide parties with a greater incentive to select candidates with

characteristics that voters want. While there have been a number of interesting studies of campaign

contributions, the literature has yet to produce a theory that satisfactorily captures this role. The

model presented here is designed to fill this gap.

        The model assumes that there are two political parties representing opposing ideologies. Parties

can choose to run either partisan or moderate candidates, with party members preferring the

    1   See Persson and Tabellini (2000) and Grossman and Helpman (2001) for overviews of recent work.




                                                         1
ideology of the former. Voters know a candidate’s party aﬃliation but not whether he is a partisan

or a moderate. Advertising allows a candidate to provide voters with this information. The idea

is that candidates have past records that reveal their ideologies and advertising can inform voters

of those records.2       Such advertising can be advantageous for a moderate candidate because it

may attract moderate voters of the opposing ideology. Resources for campaign advertising are

provided by interest groups consisting of partisans of opposing ideologies. These groups contribute

only to moderate candidates because only they can benefit from advertising their ideologies.3

    To illustrate the value of the model for policy analysis, the paper uses it to study the case

for limiting the amount that interest groups can contribute to campaigns. The analysis reveals

a basic trade-oﬀ: contribution limits reduce expected campaign spending, but also decrease the

likelihood that parties select moderate candidates. The existence of this trade-oﬀ means that

contribution limits cannot be evaluated via the Pareto criterion. Rather, they redistribute welfare

between diﬀerent groups. Moderate voters are made worse oﬀ; partisans who do not belong to

interest groups are unaﬀected; and partisans who are interest group members are actually made

better oﬀ. Thus, imposing a contribution limit redistributes welfare from moderates to interest

group members. The question of whether the gains to interest group members oﬀset the losses

to moderate voters turns on the fraction of the latter in the population. Contribution limits are

always desirable from an aggregate viewpoint when only a small fraction of the population are

moderates, while limits will tend to be harmful when moderates dominate.

    The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows. The next section explains how

   2 Thus, for example, moderate left-wing candidates will have records of being tough on crime, fiscally responsible,

or pro vouchers. Alternatively, if they have not previously held elected oﬃce, they will have had business experience
and displayed strong family values. In contrast, their partisan counterparts will have records of support for radical
programs (such as gay marriage), a history of community activism, or strong ties to the union movement. They
may also have belonged to partisan associations (such as Al Sharpton’s presidential advisory committee).
   3 The conclusion that partisan candidates recieve no campaign contributions arises because there is only one

dimension of diﬀerence between candidates and negative advertising is not permitted. In reality, it would be an
unusual race in which a candidate could not benefit by revealing some information about himself or his opponent.
Nonetheless, the general conclusion that those candidates with characteristics that swing voters value should, ceteris
paribus, receive larger contributions would seem a natural implication of the informational perspective.

the literature on informative advertising in market contexts. Section 3 presents the model and

Section 4 studies equilibrium. Section 5 analyzes the impact of contribution limits. Section 6

concludes with a summary of the lessons of the analysis and some suggestions for future research.


2         Related literature

The model presented here builds on the work of Besley and Coate (2000) and (2001). These

papers employ a model of political competition in which policy-motivated parties compete by

selecting candidates who are characterized by their policy preferences and interest groups provide

position induced contributions to these candidates.4            In the model, however, contributions are

used to finance advertising that attracts the votes of “noise voters”.5 The reason why noise voters

respond to advertising is not explained. Moreover, a candidate’s ability to attract their votes is

independent of his or his opponent’s policy stance, precluding an informational interpretation.

This paper extends this model of electoral competition to incorporate an informational, micro-

founded role for campaign contributions.

        There are relatively few papers that study informative campaign advertising. Austen-Smith

(1987) presents a framework that shares some features with that presented here. In his model,

two oﬃce-seeking candidates compete by selecting positions in a one dimensional policy space.

Two interest groups with ideal points to the left and right of the median voter oﬀer position

induced contributions. Voters have common but noisy perceptions of candidates’ policy positions

and campaign advertising reduces the variance of these perceptions. Since voters are risk averse,

this helps even a candidate with an extreme position. The focus of the analysis is to understand

how the presence of the interest groups influences the positions taken by the candidates.

   4 These papers in turn build on the citizen-candidate models of Besley and Coate (1997) and Osborne and

Slivinski (1996).
    5   This follows the approach of Baron (1994) and Grossman and Helpman (1996).



                                                       3
    While interesting and creative, Austen-Smith’s analysis has two drawbacks. First, it is not

explained why voters are uncertain about candidates’ policy positions and how this uncertainty

is reduced by advertising. Indeed, in equilibrium, there is no uncertainty in candidates’ choices

and hence, from a game theoretic perspective, no reason that voters should be uncertain. Second,

without artificially restricting the candidates to choose diﬀerent positions, equilibrium involves

candidates choosing the same positions and no contributions being given. Thus, the model does

not naturally yield an explanation for campaign contributions.

    Ortuno-Ortin and Schultz (2000) discuss informative advertising in their interesting analysis of

the public funding of campaigns. They model two policy-motivated political parties who compete

by choosing positions in a one-dimensional policy space. There is a fixed pot of public money

made available for financing campaigns. The two parties must use any money allocated to them

to inform voters of their positions.6         The paper studies parties’ choice of platforms under two

assumptions concerning the allocation of public funding: (i) each party receives an exogenous

share of the funds and (ii) each party’s share of the funds is an increasing function of its vote

share. In equilibrium, there is no uncertainty concerning each party’s platform choice and hence

all voters, having been exposed to advertising or not, know each party’s position. This feature

means that the campaign advertising is ineﬀective in equilibrium. Accordingly, if it were financed

by private citizens, none would be provided.

    Schultz (2001) discusses the targeting of informative advertising in a model in which two parties

compete for votes by promising transfers to diﬀerent groups (as in Lindbeck and Weibull (1987)).

Parties care both about votes and the ideological purity of their proposed redistributions. Voters

do not directly observe parties’ proposals but can be informed of their transfers via campaign

advertising. Each party has an exogenous advertising budget and advertising can be perfectly

   6 If voters believe that their position is closer to the median than it actually is, then parties would have no

incentive to advertise and hence this constraint may bind.




                                                        4
targeted to the diﬀerent groups. Voters are uncertain about parties’ ideological preferences so

that, in equilibrium, there is genuine uncertainty concerning parties’ proposals. As in this paper,

uninformed voters make rational inferences based on knowledge of parties’ strategies. Schultz

studies the joint determination of transfers and advertising, establishing a number of interesting

conclusions concerning the groups who will attract the most intensive campaigning. Schultz’s

analysis is complementary to that pursued here in that it seeks to shed light on how parties

will use such campaign resources as they have. By contrast, the analysis of this paper seeks to

understand the level of resources allocated to campaigning.

   Following the industrial organization literature on advertising as a signal (Milgrom and Roberts

(1986)), a number of authors have argued that campaign advertising is best understood as provid-

ing information indirectly (Potters, Sloof, and Van Winden (1997), Prat (1999), (2000)). These

papers assume that candidates have some valence characteristic such as competence and interest

groups can observe this more precisely than voters. The amount of campaign money that a candi-

date collects signals his valence to voters. Hence, although campaign advertising does not convey

information directly, it does so indirectly. In Prat’s (1999) insightful analysis, two oﬃce-seeking

candidates, who may diﬀer in competence, compete by staking out positions in a one dimensional

policy space. A single interest group with non-median policy preferences oﬀers contributions to

candidates in exchange for them moving their platforms towards its preferred policy position.

Thus contributions are service induced. Candidates the interest group believes to be more com-

petent are oﬀered larger contributions because they are more likely to win. This is because voters

observe a noisy signal of competence and hence, ceteris paribus, are more likely to vote for the

more competent candidate. In equilibrium, therefore, the more a candidate advertises, the higher

is his competence. Campaign contributions are good for voters in the sense that they provide

information about competence, but bad in that they lead candidates to distort policy. Banning

contributions can raise voters’ aggregate welfare when the losses in terms of information about


                                                5
competence are smaller than the costs of policy distortion.7

    There is much of interest in this argument. However, the widespread employment of high priced

political strategists suggests that the content of campaign advertisements matters.8                     Moreover,

campaign advertisements typically do provide verifiable information about candidates’ records.

Such information includes their accomplishments in the private sector or military service, their

family history, the public programs they have proposed or supported, things they have done for

their constituents, endorsements from community leaders, etc. While it is true that there is

nothing in the United States legal system to prevent candidates from lying about these things,9

the threat of being exposed by the media (or perhaps just basic human decency) makes bold-faced

lying the exception rather than the rule. Thus, to focus solely on the signalling role of campaign

advertising misses an important part of its function.

    It is interesting to contrast the role of informative advertising in political competition with that

in market competition (see, for example, Nelson (1976)). In political competition, one may think

of the candidates that parties select as diﬀerentiated products and an individual voter’s decision

to vote for a particular candidate as like a purchase decision. To the extent that interest groups

seek to maximize the votes for their party’s candidate, the situation seems broadly analogous to

informative advertising by producers in an industry with diﬀerentiated products. The seminal

analysis of such advertising is due to Grossman and Shapiro (1984). In their model, firms are

characterized by their product type and use advertising to inform consumers of their product and

   7 See Prat (1999) for the precise conditions under which this occurs. While Prat does not consider the distribu-

tional consequences of contribution limits, it seems likely that in his model banning contributions is either Pareto
ineﬃcient or redistributes from citizens on the side of the interest group to those on the other side of the political
spectrum. Welfare conclusions more in keeping with the findings of this paper might be expected with two interest
groups with preferred policies either side of the median voter. In such circumstances, interest group competition
may reduce the costs of policy distortion and thereby dissipate interest groups’ policy gains. For an analysis of
multiple interest groups in a related framework see Prat (2000).
   8 Presumably, it is unreasonable to suppose that voters observe the wage paid to political consultants and hence

the hiring of such consultants cannot itself be put down to signalling.
   9 In the United States, the First Amendment protects advertising as free speech. Thus, in contrast to commercial

advertising, citizens have no legal recourse against a candidate who lies about his (or his opponent’s) record.




                                                          6
its price. Consumers choose from the set of products whose advertisements they see. Accordingly,

if a firm does not advertise it receives no sales because consumers are unaware of its existence.

Thus, advertising plays the social role of creating surplus enhancing matches. With respect to the

optimality of the equilibrium level of advertising, Grossman and Shapiro identify two conflicting

divergences between private and social incentives. On the one hand, firms under-advertise because

they do not capture all the surplus from the matches they create. On the other, they over-advertise

because they do not take into account the fact that some of their increased sales come at the

expense of competitors.

   Contrasting the analysis here with Grossman and Shapiro (1984) suggests at least three dif-

ferences between informative advertising in political and market competition. First, and most

fundamentally, voters see a list of all candidates at the time they vote and hence must be aware

of the existence of a candidate even if they have not seen this candidate’s advertisement. Thus,

if they do not know a candidate’s characteristics, they must form expectations of them at the

time of voting. These expectations determine the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising. For if

voters expect unadvertised candidates to have the attributes of advertised candidates, campaign

advertising will be ineﬀective. The necessity of solving for citizens’ beliefs concerning unadvertised

candidates is the major analytical challenge in studying advertising in the political context. A

second diﬀerence is that parties choose their candidates - they do not inherit fixed locations.10

Finally, since parties choose candidates and interest groups finance them, the actors choosing prod-

uct characteristics and those financing their advertising are diﬀerent. Moreover, interest groups

are concerned with the policy outcome and hence are concerned with votes only indirectly. These

diﬀerences not withstanding, analogies to the divergences between private and social incentives

leading to over and under advertising in the market context emerge from this analysis.

  10 This is a diﬀerence between the analysis in this paper and that in Grossman and Shapiro (1984). Obviously,

in reality, firms choose the type of their products as well.

3      The model
3.1    Basics

A community must elect a representative. Citizens diﬀer in their ideology which is measured on

a 0 to 1 scale. The population is divided into three groups: leftists, rightists, and moderates.

Leftists and rightists have ideologies d and 1 − d respectively, where d < 12 . Moderates come in

two types: left-leaning and right-leaning with ideologies x and 1 − x where x ∈ (d, 12 ). Moderates

make up a fraction γ of the community and the remaining 1 − γ are evenly divided between leftists

and rightists. The fraction of moderates who are left-leaning, denoted µ, is ex ante uncertain,

reflecting the fluid nature of moderate attitudes. Specifically, µ is the realization of a random

variable uniformly distributed on [0, 1].

    Candidates for community representative are put forward by two political parties: Party L,

comprised of leftists and Party R, comprised of rightists. Candidates are citizens and hence are

characterized by their ideologies. Each party can select either a “partisan” or a “moderate”

candidate. Specifically, Party L selects a candidate with ideology d or x and Party R chooses

one with ideology 1 − x or 1 − d. Decisions as to which type of candidate to select are made

to maximize the payoﬀ of the representative party member. At the time at which candidates

are selected, party members do not know the fraction of moderates who are left-leaning making

election outcomes uncertain.

    The payoﬀ enjoyed by a citizen with ideology i from having a leader of ideology i0 is given by

−β |i − i0 | where |i − i0 | is the distance from i to i0 and β > 0. It is assumed that x − d > 1 − 2x

which implies that moderates prefer a moderate candidate of the opposing ideology to a partisan

candidate of their own ideology. Thus, left-leaning moderates (for example) will prefer the ideology

of Party R’s candidate to that of Party L’s candidate if the former is a moderate and the latter

is a partisan.




                                                  8
    Moderates do not have perfect information about candidates, in the sense of not knowing

whether each party’s candidate is a partisan or a moderate. Such information could be acquired,

but moderates are not politically engaged and choose to remain “rationally ignorant”. However,

candidates can convey information concerning their characteristics via advertising. Moderates

cannot ignore such advertising since it is bundled with radio or television programming.

    Campaign advertising is governed by the following rules. First, candidates can only advertise

their own characteristics; i.e., whether they are moderate or partisan. This rules out negative

advertising.11       Second, candidates can only advertise the truth. The idea is that candidates

have records which reveal their ideologies and that candidates cannot lie about their records. The

advertising technology is such that if a candidate spends an amount C, his message reaches a
                     C
fraction λ(C) =     α+C   of the population, where α > 0.

    Candidates’ advertising is financed by campaign contributions provided by interest groups.

There are two interest groups - a leftist group that contributes to Party L’s candidate and a

rightist group that contributes to Party R’s. A fraction θ of partisans belong to each interest

group. The interest groups choose contribution levels to maximize the expected payoﬀ of their

members. They observe the type of their party’s candidate before making contributions, and

hence only give to moderate candidates. It is assumed, however, that they do not observe the

type of the opposing party’s candidate at the time of contributing.12

    Parties choose candidates anticipating the contributions they will receive and the impact of

these on voters’ choices. Each interest group observes its party’s choice and decides on its con-

  11 It would be possible to introduce negative advertising by allowing a candidate to inform voters that his

opponent is a partisan. Since this significantly complicates the model, I leave it for future work.
   12 This assumption is made to simplify the analysis. If interest groups know the type of the opposing party’s

candidate, they will contribute more to a candidate running against a partisan than a moderate. This is because the
benefit to them of electing their own party’s candidate is higher in the former case. This diﬀerence in contribution
levels means that seeing an advertisement for a candidate provides information to voters about the likely type of
his opponent. After all, a voter is more likely to see an advertisement for a candidate when he is running against a
partisan. While this eﬀect is interesting and it is perfectly possible to carry out the analysis taking it into account,
it is an additional wrinkle that complicates an already intricate analysis. Accordingly, the eﬀect is assumed away
here.



                                                           9
tribution. Partisans always vote for the candidate put forward by the party representing their

ideology. Moderates, having possibly observed one or both candidates’ advertisements, update

their beliefs about candidates’ types and vote. They may vote for either party’s candidate. To

smooth out behavior among the two types of moderates, they are assumed to vote probabilistically.

These behaviors are now described in greater detail.

3.2    Behavior of moderate voters

At the time of voting, each moderate voter may have seen advertisements from both, one, or

neither candidate. Let (IL , IR ) denote a moderate voter’s information where IK = 1 if he has

seen an advertisement from Party K’s candidate and IK = 0 if not. Let ρK (IL , IR ) denote his

belief that Party K’s candidate is moderate conditional on informational state (IL , IR ). Since only

moderate candidates advertise, both ρL (1, IR ) and ρR (IL , 1) must equal 1. The beliefs ρL (0, IR )

and ρR (IL , 0) will be derived as part of the equilibrium. Letting vK (J; IL , IR ) denote a moderate

voter of type K’s expected payoﬀ from Party J’s candidate being elected when the voter has

information (IL , IR ), we have that


                             vK (K; IL , IR ) = −(1 − ρK (IL , IR ))β(x − d),


and for J 6= K


               vK (J; IL , IR ) = −ρJ (IL , IR )β(1 − 2x) − (1 − ρJ (IL , IR ))β(1 − d − x).


   Following the literature on probabilistic voting, a moderate voter of type K in informational

state (IL , IR ) votes for Party L’s candidate if and only if vK (L; IL , IR ) + ε ≥ vK (R; IL , IR ) where

ε is the realization of a random variable with range [−ε, ε] (ε > 0) and symmetric cumulative

distribution function H(ε). The fraction of moderate voters of type K in informational state

(IL , IR ) voting for Party L’s candidate is therefore


                         ξK (IL , IR ) = 1 − H(vK (R; IL , IR ) − vK (L; IL , IR )),

                                                     10
where we adopt the convention that H(ε) = 0 for all ε ≤ −ε and H(ε) = 1 for all ε ≥ ε.

   It is assumed that ε is smaller than the minimum of β(1 − 2x) and β(3x − d − 1). This

implies that type K moderates who believe that Party K’s candidate is at least as likely to be

moderate as the opposing Party’s candidate will always vote for him. In particular, this means that

ξL (1, IR ) = 1 and ξR (IL , 1) = 0. In addition, the assumption implies that all type K moderates

who know that their party’s candidate is partisan and that the opposing candidate is moderate

will vote for the latter.

3.3    Election probabilities

Given this voting behavior, the probability that each party’s candidate will win may be computed.

Let CL and CR denote the contribution levels the two interest groups provide to moderate can-

didates. Then, if both candidates are moderates, the fraction of left-leaning moderates voting for

Party L’s candidate is


       δL (CL , CR ) = λ(CL ) + ξL (0, 1)(1 − λ(CL ))λ(CR ) + ξL (0, 0)(1 − λ(CL ))(1 − λ(CR )).


This includes all those who have seen the advertisement of Party L’s candidate; a fraction ξL (0, 1)

of those who have seen only the advertisement of Party R’s candidate; and a fraction ξL (0, 0) of

those who have seen neither candidate’s advertisement. The fraction of right-leaning moderates

voting for Party L’s candidate is


            δR (CL , CR ) = ξR (1, 0)(1 − λ(CR ))λ(CL ) + ξR (0, 0)(1 − λ(CR ))(1 − λ(CL )).


It includes a fraction ξR (1, 0) of those who have seen only the advertisement of Party L’s candidate;

and a fraction ξR (0, 0) of those who have seen neither candidate’s advertisement.

   The fraction of moderates voting for Party L’s candidate is µδL + (1 − µ)δR . Given the as-

sumption that partisans are equally split between rightists and leftists, Party L’s candidate will

win if this fraction exceeds 1/2 or, equivalently, if µ ≥ (1/2 − δR )/(δL − δR ). This implies that


                                                  11
the probability that Party L’s candidate wins is π(CL , CR ), where the probability of winning

function π is defined as follows: π(CL , CR ) = 0 if (1/2 − δR )/(δL − δR ) ≥ 1, π(CL , CR ) = 1 if

(1/2 − δR )/(δL − δR ) ≤ 0, and

                                     1/2 − δR (CL , CR )             δL (CL , CR ) − 1/2
             π(CL , CR ) = 1 −                                 =                               .
                                 δL (CL , CR ) − δR (CL , CR )   δL (CL , CR ) − δR (CL , CR )

otherwise.

   If only Party L’s candidate is a moderate, he wins with probability π(CL , 0). Similarly, if only

Party R’s candidate is a moderate, the probability that Party L’s candidate wins is π(0, CR ). If

both candidates are partisans, then no contributions are given and Party L’s candidate wins with

probability π(0, 0).

3.4    Interest group contributions

The contribution levels provided to moderate candidates by the two interest groups must be mutual

best responses given voter behavior. The interest groups do not observe the type of the opposing

party’s candidate when making their contributions and seek to maximize the expected payoﬀ of

their representative member. Thus, the leftist interest group’s contribution CL maximizes


               χR π(C, CR )β(1 − 2x) + (1 − χR )π(C, 0)β(1 − x − d) − 2C/(1 − γ)θ,


where χR is the probability it assigns to Party R selecting a moderate. Similarly, the rightist

interest group’s contribution CR maximizes


         χL (1 − π(CL , C))β(1 − 2x) + (1 − χL )(1 − π(0, C))β(1 − x − d) − 2C/(1 − γ)θ,


where χL is the probability it assigns to Party L selecting a moderate.

3.5    Candidate selection

Parties choose the type of candidate to run anticipating interest group contributions and voter

behavior. They seek to maximize the payoﬀ of their representative member, who is assumed not

                                                     12
to belong to the interest group.13          Let τK ∈ {M, P } denote the type of Party K’s candidate

and let UK (τL , τR ) denote the expected payoﬀ of a partisan of type K if the types of candidates

selected are (τL , τR ).14    We let σK denote the probability that Party K selects a moderate and

assume that (σL , σR ) are mutual best responses for the two parties.

3.6       Political equilibrium

A political equilibrium consists of (i) candidate selection strategies for the two parties (σL , σR )

describing the probability that each party selects a moderate; (ii) contribution levels for the

two interest groups (CL , CR ) describing the contributions they make to moderate candidates; (iii)

interest group beliefs (χR , χL ) describing the probabilities they assign to the opposing party having

chosen a moderate; (iv) voting behavior functions (ξL (IL , IR ), ξR (IL , IR )) describing moderates’

voting behavior as a function of the information they have received in the campaign; and (v)

voter belief functions (ρL (IL , IR ), ρR (IL , IR )) describing moderates’ beliefs concerning candidate

types as a function of the information they have. Candidate selection strategies must be mutual

best responses given subsequent interest group and voter behavior. Interest groups’ contribution

strategies must be mutual best responses given subsequent voter behavior and their beliefs. Voter

behavior must be consistent with their beliefs. Interest groups beliefs must be consistent with

parties strategies and voters’ beliefs must be consistent with the strategies of parties and interest

groups.

       The analysis will focus on political equilibria that are symmetric in the sense that the two

parties choose moderates with the same probability (i.e., σL = σR = σ); interest groups contribute

the same amount to their parties’ moderate candidates (i.e., CL = CR = C); moderates vote in

  13 If the representative party member also belonged to the interest group, parties would need to take into account

the cost of the contributions their candidates would receive.
  14Thus,
  UL (M, M) = π(CL , CR )β(1 − 2x) − β(1 − x − d),
and
  UR (M, M) = (1 − π(CL , CR ))β(1 − 2x) − β(1 − x − d),
and so on.



                                                        13
the same way (i.e., ξL (0, 0) = 1− ξR (0, 0) and ξL (0, 1) = 1− ξR (1, 0)); and moderates’ beliefs

about the two candidates are symmetric (i.e., ρL (0, 0) = ρR (0, 0) and ρL (0, 1) = ρR (1, 0)). In such

an equilibrium, moderates who have observed neither candidate’s advertisement are loyal to their

party’s candidate; i.e., ξL (0, 0) = 1− ξR (0, 0) = 1. Thus, letting ξ = ξR (1, 0) and ρ = ρL (0, 1), a

symmetric political equilibrium may be described by the vector (σ, C, ξ, ρ). There is no need to

include interest group beliefs in the description of equilibrium, since these are simply σ.

    The variable ξ represents the fraction of right-leaning (left-leaning) moderates who vote for

Party L’s candidate (Party R’s candidate) when they have only observed an advertisement from

this candidate. It measures the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising in inducing moderate voters

to switch from their natural allegiances. When ξ is high, voters are easily swayed and when ξ is

low, campaign advertising is ineﬀective. Together with the two interest groups’ contributions, ξ

determines the fractions of left and right-wing moderates voting for their party’s candidate. We

recognize this dependence by writing the probability of winning function as π(CL , CR ; ξ).

    Voters’ loyalty is determined by ρ - their beliefs concerning the probability that their party’s

candidate is moderate when they have only seen an advertisement from the opposing candidate.

Assuming that σ > 0 and C > 0, ρ is tied down by Bayes Rule. However, if σ = 0, then the event

of observing one candidate’s advertisement does not arise along the equilibrium path and ρ is not

tied down. Thus, there exist symmetric equilibria in which σ = 0 and ρ is large enough to make

ξ so small as to make campaign advertising ineﬀective. Since it seems unreasonable to suppose

that ρ is anything other than 0 when both parties are selecting partisans with probability one,

I focus only on symmetric equilibria which have the property that σ = 0 implies that ρ = 0.15

Henceforth, a symmetric equilibrium is understood to be an equilibrium satisfying this additional

requirement.

  15 For a more technical defense of this focus, note that equilibria in which σ = 0 and ρ > 0 do not satisfy the

requirement that there exist a sequence (σn , Cn )∞
                                                  n=1 such that (σn , Cn ) ∈ (0, 1) × (0, ∞) and limn→∞ (σn , Cn ) =
(σ, C) with the property that limn→∞ ρn = ρ where ρn are the beliefs implied by Bayes Rule given (σn , Cn ). Thus,
such equilibria are not sequential equilibria (Kreps and Wilson (1982)).


                                                        14
3.7     Welfare

For welfare analysis, the expected payoﬀs of the various types of citizens in a symmetric political

equilibrium need to be calculated. With probability σ 2 both parties select a moderate and with

probability 2σ(1 − σ) only one party selects a moderate. In the former case, both candidates

spend C on their campaigns and, in the latter, the moderate candidate spends C. Thus, expected

campaign spending is E = [2σ(1 − σ)C + σ 2 2C] = 2Cσ. Moreover, when there is only one

moderate, he wins with probability π(C, 0; ξ) and hence the probability that a moderate is elected

is σ 2 + 2σ(1 − σ)π(C, 0; ξ).

    Consider a leftist who is not an interest group member. Given symmetry, the elected candidate

is equally likely to be from either party. The expected payoﬀ of the leftist if the elected candidate

is a partisan is therefore −β(1 − 2d)/2. If, on the other hand, the elected candidate is a moderate

the payoﬀ of the leftist is −β[(x − d)/2 + (1 − x − d)/2] which again equals −β(1 − 2d)/2. Thus, the

leftist does not benefit from the elected candidate being more likely to be a moderate: the gain

from a lower chance of getting a rightist is just oﬀset by the loss from an reduced chance of getting

a leftist.16 Similar remarks apply to rightists who are not interest group members. Interest group

members finance campaign spending and hence obtain expected payoﬀs −β(1−2d)/2−E/(1−γ)θ.

    Now consider a representative moderate. From an ex-ante perspective, he will be left-leaning

with probability µ and right-leaning with probability 1−µ where µ is the realization of a uniformly

distributed random variable. Computing his payoﬀ is complicated by the correlation between

which party’s candidate wins and the likelihood that he is left or right-leaning. To illustrate,

suppose that both parties have selected moderates. If µ < 1/2 then the majority of moderates

are right-leaning and Party R’s candidate will win. Accordingly, the representative moderate’s

expected payoﬀ is −µβ(1 − 2x). If µ > 1/2 then Party L’s candidate wins and the representative

  16 This result does depend on the assumption that citizens have distance preferences. If instead, we assumed

that citizens had preferences of the form v(|i − i0 |) where v is decreasing and strictly concave, then the leftist would
benefit from the elected candidate being more likely to be moderate.


                                                           15
moderate’s expected payoﬀ is −(1 − µ)β(1 − 2x). Taking expectations over µ, the expected welfare

of a moderate when both parties select moderates is therefore
                      Z   1                    Z   1
                          2                                                     β(1 − 2x)
                  −           µβ(1 − 2x)dµ −           (1 − µ)β(1 − 2x)dµ = −             .
                      0                            1
                                                   2
                                                                                    4

The key point is that states in which the representative moderate is more likely to be left-leaning

are states in which Party L’s candidate will win. Indeed, ensuring that this is the case is the key

function of elections in this model.

    Pursuing this logic for the cases in which both parties select partisans and only one party

selects a moderate, the expected payoﬀ of a representative moderates can be shown to equal

WM (σ, π(C, 0; ξ)) where,

                      β(1 − 2x)              β(1 − x − d) 3β(x − d)
    WM (σ, π) = −σ2             − (1 − σ)2 (             +          )
                          4                       4            4
                                π                       1−π                1+π
                   −2σ(1 − σ){π[ β(1 − 2x)] + (1 − π)[      β(1 − x − d) +     β(x − d)]}.
                                2                        2                  2

The second and third terms are, respectively, the expected payoﬀs when parties select partisans

and only one party selects a moderate. A detailed derivation of them can be found in the Appendix.

    Aggregate expected welfare for the community is given by:


               W (σ, π(C, 0; ξ), E) = γWM (σ, π(C, 0; ξ)) − (1 − γ)β(1 − 2d)/2 − E.


Aggregate welfare depends on three key variables: the probability that parties select moderates,

the probability that a moderate defeats a partisan, and expected campaign spending.


4     Characterization of political equilibrium

In this section, the unique symmetric equilibrium is characterized. We first understand how much

the interest groups will contribute to candidates, taking as given the eﬀectiveness of campaign

advertising. Then, taking into account this contribution behavior, we examine how parties choose

candidates. Finally, we solve for voters’ behavior.

                                                          16
   The following assumption on the parameter values is maintained throughout the analysis.

                    βθ(1−γ)(1−x−d)
Assumption 1:             4α          > 1.

This assumption ensures that equilibrium involves positive levels of campaign contributions. With-

out it, interest groups do not find it worthwhile to contribute to moderate candidates. Accordingly,

parties experience no electoral advantage from selecting moderates and equilibrium involves both

parties choosing partisans.

4.1       Campaign contributions

Given σ and ξ, a contribution level C is a mutual best response for the two interest groups if and

only if


      C = arg max {σπ(CL , C; ξ)β(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ)π(CL , 0; ξ)β(1 − x − d) − 2CL /(1 − γ)θ}.
               CL ≥0

                                                                                                            1
Our assumptions imply that π(CL , C; ξ) is a concave function of CL when δL (CL , C) <                      2   <
                          ∂π(C,C;ξ)
δR (CL , C). Moreover,      ∂CL       is a decreasing function of C.17 These facts allow us to establish

the following result, the proof of which may be found in the Appendix.

Lemma 1 For all (σ, ξ) ∈ [0, 1]2 there exists a unique contribution level that is a mutual best

response for the two interest groups.

                                  b ξ). Obviously, if (σ, C, ξ, ρ) is an equilibrium then it
   We denote this unique level by C(σ,

                          b ξ). On the range of the parameter space in which contributions

are such that a moderate candidate defeats a partisan with a probability between                 2   and 1 (i.e.,

  b 0; ξ) ∈ ( 1 , 1)), interest groups give more if there is a higher probability that their party’s

interest group believes the other side will select a partisan for sure (σ = 0) and when campaign

advertising is maximally eﬀective (ξ = 1), then it gives an amount suﬃcient to ensure the victory

of its party’s candidate with probability one. This and the previous claims are established in the

Appendix.

4.2     Parties’ choice of candidates

When choosing the type of candidate to select, parties take as given voters’ behavior and the

contributions moderate candidates will attract from the interest groups. This behavior determines

the probability that each type of candidate will win. In a symmetric equilibrium, if both parties

choose the same type of candidate, each party’s candidate wins with equal probability. Thus, for

each Party K, UK (τ, τ ) = −β(1 − 2d)/2 for τ ∈ {M, P }. If one party chooses a moderate and the

other a partisan, the probability that the moderate wins is π(C, 0; ξ). Thus, the party running

the moderate obtains the payoﬀ


                    UL (M, P ) = UR (P, M ) = π(C, 0; ξ)β(1 − x − d) − β(1 − 2d),


and the party running the partisan obtains


                           UL (P, M ) = UR (M, P ) = −π(C, 0; ξ)β(1 − x − d).


   Irrespective of the type of candidate the opposing party runs, the gain from running a moderate

as opposed to a partisan is

                                                                                           β(1 − 2d)
      UL (M, τR ) − UL (P, τR ) = UR (τL , M ) − UR (τL , P ) = π(C, 0; ξ)β(1 − x − d) −             .
                                                                                               2

This “gain” is increasing in the probability that a moderate defeats a partisan. It is also negative
                    1
when π(C, 0; ξ) =   2   and positive when π(C, 0; ξ) = 1. Thus, letting

                                                    1 − 2d
                                          π∗ =                ,
                                                 2(1 − x − d)



                                                   18
running a moderate is a dominant strategy for each party if π(C, 0; ξ) exceeds π∗ , while running

a partisan is a dominant strategy for each party if π(C, 0; ξ) is less than π∗ . If π(C, 0; ξ) equals

π∗ , then each party is indiﬀerent between running a partisan and a moderate. It follows that, if

(σ, C, ξ, ρ) is a symmetric equilibrium, then σ = 0 if π(C, 0; ξ) is less than π∗ and σ = 1 if π(C, 0; ξ)

exceeds π ∗ .

4.3     Voter behavior

The next task is to understand, for given σ, how voters respond to advertising. Recall first that

the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising ξ is given by:


                           ξ = ξR (1, 0) = 1 − H(vR (R; 1, 0) − vR (L; 1, 0)).


It is the case that vR (R; 1, 0) = −(1 − ρ)β(x − d) and vR (L; 1, 0) = −β(1 − 2x) and hence the

above equation implies that ξ is related to voters’ beliefs about the probability an unadvertised

candidate is moderate ρ in the following way:


                               ξ = 1 − H(ρβ(x − d) − β(3x − 1 − d)).


Letting ρ = [β(3x−1−d)+ε]/β(x−d) and ρ = [β(3x−1−d)−ε]/β(x−d), our earlier assumptions

on the size of ε imply that campaign advertising is completely ineﬀective (ξ = 0) when ρ ≥ ρ and

maximally eﬀective (ξ = 1) when ρ ≤ ρ.

   Voters’ beliefs about unadvertised candidates must be consistent with the strategies of parties

and interest groups. Thus, assuming that σ > 0 and C > 0, Bayes Rule implies that voters’ beliefs

are given by
                                               σ[1 − λ(C)]
                                     ρ=                         .
                                          σ[1 − λ(C)] + (1 − σ)

Moreover, by assumption, if σ = 0, then ρ = 0. We can now establish that, in equilibrium, parties

must be indiﬀerent between running a moderate and a partisan.

Lemma 2 Let (σ, C, ξ, ρ) be a symmetric political equilibrium. Then, π(C, 0; ξ) = π ∗ .

                                                   19
   To understand this result, note that if moderates defeated partisans with a probability greater

than π ∗ then both parties would choose moderates. But then campaign advertising would be

completely ineﬀective because moderate voters would know that their party’s candidate was mod-

erate and hence would never switch their votes to the opposing party’s candidate. If advertising

was ineﬀective, interest groups would make no contributions and hence moderates would have no

advantage against partisans - a contradiction. If instead moderates defeated partisans with a prob-

ability less than π∗ , both parties would choose partisans. But then campaign advertising would

be fully eﬀective which implies that moderate candidates would receive suﬃcient contributions to

defeat partisans with probability one - a contradiction.

   Now define σ to be the highest probability with which parties may select moderates that is

consistent with parties receiving suﬃcient contributions to be indiﬀerent. Formally, σ = max{σ ∈

           b 1), 0; 1) ≥ π ∗ }. If σ < 1 and σ > σ, then interest groups will not contribute
[0, 1] : π(C(σ,

suﬃciently to moderate candidates to ensure that they defeat partisans with a probability π∗

even when campaign spending is maximally eﬀective. Thus, by Lemma 2, such a σ cannot be part

of a symmetric equilibrium. In the Appendix, it is demonstrated that

                                 [(2π ∗ − 1)2 + 1][β(1 − γ)θ(1 − x − d) − 4α]
                    σ = min{1,                                                }.
                                   β(1 − γ)θ[(1 − x − d)(2π ∗ − 1)2 + x − d]

Observe that σ will be close to 0 when the parameters are such that Assumption 1 only just holds.

                                b
   Next, for all σ ∈ [0, σ] let ξ(σ) solve the equation π(C(σ,                             b
                                                          b ξ), 0; ξ) = π ∗ . Intuitively, ξ(σ) is

the level of advertising eﬀectiveness that would induce interest groups to contribute an amount

suﬃcient to make a moderate candidate win with probability π ∗ against a partisan when they

expect the opposing party to choose a moderate with probability σ. Lemma 2 implies that if

                                                                 b
(σ, C, ξ, ρ) is a symmetric equilibrium, it must be the case ξ = ξ(σ), which determines voters’

behavior as a function of σ.

                         b
   Several properties of ξ(σ)                                                  b must be less
                                                              b 1), 0; 1) = 1, ξ(0)
                              should be noted. First, since π(C(0,


                                                 20
                             b is increasing on [0, σ] because the higher the probability the
than 1. Second, the function ξ(·)

opposing party selects a moderate the lower the incentive to contribute. Finally, if σ is less than

                       b
1, it is the case that ξ(σ) = 1.

4.4       Political equilibrium

At this point, we have established that if (σ, C, ξ, ρ) is a symmetric political equilibrium then the

                                        b
eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising is ξ(σ),                                             b
                                                                                     b ξ(σ)),
                                              the level of campaign contributions is C(σ,

and σ must belong to the interval [0, σ]. Moreover, the equilibrium belief that an unadvertised

                                                                      b
candidate is moderate must be such as to generate the voting behavior ξ(σ) and, since σ > 0,19

σ must be related to C and ρ via Bayes Rule. More formally, for any given value of ξ, let ρb(ξ) be

the set of voter beliefs that are consistent with such behavior.20 Then, it must be the case that

       b
ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(σ)) and that
                                                                 ρ
                                       σ=                                        .
                                                                   b
                                                              b ξ(σ))))

                                                                                   b
Conversely, if there exists σ ∈ (0, σ] with the property that there exists ρ0 ∈ ρb(ξ(σ)) such that the

above equation holds, then (σ, C(σ, b
                               b ξ(σ)), b
                                        ξ(σ), ρ0 ) is a symmetric equilibrium. These observations

allow us to establish the following result:

Proposition 1 There exists a unique symmetric political equilibrium. In this equilibrium, parties

select moderates with positive probability. Moderate candidates receive campaign contributions
                                                                                                      1
from interest groups that allow them to defeat partisans with a probability between                   2   and 1.

       In equilibrium, contributions finance the provision of information about candidates to voters

and increase the probability that the candidate who would be majority preferred if voters had

perfect information wins. They therefore help to produce outcomes closer to those that would

arise under perfect information. Moreover, the fact that candidates may receive contributions

  19   We can rule out the possibility that σ = 0, since that implies (by assumption) that ρ = 0 and this belief cannot
generate the voting behavior ξb(0) since ξb(0) is less than 1.
  20             b(ξ) = {ρ ∈ [0, 1] : ξ = 1 − H(ρβ(x − d) − β(3x − 1 − d))}.
       Formally, ρ

provides parties with an incentive to select candidates with characteristics that the majority of

voters want. Thus the model provides a framework in which campaign contributions play the role

that they are commonly understood to play.

      Depending on the parameter values, the equilibrium is either interior or boundary. In an

interior equilibrium, parties select moderates with a probability σ less than σ and campaign

advertising is less than fully eﬀective (ξ < 1). In such an equilibrium, the level of campaign

spending exceeds α(2π∗ −1). In a boundary equilibrium, parties select moderates with probability

σ, campaign advertising is maximally eﬀective (ξ = 1), and campaign spending equals α(2π ∗ − 1).

The equilibrium will be a boundary equilibrium if σ < ρ2π∗ /[ρ2π∗ + 1 − ρ].21 Since ρ > 0,

equilibrium will be of the boundary variety when the parameters are such that Assumption 1 is

only just satisfied.

4.5      Is there too much campaign spending in equilibrium?

In popular debate concerning campaign finance reform in the United States, the question of

whether there is too much or too little money spent on campaigns is often raised. Our model

suggests one way of thinking about this rather nebulous question. Let (σ ∗ , C ∗ , ξ ∗ , ρ∗ ) be the

symmetric equilibrium. Given the behavior of parties and voters as described by σ ∗ and ξ ∗ , the

contribution level that maximizes aggregate welfare is C o = arg max W (σ ∗ , π(C, 0, ξ ∗ ), 2σ ∗ C). If

C ∗ is less than C o , there is a natural sense in which contributions are underprovided. For if

interest groups were to give a little more, then, holding constant the behavior of parties and

voters, aggregate welfare would increase. It should be stressed that underprovision according to

this definition has no obvious implications for policy. For any policy eﬀort to increase interest

groups’ contributions will alter the behavior of parties and voters. Nonetheless, the definition

 21   This follows from the proof of Proposition 1. Using the notation introduced in the proof, we know that
ξb(σ) = 1, f (0) = ρ and C(σ,
                         b 0) = α(2π∗ − 1) if σ < 1. It is now straightforward to verify that ϕ(σ) ≥ 0 if and only
if the above inequality is satisfied.

facilitates a clear understanding of the (first order) divergences between the private and social

incentives to contribute.

    The optimal level (assuming it is positive) satisfies the first order condition:

                                      ∂WM (σ ∗ , π(C o , 0; ξ ∗ )) ∂π(C o , 0; ξ ∗ )
                                  γ                                                  = 2σ∗ .
                                                ∂π                    ∂CL

Computing the derivative ∂WM /∂π, we obtain

                                ∂π(C o , 0; ξ ∗ )
              2σ ∗ (1 − σ ∗ )                     γ{β(1 − x − d) − 2π(C o , 0; ξ ∗ )β(1 − 2x)} = 2σ ∗ .
                                   ∂CL

The left hand side represents the social marginal benefit of contributions which is that they raise

the probability that a moderate defeats a partisan. This raises the expected aggregate welfare of
                                   1−x−d
moderates, assuming that           2(1−2x)    > π(·).22      The right hand side represents the social marginal

cost which is the increase in expected expenditures. The equilibrium level of contributions, on the

other hand, satisfies the first order condition:

                 ∂π(C ∗ , C ∗ ; ξ ∗ )                        ∂π(C ∗ , 0; ξ ∗ )                    2
            σ∗                        β(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ ∗ )                   β(1 − x − d) =          .
                     ∂CL                                        ∂CL                           (1 − γ)θ

The left hand side represents the private marginal benefit of contributions to an interest group

member and the right hand side represents the private marginal cost.

    These expressions reveal two sources of diﬀerences between the private and social incentives to

contribute. First, from a social perspective campaign contributions are only useful when moderates

are running against partisans. Thus, if the probability of such races is low because both parties

are very likely to pick moderates then the social marginal benefit of contributions will be small or

  22 It is interesting to note that if x < (1 + d)/3 then 1−x−d < 1 so it is possible that π could be so high that
                                                           2(1−2x)
raising the probability that a moderate defeats a partisan may actually be harmful to moderates. To understand
this, note that there are three eﬀects of raising π on the expected payoﬀ of a representative moderate. The first is
to increase the likelihood that when a moderate runs against a partisan, the moderate wins. This eﬀect is positive,
because moderates receive a higher expected payoﬀ when a moderate is elected. The second eﬀect is to decrease the
size of the expected payoﬀ arising when a moderate wins. This occurs because raising π increases the likelihood that
the representative moderate will end up with a moderate candidate of the opposing ideology. The third eﬀect is to
increase the expected payoﬀ arising when a partisan wins. Raising π increases the likelihood that the representative
moderate will be on the same side as the partisan. The overall eﬀect is negative when the second eﬀect dominates
the first and third.


                                                              23
zero. By contrast, interest groups still have an incentive to contribute even if they know that the

opposing party is very likely to select a moderate. This reflects the purely distributional incentive

that they would prefer the moderate on their side of the ideological fence to win. Second, even

when moderate versus partisan races are likely, the private incentives to contribute do not match

up with the social incentives. The former reflect the fraction of interest group members and the

gains to these citizens from having a moderate from their own side as opposed to a partisan from

the other. The latter reflect the fraction of moderates in the population and the gain to them of

raising the probability that a moderate defeats a partisan.

       These divergences mean that contributions can be over or under-provided according to our

definition.23       Overprovision arises when the probability that parties select moderates is high.

In this case, campaign contributions have no direct social benefit and are purely wasteful rent

seeking in the sense of Tullock (1980).24 Underprovision arises when parties select partisans with

a significant probability and the fraction of interest group members (1 − γ)θ/2 is small relative to

the fraction of moderates γ. In this case, campaign contributions have a significant social benefit

but this is not internalized by interest group members who care only about their own (purely

redistributive) benefit.

       As noted in Section 2, the possibility of both over and underprovision of advertising also arises

in markets with diﬀerentiated products. The fact that the benefits firms obtain from advertising

come partially at the expense of their competitors corresponds to the purely redistributive nature

of the benefits interest groups get from financing political advertising. Moreover, the fact that

firms do not take into account the surplus their advertising creates for consumers is similar to

  23   Specific numerical examples are available from the author on request.
   24 See Congelton (1986) for an interesting discussion of political advertising as rent-seeking. He observes that

political advertising has rent-seeking aspects since it involves competition for a distributional gain. However, in
contrast to standard rent-seeking, it has the spillover benefit of providing valuable information to voters. Thus, it
is not clear that it produces rent-seeking losses of the usual form. Our analysis provides a concrete way of thinking
about the informational benefits and sheds light on the circumstances under which they will be large or small
relative to the rent-seeking losses.

interest groups not taking into account the benefits of their activities to moderate voters.


5     The impact of contribution limits

We now consider a policy that puts an upper limit on the contributions that interest groups can

make. We investigate the impact that such a limit will have on equilibrium and when limits will

enhance aggregate welfare. The limit will be denoted by L. Obviously, to have any impact, L must

be less than the laissez-faire level of campaign contributions and this is assumed in the sequel.

5.1    Equilibrium with contribution limits

If the contribution limit is suﬃciently small so that π(L, 0; 1) < π ∗ , then, no matter how eﬀective

campaign advertising is, both parties will select partisans. The probability of a moderate defeating

a partisan is simply insuﬃcient to induce parties to select one. In such circumstances, equilib-

rium involves both parties selecting partisans. Noting that the condition that π(L, 0; 1) < π∗ is

equivalent to L < α[2π∗ − 1], yields:

Proposition 2 Suppose that the contribution limit L is less than α[2π ∗ − 1]. Then, there exists

a unique symmetric political equilibrium. In this equilibrium, parties select partisans and expected

campaign spending is zero.

    A contribution limit less than this critical value eﬀectively eliminates all campaign spending.

Even though moderate candidates would attract contributions, parties do not select moderates

because the electoral advantages from so doing are not suﬃcient to compensate for the compromise

in ideology. Hence no campaign spending arises in equilibrium. It follows from this proposition

that if the laissez-faire equilibrium is a boundary equilibrium so that C = α[2π ∗ − 1], then even

a very small contribution limit will completely eliminate campaign spending.

    If the contribution limit is such that π(L, 0; 1) ≥ π∗ , equilibrium has a similar structure to the

laissez-faire. In particular, as the following result shows, the probability that a moderate defeats



                                                  25
a partisan must be the same as in the laissez-faire.

Lemma 3 Suppose that the contribution limit L is at least as big as α[2π ∗ − 1] and let (σ, C, ξ, ρ)

be a symmetric political equilibrium. Then, C = L and ξ solves the equation π(L, 0; ξ) = π∗ .

Thus, if the contribution limit is large enough, equilibrium still has the property that parties

are indiﬀerent between selecting moderate and partisan candidates. The equation π(L, 0; ξ) =

                         e
π∗ has a unique solution ξ(L)                                      e
                              = (L + α)(2π∗ − 1)/2Lπ ∗ . Note that ξ(L) is decreasing, implying

that stricter contribution limits increase the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising. Campaign

advertising must be more eﬀective if the probability of a partisan defeating a moderate candidate

remains the same.

   The equilibrium belief that an unadvertised candidate is moderate must be such as to generate

                    e
the voting behavior ξ(L),                           e
                          which implies that ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(L)). If σ > 0, then σ is related to ρ by the

familiar equation
                                                    ρ
                                     σ=                         .
                                          ρ + (1 − ρ)(1 − λ(L))
                               e
If σ = 0, then ρ = 0 and hence ξ(L) = 1. This requires that L = α(2π ∗ −1). With this background,

we are now able to establish:

Proposition 3 If the contribution limit L is bigger than α[2π ∗ −1] there exists a unique symmetric

political equilibrium, while if the limit L is exactly α[2π ∗ − 1] there are multiple symmetric equilib-

ria. In either case, imposing the limit does not change the probability that a moderate candidate

defeats a partisan. However, the limit reduces both the probability that parties select moderates

and expected campaign spending. The smaller the limit, the larger are these reductions.

   To sum up, contribution limits that are at least as big as α[2π ∗ − 1] do not impact the prob-

ability a moderate defeats a partisan. Rather, they reduce the probability that parties select

moderates. Intuitively, because limits reduce campaign advertising but do not impact the proba-

bility a moderate defeats a partisan, the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising must increase. The

                                                  26
only way this can happen is that voters believe that unadvertised candidates are less likely to be

moderates. This in turn requires that parties select moderates with a lower probability.

5.2      Contribution limits and welfare

The distributive consequences of contribution limits are clear from Propositions 2 and 3. Mod-

erates are made worse oﬀ because the probability of parties selecting moderates is reduced.25

Leftists and rightists who do not belong to interest groups are unaﬀected, while interest group

members are actually made better oﬀ because they spend less of their resources on campaign

contributions. Thus imposing contribution limits redistributes from moderates to interest group

members.

      Less clear is the aggregate welfare impact of contribution limits. Are the gains to interest group

members more than oﬀset by the losses to moderates? To investigate this, let (σ ∗ , C ∗ , ξ ∗ , ρ∗ )

denote the laissez-faire equilibrium and let (σ ∗ (L), C ∗ (L), ξ ∗ (L), ρ∗ (L)) denote the equilibrium

with contribution limit L.26 Similarly, let E ∗ denote expected campaign spending in the laissez-

faire and E ∗ (L) spending with limit L. We are interested in comparing W (σ ∗ , π(C ∗ , 0, ξ ∗ ), E ∗ )

and W (σ∗ (L), π(C ∗ (L), 0, ξ ∗ (L)), E ∗ (L)). Matters are simplified by noting that if L is bigger than

α[2π ∗ − 1] imposing the limit has no impact on the probability that moderates defeat partisans.

Moreover, if L is smaller than α[2π ∗ − 1] then, parties never select moderates and hence the

probability that a moderate defeats a partisan is irrelevant. Thus, for analytical purposes, we

may assume that the limit leaves unchanged the probability a moderate defeats a partisan and

only impacts the probability that parties select moderates and expected campaign spending. This

permits a diagrammatic analysis.

      Such an analysis is presented in Figure 1 under the assumption that the laissez-faire is an

interior equilibrium. The horizontal axis measures expected campaign spending and the vertical

 25   It is readily verified that WM (σ, π(C, 0; ξ)) is increasing in σ.
 26   If L = α(2π ∗ − 1), let (σ∗ (L), C ∗ (L), ξ ∗ (L), ρ∗ (L)) be any one of the multiple possible equilibria.

axis measures the probability that parties select a moderate. The family of indiﬀerence curves

represent social preferences over diﬀerent (E, σ) combinations. These indiﬀerence curves are up-

ward sloping, convex, and parallel to each other.27 Since the social ideal would be to have parties

select moderates for sure and no campaign spending, moving to the left yields higher levels of

welfare.

      The laissez-faire outcome is represented by the point (E ∗ , σ ∗ ). Introducing a limit lowers both

the probability that parties select moderates and expected campaign spending. The curve joining

                             b σ
the points (E ∗ , σ ∗ ) and (E, b) is obtained by successively reducing the limit from C ∗ to α(2π ∗ − 1)

and tracing out the points (E ∗ (L), σ∗ (L)). When the limit reaches α[2π ∗ − 1], there are multiple

                                                                                     b σ
(E, σ) combinations that are possible equilibria. The highest of these is the point (E, b) and

the lowest is (0, 0).28       The remaining possible equilibrium combinations lie on a straight line

            b σ
connecting (E, b) and (0, 0).29            The slope of this line can be shown to be larger than the slope

                                                  b σ
of the curve joining the points (E ∗ , σ ∗ ) and (E,                  b σ
                                                     b) at the point (E, b). Reducing the limit below

α(2π ∗ − 1) yields the point (0, 0). The curve joining (0, 0) to (E ∗ , σ ∗ ) therefore represents the

locus of possibilities that society might achieve with contribution limits.

      To determine whether introducing a particular limit L increases or decreases social welfare, we

need to locate the point on the possibility locus that the limit generates and see if this point lies

on a higher social indiﬀerence curve than the laissez-faire outcome. In Figure 1, social indiﬀerence

curves are suﬃciently flat so that any contribution limit puts society on a lower social indiﬀerence

curve and hence reduces aggregate welfare. Obviously, this is not the only possibility.

      Figure 1 assumes that the laissez-faire equilibrium is interior. If it is a boundary equilibrium,

                                                                         b σ
the laissez-faire outcome (E ∗ , σ ∗ ) must lie on the curve connecting (E, b) and (0, 0). In this case,

society’s possibility locus just consists of the points (E ∗ , σ∗ ) and (0, 0) and the question of the

desirability of contribution limits is very simple.

      We can now use this diagrammatic apparatus to understand the following proposition:

                                    4α[θ(x−d)+1−2x]                                  4α
Proposition 4: (i) If β >           θ(1−2x)(1−x−d)     there exists γ < 1 −      βθ(1−x−d)   such that for all
                  4α
γ ∈ (γ, 1 −   βθ(1−x−d) ),   imposing any contribution limit would reduce aggregate welfare. (ii) There

exists γ > 0, such that for all γ ∈ (0, γ), there exists a welfare enhancing contribution limit.

Part (i) provides a condition on β under which imposing contribution limits is always welfare

reducing if the fraction of moderates is suﬃciently large. Part (ii) says that if moderates make

up a suﬃciently small fraction of the population, then there will exist contribution limits that

would improve welfare. The latter result is easy to understand once one realizes that the social

indiﬀerence curves become steeper and steeper as the fraction of moderates goes to zero. To

understand part (i), note that as we increase the fraction of moderates, the size of the interest

groups decreases and hence the generosity of contributions decreases. Eventually, the laissez-faire

equilibrium becomes a boundary equilibrium. Accordingly, the laissez-faire outcome must lie on

                     b σ
the line connecting (E, b) and (0, 0) and any contribution limit must move society to the point

                                                    b σ
(0, 0). Under the stated condition on β, the point (E, b) must lie on a higher social indiﬀerence

curve than (0, 0) for suﬃciently large values of γ in the admissible range.30 By the convexity of

the indiﬀerence curves, any point (E, σ) lying on the line is also socially preferred to (0, 0) and

hence the result.

      Proposition 4 suggests the possibility of a stronger result which says that, under the condition

on β, contribution limits are desirable if and only if the fraction of moderates is below some critical

                                                                                             b σ
level. This is indeed the case if, for all γ, the curve joining the points (E ∗ , σ ∗ ) and (E, b) in Figure

 30   The admissible range consists of those values consistent with Assumption 1 holding.

not appear to be true in general. Since, in principle, it is possible for the result not to hold in the

presence of non-concavities, Proposition 4 appears the best general result available.


6        Conclusion

This paper has developed a model of political competition with campaign contributions and infor-

mative advertising. In equilibrium, contributions finance the provision of information about can-

didates to voters and increase the probability that the candidate who would be majority preferred

were voters perfectly information wins. Contributions therefore help to produce more informed

choices. Moreover, the existence of campaign contributions provides parties with an incentive to

select candidates with characteristics that the majority of voters want. Thus the model provides a

framework in which campaign contributions play the role they are commonly understood to play

in reality.

     The model facilitates analysis of the often raised question of whether there is too much or

too little spending on campaigns. Taking as given parties’ candidate selection strategies and the

eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising, one can ask whether aggregate welfare would be higher if

interest groups provided more or less money to candidates. In general, equilibrium spending levels

   31 To see this, let W (σ, π ∗ , E; γ) denote the aggregate welfare function and C ∗ (γ) the laissez-faire level of cam-

paign spending when the fraction of moderates is γ. Similarly, let (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) denote the probability that parties
select moderates and expected campaign spending in the laissez-faire and (E ∗ (L; γ), σ ∗ (L; γ)) these variables with
limit L. We need to show that if for some b                      γ there exists L       b < C ∗ (b  γ ) such that W (σ∗ (b     γ ), π ∗ , E ∗ (b
                                                                                                                                               γ ); bγ ) is smaller
than W (σ (L; b
              ∗  b   γ ), π , E (L; b
                           ∗      ∗  b  γ ); b
                                             γ ) then, if γ < b
                                                              0     γ , there exists some L < C (γ ) such that W (σ ∗ (γ 0 ), π∗ , E ∗ (γ 0 ); γ 0 )
                                                                                                      0      ∗ 0

is smaller than W (σ∗ (L0 ; γ 0 ), π ∗ , E ∗ (L0 ; γ 0 ); γ 0 ). Interest groups are bigger when γ is lower which leads to more
contributions and hence a higher probability of electing moderates and higher campaign expenditures. Thus,
(E ∗ (γ 0 ), σ∗ (γ 0 )) lies to the northeast of the point (E ∗ (b                   γ ), σ∗ (bγ )). Note also that the equilibrium with contri-
bution limits is independent of γ provided that L < C ∗ (γ). This means that (E,                                        bb σ) is independent of γ, and
that the curve connecting (E ∗ (γ 0 ), σ∗ (γ 0 )) to (E,               bb   σ) coincides with that connecting (E ∗ (b               γ ), σ∗ (bγ )) to (E,  bbσ) for
limits L less than or equal to C ∗ (b               γ ). Since W (σ∗ (b       γ ), π ∗ , E ∗ (b

                                                                                                                                               γ ). If the curve
connecting (E ∗ (γ 0 ), σ∗ (γ 0 )) to (E,         bb σ) is concave it is easy to see diagrammatically that this must imply that
W (σ ∗ (γ 0 ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ 0 ); b
                                 γ ) is smaller than W (σ ∗ (L             b; γ 0 ), π∗ , E ∗ (L
                                                                                               b; γ 0 ); b

are flatter when the fraction of moderates is γ 0 , this implies that W (σ ∗ (γ 0 ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ 0 ); γ 0 ) is smaller than
W (σ ∗ (L∗ ; γ 0 ), π ∗ , E ∗ (L∗ ; γ 0 ); γ 0 ).




                                                                                 30
may be too low or too high because of the divergences between the private incentives of interest

groups to contribute and the social benefits of such contributions. Overprovision arises when

parties are highly likely to select moderates, in which case campaign contributions have no social

benefit. Underprovision arises when parties are more likely to select partisans and interest group

membership is small relative to the number of moderates. In this case, campaign contributions

have a social benefit that dwarfs the purely distributional benefits accruing to interest group

members.

   While the question of too much or too little spending is an interesting one, the model makes

clear that any change in the regulation of campaign contributions is likely to impact not only

contribution levels but also parties’ candidate selection strategies and the eﬀectiveness of campaign

advertising. Contribution limits were shown to reduce the likelihood that parties select moderates

and raise the eﬀectiveness of campaign spending. The impact of limits on citizens’ welfare is

redistributive. Moderate voters are made worse oﬀ. Partisans who do not belong to interest

groups are unaﬀected because the increase in the likelihood of electing a partisan of their own

ideology is oﬀset by the increase in the probability of electing a partisan of the opposing ideology.

Partisans who are interest group members are actually made better oﬀ because they spend less of

their resources on campaign contributions. The question of whether the gains to interest group

members oﬀset the losses to moderate voters turns on the fraction of the latter in the population.

Contribution limits are always desirable from an aggregate viewpoint when only a small fraction

of the population are moderates, while limits will tend to be harmful when moderates dominate.

   This paper represents only a small step in developing an understanding of campaign finance and

its regulation. Nonetheless, the framework could readily be extended to shed further light. One

useful extension would be to introduce asymmetries in the power of the interest groups supporting

the two parties. This could be done by assuming either that a larger fraction of partisans were

interest group members on one side or, perhaps more realistically, that partisans on one side had


                                                 31
greater wealth and hence a higher willingness to contribute. It would be interesting to understand

how such asymmetries might influence candidate selection and bias election outcomes. In this

context, the familiar argument that limits “level the political playing field” could be scrutinized.

   Much of the demand for campaign finance reform is motivated by the belief that giving by big

donors is service induced. One could introduce service induced contributions into the framework

by assuming that candidates could approach interest groups and oﬀer to provide policy favors in

exchange for contributions. Then, seeing advertising would lead voters to increase their estimates

that a candidate would enact special interest legislation when elected and hence dampen the

eﬀectiveness of campaign spending. Contribution limits might then impact the amount of policy

favors provided by reducing the incentives for candidates to solicit contributions. This in turn

may have interesting implications for the eﬀectiveness of campaign advertising.

   Finally, there are many interesting questions concerning the allocation of campaign resources

across diﬀerent uses (see also Schultz (2001)). One could, for example, analyze the welfare impli-

cations of negative advertising by allowing candidates to provide information to voters about their

opponents’ records. In the model of this paper, this would provide a reason for contributing to

partisan candidates. Alternatively one could introduce another dimension of diﬀerence between

candidates (such as competence) and study candidates’ decisions as to which characteristic to

campaign on.

Derivation of the Expected Payoﬀ of the Representative Moderate: It was shown in

the text that when both parties select moderates, a representative moderate’s expected payoﬀ

is −β(1 − 2x)/4. Suppose now that both parties select partisans. When µ < 1/2, Party R’s

candidate wins. The representative moderate’s expected payoﬀ is therefore −µβ(1 − x − d) − (1 −

µ)β(x − d). If µ > 1/2, Party L’s candidate wins and the representative moderate’s expected

payoﬀ is −µβ(x − d) − (1 − µ)β(1 − x − d). Taking expectations over the realization of µ, the

expected payoﬀ of the representative moderate is:
           Z   1                                                       Z       1
                                                                               2
       −           [µβ(x − d) + (1 − µ)β(1 − x − d)]dµ −                           [µβ(1 − x − d) + (1 − µ)β(x − d)]dµ.
               1
               2                                                           0

This equals
                                                  β(1 − x − d) 3β(x − d)
                                             −(               +          ).
                                                       4           4

    Next, suppose that one party has selected a moderate and the other a partisan. For concrete-

ness, suppose that Party L has selected a moderate. Party R’s candidate will win if µ is less
         1/2−δR (C,0)
than   δL (C,0)−δR (C,0) .        The representative moderate’s expected payoﬀ is then −µβ(1 − x − d) −
                                           1/2−δR (C,0)
(1 − µ)β(x − d). If µ exceeds            δL (C,0)−δR (C,0) ,   Party L’s candidate will win and the representative

moderate’s expected payoﬀ is −(1 − µ)β(1 − 2x). Thus, the expected payoﬀ of the representative

moderate is:
                   Z   1                                 Z    1/2−δR
                                                              δL −δR
               −                (1 − µ)β(1 − 2x)dµ −                   [µβ(1 − x − d) + (1 − µ)β(x − d)]dµ.
                       1/2−δR

                                                    1/2−δR (C,0)
Using the fact that π(C, 0; ξ) = 1 −              δL (C,0)−δR (C,0) ,      we can write this as

                   π(C, 0; ξ)                          1 − π(C, 0; ξ)           1 + π(C, 0; ξ)
−π(C, 0; ξ)[                  β(1−2x)]−(1−π(C, 0; ξ))[                β(1−x−d)+                β(x−d)].

Noting that the probabilities that (i) both parties select moderates, (ii) both parties select par-

tisans, and (iii) only one party selects a moderate are, respectively, σ 2 , (1 − σ)2 , and 2σ(1 − σ)

yields the welfare expression given in the text.

      f (CL , C) = σπ(CL , C; ξ)β(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ)π(CL , 0; ξ)β(1 − x − d) − 2CL /θ(1 − γ).


Then, we must show that there exists a unique C such that C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C).

   The first step is to compute the probability of winning function. Using the functional form for

λ, we obtain
                                              CL (α + CR ) + α((1 − ξ)CR + α)
                            δL (CL , CR ) =                                   ,
                                                     (α + CL )(α + CR )

and
                                                            ξαCL
                                    δR (CL , CR ) =                      .
                                                      (α + CL )(α + CR )
                            1                         α[CR (2ξ−1)−α]                              1
Note that δL (CL , CR ) <   2   if and only if CL <       α+CR         and that δR (CL , CR ) >   2   if and only
                                                                                              α[CR (2ξ−1)−α]
if CL [α(2ξ − 1) − CR ] > α(α + CR ). Thus, we have that π(CL , CR ; ξ) = 0 if CL <               α+CR       ;

π(CL , CR ; ξ) = 1 if CL [α(2ξ − 1) − CR ] > α(α + CR ) and

                                          CL (α + CR )/2 + α(1/2 − ξ)CR + α2 /2
                       π(CL , CR ; ξ) =                                         ,
                                          CL (α(1 − ξ) + CR ) + α(1 − ξ)CR + α2

function over this range.

   It will be useful to define the following functions:

                CL (α + C)/2 + α(1/2 − ξ)C + α2 /2                   CL + α
h(CL , C) = σ                                      β(1−2x)+(1−σ)                   β(1−x−d)−2CL /θ(1−γ),
                CL (α(1 − ξ) + C) + α(1 − ξ)C + α2               2(CL (1 − ξ) + α)

and

                CL (α + C)/2 + α(1/2 − ξ)C + α2 /2
g(CL , C) = σ                                      β(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ)β(1 − x − d) − 2CL /θ(1 − γ).
                CL (α(1 − ξ) + C) + α(1 − ξ)C + α2

                                                       36
Note that, for all C, h(·, C) and g(·, C) are concave and continuously diﬀerentiable functions.
                                                  ∂h(CL ,C)       ∂g(CL ,C)
Moreover, their derivatives are such that           ∂CL       >     ∂CL     .
                                  1
   Suppose first that ξ ≤         2.   Then, for all (CL , CR ) it is clear that it must be the case that
                     1
δR (CL , CR ) <      2   < δL (CL , CR ). This implies that f (CL , C) = h(CL , C). It follows from the
                                                                                                 ∂h(C,C)
properties of the function h(·, C) that C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C) if and only if                 ∂CL     ≤ 0 with

equality if C > 0. Thus, we need to show that there exists a unique C ≥ 0 with this property.

Diﬀerentiating, we obtain

             ∂h(C, C)         σξαβ(1 − 2x)       (1 − σ)ξαβ(1 − x − d)       2
                      =                  2  2
                                               +                    2
                                                                       −          .
               ∂CL      2(2(1 − ξ)αC + C + α )      2((1 − ξ)C + α)      θ(1 − γ)

                                  ∂h(C,C)
Viewed as a function of C,          ∂CL     is continuous, decreasing, and negative for C suﬃciently large.
           ∂h(0,0)                                                                                  ∂h(C,C)
Thus, if    ∂CL      ≤ 0, C = 0 has the desired property. Otherwise, the C at which                   ∂CL     = 0 is

the unique C with the desired property.

   Now suppose that ξ > 12 . Then, letting fb(CL , C) = min{h(CL , C), g(CL , C)}, we have that:

                                                          α[C(2ξ − 1) − α]
f (CL , C) = −2CL /θ(1 − γ) if CL < max{0,                                 },
                                                              α+C

f (CL , C) = σβ(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ)β(1 − x − d) − 2CL /θ(1 − γ) if CL [α(2ξ − 1) − C] > α(α + C),

f (CL , C) = fb(CL , C) otherwise.


We now have:

Claim: C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C) if and only if C = arg maxCL ≥0 fb(CL , C) and fb(C, C) ≥ 0.

Proof of Claim: Let C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C). If C ≤                       α
                                                                            2ξ−1   then f (CL , C) = fb(CL , C) for

all CL ≥ 0 and hence it is immediate that C = arg maxCL ≥0 fb(CL , C). Moreover, fb(C, C) ≥

fb(0, C) ≥ 0.

   If C >    1−2ξ    then since it must be the case that C >            α+C          and C <   α(2ξ−1)−C   we know

that f (C, C) = fb(C, C). Let C
                              eL = arg maxC ≥0 fb(CL , C). It is the case that fb(CL , C) = h(CL , C)

                                                                              ∂CL       is negative for suﬃciently


                                                        37
           eL exists. If C
large CL , C             eL =                eL <
                            6 C, then either C                      α[C(2ξ−1)−α]      eL >
                                                                                   or C        α(α+C)
                                                                        α+C                   α(2ξ−1)−C .   In the former

case, we must have that fb(C, C) < fb(C
                                      eL , C) = h(C
                                                  eL , C) ≤ f (C

In the latter case, we must have that fb( α(2ξ−1)−C
                                           α(α+C)
                                                    , C) > fb(CL , C) for all CL <                        α(α+C)
                                                                                                         α(2ξ−1)−C .      This
                          α(α+C)                                                       α(α+C)
in turn implies that f ( α(2ξ−1)−C , C) > f (CL , C) for all CL 6=                    α(2ξ−1)−C     which implies that

C=       α(α+C)
        α(2ξ−1)−C    - a contradiction. Finally, note that fb(C, C) = f (C, C) ≥ f (0, C) ≥ 0.

   Now let C = arg maxCL ≥0 fb(CL , C) and fb(C, C) ≥ 0. If C ≤                        α
                                                                                     2ξ−1   then f (CL , C) = fb(CL , C)
                                                                                                              α
for all CL ≥ 0 and hence it is immediate that C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C). If C >                           2ξ−1   then for

all CL <     α[C(2ξ−1)−α]
                 α+C      ,     we have that f (CL , C) ≤ 0 ≤ fb(C, C). Moreover, for all CL >                     α(α+C)
                                                                                                                  α(2ξ−1)−C

we have that f (CL , C) ≤ fb( α(2ξ−1)−C
                               α(α+C)
                                        , C) ≤ fb(C, C). Thus, C = arg maxCL ≥0 f (CL , C). QED

   Notice that fb(·, C) as the minimum of two concave functions is itself concave. It follows that

C = arg maxCL ≥0 fb(CL , C) if and only if fb has a subgradient φ at C such that φ(CL − C) ≤ 0 for

all CL ≥ 0 (see, for example, Theorem 3.4.3 of Bazaraa and Shetty (1979)). Thus, by the Claim,

it suﬃces to establish that there exists a unique C at which there is a subgradient with the desired

property and that this C also satisfies the inequality fb(C, C) ≥ 0.

   Note first that fb(CL , C) = h(CL , C) if CL ≤                     α
                                                                    2ξ−1   and fb(CL , C) = g(CL , C) if CL >            α
                                                                                                                       2ξ−1 .

It follows that the subgradient of fb(·, C) at any CL is the derivative                     ∂h(CL ,C)
                                                                                              ∂CL       if CL <      α
                                                                                                                   2ξ−1   and
                    ∂g(CL ,C)                 α                  α
the derivative        ∂CL       if CL >     2ξ−1 .   If CL =   2ξ−1 ,   then φ is a subgradient of f if and only if
              α            α
        ∂g( 2ξ−1 ,C) ∂h( 2ξ−1 ,C)
φ∈[         ∂CL     ,    ∂CL      ].
         ∂h(0,0)                ∂h(0,0)
   If     ∂CL      ≤ 0, then     ∂CL CL      ≤ 0 for all CL ≥ 0 and hence C = 0 has the desired property.
                                                                                              ∂h(C,C)
Moreover, it is the unique C with the property for if C 0 > 0 then, since                       ∂CL     is decreasing and
∂h(C,C)
  ∂CL       >   ∂g(C,C)
                  ∂CL     for all C, the subgradient of fb(·, C 0 ) at C 0 is negative which implies that C 0

cannot have the desired property. Finally, note that fb(0, 0) = h(0, 0) > 0.

   If     ∂CL      > 0 and            ∂CL           < 0, then there exists a unique C ∈ (0, 2ξ−1 ) such that
∂h(C,C)
  ∂CL      = 0 and this is the unique C with the desired property. It satisfies the inequality since

   If         ∂CL           > 0, then since      ∂CL       is continuous, decreasing and negative for C suﬃciently

large, there exists a unique C such that                     ∂CL        = 0 and this is the unique C with the desired

property. To show that it satisfies the inequality, we need to establish that:

                                      σ
                      g(C, C) =         β(1 − 2x) + (1 − σ)β(1 − x − d) − 2C/θ(1 − γ) ≥ 0.
                                      2

Note that

which implies that
                                                           4(2(1 − ξ)αC + C 2 + α2 )

Thus,

We leave this to the reader.

We know that if σ < 1 then it must be the case that

It follows that if σ < 1, then it must be the case that

                                                      (1 − γ)θσβ(1 − 2x)

Solving for σ, we obtain

                                  [(2π∗ − 1)2 + 1][β(1 − γ)θ(1 − x − d) − 4α]

                         =                                                 .
                                 β(1 − γ)θ[(1 − x − d)(2π ∗ − 1)2 + x − d]

This completes the proof of the formula. QED

Proof of Proposition 1: We know that (σ, C, ξ, ρ) is a symmetric equilibrium if and only if σ ∈

                      b ξ(σ)),        b
                               ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(σ)) and

                                                           ρ
                                  σ=                                       .

                                       ρ + (1 − ρ)(1 − λ(C(σ,

Thus, using the functional form for λ, there exists an equilibrium if and only if there exists (σ, ρ) ∈

                                 b
[0, σ] × [0, 1] such that ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(σ)) and

                                                ρ(C(σ, b

                                                  b ξ(σ)) +α

   The first task is to understand the correspondence ρb(ξ). It is the case that ρb(0) = [ρ, 1];

ρb(1) = [0, ρ]; and ρb(ξ) = {f (ξ)} for all ξ ∈ (0, 1) where f : [0, 1] → [ρ, ρ] is the function defined by:

                                              β(3x − 1 − d) − H −1 (ξ)
                                    f (ξ) =                            .
                                                     β(x − d)

For future reference, note that f (0) = ρ, f (1) = ρ, and that f (ξ) is decreasing.

   Now define the function ϕ : [0, σ] → < as follows:

                                                    b
                                                 f (ξ(σ))(C(σ, b
                                                           b ξ(σ))   + α)

                                              b ∈ (0, 1) and f (ξ) > ρ for all ξ < 1. It is also
It is the case that ϕ(0) < 0. This is because ξ(0)

latter point, note that

                  b and C
and that both f 0 ξ0    b0 are negative. For the latter, note that C(σ, b

equation π(C(σ, b
           b ξ(σ)),    b
                    0; ξ(σ)) = π ∗ and that increasing σ must raise the eﬀectiveness of campaign

advertising. This means that the amount of campaign contributions necessary to achieve the

probability π∗ falls.

Similarly, for every σ ∈ (σ ∗ , σ], ξ(σ)   b ∗ ) and hence ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(σ))

Thus, there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium.

                                           b
   If ϕ(σ) < 0, then for every σ ∈ [0, σ), ξ(σ)   b
                                                < ξ(σ)                  b
                                                       and hence ρ ∈ ρb(ξ(σ)) implies that

                                             ρ(C(σ, b
                                               b ξ(σ))    + α)
                                       σ<                      .

                                              ρC(σ, ξ(σ)) + α

Thus, if there exists an equilibrium it must involve σ = σ. The fact that ϕ(σ) < 0 means that

                                 b
σ < 1 which in turn implies that ξ(σ)                         b
                                      = 1. It follows that ρb(ξ(σ)) = [0, ρ]. Now choose ρ∗ ∈ (0, ρ)

such that
                                                  b 0) + α)
                                              ρ∗ (C(σ,
                                        σ=                  .
                                                  b 0) + α
                                               ρ∗ C(σ,

                                                   42
Then, it is clear that (σ, ρ∗ ) satisfy the requirements of equilibrium and, moreover, since ρ∗ is

uniquely defined, this is the only equilibrium.

   This proves that there exists a unique symmetric equilibrium (σ ∗ , C ∗ , ξ ∗ , ρ∗ ). The remainder

of the proposition follows from noting that σ ∗ > 0 and that π(C ∗ , 0; ξ ∗ ) = π∗ ∈ ( 12 , 1). QED

Proof of Proposition 2: We claim that (0, L, 1, 0) is the unique symmetric equilibrium. It is

clear that it is an equilibrium, so we need only show that it is unique. We know that if (σ, C, ξ, ρ)

is a symmetric equilibrium with contribution limit L, then it must be the case that C ≤ L and

ξ ≤ 1. This implies that π(C, 0, ξ) < π ∗ which implies that σ = 0. This, in turn, implies that

ρ = 0 and hence that ξ = 1. This, in turn implies that C = L. Expected campaign spending in

this equilibrium must be zero, because interest groups only give to moderates and parties always

select partisans. QED

Proof of Lemma 3: We first claim that π(C, 0; ξ) = π∗ . If not, then either π(C, 0; ξ) > π∗ or

π(C, 0; ξ) < π∗ . In the former case, σ = 1. Since C > 0, it follows that by Bayes Rule ρ = 1. But
                                                         1
this implies that ξ = 0 and hence that π(C, 0; ξ) =      2   < π∗ - a contradiction. In the latter case,

σ = 0. In addition, (by assumption) we know that ρ = 0. But this implies that ξ = 1 and hence

that C = L and that π(C, 0; 1) = π(L, 0; 1). But since L is at least as big as α[2π∗ − 1], we have

that π(L, 0; 0) ≥ π ∗ - a contradiction.

   It remains to show that C = L. Letting (σ ∗ , C ∗ , ξ ∗ , ρ∗ ) be the laissez-faire equilibrium, we

know that π(C, 0; ξ) = π(C ∗ , 0; ξ ∗ ) where C ≤ L < C ∗ . It follows that ξ > ξ ∗ . If σ = 0, it follows

immediately that C = L since if the constraint were not binding the equilibrium contribution level

         b ξ) which must exceed C ∗ and hence L. If σ > 0 then
would be C(0,

                                                     ρ
                                      σ=                         .
                                           ρ + (1 − ρ)(1 − λ(C))

But we know that ρ < ρ∗ and that C < C ∗ which implies that σ < σ ∗ . This means that C = L

                                                                                     b ξ) which
since if the constraint were not binding the equilibrium contribution level would be C(σ,

Proof of Proposition 3: We know that if (σ, C, ξ, ρ) is a symmetric equilibrium then ξ = ξ(L)

and C = L. If L is bigger than α[2π ∗ − 1], then we know that ξ ∈ (0, 1) which implies that ρ =

   e
f (ξ(L)) (where f is as defined in Proposition 1) and that

                                                    e
                                                 f (ξ(L))(L + α)

                                                  f (ξ(L))L + α

This is the unique symmetric equilibrium.

   If L equals α[2π ∗ − 1], then we know that ξ = 1 which implies that ρ ∈ [0, ρ]. Letting

                                                      ρα2π∗

                                                  ρα[2π∗ − 1] + α

the set of equilibria are {(b
                            σ (ρ), L, 0, ρ) : ρ ∈ [0, ρ]}.

   It remains to show that both the probability that parties select moderates and expected cam-

paign spending are decreasing in the size of the limit. Let σ ∗ (L) denote the probability that

parties select moderates with limit L > α[2π∗ − 1]. Then

                                                        e
                                                     f (ξ(L))(L + α)
                                         σ ∗ (L) =                   .
                                                         e
                                                      f (ξ(L))L + α

Diﬀerentiating, we obtain

                   dσ ∗ (L)        (f L + α)[f + f 0 ξe0 (L + α)] − (f + f 0 ξe0 L)f (L + α)
                              =
                     dL                                    (f L + α)2
                                   f 2 L + αf + αf 0 ξe0 (L + α) − f 2 (L + α)
                              =
                                                  (f L + α)2
                                   αf (1 − f ) + αf 0 ξe0 (L + α)

                                            (f L + α)2

This is positive since f 0 ξe0 > 0, which proves that σ ∗ (L) is decreasing on (α[2π ∗ − 1], C ∗ ]. With

limit L = α[2π∗ − 1], the probability that parties select moderates is no greater than

                                                       44
But for all L > α[2π ∗ − 1], we have that

   Expected campaign spending with limit L > α[2π ∗ − 1] is given by


                                              E ∗ (L) = 2σ ∗ (L)L.


This is clearly increasing in L. With limit L = α[2π ∗ − 1], expected campaign spending is no

greater than

                                          ρα[2π∗ − 1] + α

which is smaller than E ∗ (L) for all L > α[2π ∗ − 1]. QED

Proof of Proposition 4: (i) Let (σ∗ (γ), C ∗ (γ), ξ ∗ (γ), ρ∗ (γ)) denote the laissez-faire equilibrium

when the fraction of moderates is γ and let E ∗ (γ) denote expected campaign spending. Further,

let W (σ, π ∗ , E, γ) denote aggregate welfare with the pair (E, σ). Recall that

                                     [(2π ∗ − 1)2 + 1][β(1 − γ)θ(1 − x − d) − 4α]

                                       β(1 − γ)θ[(1 − x − d)(2π ∗ − 1)2 + x − d]

        b be the solution to the equation
and let γ

                       ρ2π ∗       [(2π ∗ − 1)2 + 1][β(1 − γ)θ(1 − x − d) − 4α]
                       ∗
                                 =                                              .
                   [ρ2π + 1 − ρ]     β(1 − γ)θ[(1 − x − d)(2π ∗ − 1)2 + x − d]

Observe that since ρ > 0 the left hand side is positive, less than 1 and is independent of θ. The
                                                                                 1−γ           2α
right hand side is decreasing in γ and less than or equal to zero when            2    ≤   βθ(1−x−d) .   Thus,
             4α
b<1−
γ        βθ(1−x−d) .   Now let

                                                     4α(x − d)
                                   γ = max{                           b}.
                                                                     ,γ

                                                4α
We claim that γ is smaller than 1 −         βθ(1−x−d) .   To prove this, we need to show that

                                   4α(x − d)                4α
                                                   <1−               .

                                                          45
Rearranging, this becomes
                                                4α       (x − d)  1
                                                       [         + ] < 1,
                                           β(1 − x − d) (1 − 2x) θ

or, equivalently,
                                             4α[θ(x − d) + 1 − 2x]
                                                                   < β.
                                             θ(1 − 2x)(1 − x − d)

This holds by hypothesis.

   When γ > γ, the laissez-faire equilibrium is a boundary equilibrium since, by construction,
   ρ2π ∗
[ρ2π ∗ +1−ρ]   > σ . Thus, (C ∗ (γ), ξ ∗ (γ)) = (α(2π ∗ − 1), 0) and

                                                                      σ
                                    (σ ∗ (γ), ρ∗ (γ)) = (σ,                     ).
                                                              2π∗ − (2π ∗ − 1)σ

It follows that imposing any contribution limit will lead to both zero expected campaign spending

and a zero probability of parties selecting moderates (i.e., the pair (E, σ) = (0, 0)). Thus, to

complete the proof all we need to do is to show that welfare at the laissez-faire equilibrium

W (σ ∗ (γ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ), γ) is greater than W (0, π ∗ , 0, γ). The way we do this is to first show that

                                                        b σ
(E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) lies on the line joining (0, 0) and (E, b) in Figure 1. We then show that any point

on this curve generates a higher level of welfare than does (0, 0) under the stated condition.
                             σ
   Since ρ∗ (γ) =     2π ∗ −(2π ∗ −1)σ ,   we know that

                                                          ρ∗ (γ)2π ∗
                                               σ=
                                                    ρ∗ (γ)(2π ∗ − 1) + 1

and that ρ∗ (γ) ≤ ρ. It follows that the laissez-faire equilibrium belongs to the set

                                           ρ2π ∗
                            Φ = {(                    , α(2π∗ − 1), 0, ρ) : ρ ∈ [0, ρ]},
                                      ρ(2π ∗ − 1) + 1

which is none other than the set of equilibria that can arise with the contribution limit L =

α(2π ∗ − 1). Corresponding to any point in the set Φ is an expected campaign spending level and

a probability that parties select moderates (E(ρ), σ(ρ)). It is straightforward to show that

                                                ρα(4π ∗ )(2π ∗ − 1)    ρ(2π ∗ )
                           (E(ρ), σ(ρ)) = (                         ,               ).
                                                (ρ(2π ∗ − 1) + 1) (ρ(2π ∗ − 1) + 1)

                                                           46
                                                             b σ
Varying ρ between [0, ρ] yields the curve joining (0, 0) to (E, b) in Figure 1. An explicit description

of the curve may be obtained by noting that

                                                           E
                                   E −1 (E) =
                                                (2π∗   − 1)(α4π∗ − E)

and hence the curve is described by the function

                                                           E
                                      σ(E −1 (E)) =                 .
                                                       2α(2π ∗ − 1)

This function is linear, establishing that the curve has the shape depicted in Figure 1.

      We now show that any point on the curve (6= (0, 0)) yields a higher level of welfare than

                                                                       b σ
(0, 0) under the stated condition. Suppose that it were the case that (E, b) lay on a higher social

indiﬀerence curve than (0, 0). Then, by the convexity of the social indiﬀerence curves, so must

                                                         b σ
any other point (6= (0, 0)) on the curve. To prove that (E, b) lies on a higher social indiﬀerence

                                                                                           b σ
curve than (0, 0), it is enough to show that the slope of the social indiﬀerence curve at (E, b) is

no greater than the slope of the line segment. The above analysis implies that the latter is given

by:
                                           dσ        1
                                              =              .
                                           dE   2α(2π ∗ − 1)

The indiﬀerence curves have slope

                                         dσ         1
                                            =
                                         dE         σ, π ∗ )/∂σ
                                              γ∂WM (b

Thus, the required condition is that


                                         σ , π ∗ )/∂σ ≥ 2α(2π∗ − 1)
                                   γ∂WM (b


                                                           σ , π ∗ )/∂σ. Note first that we may write:
      We must now solve explicitly for the derivative ∂WM (b

                                         σ2       (1 − σ)2
                       WM (σ, π∗ ) = −      ψMM −          ψP P − σ(1 − σ)ψP M ,
                                         2            2




                                                   47
where

                          β(1 − x − d) 3β(x − d)
            ψP P   =                   +         ,
                                2          2
                          β(1 − 2x)
           ψMM     =                , and
                              2
            ψP M   = (π∗ )2 β(1 − 2x) + (1 − π ∗ )2 β(1 − x − d) + (1 − (π ∗ )2 )β(x − d).


Diﬀerentiating, we obtain

                     ∂WM (σ, π ∗ )
                                   = ψP P − ψP M − σ(ψP P + ψMM − 2ψP M ).
                        ∂σ

It is straightforward to show that ψP P + ψMM > 2ψP M ; ψP P > ψP M ; and ψP M > ψMM . These
                          ∂WM (σ,π ∗ )
inequalities imply that      ∂σ          is positive but decreasing in σ. It follows therefore, that

                                              σ, π∗ )
                                         ∂WM (b
                                                      > ψP M − ψMM .
                                            ∂σ

Moreover, since x − d > 1 − 2x

                                                              β(1 − 2x)
                                         ψP M − ψMM >                   .
                                                                  2

Thus,
                                                  σ, π∗ )
                                             ∂WM (b         γβ(1 − 2x)
                                         γ                >            .
                                                ∂σ              2

   Next observe that, using the definition of π∗ , we have:

                                                              2α(x − d)
                                             2α(2π ∗ − 1) =
                                                              1−x−d

                                     σ , π ∗ )/∂σ ≥ 2α(2π ∗ − 1) is that:
Thus, a suﬃcient condition for γ∂WM (b

                                             γβ(1 − 2x)   2α(x − d)
                                                        ≥
                                                 2        1−x−d

This is implied by the definition of γ and the fact that γ > γ.

                                                            b as defined above is less than or equal
   (ii) There are two cases to consider. Suppose first that γ

to 0. Then, for all γ, the laissez-faire equilibrium is a boundary equilibrium in which C ∗ (γ) =

                                                        48
α(2π ∗ − 1). As shown above, this means that the pair (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) lies on the line connecting

            b σ
(0, 0) and (E, b) depicted in Figure 1. Moreover, as we decrease γ towards 0, (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) moves

continuously up the curve reflecting the fact that σ is increasing. Now let


                                                                 e σ
                                       lim (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) = (E, e).
                                       γ→0


Then,

                                                        e − β(1 − 2d) < − β(1 − 2d) .
                   lim W (σ ∗ (γ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ), γ) = −E
                   γ→0                                          2             2

Since for all γ, W (0, π ∗ , 0, γ) = − β(1−2d)
                                          2    , there must exist γ > 0 such that W (0, π∗ , 0, γ) >

W (σ ∗ (γ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ), γ) for all γ ∈ (0, γ). Since (0, 0) can be achieved by imposing any contribution

limit L < α(2π ∗ − 1), the result follows.

      b is greater than 0, then for all γ ∈ (0, γ
   If γ                                         b), the laissez-faire equilibrium is an interior equi-

librium in which C ∗ (γ) > α(2π∗ − 1). As we decrease γ in this range, the equilibrium level of

contributions increases reflecting the greater size of the interest groups. In addition, the probabil-

ity that parties select moderates increases. This translates into a continuous rightward move of

the pair (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)). Now let


                                                                 e σ
                                       lim (E ∗ (γ), σ ∗ (γ)) = (E, e).
                                       γ→0


Then,

                                                         e − β(1 − 2d) < − β(1 − 2d)
                    lim W (σ ∗ (γ), π ∗ , E ∗ (γ), γ) = −E
                   γ→0                                           2             2

and it again follows that there must exist γ > 0 such that W (0, π ∗ , 0, γ) > W (σ ∗ (γ), π∗ , E ∗ (γ), γ)

for all γ ∈ (0, γ). QED
