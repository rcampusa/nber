                                            ABSTRACT

This paper offers an empirical test of ownership mix efficiency in the U.S. hospital services industry.

The test compares the benefits of quality assurance with the costs from the attenuation of property

rights that result from an increased presence of nonprofit organizations. The empirical results suggest

that too many not-for-profit and public hospitals may exist in the typical market area of the U.S. The

policy implication is that more quality of care per dollar might be obtained by attracting a greater

percentage of for-profit hospitals into some market areas. This conclusion, however, is tempered

with several caveats. We discuss these and also make recommendations for further research.

I.      Introduction
Health care spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product has been on the

rise again in the United States, with an increase from 13.3 percent in 2000 to 14.9

percent in 2002 (Levit et al., 2004). A considerable share of this growth can be

attributed to the hospital services sector of the health economy because expenditures

on hospital services account for 36 percent of all personal health care spending. The

observed high level of spending in this sector has sometimes been linked to the

inefficient use of resources by nonprofit organizations, which may result from the

attenuation of property rights incentives.

     Hansmann (1980) notes that nonprofit organizations face a non-distribution

constraint because they cannot legally distribute any of their residual earnings. By

law, nonprofit organizations must dispense all residual earnings for the express

educational, charitable, or religious purposes for which they were formed. As a

result, economists are quick to point out that nonprofit organizations are likely to face

a more severe principal-agent problem than for-profits. In particular, the absence of a

residual claimant with a financial interest in the organization means that no one

individual, or group of individuals, has strong incentives to monitor the behavior of

the organization. Therefore, in a nonprofit health care organization, the divergence

between the interests of the principal(s) and the agent(s) often leads to the inefficient

production and provision of medical care services. This occurs because unconstrained

managers of nonprofit organizations are more inclined to pursue personal goals and

objectives, which are likely to conflict with minimum cost production, ceteris




                                             3
paribus. Consequently, property-rights theory predicts that a nonprofit healthcare

organization, in isolation, will produce medical services at higher costs than an

otherwise comparable for-profit organization.

   However, if nonprofits do produce with higher costs, as property-rights theory

predicts, it becomes unclear why nonprofit organizations are so dominant in many

health care markets. Arrow (1963) has cleared up some of this ambiguity by pointing

out that medical care is a highly complex personal service, one for which there exists

considerable uncertainty surrounding quality. Accordingly, one hypothesis for the

prevalence of nonprofits in healthcare markets is that nonprofit ownership status

serves as a signal for quality in the presence of asymmetric information.

   In this case, the non-distribution constraint implies nonprofit organizations face

little financial incentive to compromise the quality of care they provide when

consumers face asymmetric information.           This is in contrast to for-profit

organizations, which clearly confront financial incentives to engage in opportunistic

behavior, such as skimping on the quality of care they provide, when consumers are

imperfectly informed. Thus, economic theory suggests that an isolated nonprofit

healthcare organization may offer higher levels of quality than an otherwise

comparable for-profit organization.

   While theory tends to be unambiguous in predicting that an “isolated” nonprofit

organization will produce medical care with higher quality and production costs than

an otherwise similar for-profit organization, both Hirth (1999) and Grabowski and

Hirth (2002) have pointed out that nonprofit and for-profit organizations rarely

operate in isolation; in fact, they often compete against one another in the same




                                         4
market area. They hypothesize that competitive spillovers from nonprofits may lead

to a higher quality of care in for-profit organizations. In support of this theory, the

researchers find empirical evidence that an increase in nonprofit market share

improves for-profit, and overall, nursing home quality.

   Grabowski and Hirth (2002), and much earlier, Tuckman and Chang (1988), also

note that competitive spillovers from for-profits may influence the behavior of

nonprofit organizations because competition from for-profit organizations may limit

the inefficiency of nonprofits. Inefficiency is limited because nonprofits have to be

more concerned with the costs of producing medical care when facing competition

from the more cost conscious for-profit organizations.1          Grabowski and Hirth

conclude (p. 19) that ‘If non-profits have a competitive advantage in

“trustworthiness” while for-profits have greater incentives for efficiency, intersectoral

competition can yield better outcomes than a market consisting exclusively of one

type of firm.’

   Based upon the notion that a mix of for-profit and nonprofit organizations may

promote societal well being, this paper develops and conducts a unique empirical test

to assess the efficiency of the ownership mix in the typical hospital services market.

As previously discussed, the existence of both nonprofit and for-profit organizations

in a single market area can be expected to generate both social benefits and costs. By

empirically estimating the relationship between the nonprofit (or for-profit) market

share and the utilization of hospital services at the market level, we can infer the net

social benefit of additional nonprofit facilities. We discuss this in the next section of

this paper and also explain how we plan to conduct the empirical test. Section III




                                         5
describes the data and sample used in the empirical analyses. Section IV presents the

empirical findings and the last section offers conclusions, caveats, and suggestions for

future research.



II.      Conceptual Model
The method we employ to test for the efficient mix of for-profit and nonprofit

hospitals in a geographical market is derived from Svorney (1987). Svorney

examined the role of professional interests in establishing physician licensure. She

argued that physician licensure potentially raises costs through higher wages because

it acts as an entry barrier, but, she emphasized, licensure may also provide greater

benefits in the form of quality assurance. The ultimate test of the efficiency of

professional licensure, she argued, depends on whether or not the favorable demand

response outweighs the undesirable supply response. For example, if the benefit of

quality assurance causes demand to increase more than higher wages cause supply to

decrease, then the utilization of physician services increases, and this reflects the net

social benefit that physician licensure offers.2 Hence, one may observe the impact of

a regulation (or type of institution) on the utilization of a particular good or service,

and from that draw an inference about its effect on economic efficiency.

      In a similar vein, the efficiency of a mix of health care organizations with

different ownership forms may be analyzed in this manner. For example, and in the

context of this research, suppose we are comparing two similar hospital services

markets that differ in the following respect: market area “A” is completely dominated

by for-profit facilities whereas market area “B” is characterized by an equal




                                         6
distribution of market shares across for-profit and nonprofit facilities. A graphical

exposition of this comparison is presented in figure 1 for a competitive marketplace.


                          [INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]

    The curves DA and SA represent the demand and supply for hospital services in

market A (where for-profit facilities completely dominate). Notice that QA measures

the market clearing quantity of hospital services in market A.

   Given the different mix of ownership structures, the markets are likely to differ in

two principle respects, ceteris paribus. First, a greater demand for hospital services

will exist in market area B because of the increased quality assurance resulting

directly (or indirectly) from the greater prevalence of nonprofit organizations. This

higher level of quality assurance is captured by demand curve DB in figure 1. Second,

the supply of hospital services may be lower in market area B because of the higher

production costs resulting from the diminished property-rights incentives from the

greater proportion of nonprofit hospitals operating in the market. Higher production

costs are reflected in supply curve SB in figure 1. Because the demand (quality

assurance) effect is assumed to be stronger than the cost effect in our example, the

equilibrium quantity of hospital services, QB, is greater in market B than in market A.

   Whether or not the demand effect more than offsets the supply effect in the

typical market for hospital services is an empirical question that can be tested using

standard regression techniques. The test can be conducted by observing the impact

that the nonprofit (or for-profit) market share has on hospital care utilization, while

carefully controlling for a host of other supply and demand factors. Equation 1

represents the general reduced-form model used in the forthcoming statistical



                                         7
   estimations. In equation 1, Qi represents the equilibrium quantity of hospital care in

   market i; NPSi represents the market share held by not-for-profit hospitals in market

   i; 3 PSi stands for the market share held by public or government hospitals in market i;

    D ji is a vector of j additional variables that are expected to influence the demand for

   hospital care in market i; and S ki is a vector of k additional variables hypothesized to

   affect the supply of hospital care in market i. The error term, µ i , is assumed to be

   independent and normally distributed with constant variance and a mean of zero

   (fixed effects in equation 1 have been suppressed for algebraic convenience).



                                   j                  k
    Qi = β 0 NPS i + β 1 PS i +          γ n Din +          γ j +n S in +µ i         (1)
                                  n =1               n =1


       The coefficients on the not-for-profit and public hospital shares reflect whether

the two ownership forms generate positive or negative net benefits at the margin. For

example, if β0 < 0 the benefit of quality assurance (i.e., demand increases) is less than the

costs resulting form the diminished property rights incentives (i.e., supply decrease). In

this case, the results would indicate that too many not-for-profits exist in the typical

market area. If β0 > 0, however, the opposite scenario holds. Finally, if β0 = 0 this

suggests that an efficient mix of not-for-profit and for-profit organizations exist in the

typical market area.4 The same logic holds for the public market share variable and the

coefficient β1.




                                                               8
III. Data and Empirical Test

In our test, the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) was assumed to be a reasonable

approximation for the relevant geographical market (RGM) for hospital services. While

this definition of the RGM is not without its weaknesses (Dranove and White, 1994),

urban hospital markets are commonly defined in this manner for empirical research (e.g.,

Joskow, 1980; Manheim, Bazzoli, and Sohn, 1994; Spang, Bazzoli, and Arnould, 2001;

Douglas and Ryman, 2003). Only community hospitals were included in the analysis

because they provide a similar cluster of inpatient services and therefore operate in the

same relevant product market. Access to necessary data such as the uninsured rate, the

penetration rate of health maintenance organizations, and the Medicare managed care

penetration rate prevented us from extending the empirical analysis to all 320 MSAs in

the U.S. But the 90 MSA observations, for which we could obtain all of the required data,

account for 75 percent of the population in the U.S. The data used in our empirical

analyses are for the year 1999 and come from Health Forum (2002) and the Agency for

Health Care Research and Quality.5 Table 1 reports the mean value, standard deviation,

and data source for each of the variables used in our empirical analyses.

                            [INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

   The conceptual model indicates that a measure of hospital care utilization, or

quantity, Qi , is necessary to conduct the test. We employed several measures of

utilization: number of admissions, inpatient beds, inpatient days, surgeries, outpatient

visits, and emergency room visits. All of these indicators were measured on a per capita

basis. Because good instruments are unavailable, we were unable to test and correct for

the possibility that the market shares based on ownership are endogenous from a market



                                             9
perspective. While an endogenous market share is indeed a possibility, there are

nevertheless strong theoretical and institutional reasons to treat the hospital services

market shares based on ownership as being exogenous. Evidence suggests that these

market shares tend to change very little from one year to the next. In fact, Grabowski and

Hirth (2002) note that the relative share of nonprofit hospitals in different parts of the

country may be deeply rooted in historical factors such as the age of the city and different

patterns of voluntarism and charitable provision that have little to do with the advanced

technology and prevalence of third party payment that characterize the current health care

environment. However, as Bound, Jaeger, and Baker (1995) have shown, when faced

with the choice of using weak instruments and no instruments at all, the latter is often the

best empirical strategy because weak instruments may lead to large inconsistencies in the

IV-generated estimates.       Moreover, if endogeneity is present, IV estimates in finite

samples will still be biased in the same direction as OLS-generated estimates.

   As previously mentioned, in an effort to isolate the impact of ownership mix on

efficiency, we must also control for other factors that could result in utilization

differences across market areas. Otherwise, the omission of variables that are correlated

with both ownership mix and the measures of output could lead us to draw incorrect

inferences from our empirical results. Following the conceptual model, these other

influences can be broken down into the aforementioned demand-side variables, D j and

supply-side variables S k .

   Demand-side variables affecting hospital care utilization include indicators of

population size, population density, the age composition of the population, the level of

income and its distribution in the area, the presence and prevalence of disabilities among



                                             10
the population, the percentage of uninsured individuals and the type of insurance

coverage (e.g., HMO penetration rate and Medicare managed care penetration rate),

competitiveness of the HMO insurance market, the availability of community health

centers as an alternative to hospitals, and environmental conditions (e.g., unemployment,

crime, and housing). These demand-side variables are intended to control for differences

in the willingness and ability to pay for hospital services across market areas. Supply-side

variables are fewer in number and include population density (as a proxy for the price of

land), the presence of non-teaching hospitals (as a surrogate for quality of care), and the

number of hospitals per capita. By construction, each measure of output, such as the

number of admissions per capita, captures the average amount observed for the typical

hospital in each MSA. Thus, the dramatic case-mix and quality of care differences

normally observed among hospitals within a given metropolitan area are likely to be

neutralized through the averaging process such that the average outputs are more similar,

in terms of quality and case-mix, across MSAs (Keeler and Ying, 1996). We also

controlled for individual state effects using a fixed-effects model specification to capture

any omitted variables that may vary systematically across states.



IV. Empirical Results

The multiple regression equations for the six different measures of output are estimated

by the ordinary least square procedure. White’s (1980) test did not detect the presence of

heteroscasticity. Each independent variable’s coefficient estimate and its corresponding t-

statistic (in absolute terms) are reported in table 2. The six regression equations explain

between 48 and 80 percent of the variation in the various measures of output.



                                            11
                       [INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

       Looking across the various columns, it can be noted that the coefficient estimates

on the not-for-profit and public hospital market shares are remarkably similar across the

six regression equations in terms of their signs and magnitudes. This finding suggests

that both types of nonprofit hospital organizations exert a similar marginal impact on

efficiency. More specifically, the coefficient estimates are negative on both the not-for-

profit and public hospital market shares in five of the six equations. Recall that a negative

coefficient estimate indicates an overrepresentation of a particular type of hospital

ownership from an efficiency perspective. For two of the five equations, inpatient beds

and admissions, the coefficient estimates are statistically different from zero on the not-

for-profit hospital market share and for three equation, inpatient beds, admissions, and

days, the coefficient estimates are statistically significant on the public hospital market

share. From an inpatient care efficiency perspective, these results suggest that not-for-

profit and public hospitals may be overly dominant in the typical market area. That is,

more quality of inpatient care per dollar might be realized by somehow growing the

market share of for-profit hospitals.

       However, notice in the outpatient visits equation that both the not-for-profit and

public hospital market shares possess positive and statistically significant parameter

estimates. Taken alone, this result suggests that not-for-profit and public hospitals should

participate more extensively in the outpatient care sector of the hospital industry because

they are underrepresented from an efficiency perspective. Our only reticence in drawing

this particular conclusion is that the measure of market share is based on hospital

admissions and not outpatient visits. Data limitations preclude us from constructing a




                                             12
measure of market share based on other measures of output and, unfortunately, we do not

know the strength of the correlation between market shares based on inpatient admissions

and outpatient visits. However, considering that the outpatient facilities of hospitals often

compete with physician clinics that are organized on a for-profit basis, it may not be too

surprising that nonprofit organizations are underrepresented in the outpatient sector from

an efficiency perspective.

       Assuming that our results for the outpatient visits equation are plausible, can we

draw any conclusion about the overall efficiency of the hospital ownership mix in the

typical MSA? We can if we know something about the relative value that society assigns

to the two types of hospital care. For instance, suppose we just focus on the regression

results for hospital admissions since they mirror the results for inpatient beds (as well as

inpatient days and surgeries but not as precisely). Using the coefficient estimates on the

not-for-profit (-0.68) and public (-0.70) shares in the inpatient admissions equation, it can

be determined that a one-percentage point increase in the shares of each type of hospital

will reduce the number of inpatient visits per 1,000 population by .68 and .70,

respectively. Evaluated at the sample mean for inpatient admissions (118 per 1,000

population), it follows that a one-percentage point increase in the two shares reduces

inpatient admissions by .57 and .59 percent.

       Following the same procedure for outpatient visits, it can be determined that the

number of visits increases by .77 and .69 percent with respect to a one-percentage point

increase in the market share of not-for-profit and public hospitals. Thus, if society values

inpatient care and outpatient care equally, one might draw the conclusion that a greater

presence of not-for-profit and public hospitals would benefit society from an overall




                                             13
efficiency perspective because the percentage gain in outpatient visits outweighs the

percentage loss in inpatient care. However, society most likely does not value equally

both types of hospital care. For one reason, many visits to the outpatient care facility of a

hospital are not the result of a life-threatening situation. In fact, notice in table 2 that the

market shares of not-for-profit and public hospitals are not statistically related to the

number of emergency room visits, a situation where the medical attention may be life

saving in nature.

       Another reason why the two types of care cannot be treated equally is that

expenditures on inpatient care have tended to dwarf spending on outpatient care on a per

unit basis. In 2000, for example, outpatient revenues amounted to $6,177 per discharge

whereas inpatient revenues equaled $229 per visit.6 Using these values to weigh the loss

of inpatient admissions and gain of outpatient care resulting from a one-percentage point

increase in the market shares, it can be determined that the losses amount to $4,200 for

the not-for-profit share ($6,177 x 0.68) and $4,323 for the public hospital market share

($6,177 x 0.70). The corresponding benefits equal $3,073 ($229 x 13.42) and $2,792

($229 x 12.19). Thus, according to these calculations, a marginal expansion of the not-

for-profit and public market shares would result in net social losses.


V. Conclusions
This paper offers a test of the efficiency of the ownership mix in various hospital services

markets across the U.S. When consumers lack sufficient information about hospital

quality, the general notion is that nonprofit organizations generate societal benefits by

offering (and signaling) quality assurance, but they may simultaneously result in higher

production costs because of less attention devoted to efficiency. The opposite scenario


                                              14
holds for for-profit organizations. Thus, a mix of ownership types in the marketplace may

keep quality and costs under control as a result of competitive spillovers.

   In this study we proposed that the efficiency of the ownership mix might be inferred

by viewing how the ownership mix affects utilization through the use of multiple

regression analyses. Our empirical results suggest that too many not-for-profit and public

hospitals may characterize the typical hospital services market of the U.S., at least in

1999. As a result, greater quality of care per dollar could possibly be achieved by

encouraging more for-profit hospitals to enter into some market areas of the U.S. Local

and state policy makers could attract more for-profit hospitals by offering inducements

such as zoning waivers and construction bond subsidies.

   However, before policies of this kind are actually enacted it may be beneficial to

replicate this study by obtaining richer data and by using a much larger panel data set of

individual hospitals. Data of this kind are not available to us. A larger panel set would

allow the investigator to control for a large number of hospital-specific features by

employing fixed effects and may also permit some changes in the market shares of the

different types of hospitals over time. Lastly, a richer data set might allow market share

to be constructed with various measures of output or revenues involving inpatient and

outpatient care. At the very least, our study here provides an initializing template to help

organize and execute a more ambitious study on such an important and timely topic.

1
 In recent work by Kessler and McClellan (2002) examining the hospital market, areas with a stronger
presence of for-profits have 2.4% lower overall expenditures, but virtually the same patient outcomes.
2
  Svorney finds empirically that physician licensure leads to a reduced consumption of physician services.
That is, physician licensure increased entry costs (supply) by more than it increased consumer benefits
from quality assurance (demand). Thus her results provide support for the special interest theory of
physician licensure.
3
 We categorize the difference types of hospitals based on ownership as private for-profit, private not-for-
profit and public or government. Thus, the term “nonprofit” refers to both private not-for-profit and public
organizations in this paper.
4
  In fact, an inverted U relationship might hold between each ownership market share and an output
measure. However, sufficient variation in ownership does not exist to map out an entire inverted U
relationship. We can only identify the direction of the slope.
