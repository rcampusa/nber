        INTERSTATE BUSINESS TAX DIFFERENTIALS AND NEW FIRM LOCATION:
                          EVIDENCE FROM PANEL DATA


                                  ABSTRACT


     This paper examines the impact of state and local tax differentials on
the location of industry using a panel data set of manufacturing firm start-
ups. The number of firm births is modeled as a Poisson count process and the
estimation technique explicitly accounts for unobserved location or state
heterogeneity in the estimation. A second focus of the analysis is the
development of an industry and year specific series of effective tax rates
for each state. After controlling for state and industry effects, the
estimates indicate that a high state marginal effective tax rate reduces the
number of firm births for most industries examined.
