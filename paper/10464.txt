Employers must determine which sorts of healthcare insurance plans to offer employees and also
set employee premiums for each plan provided. Depending on how they structure the premiums that
employees pay across different healthcare insurance plans, plan sponsors alter the incentives to
choose one plan over another. If employees know they differ by risk level but premiums do not fully
reflect these risk differences, this can give rise to a so-called “death spiral” due to adverse selection.
In this paper, we use longitudinal information from a natural experiment in the management of
health benefits for a large employer to explore the impact of moving from a fixed dollar contribution
policy to a risk-adjusted employer contribution policy. Our results suggest that implementing a
significant risk adjustment had no discernable effect on adverse selection against the most generous
indemnity insurance policy. This stands in stark contrast to previous studies, which have tended to
find large impacts. Further analysis suggests that previous studies which appeared to detect plans
in the throes of a death spiral, may instead have been experiencing an inexorable movement away
from a non-preferred product, one that would have been inefficient for almost all workers even in
the absence of adverse selection.

Introduction

       Companies often offer employees an opportunity to select a health insurance plan from a

number of choices offered to workers in the group benefit setting. Inasmuch as healthcare plans

differ in coverage and premiums, plan sponsors must decide how to structure the premiums that

employees pay, since those premiums alter the incentives to choose one plan over another. One

recommended strategy follows a “fixed dollar contribution” model, in which the employer

nominally ‘credits’ each employee with the same fixed level of (tax-shielded) compensation

dollars which can be used toward any plan purchase. Under this model, plan-specific premiums

actually paid by employees are set to reflect differences in average total costs across plans

(Enthoven, 1980).

       If all workers were of approximately the same level of risk, employee choice would

(ideally) reflect differences in the value they place on the benefits associated with each plan.

Relative to their incremental costs, workers would then efficiently select the plans that give them

the highest net benefits. This attractive property may be eroded, however, if workers know that

they differ by risk level but premiums charged to employees do not fully reflect these risk

differences. This can give rise to adverse selection if (other things equal) a higher risk employee

concludes that the relative benefit enhancements expected from a more generous plan exceeds

his incremental premium. In such a world, higher-risk employees (and employees with higher-

risk families) would be predicted to differentially enroll in more generous healthcare plans.

       If employers then set incremental employee premiums for each plan proportionally to the

expected incremental claims costs of participants who actually elect that plan, premiums for the

more generous plan will be higher than it would have been, had the plan been selected by a

representative cross-section of all employees. This higher premium, in turn, may drive low-risk
                                                                                                    2

enrollees away, resulting in what has come to be known as a “death spiral”. Even if an (interior)

equilibrium is reached, it will be one in which enrollment in generous plans will be lower than it

would have been, had premiums been based on the average risk across all workers. A number of

recent studies report that more generous plans have been or could be adversely selected against,

and the estimated response magnitudes are quantitatively important (Cutler and Reber, 1998;

Cutler and Zeckhauser, 2000; Buchmueller and Feldstein, 1997).

       One way to deter such a death spiral might be to set the predetermined employer

contribution in a risk-adjusted fashion, which will in turn influence employee premium

differentials. The argument is that such risk adjustment might be more equitable and more

efficient than permitting the premium differential to reflect equilibrium plan choices and actual

average claims expenses. While an industry has emerged to help employers compute such risk

adjusted premiums, no economic study has thus far explored how effective such risk-adjustment

is, in tempering adverse selection behavior in the group health insurance context. Rather, prior

research has typically examined the effects of introduction of “fixed dollar” models in situations

in which previously either differentials did not exist, or premium contributions were proportional

(Cutler and Reber, 1998; Royalty and Solomon, 1999) .

       In this paper we report on a natural experiment in the management of health benefits for a

large university employer where two interesting changes were made: (1) a risk-adjusted

employer contribution approach was substituted for what had been roughly a fixed-dollar

contribution; and then (2) over time, the risk-adjusted contribution approach was held nearly

constant. Thus we have the opportunity to observe the initial impact of introducing risk

adjustment, and also to evaluate its continuing effects over time. Our results, which may be

surprising to some, suggest that implementing a significant risk adjustment had no obvious
                                                                                                  3

discernable effect on adverse selection against the most generous indemnity insurance policy.

This stands in stark contrast to previous studies which suggested that there would be a large

impact.

          In what follows, we first show that the data on enrollment movements support the “no

effect” hypothesis. Next, we provide empirical analysis that seeks to explain why the earlier

empirical models may not apply here. Finally, we draw some conclusions about the significance

of this experience. The evidence leads us to hypothesize that employee preferences were already

shifting away from the generous indemnity plan and toward much less costly managed care

plans, even before risk adjustment was introduced. Thus what may have appeared to be the

throes of a death spiral might actually have been an inexorable shift away from a non-preferred

product, one that would have been inefficient for almost all workers even in the absence of

adverse selection. In sum, erosion of market share of a plan chosen by higher risks may not be

entirely due to inefficient adverse selection.



The Natural Experiment

          For many years, the employer in question has offered a choice of health insurance options

to its approximately 10,000 non-unionized faculty and staff members. A decade ago, the most

popular choice was called “Plan 100,” a conventional fee-for-service (FFS) plan that (at one

time) had a $100 deductible for employee-only coverage. This plan was effectively self-insured,

with total premiums in a given year dependent on the plan-specific enrollees’ claims experience

in the previous year. Above a deductible, the plan paid the usual 80 percent of approved

outpatient charges, and it gradually had added outpatient, mental health, and prescription drug

coverage. The employer also offered HMO coverage from the two largest HMOs in the area: an
                                                                                                                    4

Aetna HMO and a Keystone (BC/BS) Health Plan.1 The two HMOs slowly increased their share

of employees between the early and mid-1990s; after that point, the market share of Plan 100

went into a steep decline. This decline accelerated in 1995 when the sponsor added “P-Care,” a

PPO organized around the employer’s healthcare system which was heavily patronized by

employees. P-Care offered a lower premium than Plan 100, but its-out-of network benefits had

cost-sharing levels that were comparable to those of Plan 100, and its employee premium was

much lower.

        During the early 1990s, the plan sponsor followed an approximately fixed-dollar

contribution model for each plan, within employee rating class (single or family coverage). That

is, the variation in employee premiums across plans roughly tracked the variation in total

expenditures across all plans. As the managed care total premiums fell relative to the Plan 100

premium, employee premiums for managed care plans went to zero or even become slightly

negative (which meant more benefit dollars for the person’s other cafeteria plan choices).2 Table

1 compares the Plan 100 premium with a simple average of the premiums for other plans using

both absolute and relative differences.

Table 1 here

        In 1996, a consulting firm recommended to the plan sponsor that employee premiums be

restructured to offset actual plan-specific claims experience – in other words, to embody strong

risk adjustment. In particular, the analysts estimated what premiums for each plan would have

been if the workers who selected each plan had the risk characteristics of the average worker

who takes insurance (based only on age, sex, and wage level). These “risk-adjusted” premiums


1
  In addition some plans with small enrollments were limited to employees who were residents of particular nearby
states and small HMOs that subsequently exited the regional market.
2
  The employee HMO premiums would have been even more negative if the fixed-dollar model had been followed
strictly.
                                                                                                          5

were set at levels such that, given the number of workers who actually choose each plan and their

risk levels, the expected aggregate cost for the self-insured plans and the expected premiums for

the external HMOs would be covered. The University’s contribution to this risk adjusted

premium was then set at a uniform dollar amount based on the University’s target budget for

health benefits. The employee contribution then becomes the difference between the University

contribution and the risk-adjusted premium.

        The rationale offered for this change flowed primarily from non-economic normative

arguments underlying risk adjustment in the health insurance arena. Thus, on fairness grounds,

some contended that older and sicker employees who elected Plan 100 should not be asked to

pay more, even though they would receive higher healthcare benefits on average due to their

above-average utilization. It is interesting that in this discussion, little attention was given to the

role of healthcare benefits in attracting high quality workers or minimizing labor costs. On

efficiency grounds, the lack of risk adjustment could be expected to distort plan choices,

particularly among especially risk-averse young workers who might have preferred Plan 100’s

generous benefits. On equity grounds, there might also have been discussion of the normative

issue that Plan 100 members were more highly paid than members of the other plans, especially

the HMOs, but this issue was not prominent at the time.3

        Table 1 indicates how this change in philosophy influenced both absolute and relative

premium differentials, if we compare the old and the new pricing philosophies. In practice, the

new approach altered individual plan premiums substantially: for example, in 1996-7, the total

monthly premium for the HMO-PA plan was $302 per month for family coverage, whereas after

the change, monthly premiums jumped to $428. By contrast, the Plan 100 total monthly

premium fell from an unadjusted value of $521 to a risk-adjusted value of $462. For single
                                                                                                                    6

employees, the Plan 100 premium rose modestly (in percentage terms), while the two HMO

premiums went from negative to positive amounts.

           The following year (1997-8), a new point-of –service plan (U-POS) was added to the

menu of choices offered. This was a point of service gate-keeper HMO linked to the employer’s

health system as well as a broader HMO network with higher copayments for out-of-network

use. Its employee premium was set at half the employee premium for P-Care. Employee

contributions were “rounded off” in some cases, and the two HMO employee premiums were set

equal to each other since neither the total premiums nor the mix of risks was much different.

           Not long thereafter, a new benefits consulting group was engaged which again altered the

philosophy for setting employee healthcare plan premiums. Though risk-adjusted employee

premiums were not completely discarded, as of 1997-8 some changes in employee premiums

began to emerge gradually. Between then and 2000-01, the ratio between Plan 100 premiums and

other premiums slowly widened. The two HMO employee premiums remained equal, and the

more restrictive POS plan associated with the employer’s Health System continued to cost

employees half the premiums of the less restrictive P-Care plan. In 2002-3 the plan sponsor froze

further enrollment in Plan 100 in view of low membership and boosted the employee premium

substantially, with the eventual aim of phasing out this plan.



What Difference Do Employee Premiums Make?

           Figure 1 illustrates employee enrollment data across health plans at this employer, both

before and after the introduction of the new premium pricing philosophy in 1997-8. Enrollment

percentages in Plan 100 fell steadily over the period, despite the rise in relative Plan 100

premiums up to 1997 and dramatic reductions in relative Plan 100 premiums after that point.

3
    Quality of care concerns regarding HMOs that were later raised by researchers were not an issue at that time.
                                                                                                      7

Overall, enrollment data trends offer little support for the view that enrollment patterns were

influenced by premium changes.

Figure 1 here

       In what follows, we therefore evaluate some more rigorous empirical models to address

several relevant questions: (1) Are employees of this firm less responsive to relative premiums

than those studied by other researchers? (2) Does employee income matter -- in that income

affects both the choice of plan and (because the employer had a cafeteria plan) the net-of-tax

employee premiums? Finally, (3) can we distinguish the hypothesis of a gradual shift in demand

away from the most generous plan, from a death spiral induced by adverse selection?



Modeling the Problem

       The key puzzle on which we focus is why was there so little reaction to the large decline

in relative price for Plan 100, the old-style FFS plan offering. In fact, no one new joined this

plan, and there was little slowdown in the rate at which enrolled participants exited over time.

What can this teach us about adverse selection and death spirals?

       We define an empirical death spiral in a multiple option group insurance setting as a

situation in which, over time, a plan disproportionately chosen by higher risks (a) loses

membership, and (b) experiences an increasing average level of risk, given the employer’s

policy for setting employee premium contributions.

       Both clauses are important. Clause (a) describes the informal understanding of a death

spiral, but it alone does not rule out the possibility that a plan loses membership because, given

changes in plan costs for someone of average risk, and given changes in demand, that plan type

is becoming less popular (irrespective of the risk levels of those who tend to select it). That is,
                                                                                                    8

clause (b) indicates that even if the relative premium employees pay did perfectly reflect

differences in risk at one point in time, above-average risks might -- over time -- move away

from the plan if its costs rose disproportionately or if other plans were introduced that were more

attractive. Even these two conditions are only necessary, but not sufficient, for there to be an

adverse selection induced death spiral, since it is possible that new options introduced may have

appealed more to the lower-risk members of the shrinking plan, even with perfect risk rating.

        These observations raise an important issue which has thus far been ignored in the

literature: what is the benchmark model or the null hypothesis, when testing whether a plan is

losing membership because of an adverse-selection death spiral. One attractive benchmark is

what would have happened had premiums been perfectly risk-rated; in such a situation, there

would be no adverse selection. But previous studies seem to have another, more restrictive

benchmark in mind, one in which people were initially distributed across different types of plans

independently of risk (Robinson, et al., 1991). This second benchmark is more restrictive,

because it ignores the real possibility that it could be efficient for higher risks to be

disproportionately in one type of plan rather than another in a perfectly risk-rated world. For

example, evidence from the risk-rated individual insurance market suggests that older buyers are

less likely to choose HMOs or restrictive PPOs relative to less restrictive indemnity plans.

        Traditional modeling in this area has assumed that people do move across plans in

response to employee premium differences. Prior analysis has used two different types of

dependent variables. One more common approach assumes that the probability that an employee

chooses a particular plan in a given time period depends on the difference (measured in various

ways) between that plan’s employee premium and those of other plans (c.f. Barringer and

Mitchell, 1994 who follow Feldman, et al., 1989). Another modeling tactic relates the
                                                                                                    9

probability of switching out of one’s current plan at a given time to the change in the premium

difference between that period and a previous one (c.f. Beaulieu, 2002). Below, we show results

for both “choice” and “switching” outcomes.

       Our empirical evidence is a formal test of the hypothesis that the rate of decline in Plan

100’s share was not affected by the dramatic premium change effected in 1997. To undertake

this test, we estimated a microeconomic multinomial Logit regression using plan choice data for

approximately 65,800 person years over the period 1992-2000. We focus our analysis on in-state

employees who selected one of the offered health insurance plans (thus we omit approximately

10 percent of the sample who selected no plan or no in-state plan.) Two dependent variables are

analyzed: one takes on a value of one if the person was in Plan 100 and zero if the person was in

any other plan; while the other takes on a value of one if the person switched out of Plan 100

between one year and the next, and was zero otherwise.

       Explanatory variables of interest include a measure of the tax-exclusion-adjusted

difference in premiums between Plan 100 and a simple average of all other premiums in the

family/individual category selected. We also include a time trend variable to test for a secular

shift in preferences away from Plan 100, and also we include a count of the number of managed

care plans offered in the period. There was no significant change in the coverage provisions of

healthcare policies offered other than Plan 100, so only that deductible was adjusted to account

roughly for inflation. Since employees received different levels of earnings and therefore would

fall under different marginal tax rates, workers’ healthcare insurance premiums varied over time,

across category, and by income.

       It is important to develop an accurate empirical definition of the employee’s “price” for a

healthcare insurance policy. Naturally, it should reflect the employee’s cost of choosing Plan
                                                                                                      10

100 as well as the price of alternatives to Plan 100. Accordingly, we represent the employee

price of alternatives by a simple average of the employee premiums for all plans other than Plan

100 for the type of insurance (family or self-only) actually chosen by the employee. As Cutler

and Reber (1998) have noted, in a cafeteria plan (such as at this employer), even this premium is

paid out of pre-tax dollars, so the net premium differential is multiplied by (1-m), where m is the

employee’s marginal tax rate. The price measure we use is therefore the tax-adjusted absolute

difference in premiums (DP) between the Plan 100 employee premium and the composite

premium for the offered alternatives.

        If the probability of choosing Plan 100 were a function of this net differential, we would

have variation in premiums across employees related to their tax rate as well as to other causes of

variation We assume that the marginal tax rate on the recorded wage income (on an annual

basis) is a proxy for the true rate. This means, however, that net price is highly correlated with

total earnings, since only the “steps” in the tax structure make correlation less than perfect.

Hence it may be difficult to separately estimate premium and wage (income) effects.

Alternatively, we could specify the price measure as the proportional change in the cross-plan

differential, in which case the marginal tax rate drops out: a $10 increase in a $100 differential is

a 10 percent increase for all workers facing this set of circumstances regardless of the individual

worker’s marginal tax rate. The tax rate also drops out if we use as a price measure the relative

differential (DP/P) or the log of DP, since the regression relates variations in DP relative to the

mean value of DP. Of course these latter price definitions are less correlated with earnings, but

there is also less cross-sectional price variability since the differentials are the same for all

workers choosing a particular type of plan in a given year. While we have no a priori basis for
                                                                                                   11

preferring one functional form to another, the income-related measure is very likely to yield

better goodness-of-fit than the price measures that do not vary as much.



Empirical Findings

       In the empirical model, the multivariate regression equations we examine take the form

(in the levels or changes):

       Plan Choice it = f(DP, t, N, Tenure, F, R, Age, Salary, Interactions),                     (1)

where control variables besides the price differential and the time trend indicate the worker’s age

and salary, whether he was a new hire, and the number of years he worked at the firm. In

addition his policy type (family or single) was included. Of most importance is an indicator of

when the reform was adopted, R, which is also interacted with the premium difference variable.

All variables are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2 here

       Regression coefficients are reported in Table 3. Cross-sectional plan choice results appear

in panel (a), and cross-time plan switching results in panel (b). With the large sample size (more

than 65,800 observations), all regression coefficients are statistically significant at conventional

levels. The results indicate that employee premiums did have a negative effect on demand, and

this effect was larger in absolute value for new employees and after the reform was

implemented; also, it was smaller for family coverage. Of key interest is the time trend, which

indicates a long-term and persistent movement away from Plan 100, even after holding constant

the premium differential and holding other factors. Furthermore, the interaction term (RP = R x

DP) indicates that the movement away from the FFS plan became stronger after the 1997-8
                                                                                                      12

reform: in other words, the absolute value of the price coefficient actually increased between the

two time periods. The increase, however, was small in magnitude.

Table 3 here

        The evidence thus leads us to conclude that the employees in these plans did respond to

premium differentials over time, but that the premium differential favoring of Plan 100 after

1996-7 was offset by a coincident additional shift in demand away from the FFS plan type. The

net effect was a continuation of the erosion as the reform occurred, and an even higher rate of

loss of market share after the change.

        We also investigate the “first difference” behavior embodied in plan switches by

continuing employees given changes in relative premium differences.4 Results appear in panel

(b) of Table 3. The dependent variable here is the (log) odds that an employee drops out of Plan

100, and the premium measure is specified as the change in DP between periods t-1 and t. We

did not first-difference any of the other variables because they were either constant over time or

changed rarely. Results show that the direct effect of changes in the out-of-pocket premium

differential is unexpectedly positive but not statistically significant. It is interesting that the

interaction variable R*DP is highly significant and negative in sign, which signifies that after the

1997 reform, a given Plan 100 premium differential over the other offerings caused more

employees to leave Plan 100, than prior to the reform.



Discussion

        To illustrate our estimated price effects more clearly, we convert Logit effects from the

plan choice regression in Table 3a into elasticity terms; the implied elasticity is approximately -

results to the Cutler-Reber findings, which appear to use the log of DP, we also reestimated the

regression using the log of DP. In this framework, our point estimate for the price elasticity is -

0.3, which is well within the Cutler-Reber range of -0.3 to -0.6. Clearly, the elasticity results

suggest that the behavior of this firm’s employees is not atypical. The most important influence

on Plan 100’s share is the time trend; the (log) odds of being in that plan fell by almost 20

percent (0.17) year after year. Perhaps more importantly, this decline proceeded at an

accelerated pace in the post-reform period, more than doubling in magnitude.

           Naturally, this leads to a key question: what difference did it make to dramatically change

premium risk adjustments? One way to answer this question is to forecast what would have

happened to the premium difference in the absence of reform, and then to evaluate what the

predicted market share might have been. Because there was relatively little change in the

relative premium difference after the reform, we focus on estimating the short-run effect.

           To determine the effect of the premium reforms per se on enrollment, we need to

simulate what would have happened to Plan 100 enrollments in years after the reform, had the

premium differential been set at the (higher) level consistent with previous policy. To do this,

we assume that the ratio of the Plan 100 premium to the average of other premiums remained at

its 1996 value over the next five years. We then use the Logit regression coefficients to predict

the Plan 100 market share in each future period, taking account of the direct effect of prices and

their interaction with time.

           Figure 2 shows the estimated time path of Plan 100 enrollment under this scenario, versus

its actual path through time. The simulations show that enrollment in Plan 100 would have been

somewhat lower than what was actually experienced, especially immediately after the relative

premium increase. However, the Figure shows that the reform delayed the decline in market

share for only a short time. Indeed, by mid-2000, the share would have been virtually the same

with or without the reform. The Figure also indicates what would have happened, had tastes not

shifted against Plan 100 at about the same time as the reform. This difference is somewhat more

durable, but it still converges to a very small fraction after four years.

Conclusions

       In a sense, it appears that this employer’s efforts to institute a risk-adjusted premium

policy for health insurance across all employees suffered from unfortunate timing. This is

because efforts to stabilize Plan 100’s membership appeared to have been swamped by a shift in

tastes adverse to this traditional fee-for-service plan. We cannot formally test whether the timing

of the taste shift was precisely coincidental; more generally, we do not have an explanation of

why this shift occurred. It could reflect some complex interactions with premium changes at the

time of the reform which our differential measures cannot capture.5

       Another possibility is that the simultaneous introduction of the PPO plan in 1995 could

have had an effect above and beyond including its premium in the average premium. It was

fairly generous in its indemnity payments for non-network use. Nevertheless, this argument is

not persuasive since that plan’s market share remained relatively small. Also its introduction

would not explain the continued trend against Plan 100 for several years thereafter, until the end

of the 1990s, when the POS plan arrived on the scene. While some of the alternative plans were

new or nearly so, the two HMOs had been available for years and their provisions (relative to

Plan 100’s) did not change much. Possibly one could hypothesize that the nominal-copayment
                                                                                                                    15

managed care plans may have looked more appealing, relative to the proportional coinsurance

Plan 100, as medical spending rose, but the rate of increase in health insurance spending actually

slowed in this period. A moderately plausible conjecture is that there was some kind of positive

“demonstration effect”: as more workers joined managed care, they may have reassured those

left behind in the old-fashioned plan, thereby inducing further switching.

         Regardless of the specific explanation, the policy message is important: adjusting

premiums to correct for risk selection may well be of second-order importance, compared to

other things affecting employee choice of healthcare plans. The demise of a generous plan is not

necessarily due to adverse selection, even when that plan has been observed to be selected by

higher risk workers. Of course, as prior studies have noted, small differences in premiums may

lead to large adverse selection effects in static theoretical models. But in actual empirical

settings where much is changing, these effects may be swamped. Even if selection is predicted

before the fact, it may be difficult to find afterward. The theoretical models which predict death

spirals, after all, hypothesize that a spiral will result from a linked series of increases in the

relative premium of the more generous plan. They do not imply that, holding premiums constant,

there should be a continuous trend against that more generous plan.

         A question remains as to whether substantial efficiency costs remain, as a result of failure

to risk adjust employee premiums. It is hard to say, since the relevant “elasticity” here concerns

the assignment of individuals to plans, and not inefficient levels of insurance given a plan. At a

minimum, the reform generated few gains to low-risk workers who might have preferred the

indemnity plan. In the end, if the reform did anything, we conclude that it only slightly delayed

the inevitable demise of an outdated benefits design. Adverse selection therefore may not be as

  For example, whatever happened to the Plan 100 employee premium relative to the average of other premiums,
there could have been an especially salient change in the premium relative to one of the options. This is not, in our
