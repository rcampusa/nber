Invention and the Life Course: Age Differences in Patenting

                                           ABSTRACT

Previous research suggests creative ability peaks in the age decades of the 30s and early 40s, and
declines thereafter, with some variation across fields. Building from the cognitive aging literature,
we expect differences in the rate of creation and qualitative nature of creative works by age.
Cognitive processes show aging-related changes with increases in experience-based knowledge
(pragmatics or crystallized abilities) and decreases in the ability to process novel information
quickly and efficiently (mechanics or fluid abilities). We describe a new database created by
combining the publicly available patent data with information on inventor ages scraped from
directory websites on the web for approximately 1.2 million U.S.-resident inventors patenting
between 1976 and 2017. Our results suggest that cross-sectional and within-inventor patenting
rates are similar, peaking at around the early 40s for both women and men. We find varying
results for attributes of patents in relation to age, some of which are consistent with cognitive
aging theory. For solo inventors, backward citations and originality, which are connected to
experience, were found to increase with age. Forward citations, number of claims, and generality
measures, as well as a citation-based measure of disruptiveness decline on average with inventor
age. A similar pattern was found for performance in teams based on the average age of inventors
in the team. Exploration of age diversity showed that teams with a wider age range had patents
that are slightly more important (i.e., with more forward citations). The findings have the
potential to advance scholarship on the life course of innovation with implications for workplace
policies.

1 Introduction


        There is great interest in the implications of an aging workforce, in particular whether the
growing numbers of older workers will have beneficial or adverse consequences for the economy
(National Research Council, 2012). At the same time, there is much discussion about ways to
support older adults remaining longer in the workforce. Government and industry are concerned
that the slower maturation of younger workers and the possible declines in productivity associated
with the aging workforce could have a negative impact on innovation and productivity. There is,
however, no systematic evidence from the broader economy about the inventive abilities of
younger and older workers. Understanding these patterns can have significant implications for
public health and public policy at the level of individuals (work, mentoring and retirement
choices), organizations (retirement policies and structure of collaboration), and the economy as a
whole (consequences of an aging work force for innovation and productivity). This paper examines
how the extent and attributes of patent activity change as inventors age.


         There is a long-standing belief that one's most creative work is done early in adulthood,
peaking between the ages of 30 and 40 (Beard, 1881; Dennis, 1956; 1958; Lehman, 1943;1960).
Economists have studied how creative success varies over the life cycle, with the explicit goal of
understanding the consequences for productivity (Galenson 2003; 2007; Galenson & Weinberg,
2000; 2001; Jones, 2009; 2010; Jones & Weinberg, 2011). Existing evidence on the age-creativity
nexus focuses on the most significant achievements such as major inventions, famous artistic and
literary works, or discoveries leading to a Nobel Prize (e.g. Lehman, 1943; Dennis, 1956;
Simonton, 1988). Other work examines scientific research rather than commercial invention
(Packalen & Bhattacharya, 2015) or looks at innovation in the workplace using small samples with
in-depth cases studies (e.g., Amabile & Kramer, 2011). The only previous studies of patents as a
function of age are in Sweden (Jung & Ejermo, 2014), and two studies looking at a subsample of
US inventors (Jones, 2009, Nager, et. al., 2016). Most of this work is cross-sectional, looking at
the age distribution of creators within samples of achievements. Such analysis confounds how the
abilities of individuals change over their life with selection into and out of the creative activity
(Yu, et al 2019). By looking at 3 million patents associated with 1.4 million inventors over the
period 1976-2018, we can complement cross-sectional comparisons with fixed-effects estimation
that mitigates selection issues.


        Consistent with prior related work, we find that the rate at which inventors successfully
patent rises on average in the first decades of work life, and then begins to decline at around age
40. Surprisingly, however, we find that the nature of inventions changes more or less
monotonically with age, with invention attributes related to experience (backward citations,
originality) rising with age, and patent attributes related to creativity (forward citations,
disruptiveness, generality, and number of claims) falling with age. We find that patents generated
by teams of inventors show patterns basedon the mean age of the team that are consistent with the
patterns that are related to the age of solo inventors. Yet, we did find that the diversity of age within
teams had small effects on the attributes of team patents. The largest effects of age variability




                                                   2
within teams was found for forward citations, suggesting that mixed age teams produce more
important inventions.
        The following section grounds this analysis in the theoretical and empirical literature on
how cognitive abilities change with age. Section 3 describes the construction of the data and
Section 4 provides an overview of the empirical approach. Section 5 presents results, and Section
6 analyzes the robustness of the results to errors introduced in our search for inventor ages. Section
7 provides discussion and Section 8 gives concluding comments. Complete documentation of the
data collection process is given in Kaltenberg, et al (2021)

2 Innovation and the Life Course

 2.1 Invention and cognitive aging

         A prevalent view of older adults is that they are less creative and productive than younger
adults, in part due to their declining cognitive abilities (Belbase, Sanzenbacher, & Gillis, 2015; Ng
& Law, 2014; Ng &Feldman, 2012; Woolever, 2013). There is consistent evidence from studies
of adult development of a shifting balance of gains and losses in cognitive abilities throughout
adulthood (Baltes et al., 2006) with increases in experience-based knowledge (pragmatics or
crystallized abilities-Gc) and decreases in the ability to learn and process new information quickly
and efficiently (mechanics or fluid abilities-Gf; Hartshorne & Germine, 2015; Salthouse, 2009;
Schaie, 2012). Much of this work has been done using standardized cognitive test batteries in
cross-sectional or longitudinal studies or in laboratory studies using experimental designs.
However, little is known about how these ability changes might affect performance on tasks in
daily life, including the work domain (Hertzog, 2020). In one domain, financial decision-making
(Agarwal et al., 2007), there is evidence that midlife (i.e., age 52) is a time of peak ability, despite
age-related declines in memory, speed of processing, and abstract reasoning, suggesting there can
be compensation for declines in the cognitive mechanics (Gf) by drawing on experience and
knowledge (Gc; Lachman et al., 2015; Salthouse, 2012). A possible explanation for performance
peaking in middle age is that this a period when there is an ideal mix of the pragmatics and
mechanics of intellectual abilities, which suggests this would be a likely period of heightened
creativity and inventiveness (Lachman et al., 2014).
    We suggest that the rate of invention (number of patents per year) and the attributes of
invention (citation-based metrics of patent attributes such as, forward citations, backward citations,
disruptiveness, number of claims, originality and generality) are affected by changes in inventors'
cognitive abilities over their lives. In particular, both experience-based knowledge (pragmatics or
crystallized abilities-Gc) and the ability to process new information quickly and efficiently
(mechanics or fluid abilities-Gf) both contribute to success in creative activities such as patenting.
The process of invention, of which patents are an indicator of success, is likely to reflect the
interaction and balance of pragmatics and mechanics in observable ways. Invention is a
cumulative process, in which inventors proceed by building upon and synthesizing what has been
done before (Caballero & Jaffe, 1993), a process likely to be facilitated by a high level of pragmatic



                                                   3
experience (Gc). At the same time, patents are, in principle, only granted for "novel" inventions,
thus requiring a creative spark that is likely to be more common for inventors with a high level of
fluid mechanics (Gf). Weinberg and Galenson (2005) suggest that "experimental" innovators work
inductively based on experience, while "conceptual innovators" work deductively, applying
abstract principles. Jones et al., (2014) recently survey work on the relationship between age and
"genius," emphasizing that creativity peaks in middle age, but there is no research that
systematically studies age patterns within persons over time or within teams to the best of our
knowledge.


    Because of the important contribution of both of Gc and Gf abilities in invention, we expect
that a given inventor's rate of patenting will peak in middle age. The relationship between Gc and
Gf and the characteristics of an inventor's patents is less clear a priori. If a characteristic depends
on both Gc and Gf, then we would expect it similarly to peak in middle age, where inventors can
best draw on both abilities. If, however, a given characteristic is determined largely by only one
form of ability, then we might it expect it to either rise with age (if it depends on Gc) or fall with
age (if it depends on Gf).


2.2    Age Diversity and Innovation in Inventor Teams
    Collaboration in scientific research and invention is an active research area (e.g. Wuchty et al.,
2007; Freeman, et al., 2015; Ahmadpoor and Jones, 2019). One theory suggesting the need for
increased collaboration is the "burden of knowledge" (Jones, 2009), i.e. the rapid advance of
science means more needs to be known to advance further. This suggests that differences in
accumulated experience vs. newly acquired knowledge connected to age might play an important
role in overall research team performance. In the realm of scientific research collaborations,
researchers explore ethnicity (Freeman & Huang, 2014), benefits of international collaboration
(Adams, 2013), and the comparative impact of collaborative and non-collaborative research (Hsu
& Huang, 2011). Packalen and Bhattacharya (2015) find that scientific papers with a young first
author and a more experienced last author are more likely to try out newer ideas than papers
published by other age configurations. More recently, Yu, et al (2019) look at the citations received
by a large number of papers in health sciences as a function of the `career age' of the first and last
authors. They find the typical `inverted-U' in the raw data, but steadily declining `quality' with
age once author fixed effects were used to control for unobservable inventor characteristics. With
respect to patents, Jaravel, et al., (2015) show that inventor teams are age-heterogeneous, but they
do not have data on inventors' participation in teams with different age compositions over time,
and so do not consider how life course changes (e.g., cognitive aging) could affect patenting
activity.


   Given the aging of the population and the increased number of older adults remaining in the
workforce beyond traditional retirement age, there has been interest in examining the effects of



                                                  4
age diversity in the workplace (Salas, & Paoletti, 2019). The results generally show there are
benefits to having age diversity for innovation and productivity (Gomez et al., 2019; Hammermann
et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). Yet, there are also moderating factors such as firm size, job security
and type of industry that affect whether or not diversity is beneficial (Garnero et al., 2014
Meulenaere et al., 2015).


    The relationship between team age structure and patent attributes should, again, be conditioned
by how the attributes are related to Gc and Gf. If there are attributes that depend on both forms of
ability, this suggests the theoretical possibility of age complementarity or benefits of age diversity.
That is, we would expect that attributes requiring both Gc and Gf might be most easitly produced
by teams who have younger members (with high Gf) and older members with high Gc or primarily
middle-aged adults, who typically would have moderate to high levels of both Gc and Gf. The
patent data set we present in this paper allows us to examine whether the productivity of workers
differs when participating in age-heterogeneous vs. age-homogeneous teams.


   3   Data

       We used the USPTO Dataset from patentsview.org. This dataset covers all patents granted
between 1976-2018 and contains 8,080,135 patent-inventor pairs with 3,648,663 patents and
1,858,516 inventors.

        Using disambiguated names and the location of the inventor provided on the patent
application, we searched for ages from three directory websites, Radaris, Spokeo and Beenverified.
If the website has information about that person (or someone with that name in that location), we
extracted the first and last names (including any aliases), middle name or initial, city, state, and
age, and computed a similarity score to the information in our database for each result.

        We were able to capture age information by exactly matching the first and last name of the
inventor with their associated location in 72% of inventors in Radaris, 65% of inventors for Spokeo
and 66% of inventors for Beenverified. For a subset of inventors, we also searched for additional
ages using the website Peoplefinder. Across all databases, we found at least one age to be
associated with a name and location for approximately 93% of the inventors in the dataset. About
30% of the age results are consistent across at least three web-scraped sources. In Section 6, we
present an analysis of the extent to which the inventors we failed to find differ systematically from
those we did find.

       After scraping the web for age related information, we created a few heuristics to calculate
ages where there is disagreement between the sources we scraped. We use the average of all the
ages we identify for a given inventor, if the difference was less than three years. We subtracted the
age from 2018, the year the searches were done, to calculate the birth year of the inventor.



                                                  5
        We calculated an inventor's age at patenting by subtracting their birth year from the year
that they applied for each patent. We limited our dataset so that we exclude inventors for whom
the age we found suggests that they applied for a patent before age 15 or above 89, as patents at
ages outside that range would be highly unlikely. After this procedure, we are left with 1,508,676
inventors with age information holding 3,383,594 patents.1 In Section 6, we consider whether the
possibility of matching errors in the data construction is likely to be having a significant impact
on the results.


4 Methods

        We looked at two aspects of inventor patent information, the rate of patenting and the
patenting attributes throughout the life course. This requires two different methods of analysis and
datasets which we discuss in the remainder of this section.

   4.1 Rate of Patenting over the life course
         To study an inventor's rate of patenting over their life course we created a panel dataset
that follows inventors patenting activity over their lifetime. This dataset covers patent applications
from 1974-2017. We excluded a small number of patents applied for after 2017 as most such
applications would not have been granted within the 2018 data cutoff. If an inventor had not
patented in a given year, they have zero patents listed, but if they were not alive in that time period
they are marked as missing in that year.

        We normalize patent counts to account for the fact that the number of patents granted
increased over time. We use the number of utility patent applications of U.S. origin per capita per
year as the normalization factor and use the year 2012 as the base year. Thus, all patents are relative
to patent applications per capita in 2012.

        We counted patents two different ways when looking at an inventor's rate of patenting. A
general count, which counts every patent on which the individual appeared as an inventor in a
given year. We call this the non-fractionalized patent count. Given that teamwork is an important
factor in patenting activity, we also calculated fractionalized patents, for which each patent counts
only as the reciprocal of the team size. Thus an inventor who appeared in. a given year on one solo
patent, one with 1 other inventor and 1 as part of a team of 5 would have a non-fractionalized count
of 3 and a fractionalized count of 1.7 in that year.

        To estimate the rate of patenting of inventors over their life course we used an inventor
fixed effects model with age dummies, which we also estimated by gender and technological field.

                                                  6
         To estimate the rate of patenting of inventors over their life course we used an inventor
fixed effects model with age dummies, which we also estimated by gender and technological field.
Gender is assigned using an algorithm by Blevins & Mullen (2015), which uses the US Social
Security database to estimate the probability of a person being male or female given their first
name and birthyear. We used the NBER classification of technological field (Jaffe, Hall,
Trajtenberg, 2001). Since technological field is given at the patent level and inventors can have
more than one patent in a given age category, we used the technological field of the majority of
patents an inventor patented at that age. They continue with that technological field throughout
their life until the majority of their patents in an age is higher in another technological field. The
simple model to estimate the rate of patenting of inventors is:

Equation 1

                                       =    +  + 

         where  is the inventor and  is the age of the inventor when they patented.  is the
fractionalized or non-fractionalized patent count for that inventor at that age.  is a dummy
variable set to unity for observations corresponding to age .  is the inventor fixed effect. That
is, rather than estimating some parametric form for the relationship between patent production and
age, we allow each age to have its own average productivity. Lastly,  is the error term. We use
cluster robust standard errors.

   4.2 Patent attributes
          We observe the attributes of patenting activity throughout an inventor's lifetime by using
citation-based indicators: forward citations, backward citations, number of total claims,
disruptiveness, generality, and originality. Forward and backward citations and the number of
independent claims are provided by the USPTO through patentsview. The number of forward
citations received by a patent are widely used as a measure of `importance' and the number of
backward citations made by the patent indicate the depth of connection to previous technology.
Generality and originality are measures of the technological diversity of, respectively, the forward
and backward citations. They are calculated as one minus the sum of squared shares of patents by
patent class, so they are equal to zero if all of the citing/cited patents are in the same class, and
they approach one as the patents are spread across classes (Trajtenberg, et al, 1997; Squicciarini,
et al, 2013). 2
          The claims in a patent represent the legal statement(s) as to what object, composition or
method is specifically claimed for patent protection. A larger number of claims may indicate an
invention of broader scope, and the number of claims has been used as an indicator of patent scope



2The simple calculation of generality and originality is biased towards towards zero for patents with few citations.
We apply the bias correction described in Hall, et al (2001) to correct for this bias.



                                                          7
or breadth. (Squicciarini, et al, 2013). 3 Because the number of citations and the number of claims
in U.S. patents varies by technology field and has been rising over time, we normalize these three
measures by dividing the actual number by the mean for that indicator across all patents applied
for in the given year and patent class. In order to calculate these citation metrics, we include only
patents granted before 2016 as more recent years of patent citations are more likely to have errors
and are left with 2,532,562 patents.
          The disruptiveness measure was proposed by Funk & Owen-Smith (2016). This metric,
which they call the CD index, captures the extent to which the patent represents an important new
technology trajectory. It is based on the extent to which the patents represented by the forward
citations also cite the patents represented by the backward citations. It ranges between the value of
-1 (all of the patents making the forward citations also contain citations to patents receiving the
backward citations--minimally disruptive) to 1 (none of the patents making the forward citations
contain citations to the patents receiving the backward citations--maximally disruptive).

        For our analysis, we consider two aspects of patent attributes, patenting that is solo-
authored, and patenting by all inventors.

         4.2.1 Solo-authored inventors
         We begin with an analysis of single-inventor patents to understand patent attributes over
the life course at the individual level. The data include 439,822 inventors holding 763,917 solo-
inventor patents for which we have patent attribute information. We estimate the following model:

Equation 2

                               =    +    +  + 

        This model estimates the patent attribute measure  for patent p invented by inventor i.
Dummies for each age are included as before, allowing for a completely flexible relationship
between age and each indicator variable. We include inventor fixed effects,  so that we are
estimating the differential productivity of inventors or the life course rather than the cross-sectional
difference between given inventors at a certain age. Last,  is the error term.

       4.2.2 All inventors
       Our second estimation strategy for patent attribute looks at team age compositions and their
impact on patent attributes. For this analysis, we include all patents for which we know all of the



3 Claims can be `independent' or `dependent'. Dependent claims narrow the scope of the independent claim on
which they depend. Thus, the number of independent claims is probably a better measure of patent scope than the
total number of claims. However, the Patentsview website did not have a consistent time series for independent
claims as of the time of this analysis.



                                                        8
ages of the inventors associated with that patent, which leaves us with 2,532,594 patents. 4 Our
estimation model is at the patent level, and is as follows:

Equation 3

      =    +   + 2  +    +    +  + 

         We estimate how the patent attribute measure  varies with the mean age of the members
of the inventor team, using dummies for mean age rounded to the nearest integer, to allow complete
flexibility in the shape of the age-attribute relationship as before. We also include the standard
deviation of age across the members of the team in order to test for effects of age heterogeneity
within the team. 5 Although there are other measures used to examine age diversity (e.g., Blau
index, coefficient of variation), the standard deviation has been suggested as most appropriate to
examine the extent of age separation in a team in contrast to the disparity or variety (Harrison &
Klein, 2007; Orlando and Shelor, 2002; Solanis et al., 2012). We were most interested in whether
having both younger and older adults on the same team would be an advantage, given that they
would bring different cognitive abilities. Thus, given our focus on the potentially complementary
skills brought by younger and older adults, we examined whether diversity in terms of a larger
degree of age separation on teams would be associated with higher quality patents. Gender is the
fraction of the team members who are female. Previous work has found that citations and other
significance measures are increasing in the size of the inventor team, so we include a full set of
dummies for each team size up to 8. We also include year ( ), field ( ) and inventor
( ) fixed effects. Field is the NBER technological field assigned to that patent. Year is the
application year of the patent. We use robust standard errors, and the error term included is  .

Estimation of Eq. (3) presents computational challenges because of the unusual way in which the
inventor fixed effects enter. Unlike the typical panel data situation, each inventor is connected to
a varying number of patents, and each patent has a varying cast of associated inventors. This makes
estimation by demeaning or absorbing the fixed effects impossible. In principle, it could be
estimated including dummy variables for each inventors, but the very large number of inventors
makes this infeasible. To solve this problem, we partialed out each variable with respect to each



4 We exclude the very small number (1.20%) of patents with more than 8 inventors, as it is not clear how to think
about the effects of age composition for large teams.
5 Theoretically, the effect of age heterogeneity on team performance could be more complex than would be

captured by simply including the standard deviation of age, particularly if the age-attribute relationship is
nonmonotonic at the individual level. We did test for such effects by estimating versions of the model with
dummies for particular combinations of ages, e.g. teams with someone below 35 and someone over 50. These age-
combination effects were always close in magnitude to the simple average of the effects associated with the
groups being combined. This is not surprising ex post; as discussed below, we find the age-attribute relationships in
the individual regressions to be monotonic.

of the covariates to reflect the contribution of the average patent quality of each inventor. The
approach is similar to solving high-dimensional fixed effects by Correia (2017). 6

   5   Results

   5.1 Overview
5.1.1 Patenting rate over life course dataset
        Given that our dataset introduces a new variable to the patent literature, we begin our
discussion of results by describing the age information contained in our new dataset and other
descriptive statistics on teams and age composition. Below, Figure 1 provides an overview of the
distribution of patents by ages and gender of inventors. Patents are normalized with respect to the
number of applications per year per capita relative to 2012 patenting activity in order to remove
the effect of the overall increasing rate of patenting with time. For this purpose, multi-inventor
patents are `credited' fully to each inventor on the team. Patenting activity peaks in the early 40s
for men and slightly earlier for women in the late 30s. It is also noteworthy that both men and
women continue to patent throughout adulthood in later life, although at lower rates. Overall,
men patent more than women beginning at about age 26 through the late 70s. At their peaks, the
average male inventor in the dataset is associated with about one patent every four years, and the
average female about one every six years.

Figure 1 Patenting Activity by Age and Gender (patents per year per inventor, normalized to the
overall patenting rate in 2012)
     5.1.2 Career Inventors' and patenting activity
         Previous work on the life course of patenting often uses elapsed time since the year of first
patent as a proxy for age (Allen et al, 2007). We explore the validity of this relationship by looking
at the age of first patent for "career" inventors, defined as those with more than one patent in their
life time. Figure 2 only presents information for people who are born after 1959 to minimize bias
caused by censoring. 7 For most career inventors, their first patent is in their late 20s or early 30s,
but there are a significant number of inventors that begin patenting in their 40s and beyond. Thus,
the data suggest it is not appropriate to assume that the first patent occurs near the start of the
inventor's professional career, as others have done (Allen et al, 2007, Wu et al, 2018).




7   Inventors born before 1959 could plausibly have had their first patent before our data start in the mid 1970s.

Figure 2 Age at first patent for inventors with multiple patents
         Previous work on the `burden of knowledge' has shown that the age at which scientists
get their first publications and NIH research has been increasing over the past few decades
(Jones, 2009). Figure 3 presents an analogous comparison for first patents. It shows the opposite
trend, with the age at first patent for inventors with multiple patents being younger in the most
recent decade than the previous decade. There are several possible explanations for this. First,
the overall rate of patenting has been rising rapidly, possibly suggesting that the USPTO
standard for granting a patent has been falling. This might lead to younger inventors having their
first success at a lower age. Second, inventor team sizes have been rising; since we give full
credit to all inventors on a team, this may have lead to it being easier for a younger inventor to
get their name on a patent earlier in their career.

An important advantage of our dataset to understand patenting patterns over the life course is that
it uses a disambiguated dataset in which individuals who have multiple patents throughout their
lifetime can be linked over time. The patentsview dataset uses a disambiguation algorithm, which
tries to identify if someone with the same name is the same person who authored multiple patents
or if they are actually different people (Monath, McCallum et. al., 2015). The algorithm considers
name spelling, patent title/abstracts, location, assignee (firm or university affiliation), and co-
inventors to help identify unique inventors across time. Almost half of the inventors in the dataset
have only a single patent, but given the size of the dataset there are still tens of thousands of
inventors with multiple patents as presented in Figure 4. This fact enables within-person
longitudinal analysis which we discuss in section 5.2. It is noteworthy that there are many fewer
women inventors with multiple patents.




Figure 4 Lifetime Total Patents by Inventor
   5.2 Rate of patenting over the life course
        We estimate the rate of patenting of inventors over their life course using a fixed effects
model as presented in Eq. (1). For all our estimates, the reference group is age 41. Every estimate
we provide in this section is significant at the .01% level. Much previous work on age and
creativity has been based on cross-sectional rather than longitudinal comparisons. It is therefore
interesting to compare the fixed effects results to the raw counts by age of inventor, to see how
much difference controlling for the heterogeneous quality of inventors makes.
        As noted, in counting inventors' productivity, we need to choose how to count multi-
inventor patents. We can count multi-inventor patents as a full patent credited to each of its
inventors, or we can fractionalize the patent counts, so that each inventor gets credit for 1/n of a
patent, where n is the number of inventors on the patent. The age-patenting profiles produced by
the two methods might differ, particularly if inventors of different ages have systematically
different proclivities to participate in teams (a question we explore further below). As it turns out,
the age profiles for fractionalized and non-fractionalized counts are quite similar. For brevity we
display here the results for the fractionalized counts; the profiles for the non-fractionalized counts
are presented in Appendix Figure A1.



                                                 14
        Figures 5a and 5b compare the patenting-age profiles for the raw data and the fixed effect
estimates. The profiles are remarkably similar. We might have thought, for example, that there is
some amount of patenting at young ages by people who really are not very good inventors, who
then figure out that they are not good at it and drop out. To the extent this were true, it would
generate an apparent decline in patenting with age that would disappear in the fixed effects
estimates, because the latter measure only the relative rate of patenting at different ages for a given
inventor. The fact that the fixed-effect estimates are so similar to the raw data suggests that
selection out of (or into) patenting activity is not highly correlated with innate ability to patent.

(fractionalized patent count)

    5.2.1 Patenting rate by technological field
    We also explore patenting rates across technological fields using our fixed effects regression,
but running a separate regression for technological field and gender. Technological fields are given
by the NBER technological fields originating from Jaffe, Hall, and Trajtenberg (2001). There are
six technological fields identified, chemical, drugs and medical, computers and communication,
electrical and electronic, mechanical and other. Some technological field codes were missing,
which we include in our results for transparency. Since we are unable to understand why they are
missing, we do not discuss their results in detail. There are 39,447 female inventors who fell in the
missing category and 300,668 male inventors. Figure 6 provides an overview of patenting rates by
age and field separately for men and women.

             The fields with the most patenting activities for women and men are in chemical, and drugs
    & medical technologies. However, women tend to patent more in drugs & medical throughout
    their lifetimes as compared to men who tend to patent more in drugs & medical starting in their
    mid-life. Patenting activity has similar patterns in electrical & electronics, mechanical, computers
    & communications and other fields for both men and women.

      5.3 Patent attributes over the life course for solo inventors
            We now turn to our results on the changes of patent attributes over an inventor's life course
    by looking at single authored patents over the life course of an inventor. Figures 7-12 display the
    coefficients on the age dummies from estimating Eq. (2) for the six patent attributes. The omitted
    age is 41, so all of the estimates represent the average difference at a given age relative to average
    age 41. The estimates are from regressions with inventor fixed effects, so the interpretation of the
    coefficients is the relative performance for a given inventor at different ages 8 Complete regression
    results are presented in Appendix Table A1. None of these attributes exhibits a pattern of rising to
    a peak in middle age and then declining, as found for the frequency of patenting. Forward citations,
    number of claims, disruptiveness and generality all exhibit monotonic decline in age, except for
    some `noise' in the estimates at very young and very old ages, likely due to the relatively small
    number of observations at those ages. In contrast, backward citations and originality show a
    monotonic increase (again after noisy estimates below age 20), peaking at about age 70, with some
    evidence of a decline after that.
            The effects for forward citations, disruptiveness, backward citations generality and
    originality are quite large. Because the citation counts have normalized relative to the mean for the
    technology-year cohort, the estimated forward citations coefficient of about .5 ages in the early
    20s indicate that on average a given inventor's patents receive about 50% more citations at this



    8
        Estimates without inventor fixed effects (not reported) are not qualitatively different.



                                                                 17
age than that inventor's patents when they are 41; when the inventor reaches their late 50s, their
patents will receive about half as many as at age 41.
         As noted, disruptiveness is bounded between -1 and 1; its standard deviation in our dataset
is .275. The estimates indicate that the patents of the inventor in their early 20s are about .2 more
disruptive, and those of the inventor in their early 60s .3 less disruptive, than those of a 41-year
old. For backward citations, the average rate of citations made by an inventor in their mid 60s is
about 1.4 times the number for an inventor in their early twenties. Generality and originality both
vary from zero (all citations in the same technical field) to an asymptote of one (citations infinitely
distributed across different fields). So the decrease in generality of about .6 and the increase in
originality of about .4 are quite large.
         The effect for number of claims, while quite monotonic is quite small: a decrease of
something like .2 claims on average over the life course, against an average number of claims of
about 1.14.
         The findings of monotonic relationships with age for all of these attributes suggests that
each attribute is linked more strongly to one or the other of the cognitive abilites Gf and Gc.
Forward citations--which is typically interpreted as capturing technological impact or
importance--and disruptiveness seem to be linked to fluid intelligence (Gf or the ability to learn
and process new information quickly and efficiently), which makes sense if such rapid thinking
and processing is the source of important new concepts. Backward citations appear closely linked
to crystalized intelligence (Gc or experience-based knowledge), which makes sense if more
experienced inventors produce new inventions more thoroughly grounded in previous technology. 9
It is less clear to us why the number of claims would be linked to fluid intelligence, but since the
effect is small in magnitude the connection appears insignificant in any case. Finally generality
(the technological diversity of the forward citations) appears linked to Gf and originality (the
technological diversity of the backward citations) appears linked to Gc. We note in this regard that
the nomenclature of `originality' and `generality' is conventional and is based on an untested
notion that inventions that connect to a wide diversity of earlier technologies can be thought of as
`original' and those that connect to a wide range of future technologies can be thought of as
`general'. The empirical fact is that as inventors age, their inventions tend to draw on a a wider
range of technological fields, but are connected to a narrower technological range of future
inventions. Our data do not themselves provide any interpretation of these tendencies.




9
  Note that patent citations differ from citations in scholarly papers in that they are placed in the patent by the patent
examiner, based on a combination of citations noted by the applicant and the examiner's own search of the prior art.
Depending on the time period, something like half of citations are added by the examiner. Thus, the finding of a
higher rate of citation by older inventors does not mean (only) that they literally are more knowledgeable about prior
patents, but more generally that they are undertaking inventions that are more extensively connected to prior
technology.

     5. 4 Team composition and patent attributes

    5.4.1 Patenting activity and teamsize
        Teamwork is an important part of patenting activity. Figure 13 shows the fraction of each
inventor's patents that came from a team, and the average team size (for those patents that were
not solo), as a function of age and gender. Teamwork is quite common; overall about 80% of a
given male inventor's patents come from a team, and 90% for women.10 There is a slight tendency
for the likelihood of being on a team to decline with age, particularly after about age 50. Men
experience teams with an average size of about 4; for women about 4.5. There is little systematic
variation in the size of teams over their life course for either gender.




                              Figure 13 Inventor Team size by age and gender
        5.4.2 Age and gender composition of teams and attributes
        We turn now to estimation of the relationship between team age composition and patent
attributes using Eq. (3). The resulting mean age dummy coefficient estimates from the inventor-
fixed-effects regression are displayed in Figures 14-19. Complete regression results are presented
in Table 2. The Figures all show patterns qualitatively quite similar to the corresponding Figure
for the solo-inventor patents. The effects are, however, quantitatively larger except for


10
  This is not saying that 80-90% of patents are team patents. As noted above, solo inventor patents are about
33.23% of the total in our sample. But when looked at from the perspective of the inventors, each multiple-inventor
patent is counted multiple times, so the fraction of inventor experiences that are on teams is higher than the fraction
of patents from teams.

disruptiveness. Comparing a team with average age of 25 to one whose average age is 60, the
former produces patents that on average receive about 4 times as many forward citations, make
about 1 more claim, exhibit disruptiveness about .5 higher, make about one quarter the number of
backward citations, have about .2 less originality, and have about .05 more generality . The
generally larger effects are perhaps not surprising, as a team of several people with an average age
of 20 (or 60) is more unusual than a single inventor having that age. This rarity of extreme values
of the average is also the reason why the estimates are noisy for average ages below 25 and above
70.

        As seen in Table 2, larger inventor teams produce patents that make more backward
citations, receive more forward citations and have more claims. The magnitude of the team size
effects are significant, but generally not as large as the age effects. For example, the difference
between the youngest and oldest teams in terms of forward citations is on the order of a factor of
4, whereas the difference between a team of 8 and a team of 2 is a factor of about 1.75. Team size
is an important factor in all of the measures. For forward citations, backward citations, number of
claims, generality, and originality, larger teams have higher outcomes. However, smaller teams,
especially solo-authors, tend to have more disruptive patents than larger groups.

        The gender composition of teams does not have a measurable association with any of these
attributes. Age diversity (as measured by the standard deviation) has a positive coefficient with
respect to forward citations, claims, generality and originality, and a negative coefficient for
disruptiveness and backward citations. All of these estimates are statistically significant but with
the exception of forward citations, the effects are quite small. For forward citations, the estimate
is small but not trivial. Consider a hypothetical team of four 40-year olds, and the hypothetical
replacement of one of these with a 20-year old and one with a 60-year old. This would increase
the standard deviation of age on this team by about 16, which, by the estimate in Table 2, would
increase the expected forward citations by about 25%--a noticeable increase associated with a
possible (though admittedly rather extreme) increase in team age diversity. Thus, for a given
average age of team membership, greater diversity, i.e., a wider age range, is associated with a
modestly higher level of forward citations, often used as a measure of patent quality.

        The standard deviation of age on a team is an arbitrary measure of age variation. As a
different way of looking for effects of age composition of teams on team performance, we
examined whether (controlling for team size), specific combinations of ages (younger with older,
younger with middle age, middle age with older) exhibit differences in average patent attributes.
We found that average performances on the difference attributes for such combinations were very
close to the mean of the performance of solo inventors with each attribute. For example, a team
with an older and a younger member had average forward citations very close to halfway between
the mean for an older solo inventor and an a younger solo inventor. Thus this approach provided
no additional evidence of meaningful complementarities or other interactions between inventors
of different ages on a given team.


6 Robustness Checks

        Our matching of web-scraped ages to the patent data potentially creates measurement
problems that could affect our results. First, to the extent that the inventors that were matched
differ systematically from those that could not be matched, our results could be unrepresentative
of the underlying population. Second, some of the matches are likely mis-matches, meaning that
age in the dataset is likely measured with some amount of error. This could bias the estimates of



                                                25
the relationship between age and the variables of interest. Measuring the size of these problems
would require, by definition, information we don't have, so we cannot ultimately determine how
serious they are. In this section we undertake two analyses that do not fundamentally measure the
size of these problems, but which do shed light on whether they are likely to seriously bias the
results.

        To address the issue of selection based on successful matching of the inventor to
individuals with ages found on the web, we simply compare those patent-inventor pairs that were
matched to those that were not using all available information. Table 4 presents a logistic
regression of age found/not found for each patent-inventor pair, using as regressors all observable
attributes of the patent-inventor pair and displays the average partial effects. The results suggest
that the only variable that has an impact on predicting our ability to find an age for an individual
is gender. Other variables--patent attributes, year of application, team size or field of the patent--
have effects that are statistically distinguishable from zero because of the large sample size, but
which are small in magnitude. Finding the age of women, in particular, can be particularly difficult
because women are more likely to change their name throughout their lifetime. In addition, we
rely on two algorithms ­ one that pools patents to a unique inventor, and another that identifies
gender. It is possible that a woman patents under two different names and consequently, that
algorithm creates two separate inventor ids. As a result, there may be more difficulty in finding
ages for women as there may be more public information for one name than a another.

        To address the possible effect of age mismeasurement within the dataset of matched
inventors, we explore empirically the extent to which the re sults seem to change using
subsamples of the data in which the extent of age mismeasurement is likely to be low and high.
For a `low measurement error' sample, we utilize those inventors that were successfully matched
to invididuals on 3 different web sites, and for which we found the same birth date on all three
sites. We also require that the match on all three sites was exact, including middle initial, state,
and city. This `low measurement error' sample is a sub-sample of the data used for the analysis
above. For a `high measurement error' sample, we utilize those inventors for which we found
matches on different web sites, with the different web sites indicating different birth dates for the
individual. These inventors were not used in the analysis above, but for this robustness check we
choose one of the differing birth dates at random and include them in the anslysis as if it were the
correct birth date. While we do not know exactly how much measurement error is in these datasets,
we are confident that the `low measurement error' sample has less than our baseline analysis
dataset (which includes, for example, many inventors that were found on only one site), which in
turn has less measurement error than the `high measurement error' sample.




Figure 20 Patenting Activity by measurement error sample, Estimated with Inventor Fixed Effects
(fractionalized patent count)


        Figure 20 shows the results for the fixed-effect estimates of the rate of patent production
over the life course. For the prime work years of 25-65, the estimates are essentially
indistinguishable. They deviate modestly for very young and very old inventors, likely because of




                                                 28
relatively small sample sizes. But because of this sample size issue, we had already chosen not to
place much weight on these estimates in the tails of the age distribution.




Figure 21 Normalized forward citations by measurement error sample, Estimated with Inventor
                                       Fixed Effects
       Figure 21 shows analogous results for the forward citation team patent regression. Here the
range of ages for which all three sets of results track closely is somewhat narrower, roughly age
30 to 50. For ages below 30 the low measurement error results show an even larger advantage for
the younger inventors. For ages 50-60, both the high and low measurement error groups show an
even more rapid decline than our baseline results.

        Overall, these results suggest that measurement error may have some effect on the exact
magnitude of the age effects, particularly for the lowest and highest age groups. However, the
qualitative picture of the results is quite robust even to what seems like quite a large swing in the
amount of measurement error present in the data.

7 Discussion
        We contribute to the literature on creativity and aging, by exploring how the extent and
qualitative nature of patents changes as inventors age. Because of the size and richness of our data,
we are able to explore several important dimensions of this relationship. First, we have longitudinal
data on many inventors over many years, which allows us to resolve the extent to which apparent
patterns in the data are due to variations across individuals as distinct from variations with age for
a given individual. Second, we have data on several different qualitative attributes of patents,




                                                 29
which allows us to examine not just how the rate of creativity activity changes as people age, but
also how the nature of those activities change. Finally, because we observe inventors participating
in many changing inventor teams over time, we can explore how the ages of the members of a
team interact to affect the activities of the team.

        We first confirm the previously observed pattern, from more exceptional or specialized
samples including geniuses, that the rate of patenting peaks at approximately age 40. This pattern
is similar for men and women, and it is similar when viewed longitudinally. Interestingly, we find
that the age at which inventors get their first patent has been falling over the last couple of decades,
in contrast to scientific research where the age of first publication has been rising.

        When we look at how the attributes of patents vary with the age of their inventors, we find
clear and monotonic relationships for all of the attributes we examined. As inventors age, they
produce patents that yield more forward citations, are more disruptive of the existing technology,
and which have slightly broader scope as measured by the number of claims. For forward citations
and disruptiveness these effects are quantitatively large, bigger, for example than the effects
previously identified as associated with the size of inventor teams.

        The number of backward citations and originality, on the other hand, rise significantly as
inventors age. While it is perhaps surprising that all of these attributes exhibit monotonic
relationships while the rate of patenting rises and then falls after a peak in middle age, the particular
pattern of associations confirms the relavence of the formulation of cognitive aging process in
terms of rising crystallized intelligence and declining fluid intelligence, assuming we are
comfortable associating forward citations, generality, and disruptiveness with fluid intelligence
and backward citations and origianality with crystalized intelligence. As Hertzog (2020) has
pointed out, the increased knowledge and expertise associated with later life may also restrict the
number of important or novel contributions. Older inventors may work on incremental changes to
ideas or patents developed earlier in life, rather than beginning a novel and revolutionary or
disruptive line of work

        Turning to the analysis of teams, the results are straightforward. In terms of age effects,
teams behave pretty much as the average of their members. Teams with lower average age produce
patents that receive more forward citations, are more disruptive, general, and have somewhat more
claims. Teams with older members produce patents that make more backward citations and more
originality.With regard to age heterogeneity of teams, for forward citations there is a small
but non-trivial effect of age diversity that can be layered on top of these larger effects associated
with average age. That is, for a given average age, greater diversity is associated with a modestly
higher level of forward citations.

                  There has been some mixed evidence for the role of age and diversity with regard
to innovation. For example, Hammermann et al., (2019) found that the average age of



                                                   30
a company's workforce had a negative impact on innovation, but age diversity measured
by the standard deviation of age increases the innovation of a company. Moreover, the
effects of age diversity vary as a function of the type of work that is being done (Garnero
et al., 2014). Thus, in future work it will be of interest to explore the role of team age
diversity across different technological fields.

        The team results are not surprising given the nature of the associations between
age and attributes at the individual level. If a given attribute required a mixture of Gc
and Gf, then we might expect that more age diverse teams combining older and younger
members could rely on the respective strengths of each. But if a given attribute required
an emphasis on one component of intelligence, then we would expect performance with
respect to that attribute to change with age monotonically. Our finding that all attributes
change monotonically with age suggests that each attribute depends primarily on only
one aspect of intelligence as the patterns by average age of the team members are
consistent with that found for solo inventors of that age. At the same time, however, a
wider age range seems to have a small advantage for the quality of an invention.

         In interpreting our results, several constraints and caveats should be kept in mind.
There are questions of the importance or significance of the inventive activity, and the
generalizability of findings about invention to other domains. Invention is economically
important because of its crucial role in technological change and economic growth.
Inventors represent a large and important group of professional workers, and our
analysis is based on many more individuals than have been used in previous research on
these topics. Although we cannot know how similar they are to other professional
workers, they nonetheless represent a significant expansion in the scale and scope of
activities for which these patterns have been studied.

        Another issue is that at present we do not have other information about the
inventors. There are limitations on our ability to distinguish the direct effect of age on
cognitive function from effects on the rate of patenting that might be associated with
other age-related changes such as disease, marital/parental status, or transition out of
inventive activity into management or early retirement. Some of these effects (e.g.
cognitive decline due to disease) are closely connected to age-related decline. Other
effects (e.g. people become managers later in life) are unconnected to cognitive decline
but might still plausibly reduce the rate of patenting of older inventors. It is less obvious,
however, that these non-cognitive changes would affect our measures of patent
attributes. The attributes of the (possibly smaller number of) patents that older workers
get should be unaffected, so our conclusions about the effects of age on patent attributes
should not be biased. Nonetheless, we view the age/patent-creativity relationship as an
association rather than a causal relationship.




                                                   31
        Creation and cleaning of these data open up many other avenues for future
research. For example, much work on research productivity effectively treats `age' and
`experience' interchangeably, using a variable often defined as years since PhD, or years
since first patent or paper. These data allow exploration of the interacting effects of
chronological age and experience defined in terms of previous patenting activity. More
generally, the disambiguated inventor names and associated information can be used to
search for and merge in other inventor attributes such as educational attainment or work
history, allowing for broad and varied exploration of how inventive behavior evolves
over the life course.

8 Conclusions

         By adding information about age and gender to the U.S. patent database, we are able to
show the age and gender distributions of inventors over a period of 40 years. This allows us to
examine how creative productivity varies both between and within persons. We find that about 6%
of the inventors for whom we found ages are granted patents after age 65. About 22% of the sample
received their first patent after age 50. In addition, the new data provide interesting information
about how the attributes of inventions vary across age and the age heterogeneity in teams. We find
that older workers bring different innovative skills to bear on the inventive process than younger
adults. Moreover, teams that include a wider age range have some advantage compared to age
homogeneous teams in terms of producing more widely cited inventions. The results have
implications for work and retirement choices and employer policies such as maintaining older
workers longer and including them in mixed age teams.

         We expect findings from this project have the potential to advance the scholarship on
creativity and aging, but also to generate policy implications for promoting and acknowledging
the life course of innovation in the workplace. The results show that although more inventions are
made by those in early and middle adulthood, there are many older adults who continue to receive
patents for inventions, working alone or in mixed age teams. The inventions by younger adults
are cited more widely by future patents. In contrast, inventions by older adults draw more heavily
on a wider range of previous inventions. This suggests that inventions of older adults rely more
on connections and integration with earlier patents, which depends on having more expansive
knowledge and experience. Although we did not find strong evidence for the added value of mixed
age teams, there was some evidence that teams with a more diverse age range had patents that are
more important (i.e., with more forward citations). Future work that explores these relationships
within different technology fields may help to clarify the contributions of age diversity.
