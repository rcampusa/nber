                                          ABSTRACT

Improvements in energy efficiency reduce the cost of consuming services from household cars
and appliances and can result in a positive rebound effect that offsets part of the direct energy
savings. We use a general equilibrium model to derive analytical expressions that allow us to
compare rebound effects from a costless technology shock to those from a costly energy
efficiency mandate. We decompose each total effect on the use of energy into components that
include a direct efficiency effect, direct rebound effect, and indirect rebound effect. We
investigate which factors determine the sign and magnitude of each. We show that rebound from
a costless technology shock is generally positive, as in prior literature, but we also show how a
pre-existing energy efficiency standard can negate the direct energy savings from the costless
technology shock – leaving only the positive rebound effect on energy use. Then we analyze
increased stringency of energy efficiency standards, and we show exactly when the increased
costs reverse the sign of rebound. Using plausible parameter values in this model, we find that
indirect effects can easily outweigh the direct effects captured in partial equilibrium models, and
that the total rebound from a costly efficiency mandate is negative.

       New energy efficiency technology can reduce electricity or fuel use needed to get the
same services such as cooling from an air conditioner or refrigerator, heat from a furnace, or
miles driven in a car. It reduces the marginal cost of those services, so it encourages
consumers to make more use of those appliances – and thus causes a rebound effect that
offsets at least part of the energy savings. Many papers demonstrate this positive rebound
effect, both in empirical partial equilibrium models and in theoretical general equilibrium
models. Here, we demonstrate potential problems interpreting those results and their
implications for energy policy. In particular, these papers analyze effects of a costless
technology shock (CTS) and correctly shows the important economic effects of technology.
But policymakers cannot require a costless technology shock. They can require that firms use
more resources to achieve more energy efficiency in the appliances they produce, but the
economic effects of such requirements cannot be inferred from studies of a CTS. A few
papers consider costs of energy efficiency in partial equilibrium or computable models. None
provide analytical general equilibrium results for a costless technology shock and for
increased stringency of an energy efficiency standard (EES) in a world with a pre-existing
standard that is already binding and therefore costly.
       In other words, we focus on the costs of policies that require energy efficiency in a
model that incorporates economy-wide resource constraints and where these policies face
increasing marginal cost of achieving greater energy efficiency. Our general equilibrium
model is solved analytically to decompose rebound into direct effects and indirect effects,
each of which is explained by income and substitution effects. The closed-form solutions
show exactly how each effect depends on parameters. Then we also calibrate the model to
provide numerical illustrations. We show that this view of the policy experiment can indeed
improve energy efficiency and has the same kind of direct efficiency effect of reducing
energy use, but the sign of rebound likely switches from positive to negative. What do we
mean by “likely”? The sign is still formally ambiguous, but our theoretical results show
exactly the conditions under which rebound is negative. And the most plausible cases we
consider in our numerical illustrations have negative rebound.
       The intuition is clear: the CTS is an exogenous improvement in technology that makes
more possible with less, expanding the production possibility frontier (PPF). It raises real
income, which induces consumers to purchase more heating or cooling services. In contrast,
the EES requires a move along the PPF. With no pre-existing mandate, introducing a small
EES has small costs. But, most developed economies have substantial energy efficiency

requirements. If technology is given, and consumers are constrained to buy more-expensive
appliances with more energy efficiency than they would if unconstrained, then an increase in
stringency can have rising marginal costs that reduce real income. Those extra costs could
well be justified by benefits of reduced negative externalities from energy use, but costs of
complying with the mandate still reduce household incomes and thus have negative income
effects on the purchases of all goods including appliance services. We show how the negative
income effect offsets part of the positive direct effect on energy used for those services, and it
creates a large negative indirect rebound effect on energy used in production of other goods.
           Scores of economics papers have provided theoretical and empirical analyses of
rebound effects from energy efficiency improvements, but the size of rebound is still under
debate. These papers include both partial equilibrium (PE) and general equilibrium (GE)
models, but most focus on a costless technology improvement in energy efficiency and find
positive rebound. 1 Some research considers the costs of energy efficiency improvements in
PE models, and they find smaller rebound effects than in the case of a costless technology
change. 2 But, PE studies do not usually incorporate economy-wide resource constraints. A
few papers include costs of energy efficiency in numerical results using quantitative, multi-
sectoral, dynamic, GE growth models. 3 While these PE or GE papers may consider the costs
of greater energy efficiency, however, they are not clear about whether these costs are
incurred voluntarily by firms and consumers or are mandated by government. Yet, voluntary
costs can be presumed to raise consumer welfare, with positive overall effects on real income.
We calculate rebound effects from a mandated increase in costly energy efficiency, and we
compare them to effects of a costless technological improvement. We also show how the
effect of either such shock is altered by pre-existing costly efficiency standards. 4
           Our simple general equilibrium model has many identical consumers who get utility

 See Mizobuchi (2008) and Nässén and Holmberg (2009). In Borenstein (2015), the price of electricity exceeds
social marginal cost, a pre-existing distortion that encourages energy efficiency. He considers the consumer’s
choice to spend more for additional energy efficiency, a cost that reduces income and can reduce use of energy.

 The review by Gillingham et al. (2016) points out the distinction between rebound from a costless technology
shock and a costly policy shock, and it describes how empirical estimates mix the two. Interestingly, however,
none of the papers in this large rebound literature has analyzed an energy efficiency improvement – either
costless or costly – as we do here in a world with a pre-existing policy that is both costly and binding.

from vehicle or appliance services and from another composite good. They own a single
factor of production that they can sell to firms for income to buy appliances, energy to run
them, and the other composite good. We model production, all resource constraints, and zero
profit conditions of competitive firms. We differentiate all equations to linearize the model,
and then we analyze three kinds of exogenous shocks. First, we consider a costless technology
shock with no change in spending on appliances. That shock raises welfare and reduces direct
energy use – with positive rebound as in prior literature. Second, we consider a CTS in a
world with a pre-existing efficiency mandate that is binding and costly. When consumers can
change all their other choices, we show how the CTS allows them to reduce their expenditures
that were formerly necessary to satisfy the mandate. The result is no gain in energy efficiency,
which still barely satisfies the unchanged mandate, but the CTS does have a positive income
effect and so still yields positive rebound. Third, and finally, we consider the essential policy
question: what are the effects of increasing the energy efficiency requirement of a pre-existing
mandate? The answer depends on the curvature of the cost function for acquiring additional
energy efficiency (given existing technology). If that extra efficiency is cheap, then overall
welfare costs are low, but we consider the likely case that the marginal cost of achieving
additional energy efficiency is not only significantly positive but rising – as policymakers
attempt to achieve greater energy efficiency.
       Following sections describe the model (section 1), our linearization (2), theoretical
results for the three types of shocks just described (sections 3, 4, and 5), our calibration (6),
numerical results (7), sensitivity analysis (8), extensions (9), and conclusions (10). All
appendices are included below, but later will be online only. Our section on extensions
discusses rebound with: (a) negative effects of energy use on productivity, (b) upward-sloping
energy supply, (c) energy efficiency standards in the other sector, and (d) disaggregation.

1. The Analytical General Equilibrium Model

       For simplicity, we assume a static, one-period, closed economy with competitive
markets and a large number 𝑛𝑛 of identical consumers (or households). These consumers each
own and supply a single primary factor 𝐾𝐾, which can be labor, capital, or a composite of both.
As specified below, 𝐾𝐾 is used in production of energy 𝐸𝐸, appliances 𝐴𝐴, and a composite of all
other goods 𝑋𝑋 (such as clothing, food, and shelter). With this aggregation for tractability, we
define 𝐴𝐴 to include air conditioners, furnaces, and all other consumer durables that use energy
– including vehicles. Then a costless technological discovery might increase a refrigerator’s
                                                        -4-
cooling per kilowatt hour of electricity, or it might increase a car’s miles per gallon. In fact,
one of our major examples of a mandate is the federal corporate average fuel economy
(CAFE) requirement that manufactures meet a minimum fleet-average miles per gallon.
Several nations have such requirements and might increase their stringency.
         In a form of home production, each household produces services 𝑆𝑆 from purchases of
appliances 𝐴𝐴 and energy 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 (that is, energy, 𝐸𝐸, used for services, 𝑆𝑆). These services include
refrigeration, cooling in summer, heat in winter, and miles driven. Consumers get utility from
these services, and from the composite good, and they get disutility from the economy-wide
aggregate use of energy. Thus, each consumer’s utility function takes the following form:

         𝑈𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈(𝑆𝑆, 𝑋𝑋; 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛)                                                                        (1.1)
where 𝑈𝑈 is twice continuously differentiable, quasi-concave, and homothetic. It is increasing
in the first two arguments and decreasing in 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛, aggregate energy use. 5 This public good or
bad is separable in utility, so changes in 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 do not affect consumer choices of 𝑆𝑆 or 𝑋𝑋.
         Our simple model cannot consider the discrete choice of whether to buy an appliance
or vehicle. Instead, the household can choose any amount of the aggregate “𝐴𝐴” commodity.
Moreover, conceptually, features of a car not related to energy efficiency such as leather seats
are best considered to be part of the other good, 𝑋𝑋. Similarly, a home’s double-pane insulated
glass window is part of 𝐴𝐴, but the stained-wood window frame is part of 𝑋𝑋. Thus, we use 𝐴𝐴
not to represent total cars and appliances, but only the portion devoted to energy efficiency. 6
         With those clarifications, the home-production function is:

          𝑆𝑆 = 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆                                                                               (1.2)
where 𝜖𝜖 is a technology scalar, and 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 is energy efficiency. If 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 is in miles per gallon, for
example, then multiplication by 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 in gallons of gasoline yields 𝑆𝑆 in miles. Or, if 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 is in
cooling per kwh, and 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 is kwh of electricity, then 𝑆𝑆 is measured in degrees of cooling. With
only one type of 𝐴𝐴, consumers who want more energy efficiency must buy more 𝐴𝐴. Then,
with this model, we can study a small exogenous increase in the technology scalar, 𝜖𝜖, to solve



5
 If 𝑛𝑛 is large enough, an individual household disregards its own contribution to aggregate energy use and takes
as fixed the third argument in utility (𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛). Except for an extension in Section 9, we do not make use of this third
argument in our analysis, but include it primarily as a reminder of the reason to have an energy efficiency policy.
6
  With no data to identify the portion spent on fuel efficiency, our calibration below uses alternative assumptions.
Also, our static model abstracts from the timing of durable purchases, vintages that affect energy use, and the
distinction between short run and long run effects. We compare long run equilibria. But, we capture the key fact
that either a CTS or EES would reduce the price of services and thus give rise to rebound.

for rebound effects from a costless technology shock (CTS), and we can study a small
increase in required spending on 𝐴𝐴 to analyze an energy efficiency standard (EES).
         Extra energy efficiency in 𝐴𝐴 can be purchased, and it is produced by firms using extra
resources, so the total cost of making appliances or cars more energy efficient is expressed in
units of the composite input, 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 (that is, composite input, 𝐾𝐾, used in production of 𝐴𝐴):

         𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 𝐵𝐵(𝐴𝐴 − 𝐴𝐴0 )𝛽𝛽 , with 0 ≤ 𝐴𝐴0 ≤ 𝐴𝐴, 𝐵𝐵 > 0, and 𝛽𝛽 ≥ 1                               (1.3)

The scale parameter 𝐵𝐵 converts units (from 𝐴𝐴 to 𝐾𝐾), and the exponent 𝛽𝛽 represents cost
curvature. If 𝛽𝛽 = 1, then cost is linear, so additional fuel efficiency can be achieved at a flat
marginal cost. But we generally assume 𝛽𝛽 > 1, to capture the likely case that additional
efficiency requires using successively more expensive technologies or materials. The
parameter 𝐴𝐴0 provides flexibility to shift the intercept of the cost function; this shifted
function is used in most engineering studies reviewed below and in our calibration appendix. 7
The general idea is that any car must generate some positive miles per gallon (mpg), even
when no costs are incurred trying to raise mpg. Some energy efficiency (𝐴𝐴0 ) comes with any
car, while costs of additional efficiency could be quadratic (e.g., 𝛽𝛽=2).
         The model abstracts from various taxes on inputs or outputs, just as it abstracts from
government expenditures. 8 The essential function of government modeled here includes only
a required target total energy efficiency of household appliances, a target that can be stated in
miles/gallon or degrees of cooling/kwh. That standard can be represented as 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 ≥ 𝜂𝜂, for a
policy scalar 𝜂𝜂. We assume the existing policy is binding, so fuel efficiency matches the
scalar: 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 = 𝜂𝜂. For a given value of the technology parameter, government has essentially set
𝐴𝐴, which costs 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 . Thus, a new regulation that raises required fuel efficiency must raise costs
in this model, where the cost of 𝐴𝐴 rises at an increasing rate (increasing marginal cost). 9
         Because the initial equilibrium has a pre-existing efficiency standard that is both


7
  Those studies include NRC (2002, 2015), DOE (2011, 2016a, 2016b), and Lutsey et al. (2017). Our cost
function allows 𝐴𝐴0 to be zero, and we later determine whether a positive 𝐴𝐴0 is necessary to fit the data.
8
  Our model could be extended to include other taxes and second-best effects, but those topics are well covered
already (see papers collected in Goulder, 2002). Such extensions would complicate our analysis and modify our
solutions by adding more rebound terms of either sign, but it would not remove the key terms we discuss below.
It might confuse readers to discuss old second-best results that are not the topic of this paper. We prefer the
simplest model necessary to demonstrate our new results (as summarized above and in propositions below).
9
 These costs follow from our assumption that consumers are well-informed optimizers facing a costly mandate.
In a behavioral model where consumers miss opportunities to reduce their own overall costs by choosing more
energy efficiency, a mandate could raise welfare – with effects very similar to the CTS analyzed below. Here we
use the simplest model to show how increased stringency can raise costs and thus have negative rebound.
                                                         -6-
costly and binding, we have no need to describe how a consumer facing no standard would
maximize 𝑈𝑈 = 𝑈𝑈(𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 , 𝑋𝑋; 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛) by their choices of 𝐴𝐴, 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 , and 𝑋𝑋. Instead, we assume that the
government “distorts” those choices by requiring more 𝐴𝐴 than unconstrained consumers
would choose – presumably to reduce the negative effect on 𝑈𝑈 from total energy use 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛. Our
linearization below can analyze small changes, so we also assume that a small increase in
technology 𝜖𝜖 would not be enough to make the policy non-binding (discussed more below).
         In Proposition 2 below, we solve for a condition on parameters that must hold for our
assumption that rational and fully-informed consumers are being forced to purchase more 𝐴𝐴
than they would desire if unconstrained. When we assume this condition holds, then any
increase in the stringency of the energy efficiency requirement must be costly and therefore
must reduce real income (ignoring the benefits of reduced external damages). 10
         Since 𝜖𝜖 and 𝐴𝐴 are given, and 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 is a fixed cost, the household chooses only energy use
𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 (at price 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 ) and other goods 𝑋𝑋 (at price 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 ). Their only income is from a fixed total factor
           � , which earns the rate of return 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 . Thus, the budget constraint is:
endowment, 𝐾𝐾
                   � = 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋 + 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆
         𝐼𝐼 = 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾
Then, because 𝑆𝑆 = 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 , the maximization of 𝑈𝑈(𝑆𝑆, 𝑋𝑋) subject to this budget yields first order
                                                                                   𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕     𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
conditions that can be solved for the marginal rate of substitution:               𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
                                                                                          / 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 /(𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖). In

other words, given the fixed cost 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 , the effective marginal price of appliance services is
𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖. For example, if 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 is the price of gasoline in $/gallon, and 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 is fuel efficiency in
miles/gallon, then the cost of an additional mile (𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖) is in dollars per mile.
         This model abstracts from the fact that the choice of car or air conditioner takes place
before the choice of miles or cooling. It collapses that dynamic problem to a year in which the
economy is in long-run equilibrium, so the household pays the annualized cost of the car plus
annual cost of miles. But this model captures exactly the aspect of the problem that gives rise
to rebound: once the car or appliance is purchased with a particular energy efficiency, the
only marginal cost is energy use. Energy efficiency may rise through a costless shock to 𝜖𝜖, or
a requirement that raises the fixed cost of 𝐴𝐴, but either such shock reduces marginal cost
(𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖) per mile driven or per degree of cooling from the air conditioner.
         On the producer side, competitive firms are price takers in all markets, with constant
returns to scale (CRTS) production. Firms in sector 𝑋𝑋 use 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 and energy 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 as inputs. Energy

10
 Or, if that condition is not satisfied, then a policy to increase energy efficiency can raise real income. That case
would require a model of how consumers choose energy efficiency (𝐴𝐴) that does not maximize utility.

𝐸𝐸 is generated from input of factor 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 . We choose units of measurement such that one unit of
the primary factor 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 can produce one unit of 𝐸𝐸. Thus, the production functions are:

        𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋(𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 , 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 )                                                                    (1.4)
        𝐸𝐸 = 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸                                                                                (1.5)
Perfect competition and CRTS imply zero-profit conditions stating that the value of each
sector’s output produced and sold must equal the sum of amounts spent on inputs:

        𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋 = 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋                                                           (1.6)
        𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸                                                                       (1.7)
All markets must clear in equilibrium. That is, energy supply must equal the sum of all
demands, and the factor endowment must equal the sum of all factor uses:

        𝐸𝐸 = 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 + 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ,                                                                        (1.8)
        � = 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 + 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 + 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 .
        𝐾𝐾                                                                                        (1.9)

2. Linearization

        We totally differentiate and linearize all equations at the initial equilibrium, and we
use a “hat” to denote a proportional change (e.g., 𝑋𝑋� ≡ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/𝑋𝑋). The resulting 𝑁𝑁 linear
equations are solved in later sections for 𝑁𝑁 unknowns, the changes in quantities and prices
that result from a small exogenous change in technology (𝜖𝜖̂) or policy (𝜂𝜂̂ ). The analysis of
small changes does not mean results are small, however. Pre-existing standards act like taxes
that raise the cost of appliances, so they create deadweight losses that rise disproportionately
with the implicit tax rate. While the initial small standard or tax has only second-order effects
on welfare, successive increases have first-order effects. Moreover, our linearization captures
exactly the sort of the policy debates about small legislative changes that are most common.
        Large new regulations are rare, as actual policy proceeds incrementally. When first
enacted in 1975, for example, CAFE rules required new passenger cars by 1978 to average 18
miles per gallon (mpg). The standards increased to 27.5 mpg for model year 1985, and they
were raised again in 2011 (NHTSA, 2011a). By model year 2025, vehicles with footprint over
55 square feet need to meet a standard of 46 mpg, while those 41 square feet or smaller must
achieve 60 mpg (NHTSA, 2011b). Rules for household appliances similarly face periodic
debates about incremental changes. 11

11
  A standard enacted in 1988 required top-loading clothes washers manufactured between 1988 and 1994 to
have an unheated rinse option, and it required those manufactured after 1994 to have a “modified energy factor”

         To proceed, total differentiation of production functions for the three goods shows
how the change in each output is determined from changes in each set of inputs:

         𝑆𝑆̂ = 𝜖𝜖̂ + 𝐴𝐴̂ + 𝐸𝐸

For sector 𝑋𝑋, the factor share for input 𝐾𝐾 is 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 , the factor share for energy is 𝜃𝜃𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 , and
𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 + 𝜃𝜃𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 = 1. The elasticity of substitution in sector 𝑋𝑋 between inputs to production is
defined as 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋 , the percentage change in the input use ratio in response to a one percent change
in the input price ratio. For small changes, the definition of 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋 implies:

Since the marginal price of services 𝑆𝑆 is 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖, differentiation yields the proportional change
                  �𝐸𝐸 − 𝐴𝐴̂ − 𝜖𝜖̂). The elasticity of substitution in utility between 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆 is 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 ,
in that price as (𝑃𝑃

the marginal price ratio. For small changes, we get:

where 𝛼𝛼 ≡ 𝐴𝐴0 /𝐴𝐴 is minimum energy efficiency as a fraction of total initial energy efficiency
(0 ≤ 𝛼𝛼 < 1). We interpret 𝛽𝛽/(1 − 𝛼𝛼) in this equation as the “cost elasticity of energy

totally differentiate zero-profit equations (1.6) - (1.7), and use the firm’s FOC’s:

3. Rebound from a Costless Technological Shock with No Binding Mandate

        A costless technology shock (CTS) is represented here by a small exogenous change
in efficiency technology, 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0. Many prior papers study rebound from this kind of shock in
a world with no mandate and assuming no change in spending on appliances. This section is
designed to represent prior literature by similarly assuming no mandate nor change in
appliance spending. This case is not “general equilibrium” in nature, because we assume no
change in 𝐴𝐴. Yet, consumers do react to greater energy efficiency by changing their fuel use,
services, and other goods. 12 We use this representation of prior literature below for direct
comparisons with results for GE rebound from either a CTS or a policy shock in a world with
a pre-existing energy efficiency mandate that is both costly and binding. This section also
provides a detailed walkthrough of how we decompose rebound into its components.

linearized equations (2.1) – (2.10). This section takes 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0 as exogenous and assumes that 𝐴𝐴
is unchanged (𝐴𝐴̂ = 0). Thus, with 𝐾𝐾 as numeraire (𝑃𝑃
                                                    � 𝐾𝐾 = 0), we can solve for the other ten

outcomes (in proportional changes). In addition, we unpack the solution for 𝐸𝐸� into different
terms. Each such term can show a particular rebound effect as a function of parameters and of
the exogenous increase in the efficiency scalar, 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0.
        Some of the solutions are easy. Production of 𝐸𝐸 uses only the numeraire primary
                               �𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃
factor, so our first result is 𝑃𝑃    � 𝐾𝐾 = 0. Production of 𝑋𝑋 uses both 𝐾𝐾 and 𝐸𝐸, but neither input

                               �
price changes, so CRTS implies 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 = 0. Also, the two inputs change in the same proportion

           �𝑋𝑋 = 𝐾𝐾

                                                                         �𝐸𝐸 − 𝜖𝜖̂ − 𝐴𝐴̂ = −𝜖𝜖̂).
𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 are unchanged. Therefore, the cost per additional unit of 𝑆𝑆 falls (𝑃𝑃

  Our simple model is not designed to determine consumer choice of 𝐴𝐴 optimally in a world with no mandate.
Instead, we want to compare rebound from the CTS with and without a mandate, “all else equal” (including 𝐴𝐴).

The last equation for the overall change in energy use (𝐸𝐸� ) will be re-arranged to decompose it
into key components, but we first gain some intuition by looking at the other outcomes.
           The positive technology shock increases real incomes, so consumers buy more goods
and services. 13 They also respond to the fall in the marginal cost of services by substituting
toward 𝑆𝑆 from 𝑋𝑋 (in a way that depends on 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 ). The simplicity of our model allows us to
separate income from substitution effects for both services and the other good. Specifically, in
Appendix B, we derive the substitution effect as the change in consumption while consumers
face the new prices but are as happy as in the old equilibrium. The income effect is the
remaining change in consumption. In fact, Appendix B shows that the first term in equation
(3.1) is the substitution effect on 𝑋𝑋, which depends on 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 and is negative. The income effect
on 𝑋𝑋 is the remaining term in (3.1) and is positive. Similarly, the first term in (3.2) is the
positive substitution effect on 𝑆𝑆. The income effect on 𝑆𝑆 is the remaining term in (3.2), and it
matches the positive income effect on 𝑋𝑋 (because of homothetic preferences).
           Next, our model enables us to solve for the welfare gain from this shock, given by the
overall change in utility (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) divided by the marginal utility of income (𝜇𝜇). This dollar value
of the change in utility is then divided by total income (𝐼𝐼) to express it in relative terms. As
shown in Appendix C, this measure of the change in welfare is:

           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋       𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆

                                                                      (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
           = (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝑋𝑋� + (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 )𝑆𝑆̂ =                                                 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0

In the first line, the relative change in welfare is a weighted average of the changes in
consumption of goods and services, where the weight for each is its share of income. Using
solutions for 𝑋𝑋� and 𝑆𝑆̂ above, the closed-form solution for 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/(𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇) is shown on the far right.
As confirmation of these two derivations, we note that this relative change in real income is


13
     Utility is homothetic, so both the commodity 𝑋𝑋 and services 𝑆𝑆 are normal goods.

identical to the earlier-derived income effect on goods and on services.
         The substitution effect increases 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 by the first term in (3.3), and the income effect
                                                          �𝑆𝑆 has a third term that reduces energy

use for appliance services (by −𝜖𝜖̂). This last term is the direct effect of the CTS that allows
consumers to produce the same services using less energy.
         The solution for 𝐸𝐸� in (3.4) has an ambiguous sign, and it is hard to interpret, so we
unpack it into three major components: a direct efficiency effect, a direct rebound, and an
indirect rebound. We then further decompose both the direct and indirect rebound effects into
income and substitution effects, in general equilibrium. 14 These components appear in the
first column of Table 1, Panel A, which decomposes effects of a CTS on total energy use in
this case (with no policy, and fixed 𝐴𝐴). The sum of all terms in the first column is 𝐸𝐸� in
equation (3.4). The other columns and panel – discussed later – show GE effects of a CTS
with a pre-existing standard, and effects of increased stringency of an energy efficiency
standard (EES).
         In column (1), with no policy, consumers could exploit the efficiency improvement to
get the same services using less energy. That is, even if households were to choose unchanged
𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆, the energy used to produce this bundle would fall. We define this energy saving as
the “direct efficiency effect” (DEE), identified in the first term of the column. This energy
saving would be the only effect if relative prices and real incomes held constant – as it might
be calculated by engineers. Thus, the DEE reduces energy used for services by the full
amount of the technology shock (−𝜖𝜖̂). It reduces total energy use in the economy by the shock
times the fraction of total energy used for those services (−𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜖𝜖̂ < 0).
         Next, in column (1) of Panel A, we define the “direct rebound effect” (DRE) as the
change in 𝐸𝐸 from the combined substitution and income effects on the demand for services 𝑆𝑆.
The income effect component of that DRE is the next term in the column (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 times the
income effect on 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 in eq. 3.3). The real income gain allows consumers to get more 𝑆𝑆 using
more 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 . The DRE through the substitution effect is the next term down. It is 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 times the
substitution effect on 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 in (3.3), and it is also positive. Its size depends on 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 . The DRE is
the sum of the income and substitution effects and thus must be positive.
         The “indirect rebound effect” (IRE) then refers to the effect of the shock on the

14
  Most PE empirical studies estimate only the uncompensated direct rebound effect, without separate income
and substitution effects. Thomas and Azevedo (2013) and Borenstein (2015) use PE theory models to decompose
direct and indirect rebound effects into substitution and income effects. We follow their lead, but in a GE model.
                                                                          -12-
equilibrium change in demand for the other good, 𝑋𝑋, and thus on its energy use, 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 . The
second-to-last term in this first column of Panel A is the change in energy use from the
income effect on demand for 𝑋𝑋. It is 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 /𝐸𝐸 times the income effect on 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 in (3.1), and it
is positive. The last term is the change in energy use through the substitution effect away from
𝑋𝑋. The total IRE is the sum of a positive income effect and negative substitution effect:
                𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 �(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 �                                        𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 (1 − 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 )
                                                                 𝜖𝜖̂−𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝜖𝜖̂ =                            𝜖𝜖̂.
                                 1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴                                                                         1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴
The sign of this expression depends on the size of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 . If goods 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆 are not substitutable
enough (𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 <1), then the income effect dominates, and indirect rebound is positive. If the
substitution effect dominates (𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 >1), however, then the IRE is negative.
             Alternatively, we can decompose rebound into an “overall income effect” and an
“overall substitution effect”. The real income gain increases demands for both 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 and 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 and
thus always adds positively to rebound. The sum of the two income effects in the first column
of Table 1 is the total income effect, the second term in the solution for 𝐸𝐸� in (3.4). Similarly,
we can calculate an overall substitution effect on rebound through both 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 and 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 by adding
the two substitution effects. This sum is the first term in (3.4). It has an ambiguous sign
because the substitution effect increases 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 but decreases 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 .
             We can show that 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 > 0 implies that appliance services are more energy-
intensive than the composite good. 15 If this inequality holds, then the overall income effect
and overall substitution effect both increase energy use. If 𝑆𝑆 is less energy-intensive, however,
then the substitution effect is a negative component of rebound, and the sign of total rebound
depends on whether the income effect dominates the substitution effect.
             These analytical results and their signs in the second column of Table 1 are consistent
with results in prior literature. When technological progress improves energy efficiency, its
DEE reduces total energy use. The DRE is expected to be positive, through both substitution
and income effects, while the IRE can be positive or negative. We next distinguish these
effects of a CTS with no mandate to effects of a CTS with a pre-existing and binding mandate
(and later, to effects of increasing stringency of a binding EES).

shock in the case with a pre-existing efficiency mandate that is both costly and binding. The
CTS is still modeled as an increase in the technology parameter, 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0, but we assume that a
small change in 𝜖𝜖 does not make the policy non-binding. 16
         In general equilibrium, if consumers face a minimum energy efficiency 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 and are
given a free increase in 𝜖𝜖, then they can choose to spend less on 𝐴𝐴. With a costly mandate that
remains binding, then consumers still have to purchase more 𝐴𝐴 than desired, so they respond
to the technology shock by cutting back as much as possible on purchase of 𝐴𝐴. If consumers
spend only enough to satisfy the unchanged mandate, then the CTS results in no additional
energy efficiency at all. 17 The unchanged policy still requires 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 ≥ 𝜂𝜂, so consumers can
reduce purchase of costly 𝐴𝐴 such that 𝐴𝐴̂ = −𝜖𝜖̂, and energy efficiency 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 is unchanged. 18
         We use the ten linearized equations in Section 2 to solve for the same ten unknowns as
                                                                        �
above. The exogenous shock is still 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0, and the numeraire is still 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 = 0, but all outcomes

are now different because 𝐴𝐴̂ = –𝜖𝜖̂. Appendix D derives a closed-form expression for each of
these ten equilibrium changes resulting from a small CTS with a binding EES, including the
change in total energy use, 𝐸𝐸� , but then we unpack that solution for 𝐸𝐸� into the same rebound
effects as before, as shown in column (3) of Table 1.
                                                                              �𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃
         Many of the results are both easy to solve and intuitive. As before, 𝑃𝑃    � 𝐾𝐾 = 0.

Neither input price changes, so CRTS implies 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 = 0. Therefore, the two inputs change in the

                           �𝑋𝑋 = 𝐾𝐾
same proportion as output, 𝐸𝐸    �𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋� . Next, the CTS does not change overall energy

efficiency, 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖, so 𝑆𝑆̂ = 𝐸𝐸
                           �𝑆𝑆 . The effective marginal price of 𝑆𝑆 is 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖, where 𝑃𝑃
                                                                                         �𝐸𝐸 = 0, and 𝐴𝐴
falls by the same percentage that 𝜖𝜖 rises. Therefore, the marginal cost of 𝑆𝑆 does not change
 �𝐸𝐸 − 𝜖𝜖̂ − 𝐴𝐴̂ = 0). Unchanged relative prices of services 𝑆𝑆 and good 𝑋𝑋 implies no substitution
(𝑃𝑃
between these goods. Yet the CTS helps consumers to cut spending on 𝐴𝐴 while they still meet
the unchanged standard. Thus, it has a positive income effect that increases 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆 by the
same percentage as the income gain (as shown in Appendix D):



16
   If an actual shock were large enough to make the policy non-binding, then the outcome would include some
effects of this section with a binding mandate and some effects of the previous section with no binding mandate.

  In a similar result, though not about rebound, Goulder et al (2012) look at a subset of states that adopt a
vehicle fuel efficiency standard that is more stringent than the federal standard requiring automakers to meet a
nationwide corporate average fuel economy (CAFE). Those automakers can sell more fuel efficient cars in the
more-stringent states and sell less efficient cars in other states, with no overall change in average fuel efficiency.
18
  Empirical evidence in Knittel (2012) suggests that improvements in fuel efficiency technology over time were
offset by spending on other vehicle characteristics that reduce fuel efficiency, such as vehicle weight and power.

As a consequence, the relative welfare gain, measured by the dollar value of the change in

Increases in consumption of 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆 lead to an increase in energy use by the same percentage:
                              𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽

                                   𝐴𝐴

These positive rebound effects depend positively on the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used in the appliance
                     � ), and on the cost elasticity of additional energy efficiency [𝛽𝛽/(1 − 𝛼𝛼)].
sector (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≡ 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 /𝐾𝐾
This elasticity depends on the curvature of the cost function 𝛽𝛽 and the fraction 𝛼𝛼 ≡ 𝐴𝐴0 /𝐴𝐴.
        In fact, all effects on energy use in column (3) of Table 1 are either zero or positive.
The economy stays at the same mandated efficiency level after the technology shock, so the
DEE is zero. And rebound through substitution effects is zero, so the DRE and IRE have only
their positive income effect. The total effect of the CTS is to increase total energy use (as
shown in Table 1). This result could be defined as a “backfire”, since the positive rebound
effect swamps the zero DEE. We state these results formally in Proposition 1.

PROPOSITION 1: For a positive costless technology shock (CTS) in this model with a pre-
existing energy efficiency mandate that is costly and still binding after the shock, then:
        (i) The direct efficiency effect is zero.
        (ii) Rebound substitution effects are zero.
        (iii) The only nonzero rebounds are through income effects and are positive.

The proof for Proposition 1 is the derivation above and in Appendix D. It follows from the
assumption that the unchanged EES is still binding after the CTS.
        These results are strikingly different from those in prior rebound literature. For the
CTS with no pre-existing mandate, the prior literature shows that the DEE is a reduction in
energy use, only partly offset by a positive DRE (as in the first two columns of Table 1). For
the CTS with a pre-existing mandate, the next two columns show the CTS has no direct
energy savings at all, and no rebound through substitution effects. In essence, the energy
efficiency innovation reduces the cost of achieving the unchanged pre-existing standard. Then
“direct rebound” is the positive income effect on energy for 𝑆𝑆, and “indirect rebound” is the
positive income effect on energy for production of other goods, 𝑋𝑋.
                                                                     -15-
       A glance down column (3) shows that if the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 in services (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ) is less than
the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used in other goods (𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 ), as could be expected, then the indirect rebound
effect (on 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 ) exceeds the direct rebound effect (on 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ). Most empirical PE models measure
only direct rebound, using the elasticity of demand for services, but they ignore mandates. In
contrast, our GE model can show indirect rebound. For the CTS with a pre-existing efficiency
mandate, the positive indirect effect likely exceeds the positive direct rebound effect.
       An additional possibility ignored here is that policy makers set standards based on
costs and benefits, such that this reduction of costs could induce them eventually to tighten
the standard. We do not analyze endogenous policy, but we do analyze a tighter standard (in
the next section). We also ignore endogenous technology, but another possibility is that the
costly policy can induce improvements in technology that then cause positive rebound effects.

5. Rebound Effects from a Change in the Energy Efficiency Standard

       We now solve for effects of a costly increase in EES stringency, decompose it into
types of rebound, and compare these results to those above. Since the policy is represented by
𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 ≥ 𝜂𝜂, we model the policy shock as a small exogenous change, 𝜂𝜂̂ > 0 (with no change in
technology, 𝜖𝜖̂ = 0). Because purchase of 𝐴𝐴 is costly, and consumers are already required to
purchase more than they would if unconstrained, they will not buy more than necessary to
satisfy the new requirement. Therefore the chosen 𝐴𝐴̂ will exactly equal the required 𝜂𝜂̂ .
       Here again, we use the ten linearized equations (2.1) - (2.10) to solve for equilibrium
changes in energy consumption, 𝐸𝐸� , and nine other unknowns. Then we decompose that effect

Again we discuss outcomes in (5.1)-(5.3) to help understand effects on total energy in (5.4).
        Similar to the analysis of the CTS, the reduction in marginal cost of 𝑆𝑆 has both income
and substitution effects on 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆. Substitution leads to more consumption of services and
less of other goods. The first term in (5.1) is the substitution effect on 𝑋𝑋, and it is negative.
The substitution effect on 𝑆𝑆 is the first term in (5.2), and it is positive. The size of substitution
effects depends positively on 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 . In addition, the total income effect has two terms. On the
one hand, consumers get a positive income effect from the service cost reduction, captured by
the second terms in (5.1) and (5.2). On the other hand, they get a negative income effect
because the more stringent policy (𝜂𝜂̂ > 0) also requires more resources 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 to produce 𝐴𝐴. This
                                        𝛾𝛾 𝛽𝛽
portion of the income effect (− (1−𝛾𝛾 𝐴𝐴)(1−𝛼𝛼) 𝜂𝜂̂ <0) has a magnitude that depends on existing

resource use for fuel efficiency (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≡ 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 /𝐾𝐾
        The policy shock alters relative prices, the consumption bundle, and thus energy use.
The change in production of 𝑋𝑋 in (5.1) results in the same percentage change in 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 . The
change in 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 in (5.3) is ascribable to both the change in 𝑆𝑆 and an additional negative term, – 𝜂𝜂̂ .
This additional term is the direct energy savings from the mandated increase in efficiency.
        To interpret the effect of the EES on total energy use, we now re-arrange (5.4) into the
components shown in column (5) of Table 1, in Panel B. The first entry shows the direct
efficiency effect, −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜂𝜂̂ , which is the reduction in use of energy with more-efficient appliances
that would occur if households were to consume an unchanged bundle of 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆. This DEE
reduces energy use in production of 𝑆𝑆, and thus reduces the economy-wide aggregate energy
consumption by 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 /𝐸𝐸 times the policy shock 𝜂𝜂̂ .
        But households do change their bundle of 𝑋𝑋 and 𝑆𝑆. We define rebound effects of the
EES in the same way as for the CTS, which enables us to compare the same concept for the
two different shocks. Both the CTS and the EES shocks allow consumers to get the same
services using less energy, so results in the fifth column are consistent with existing findings
that the substitution effect increases consumption of 𝑆𝑆 but reduces 𝑋𝑋. In particular, the DRE
through the substitution effect is positive (see the third entry in the fifth column). The last
entry in that column is the negative IRE through the substitution effect on 𝑋𝑋. Substitution
effects decrease 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 but increase 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 . Adding the two substitution terms in the fifth column
yields the overall substitution effect on energy use, (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝜂𝜂̂ , which has ambiguous
sign. Thus, if services 𝑆𝑆 are more energy-intensive than 𝑋𝑋, (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴)>0, then the overall
substitution effect increases 𝐸𝐸, with a net positive rebound effect. But if the 𝑋𝑋-sector is more
                                                               -17-
energy intensive than the 𝑆𝑆-sector, the substitution effect increases 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 less than it decreases
𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 , so the overall substitution effect could reduce total energy use.
        The income effect is the main difference between the EES and CTS (with or without
pre-existing mandate). The income effect for the CTS is always positive, as consumers get
“free money” from reduced need to spend on 𝐴𝐴 or 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 . Assuming the EES is binding and
costly, however, the real income effect of this policy shock must be negative.
        As shown in Appendix C, using solutions for 𝑋𝑋� and 𝑆𝑆̂ above, we can measure the
change in real income as:

        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋       𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆
              =      𝑋𝑋� +                       𝑆𝑆̂
         𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇   𝐼𝐼                   𝐼𝐼
                                                              (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸          𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽
        = (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝑋𝑋� + (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 )𝑆𝑆̂ =                                            −
                                                                            1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴                     (1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 )(1 − 𝛼𝛼)
Our assumption that the policy is binding therefore means that the change in real income on the
far right must be negative. A slight re-arrangement of this condition implies:

PROPOSITION 2: In this model, the pre-existing energy efficiency standard is costly and
binding if and only if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 �.

Our assumption that the EES is binding means that the inequality holds. It means we assume a
large enough fraction of resources is used for energy efficiency (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ), or a large enough
curvature in its cost function (𝛽𝛽), or both. If so, then the total income effect is negative.
        The direct rebound effect is the sum of substitution and income effects on 𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠 . The
substitution effect on 𝑆𝑆 and 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 is always positive, but the income effect is negative. Therefore,
the DRE can be negative or positive. The indirect rebound effect on 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 includes a negative
substitution effect and a negative income effect, so its sign is clearly negative.
        Also, some prior studies find evidence for “backfire” from energy efficiency – where
the direct energy savings from increased energy efficiency are more than offset by positive
rebound effects (Khazzoom, 1980; Brannlund et al., 2007; Fouquet and Pearson, 2012;
Saunders, 2013). This backfire is less likely for a mandated increase in energy efficiency,
because the mandate is costly and thus has negative income effects on rebound. Here, we
show exact conditions under which backfire is impossible for the efficiency mandate.


PROPOSITION 3: For increased stringency of an energy efficiency standard (EES) in this
model with a pre-existing efficiency mandate that is costly and always binding:
                                                         -18-
     (i) The direct rebound is negative if and only if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 �
         (in which case, 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 is even larger than required for the EES to bind).
     (ii) The total rebound is negative if and only if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)(𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ) (less strict
         than in (i)). A sufficient condition is when X is energy-intensive (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴<0).
     (iii) Backfire is impossible if and only if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 (𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 − 1) (less strict than in
         (ii)). Sufficient conditions are X is energy-intensive (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴<0), or 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 < 1.

          Appendix F provides a detailed proof, but here we provide some intuition. The direct
rebound effect on 𝑆𝑆 is the sum of a positive substitution effect and a negative income effect,
so it will be negative if the income effect dominates (a large enough 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 or 𝛽𝛽, a small enough
𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , or a combination of these). Total rebound is the sum of that DRE and the unambiguously
negative IRE, so it can be negative under a looser condition. It is trivial to show that the
condition in (i) is stricter than the one in (ii), and either is more strict than in (iii). If (ii) holds,
so the total rebound effect (TRE) is negative, then direct energy savings are augmented by
further energy savings, and backfire is impossible. The condition 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 < 1 is sufficient to rule
out backfire, because the right side of the inequality in (iii) is negative, while the left side is
positive. With 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 < 1, the positive substitution effect is small and is swamped by the negative
income effect, so the total rebound effect cannot offset direct energy savings. 19
          Empirical studies of rebound often ignore or underestimate the indirect rebound
effect. 20 Yet we find above for the CTS that it can exceed the direct rebound effect. The same
can hold for increased stringency of the EES. Proposition 3 shows that the condition under
which the DRE is positive is compatible with the condition where the TRE is negative. If so,
then the magnitude of the negative IRE must be greater that of the positive DRE. Thus, again,
the IRE can swamp the DRE. Moreover, as shown in Appendix F, we can use the proposition
to find conditions under which indirect rebound is more negative than direct rebound.

6. Calibration

          As shown above, direct and rebound effects from an energy efficiency improvement
depend on elasticities, shares, and other parameters. To illustrate numerical magnitudes, we
choose plausible values for these parameters and use them in our formulas. Our benchmark


19
  A different special case also can guarantee that total rebound is negative. The costs of a more stringent EES
certainly make the income effect negative, but if the 𝑋𝑋-sector is more energy-intensive than the 𝑆𝑆-sector, as well,
then 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 falls by more than 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 rises, and the overall substitution effect must also be negative.
20
  One difficulty for empirical studies is to define a complete set of substitutes and complements to a particular
product. Second, most ignore indirect income effects and use only cross-price elasticity estimates.

dataset approximates the U.S. economy in 2015, the most recent year with relevant data.
           Our model has one primary factor, 𝐾𝐾, and two final outputs: appliance services 𝑆𝑆 and a
composite good 𝑋𝑋. Two other outputs are used as intermediate inputs, including energy 𝐸𝐸 and
appliances 𝐴𝐴. Yet, an actual car or appliance is a combination of energy efficiency features
plus many aesthetic and functional features not related to energy use. We observe spending on
appliances, but not on each feature. Added costs to improve energy efficiency may also vary
by appliance. Yet, the energy efficiency mandate requires that 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 ≥ 𝜂𝜂, for policy scalar 𝜂𝜂, so
spending on 𝐴𝐴 is best calibrated and interpreted as spending on energy efficiency rather than
on other features not related to energy use. Here, we arbitrarily assume initially that half of
actual expenditures on appliances is for energy efficiency (e.g. extra insulation or higher
quality parts). 21 That is, if an Energy Star freezer-refrigerator costs $600, then $300 is spent
on energy efficiency (𝐴𝐴). The remaining $300 is part of the other composite good, 𝑋𝑋.
           Using PE models, Borenstein (2015) or Chan and Gillingham (2015) can calculate
rebound for particular vehicles, electric lighting, or refrigerators. For a broader perspective,
our GE model is most useful for a large sector. Therefore, we analyze energy efficiency in a
general way for all household appliances, an aggregation of everything of households that use
energy – including washer, dryer, furnace, refrigerators, lights, air conditioners, and electric
space heaters. Since household vehicles are also subject to fuel efficiency standards, they are
also included. 22 Then energy for appliance services (𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ) is an aggregation of all household
purchase of electricity, natural gas, heating oil, propane, gasoline, and other motor fuels.
           We get residential energy expenditure data from State Energy Data System (SEDS),
through which the Energy Information Administration (EIA) provides time series of energy
production, consumption, prices, and expenditures across sectors. 23 We get expenditure data
on motor fuels from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). 24 Energy expenditure by
households for 2015 is 248 ($B), and expenditure on motor fuels is 270 ($B), for a total of
518 ($B). We define a unit of 𝐸𝐸 as the amount that costs $1, so 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 = 1 (dollars per unit of 𝐸𝐸).

21
   Accounting figures for explicit costs of energy efficiency technology are undoubtedly less than half of total
spending on cars or appliances, but manufacturers may change other design features to help reduce fuel costs
(e.g., expensive lightweight structural materials). In any case, we test sensitivity of results to this assumption.
22
   Actual appliances also have standards with different stringency. With more disaggregation and complexity, a
computational GE model could represent each of them separately. Those with more stringency will have more
negative income effects and negative rebound. In an extension below, we analyze cars and appliances separately.

Energy 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 is the sum of all fuels used by households, so the initial 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 = 518 billion units.
           To calculate the annual capital cost of appliances for energy efficiency, 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 , we start
with household expenditures on new cars and appliances for 2015 from the BEA (675 $B) and
then perform a user cost calculation to arrive at their annualized cost. 25 We assume annual
depreciation (δ) equal to 10% of total appliances, and annual maintenance (ω) equal to
another 5%. We also assume no growth, so that all new appliance purchases are replacement
investment (10% of the existing appliance stock each year). Then the existing stock is
675×10=6,750 ($B). If the annual discount rate (ρ) is 5%, then the annual user cost of cars
and appliances in $B is 6,750×(δ +ω+ρ)=1,350 ($B). 26 For the portion representing energy
efficiency features, the annual user cost is half of that: 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 675 ($B).
           Next, we use the EIA’s SEDS to obtain economy-wide energy use for 2015 as $1,127
billion.27 The ratio of energy use for cars and appliances to total energy use (𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ⁄𝐸𝐸 ) is
518/1,127 = 0.460. Then, 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 ⁄𝐸𝐸 = 1 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 = 0.540 is the fraction of energy used in
production of the composite good 𝑋𝑋. Next, we define a unit of K as the amount that earns $1
                                                               � . Using U.S. gross domestic
per year, so the initial 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 = 1, and national income is 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾
product (GDP) for 2015 from BEA, 𝐼𝐼 = 18,037 ($B). 28 The fractions of 𝐾𝐾 used in production
of energy and for energy efficiency are:

                          𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾    18,037
Since the fractions of 𝐾𝐾 used in all sectors add to one, 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 = 1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 = 0.900.
           No one has estimated the elasticity of substitution in utility between appliance services
and all other goods. To calibrate this 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , we use estimates of the own-price demand elasticity
for appliance services, 𝜉𝜉𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 . As shown in Baylis et al. (2014), these parameters are related to
each other by 𝜉𝜉𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = −(𝜁𝜁𝑆𝑆 + 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 (1 − 𝜁𝜁𝑆𝑆 )), where 𝜁𝜁𝑆𝑆 is the calibrated share of income spent on

25
   These assets include televisions, major household appliances (e.g., refrigerator, freezer, washer, dryer, stove,
range, and air conditioners), small electric appliances (e.g., vacuum cleaner and electric kettle), equipment for
house and garden (e.g., lawn mowers and propane grills), plus new motor vehicles and parts.
26
  Here, we assume perfect markets and ignore taxes, so the market rental price per year would be the same as
the annualized cost to the owner of the car or appliance.

services. Estimates range between -0.1 to -0.3, both for the price elasticity of vehicle-miles-
traveled and for the price elasticity of electricity demand. 29 Using that range, the calculated
elasticity of substitution in utility ranges from 0.05 to 0.25. For our central parameter, we use
the center of that range, 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 = 0.15, and we vary it to see the sensitivity of results.
           For our cost function 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 𝐵𝐵(𝐴𝐴 − 𝐴𝐴0 )𝛽𝛽 , linearized equations depend on the parameter
                                                                      �𝐴𝐴 = 𝛽𝛽 𝐴𝐴̂. Appendix G
𝛼𝛼 ≡ 𝐴𝐴0 /𝐴𝐴. We do not need to calibrate 𝐵𝐵, because it drops out of 𝐾𝐾   1−𝛼𝛼

describes in detail the calibration of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 using engineering studies of the added costs
associated with adding to energy efficiency. These costs are calculated for selected vehicles
by the National Research Council (NRC, 2002, 2015) and the International Council on Clean
Transportation (Lutsey et al., 2017), and for selected appliances by the Department of Energy
(DOE, 2011, 2016a, 2016b). Looking at specific measures of energy efficiency (such as mpg),
our overall strategy is as follows. (1) Choose 𝐴𝐴0 in the low-efficiency range for the vehicle or
appliance, and use observed energy efficiency 𝐴𝐴 to calculate the ratio 𝛼𝛼. (2) Vary that choice
to check sensitivity, and include 𝛼𝛼 = 0 to see if we could dispense with this extra parameter.
(3) Use their calculations of changes in cost for changes in energy efficiency to recover 𝛽𝛽. (4)
Show in appendix tables the various resulting combinations of 𝐴𝐴0 , 𝛼𝛼, and 𝛽𝛽. (5) Choose the
most reasonable combination of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 for our primary parameters. (6) Use those values for
our aggregation of cars and appliances, and show sensitivity of results to alternatives.
           The value of 𝛽𝛽 can vary along a single cost curve, and the whole curve can differ
between datasets, cars, and different appliances. This heterogeneity is confirmed across five
selected vehicles and appliances for which engineering studies are used in Appendix G to
calibrate 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 shown in Tables G1-G5. 30 The two tables for cars and light trucks each
show two methods, so the five tables show seven different calculations. These tables are not
available for every appliance and vehicle, so these examples only show a plausible range of
values. We choose a pair 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 to best represent all appliances and cars in our aggregation.
Our numerical results below are only illustrative; the same calculation could be undertaken
for any particular vehicle or household appliance, as in a partial equilibrium model.
           In the five tables, we see that 𝛽𝛽 can range widely, though all exceed one. Empirical

30
  The examples in Appendix G are based on two different datasets for vehicles, which yield somewhat different
results, plus three different appliances (central air conditioners, furnaces, and refrigerator-freezers).
                                                         -22-
studies of energy efficiency costs often find 𝛽𝛽=2 (quadratic costs). 31 But appendix tables also
show how 𝛼𝛼 depends on 𝛽𝛽, so they need to be chosen in concert. 32 Starting with 𝛼𝛼=0 in these
tables, the implied values of 𝛽𝛽 are unstable, varying from 1.25 to 5.82. Indeed, this instability
is what induced us to add the intercept 𝐴𝐴0 to the cost function. When 𝛼𝛼 is about one-half, the
                                                                                          𝛽𝛽
values of 𝛽𝛽 vary less, from about 1.75 to 2.75. The implied elasticity 1−𝛼𝛼 ranges from 3.5 to

5.5, but that range in our model would yield costly standards and large negative rebound. To
                                                                𝛽𝛽
be conservative, we choose 𝛼𝛼=0.5 and 𝛽𝛽=1.5 (so 1−𝛼𝛼 is only 3.0). 33 This choice is equivalent
                                                                                     𝛽𝛽
to the combination where 𝛼𝛼 is one-third and 𝛽𝛽=2, since the implied 1−𝛼𝛼 is still 3.0.

         Finally, we check the condition in Proposition 2 to make sure that the EES is binding
as our model assumes. The chosen parameter values imply 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 is 0.06, while (1 − 𝛼𝛼) ×
[(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 )] is 0.02, so these values are indeed consistent with our assumption
that the EES is binding and costly. Also, with all the calibrated parameters, 𝛽𝛽 must be at least
0.45 to ensure that the EES is binding. For sensitivity analysis, we vary 𝛽𝛽 from 1 to 5.

7. Numerical Illustrations

         For any costless technology shock, we assume a 10% increase in energy efficiency
technology, 𝜖𝜖̂ = 0.10. In the CTS case with no policy and no change in purchased energy
efficiency (𝐴𝐴̂ = 0), 10% better technology implies 10% better energy efficiency. For the EES,
we assume the government raises the efficiency standard for all appliances by 10%, so it
generates the same impact on energy efficiency. Inserting all calibrated parameters into each
expression in Table 1 yields the size of each effect in percentage points. The direct efficiency
effect (DEE) is calculated as if relative prices and incomes were constant. For example, a
+10% change in 𝜖𝜖 leads to a –4.6% DEE (because 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ⁄𝐸𝐸 = 0.460). If the total rebound


31
   Greene and DeCicco (2000) find that a quadratic cost function for fuel economy improvement can be a good
fit to the data. Also see NRC (2002) for various estimates of fuel economy cost curves. Our calibration of 𝛽𝛽 uses
more recent studies from the NRC and the International Council on Clean Transportation.
32
   In the tables, a higher 𝛼𝛼 is always associated with a smaller 𝛽𝛽. We take as given the engineering calculation of
the incremental cost of improving energy efficiency, but matching that incremental cost with a higher 𝛼𝛼 requires
                                                𝛽𝛽
a smaller 𝛽𝛽. But, the overall cost elasticity      does not vary as much as 𝛼𝛼 or 𝛽𝛽 individually. Appendix Tables
                                               1−𝛼𝛼
G1-G5 show that virtually any combination of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 yield an overall elasticity of 3.0 or higher.
33
  If the overall cost elasticity of 3.0 seems large, remember that it is the percent change in cost for a one percent
increase in total energy efficiency. In the vehicle example, suppose the required mpg rises from 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖=30.0 to 30.3
(a 1% increase in mpg). Manufacturers had no extra cost of achieving the initial “minimum” 15 mpg, so our cost
function applies to the mpg in excess of 𝐴𝐴0 =15. The same increase of 0.3 mpg is a 2% increase in the extra 15
mpg (from 15 to 30 mpg). With our 𝛽𝛽=1.5, that 2% addition means a 3% increase in cost.
                                                 -23-
effect (TRE) is about +1%, then total use of energy E falls by the difference (–3.6%).
        Using our calibrated parameters, we calculate and plot in Figure 1 not only the DEE,
but also the direct rebound effect (DRE), the indirect rebound effect (IRE), the TRE, and the
total effect (TE). The first five bars on the left are the effects from the CTS with no mandate.
The five bars in the middle show the CTS case with a binding EES, and the last five bars are
the effects on energy use from increased stringency of the EES policy.
        For the CTS with no policy, the fourth bar shows that the free 10% gain in energy
efficiency leads to a –4.6% “direct effect” on total energy use. More than one-fifth of that
energy saving is offset by the positive TRE in the third bar. Comparing the DRE in the first
bar to the TRE in the third bar suggests that nearly 90% of total rebound is from rebound on
appliance services. Though not shown in Figure 1, both the income and substitution effects
increase consumption of 𝑆𝑆. For the other goods in 𝑋𝑋, however, the substitution effect reduces
consumption, while the income effect increases it. The IRE in the second bar is net positive,
which means the positive income effect dominates the negative substitution effect on 𝑋𝑋. As
intended, these numerical results are consistent with findings in the prior rebound literature
that study the exogenous costless technology change.
        New in this paper is a pre-existing mandate that remains binding after the costless
technology shock (in the middle bars of Figure 1). Then the CTS allows consumers to pay less
for energy efficiency but still meet the unchanged energy efficiency requirement, 𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖. The
reduced spending on 𝐴𝐴 perfectly offsets the increase in technology (so 𝐴𝐴̂ = −𝜖𝜖̂). The savings
can be spent on more energy for services (𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ) and on other goods (𝑋𝑋). Visually, in the middle
bars for the CTS with existing policy, the bar for DEE seems missing, but energy efficiency
stays at the original level, so the DEE is literally zero. The total effect on energy is exactly the
total rebound effect, +1.17%. Both the rebound effects are positive, but the IRE is slightly
greater than the DRE. The income effect through the cost savings on energy efficiency
explains all rebound (i.e., no substitution effect).
        The “stricter EES” case shows the effects on energy use when the pre-existing EES
becomes 10% more stringent. As normalized, the CTS with no policy and the stricter EES
have identical direct energy efficiency effects – as might be calculated by engineers. But the
DRE from the EES (the dotted bar on the right) is less than half of the DRE from the CTS
with no policy (the dotted bar on the left). The IRE from the EES case (the diagonal stripe bar
on the right) is negative and larger in magnitude than the positive DRE. Therefore, total
                                                 -24-
rebound is negative: total energy saving in the last bar is greater than direct energy saving.
Substitution effects are the same for both the EES and CTS with no policy. Therefore, the real
income effect is a main difference in numerical results between the CTS and EES shocks. The
CTS provides an income gain, while policy presents a real income loss.
        Since the income effect is a key factor that distinguishes the CTS and the EES, we
next consider sensitivity of results first for 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 and then for other parameters.

8. Sensitivity Analysis

        Figure 2A investigates sensitivity of rebound effects as we vary the assumed curvature
of the cost function for energy efficiency (𝛽𝛽). Then Figure 2B shows these same rebound
effects through income and substitution effects. We use the central-case values for all other
parameters. In Figure 2 and others, we generally use dash-dot lines for the CTS with no
policy, dashed lines for the CTS with policy, and solid lines for the EES.
        For the costless energy efficiency gain with no pre-existing policy, Figure 2A shows
that the DRE and the IRE are completely flat: they do not depend on the cost of policy (𝛽𝛽).
Similarly, the income rebound effect (IncRE) and the substitution rebound effect (SubRE) in
Figure 2B also do not depend on 𝛽𝛽. These results for the CTS with no existing policy match
the prior literature that ignores the cost of requiring more energy efficiency.
        By contrast, the rebound effects from the CTS with pre-existing policy and from the
EES shock are more responsive to 𝛽𝛽, but they respond in opposite directions. First, for the
CTS with policy (dashed lines), the DRE and IRE are positive and rise with 𝛽𝛽. Why? A larger
𝛽𝛽 means that more is already being spent on energy efficiency, and the CTS allows consumers
to meet the unchanged mandate by use of new free technology instead, so it provides a larger
positive income shock (allowing more use of energy for both 𝑆𝑆 and 𝑋𝑋). In contrast, for the
stricter EES (solid lines), the DRE and IRE both fall with 𝛽𝛽. A larger 𝛽𝛽 in this case means that
the additional required energy efficiency is more expensive, which causes a larger negative
income shock and negative rebound effects. In fact, Figure 2B shows that all sensitivity of the
DRE and IRE comes from the income effect. Substitution effects for the CTS with no policy
and for the EES are the same and are completely flat lines (solid flat line in Figure 2B).
        Figure 2 does not show the direct efficiency effect, because it does not depend on 𝛽𝛽.
The DEE from the CTS with policy is zero. For both the CTS with no policy and EES shock,
                                                                 -25-
the DEE are normalized for all value of 𝛽𝛽 to be the same 4.6% reduction in energy use. 34
           Next, Figures 3A and 3B show results as the intercept in the cost function, 𝛼𝛼 ≡ 𝐴𝐴0 /𝐴𝐴,
varies between 0.2 and 0.8. Results are almost identical to those in Figure 2, because 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽
                                                            𝛽𝛽
                                      �𝐴𝐴 =
affect only the overall added cost in 𝐾𝐾    1−𝛼𝛼
                                                 𝐴𝐴̂. The difference is that 𝛽𝛽 affects that added

cost linearly (as also shown in Figure 2), whereas 𝛼𝛼 affects it nonlinearly (as also shown in
Figure 3). Just as for 𝛽𝛽 in Figure 2, the choice of 𝛼𝛼 in Figure 3 does not affect the CTS with
                                                       𝛽𝛽
no existing policy. In both figures, when 1−𝛼𝛼 gets larger, rebound effects are more positive

for a CTS with existing policy and more negative for an EES. Again, all of this sensitivity
occurs through the income effect. The substitution effect is completely flat (orange solid line
in 3B). Sensitivity results in the figures show that our central values of 𝛽𝛽=1.5 and 𝛼𝛼=0.5
appear to be both reasonable and conservative, as well as compatible with each other.
           Next, we undertake sensitivity analysis for the arbitrary assumption that one-half of
expenditures on appliances is for features that enhance energy efficiency. This assumed
                                        � , the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used for energy efficiency. 35 Because
fraction primarily affects 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≡ 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 /𝐾𝐾
the relationship between this assumed fraction and 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 is monotonic, however, our sensitivity
analysis for 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 is equivalent to testing the sensitivity of results to this assumed fraction.
           In our central calibration above, 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 is 0.037, but Figure 4 varies it from 0.02 to 0.06
(or equivalently, the assumed fraction of appliance spending that is for energy efficiency
varies from 0.25 to 0.8). As shown, rebound effects from the CTS with no policy do not
depend on the value of 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 , because again this parameter pertains to the cost of policy. In
contrast, rebound effects from both the EES and the CTS with policy are responsive to 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 .
Figure 4 looks a lot like Figure 2, because 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 affects the cost of policy as does 𝛽𝛽. Total
rebound from the EES shock can be negative if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 is larger than 0.036, and our central
estimate is 0.037. As depicted in Figure 4B, the substitution effect (orange solid line) has
almost no slope, so the income effect explains most of how rebounds depend on 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 .
           Prior studies focus overwhelmingly on the responsiveness of rebound effects to the
elasticity of substitution between energy services and other goods, and to the elasticity of
substitution between appliances and energy in the production of energy services. They ignore
the cost curvature parameter 𝛽𝛽 and the fraction 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 , which we show here can explain much of

34
     Backfire is impossible in this case; positive rebound from substitution is offset by the negative income effect.

the difference between rebound effects from the CTS and EES.
          Nonetheless, to compare our results with prior literature, Figure 5 plots rebound
effects from the CTS and EES shock against the elasticity of substitution in utility (𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 ). First,
recall that rebound effects from the CTS with a binding policy depend only on income effects,
not on substitution effects, so its rebound effects are flat in this figure.
         In contrast, rebound effects from both the CTS without policy and the EES are indeed
sensitive to 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 . In Figure 5A, both direct rebound effects rise steeply with 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , which is both
intuitive and consistent with prior literature. Regardless of whether it is cost-free or costly, an
increase in energy efficiency reduces the marginal cost of energy services and thus causes a
positive direct rebound effect that rises with 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 . Also in Figure 5A, the indirect rebound
effects in these two cases change only slightly with 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , because of offsetting income and
substitution effects on energy use in 𝑋𝑋. In addition, Figure 5B shows that the income effect
from the EES shock is always negative, while the income effects from both CTS cases are
always positive. Thus, for every value of 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 in 5A, the DRE from the EES shock is always
smaller than the DRE from the CTS without policy. 36

9. Extensions

         Our model must be fairly simple to be able to solve for GE effects analytically, but the
advantage is that mathematical expressions show exactly how each effect depends on
parameters and policies. We explained several caveats along the way. In this section, we
extend our model to relax four of our key assumptions and to see how they affect our main
results: (a) negative effects of total energy use on productivity; (b) upward-sloping supply of
energy; (c) mandates in the business sector, and (d) disaggregation.
         First, we study the case where emissions from energy use affect productivity (e.g.,
Williams, 2002). If so, reducing energy use could have positive income effects on rebound.
                                                     � = 𝐾𝐾𝑋𝑋 + 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 + 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 , with 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕/𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕<0, so
Then equation (1.9) of our basic model becomes 𝐺𝐺(𝐸𝐸)𝐾𝐾
that more emissions reduce productivity of the primary factor 𝐾𝐾. In the initial equilibrium,
𝐺𝐺(𝐸𝐸 0 ) = 1, where 𝐸𝐸 0 is initial energy use. We linearize that equation to get:

         𝛿𝛿𝐸𝐸� = 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝐾𝐾
                      �𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝐾𝐾
                                 �𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝐾𝐾
                                            �𝐸𝐸                                                          (9.1)



36
  In Figure 5B, income effects (in all three black lines) slightly rise with 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , because consumers are better able
to substitute towards cheaper energy services. But most of the response to 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 comes through the substitution
effect, as the orange solid line in Figure 5B is strongly upward sloping.

                    𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕   𝐸𝐸
where 𝛿𝛿 ≡ 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 𝐺𝐺(𝐸𝐸) < 0 is the elasticity of productivity with respect to energy use. Appendix H

derives all outcomes for a stricter EES, but here we show only the effect on total energy, 𝐸𝐸� :

              𝐸𝐸� = −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜂𝜂̂ +                         �𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛿𝛿 −          � 𝜂𝜂̂
                                        (1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝛿𝛿)                                         1 − 𝛼𝛼

The first term, −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜂𝜂̂ , is the direct efficiency effect, and the rest is total rebound. The new
parameter 𝛿𝛿<0 appears in two locations and therefore affects rebound, but it does not affect
the final term reflecting the cost of the policy – which generates a negative income effect with
a magnitude that depends on the cost curvature parameter 𝛽𝛽.

           The new condition for total rebound to be negative can be written as:
              𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛿𝛿) ,                                                                             (9.3)

which almost matches the condition in Proposition 3.ii from before, but adds −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛿𝛿 > 0 to the
right hand side. This term makes it harder for total rebound to be negative. Clearly, the
productivity gain from reducing energy consumption through the stricter EES generates a
positive income effect and thus a positive effect on rebound. The sign of the TRE is still
ambiguous, however. With a high cost of the mandate (𝛽𝛽), rebound can be negative.
           Second, to consider upward-sloping supply of energy, the production function 𝐸𝐸 = 𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸
is replaced by 𝐸𝐸 = 𝐸𝐸(𝐾𝐾𝐸𝐸 , 𝑄𝑄�), where 𝑄𝑄� is a fixed natural resource. 37 Then 𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 is the elasticity of
substitution in the production of energy, and 𝜃𝜃𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 is the cost share of the fixed factor 𝑄𝑄� . This
extension introduces one new unknown variable 𝑃𝑃𝑄𝑄 , the return to the fixed factor �
                                                                                    𝑄𝑄 , and thus
it raises the number of equations and unknowns from 10 to 11. All derivations are in
Appendix I. The result for 𝐸𝐸� in the case with increased stringency of the EES is:
                    1                                                                                                                                𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽
𝐸𝐸� = −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜂𝜂̂ +      ��𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 + 𝜃𝜃𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 �𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝜃𝜃𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋 (1 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 ) + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 − 𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾          � 𝜂𝜂̂
                    𝐷𝐷                                                                                                                              1 − 𝛼𝛼

where 𝐷𝐷 ≡ 𝜃𝜃𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 �𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 (𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 )/𝜃𝜃𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑋𝑋 (1 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 )� > 0.                                         (9.4)

The first term is the DEE, −𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝜂𝜂̂ , and the rest is the TRE (with both substitution and income
effects from the reduced price of energy). 38 After accounting for these effects, can the cost of

When the price of 𝑆𝑆 falls, a large 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 > 1 means a strong shift toward energy-intensive services, 𝑆𝑆, and thus more
demand for energy. With an upward-sloping energy supply and 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 > 1, more demand for 𝐸𝐸 implies an increase
in price 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 . Estimated demand elasticities are low, however, and our calibrated 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 is only 0.15.
                                                                              -28-
the stricter EES still make the TRE negative? The last term in the big parenthesis shows the
negative rebound effect from the costly policy (−𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽)/(1 − 𝛼𝛼)), but other terms are
positive. Thus, the sign of the TRE is still ambiguous. The condition for a negative TRE is:

                                                                                                              +                𝜎𝜎𝐸𝐸 𝜃𝜃𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾
                                                                                                                                                          �   (9.5)

which is stricter than the condition in Proposition 3.ii. Thus, adding slope to the energy supply
curve makes it somewhat more difficult for negative rebound effects to outweigh positive
rebound effects. But, it does not negate our point that the cost of the mandate introduces
negative effects on rebound. Thus, results of prior analyses of the costless technology shock
should not be used directly to infer effects of energy efficiency policy.
          Third, firms in sector 𝑋𝑋 also face energy standards on their business equipment and
vehicles. A complete model of that fact would include several more equations, lengthy
expressions, and more effects in our solutions. Using an ad hoc approach, however, we can
approximate those complicated effects within our simple model. Figure 6 plots rebound
effects for larger values of the parameter 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 , the fraction of total energy used with regulated
appliances to produce energy services. Our central parameter values include 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 of about one-
half, so Figure 6 varies 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 between one-third and two-thirds. It shows a steeply falling grey
line for the DEE, indicating that more energy subjected to efficiency standards means more
reduction in energy use. But the other lines all indicate that percentage rebound effects from
either the CTS or the EES shock are not very sensitive to 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 .
          Fourth, disaggregation and heterogeneity could matter for several reasons. First, the
PE model of Chan and Gillingham (2015) includes a list of goods with different cross-price
effects and energy intensities. Thus, a change in the price of services from one appliance leads
to more of some goods and less of others, each with a positive or negative effect on energy
use. 39 Indeed, our results highlight income effects, so different income elasticities would also
matter. Second, disaggregation could capture details of policy: vehicle CAFE standards in the
U.S. implicitly subsidize fuel-efficient cars and tax fuel-inefficient cars. Here, we capture
only the overall costs of such a policy on the average car with a single fuel efficiency. Third,
of course, heterogeneity would be important if high-income household expenditures differ
from those of low-income households – where policy places more burden on one or the other.

39
  West et al. (2017) show that a change in fuel efficiency also changes important vehicle attributes such as size,
safety, and performance. While the reduced cost per mile can increase driving, changes in those other attributes
could reduce it. Conceptually, these other attributes are “other goods” in utility, with cross-price elasticities.
                                                         -29-
         We cannot disaggregate goods in GE without a computational model, but a GE model
is not necessary to analyze a policy that applies only to freezers that constitute 0.1% of the
economy; it would have tiny indirect effects on the other 99.9% of the economy. Again,
however, we can use an ad hoc approach to see key differences between cars and appliances.
Using calibration procedures exactly analogous to those in section 6 above, Appendix J
derives share parameters (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 and 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ) for household vehicles and energy use (motor fuel). It
also aggregates all household appliances other than vehicles, such as refrigerators, furnaces,
and air conditioners. The calculated share parameters are shown in the first two columns of
Table 2. We continue to use the previous cost function parameters for both cases. 40
         Using the parameters in Table 2 for vehicles separately from appliances, we calculate
bar graphs just like Figure 1 (showing bars for the DEE, DRE, IRE, TRE, and total energy
use). Those bar graphs are in Appendix J, rather than here, because they look exactly like
Figure 1 but for the vertical scale. Table 2 shows that share parameters for vehicles are very
nearly half the size of the shares for appliances and vehicles together (and so appliances alone
are the other half). Thus, bars for the DEE extend down to 2.3% less energy, instead of 4.6%
less energy. Each type of positive rebound extends up to 0.5% more energy instead of 1.0%
more energy; and each type of negative rebound is also half the size of those in Figure 1.
         The lesson here is that the size of the sector does not affect the relative size of effects.
Both share parameters (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 and 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ) are halved, so all results are halved. The relative sizes of the
DEE would differ if only 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 changed (as in Figure 6); the relative sizes of other effects would
differ if only 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 changed (as in Figure 4). The relative sizes of the effects for appliances vs.
vehicles would also differ if those two categories faced different mandate stringency (i.e., 𝛽𝛽,
as in Figure 2), or have different demand elasticities (based on 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 , varied in Figure 5). The
point here is that the relative size of each rebound effect depends in a primary way on whether
the improvement in energy efficiency derives from a technology shock or a mandate, and
whether the technology shock takes place with or without a pre-existing mandate.

10. Conclusions

         We use a simple analytical general equilibrium model to analyze and to compare
rebound effects from an EES to those from a CTS. In both cases, we consider the economy


40
  The calibration of 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛽𝛽 in Appendix G for cars and appliances are not much different from each other. In
four calculations for cars and light trucks, when 𝛼𝛼 is about one-half, 𝛽𝛽 varies from 1.75 to 2.71. Three cases for
appliances with 𝛼𝛼 about one-half yield 𝛽𝛽 from 2.18 to 2.78. Sensitivity above shows how 𝛼𝛼 or 𝛽𝛽 affects results.

with a pre-existing EES that is both costly and binding. Also, we decompose each total effect
on the use of energy into various components, including a direct efficiency effect, a direct
rebound effect, and an indirect rebound effect. Each rebound term is composed of substitution
and income effects. Results show that the magnitude and sign of rebound for both the CTS
and EES depend strongly on the costliness of efficiency mandates.
       As found in prior literature, a CTS raises real incomes and thus has positive rebound
effects on energy use that offset part of the reduction from the improvement in technology.
Some studies have interpreted such results to indicate effects of energy efficiency policies.
Here, however, we show that energy efficiency standards have costs and therefore reduce
income, which can reduce energy use and cause negative rebound. Also, the prior literature
gives much attention to rebound through the substitution effect. Here, with a costly energy
efficiency policy, the curvature of the cost curve for energy efficiency improvements gives
rise to income effects that help determine the magnitude and sign of rebound.
       Numerical illustrations use reasonable values for all parameters, including elasticities,
factor shares, and cost parameters. With these plausible parameters, total rebound from a CTS
is positive, but total rebound from an EES are negative. The analytical findings and numerical
example both suggest that using estimated rebound from a zero-cost efficiency gain as the
effect of an energy efficiency mandate could greatly overstate rebound from the mandate.
       Our results do not contradict prior empirical estimates of rebound in PE models, but
they do demand a reinterpretation of those results. If a PE model of a costless efficiency
improvement finds 10% positive rebound (as we do in Section 3), then the author or reader
needs to add a sentence. “If these estimated behaviors were embedded into a GE model and
used to calculate the effects of a costly mandate to improve energy efficiency, then negative
income effects could reduce energy use not only for appliance services but also in the other
sector of the economy; total rebound could well be negative.”

Appendix A. Solve for Changes in Energy from a CTS with No Policy

        This appendix uses equations (2.1) - (2.10) in the text to solve for changes in prices
and quantities that result from a small CTS, 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0, but to compare these results with the
previous literature, we calculate the effects of the alternative assumption that: 𝐴𝐴̂ = 𝐾𝐾
                                                                                        �𝐴𝐴 = 0.
                           �
With the numeraire choice, 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 = 0, relative prices of 𝐸𝐸 and 𝑋𝑋 does not change because the

                                                                                  �𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃
production of 𝐸𝐸 uses only 𝐾𝐾 and the production of 𝑋𝑋 uses 𝐾𝐾 and 𝐸𝐸. Substitute 𝑃𝑃    � 𝑋𝑋 = 0

into (2.2), (2.4), (2.7), and (2.8) and manipulate to derive:

        𝐾𝐾    �𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋� = −𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝜖𝜖̂ + 𝜖𝜖̂ + 𝐴𝐴̂ + 𝐸𝐸
        �𝑋𝑋 = 𝐸𝐸                                  �𝑆𝑆 = (1 − 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 )𝜖𝜖̂ + 𝐸𝐸
                                                                         �𝑆𝑆                                              (A.1)

Then substitute (A.1) into (2.9):

        𝐸𝐸� = 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝜖𝜖̂(1 − 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 ) + 𝐸𝐸
                                    �𝑆𝑆                                                                                   (A.2)

                             �𝐴𝐴 = 0 into (2.10) to obtain the closed form solution for 𝐸𝐸
Substitute (A.1), (A.2), and 𝐾𝐾                                                         �𝑆𝑆
(equation (3.3) in the text):
             (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )(𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 − 1)                                  (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
     �𝑆𝑆 =
     𝐸𝐸                                    𝜖𝜖̂ = �(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 +                                          − 1� 𝜖𝜖̂
                       1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴                                                           1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴

                                        �𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 +𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 �𝜎𝜎 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 +𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
        = �(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 +                        𝑈𝑈
                                                                               − 1� 𝜖𝜖̂                                    (A.3)
                                                     1−𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴


Substitute (A.3) into (2.1), (A.1) and (A.2) to obtain equations (3.1), (3.2), and (3.4) in the
text for the closed form solutions of 𝑋𝑋�, 𝑆𝑆̂ and 𝐸𝐸� .

Appendix B: Separating Income and Substitution Effects for the CTS

        We take the overall effect on energy use from a small exogenous CTS and separate it
into income and substitution effects. This shock changes consumers’ costs, real incomes, and
consumption choices. We measure the substitution effect for each commodity as a change in
that quantity within the overall consumption bundle that makes the consumers as happy as
before the price change but while facing new prices. The income effect is the remaining
change in the consumption bundle due to the change in real income.
        We use superscript “0” to denote the initial equilibrium and superscript “1” to denote
the new equilibrium. Also, the superscript “𝐶𝐶” refers to the “compensated” quantity needed to
measure the substitution effect, and the superscript “𝐼𝐼” refers to the remaining change in
quantity from the income effect. We start with equations from Appendix A that show
                                                                                    -A2-

solutions for 𝑋𝑋� and 𝑆𝑆̂ as functions of the shock and parameters:
                                                                   (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
           𝑋𝑋� = �−(𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 +                                                                � 𝜖𝜖̂
                                                                                 1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴

                                                               (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
           𝑆𝑆̂ = �(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 +                                                             � 𝜖𝜖̂
                                                                             1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴

Decompose the effect of the shock on 𝑆𝑆 into two components:

                𝑆𝑆1 −𝑆𝑆0
           𝑆𝑆̂ ≡ 0 = 𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐼𝐼                                                                                                                                                  (B.1)
                        𝑆𝑆

where 𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐶𝐶 ≡ (𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶 − 𝑆𝑆 0 )/𝑆𝑆 0 defines the substitution effect, and 𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐼𝐼 ≡ (𝑆𝑆 1 − 𝑆𝑆 𝐶𝐶 )/𝑆𝑆 0 is the
income effect. We define 𝑋𝑋� 𝐶𝐶 and 𝑋𝑋� 𝐼𝐼 similarly as the substitution and income effects on 𝑋𝑋�:

                 𝑋𝑋1 −𝑋𝑋0
           𝑋𝑋� =      0   = 𝑋𝑋� 𝐶𝐶 + 𝑋𝑋� 𝐼𝐼                                                                                                                                           (B.2)
                         𝑋𝑋

By definition, the substitution effect implies that consumers stay at their original utility level
facing the new price, so we observe zero change in utility:

            𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇        𝐼𝐼                   𝐼𝐼

                     = (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝑋𝑋� 𝐶𝐶 + (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 )𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐶𝐶 = 0                                                                                                       (B.3)

where 𝜇𝜇 is the marginal utility of income, and we use first order conditions from consumer
optimization (𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕/𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 𝜇𝜇𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 ).
           With homothetic preferences, the income effect changes the consumption bundle
proportionately, so we get: 1

           𝑋𝑋� 𝐼𝐼 = 𝑆𝑆̃ 𝐼𝐼                                                                                                                                                             (B.4)

Appendix C: Derivation of the Welfare Change from a CTS

                 Here, we derive the welfare change from the CTS. Consumers maximize utility by
their choices of the composite good, 𝑋𝑋, and appliance services, 𝑆𝑆, subject to their budget:
                 max 𝑈𝑈(𝑆𝑆, 𝑋𝑋; 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛) subject to 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 𝑋𝑋 + 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 + 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 ≤ 𝐼𝐼
                  𝑋𝑋,𝑆𝑆

Assuming interior solutions (the budget constraint holds as an equality), first order conditions
for this maximizing problem are:

                 𝑈𝑈𝑋𝑋 − 𝜇𝜇𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 = 0 or 𝑈𝑈𝑋𝑋 /𝜇𝜇 = 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋                                                                                                                             (C.1)
                 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 − 𝜇𝜇𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /(𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖) = 0 or 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 /𝜇𝜇 = 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 /(𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖)                                                                                                             (C.2)

where a subscript on 𝑈𝑈 indicates a partial derivative (marginal utility), and 𝜇𝜇 is the shadow
price on the budget constraint (marginal utility of income).
                 The CTS affects prices and outputs, so it affects utility. Totally differentiate the utility
function and divide by 𝜇𝜇 to obtain the dollar value of the change in utility:
                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑈𝑈𝑋𝑋       𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆
                     =     𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                  𝜇𝜇   𝜇𝜇         𝜇𝜇
Substitute (C.1) and (C.2) into the above equation and divide by the total income (I). Then
multiply and divide by appropriate terms, and rearrange:

Appendix D: Solve for Changes in Energy from a CTS with a Pre-existing EES

         To solve for changes in prices and quantities from a small CTS, 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0, we assume no
change in the EES. The pre-existing EES is still binding, so we get:

         � = 𝜂𝜂̂ = 0 or 𝐴𝐴̂ = −𝜖𝜖̂
         𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖                                                                                                    (D.1)

Given (D.1), linearized equations (2.1) - (2.10) yield a system of 10 equations and 10

changes in energy use in sectors 𝑆𝑆 and 𝑋𝑋 as functions of parameters and the shock 𝜖𝜖̂ > 0. The
easiest way to solve this system is to find expressions for changes in all quantities in term of
�𝑆𝑆 and 𝜖𝜖̂, and then substitute those expressions into equation (2.10) to get the closed-form

and combined with (2.7) - (2.8), it yields: 𝑃𝑃     � �
                                              𝐾𝐾 = 𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸 = 𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋 = 0. We substitute these zero

changes and (D.1) into into (2.1), (2.2), (2.4), and (2.5)) to obtain:

         𝐾𝐾    �𝑋𝑋 = 𝑋𝑋� = 𝑆𝑆̂ = 𝐸𝐸
         �𝑋𝑋 = 𝐸𝐸                �𝑆𝑆                                                                            (D.2)

Thus, the percentage change in 𝐸𝐸 equals the percentage change in 𝐸𝐸𝑋𝑋 and 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 , then use (2.3)
and (2.9) to get:

         We can solve for the welfare gain from this shock by following the same step in

Appendix E: Solve for Changes in Energy from a Small EES Policy Shock

        This appendix uses equations (2.1) - (2.10) in the text to solve for changes in prices
and quantities that result from a tighter efficiency standard (𝜂𝜂̂ > 0). We assume no change in
energy efficient technology, so 𝜖𝜖̂ = 0. Because purchase of 𝐴𝐴 is costly, households will not
buy more than necessary to satisfy the new requirement. Therefore the chosen 𝐴𝐴̂ will equal the

We want the closed-form expression for 𝐸𝐸� as a function of parameters and the policy shock 𝜂𝜂̂ .

        From (2.2) and (2.4), no change in relative prices of 𝐾𝐾, 𝐸𝐸, and 𝑋𝑋 implies that:

Appendix F: Proof of Proposition 3

Proof of (3.i):

        The DRE from the EES shock is the sum of the substitution and income effects on 𝐸𝐸,
so it can be written and shorten as:

Because 1 − 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 > 0, 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 > 0, and 𝜂𝜂̂ > 0, the sign of DRE has the sign of the whole expression
in big parentheses. That is, if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 �, then DRE< 0. In such
a case, 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 is even larger than required for the EES to bind as
𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 � > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 )𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 �.
          We can also show that under the condition 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 �,
the IRE is also negative and more negative that the DRE. We can write the IRE as:

The fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used in production of 𝐴𝐴 to 𝐾𝐾
of TRE depends on the term in big parentheses. That is, if 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)(𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ),
then TRE< 0.
        First, we must meet the minimum requirement such that the pre-existing energy
efficiency standard is costly and binding: that is, γA β > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(γX + γE λX )σU γA + λS γE �.
If energy service sector is less energy intensive (i.e., 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 < 0), then we can show:
                                   𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 < (𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸
by subtracting the left hand side terms from the right hand side terms in the above inequality
and rearranging the result as :

Then in such a case, the minimum requirement to ensure the pre-existing energy efficiency
standard is costly and binding implies the condition such that 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 < 0.
        If energy service sector is more energy intensive (i.e., 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 − 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 > 0), then the
minimum costly and binding EES condition is less strict than the condition that is required for
the TRE to be negative:
             𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 𝛽𝛽 > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)(𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ) > (1 − 𝛼𝛼)�(𝛾𝛾𝑋𝑋 + 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 − 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸 �

Proof of (3.iii):

        Backfire occurs when the direct energy savings from increased energy efficiency are
more than offset by the positive rebound effects, or the total effect on energy use is positive.
It’s trivial to show that if the energy service sector is less energy intensive than the other good
sector, backfire is impossible as the total rebound effect is actually a negative rebound.
        Consider if the energy service sector is more energy intensive, then from equation
(5.4), the total effect on energy use can be shortened as:

                                             (𝛾𝛾 +𝛾𝛾 𝜆𝜆𝑋𝑋 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 +𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 𝛾𝛾𝐸𝐸        𝛾𝛾 𝛽𝛽

Appendix G: Calibration of Cost Function Parameters (𝜶𝜶 and 𝜷𝜷)

         Recall that the annual cost, 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 , of achieving more energy efficiency, 𝐴𝐴, is a function
of the extra energy efficiency beyond some 𝐴𝐴0 which we call “minimum” energy efficiency:
         𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 𝐵𝐵(𝐴𝐴 − 𝐴𝐴0 )𝛽𝛽 , with 𝐵𝐵 > 0 and 𝛽𝛽 ≥ 1
This minimum 𝐴𝐴0 is essentially an engineering concept, but it is better interpreted as a
parameter of the cost function – a fixed number that needs to be calibrated for the model to fit
the facts we want to capture. 3 Various sources below are used to set 𝛼𝛼, defined as 𝛼𝛼 ≡ 𝐴𝐴0 /𝐴𝐴.
         For convenience of notation, we define 𝐴𝐴1 ≡ 𝐴𝐴 − 𝐴𝐴0 . Then the above cost equation
                                   𝛽𝛽
can be written as: 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴1 , and it can be differentiated with respect to the chosen extra
energy efficiency 𝐴𝐴1 to obtain the marginal cost of energy efficiency:
                                              𝑑𝑑𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 𝑑𝑑𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴         𝛽𝛽−1                                              (G.1)
                                     𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 ≡         =       = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐴𝐴1
                                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑   𝑑𝑑𝐴𝐴1
Note that 𝑑𝑑𝐴𝐴1 = 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, since 𝐴𝐴0 is a fixed parameter. Totally differentiate equation (G.1) with
respect to 𝐴𝐴1 to get:

                                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵(𝛽𝛽 − 1)𝐴𝐴1
                                                                  𝛽𝛽−2
                                                                         𝑑𝑑𝐴𝐴1                                        (G.2)

Divide equation (G.2) by equation (G.1) to obtain:

  This 𝐴𝐴0 is not the cost-minimizing energy efficiency that un-regulated firms and consumers would choose.
Existing mandates mean that firms start with 𝐴𝐴 above 𝐴𝐴0 , and our model is used only for small changes. This 𝐴𝐴0
just shifts the cost curve, so that 𝐴𝐴0 and 𝛽𝛽 can be chosen jointly to obtain the best fit for available information.

equation (G.3) to calibrate our cost curve parameter 𝛽𝛽.
        For light-duty vehicles, given some initial fuel efficiency 𝐴𝐴 in miles per gallon (mpg),
calculations of incremental costs (𝑑𝑑𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 ) associated with improved fuel efficiency (𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) are
provided by the International Council on Clean Transportation (Lutsey et al., 2017) and the
National Research Council (NRC, 2015). For several major appliances, the Department of
Energy (DOE, 2011, 2016a, and 2016b) provides similar cost calculations for changes in
energy efficiency (as measured for appliances). We use those additional costs to calculate the
                                                                                     � ).

        Then, to calibrate 𝛽𝛽 using equation (G.3), we also need to know �
                                                                         𝐴𝐴1 = 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/(𝐴𝐴 − 𝐴𝐴0 ),
where 𝐴𝐴0 is not observed. In the model, 𝐴𝐴 and 𝐴𝐴0 are in services 𝑆𝑆 per unit of energy, where 𝑆𝑆
is an aggregation. In the data, energy efficiency is reported in mpg for cars, or Annual Fuel
Utilization Efficiency (AFUE) for furnaces, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (SEER) for
air conditioners. Our text lists the six steps of our approach.
        Table G1 shows calibration results for midsize cars with spark-ignition (SI) engines,
as studied in NRC (2015). Panel A shows their “low-technology cost scenario”, and panel B
shows their “high-technology cost scenario”. Fuel efficiency improvements and associated
incremental costs in the first two columns of Table G1 are taken from NRC (2015). All
incremental costs are relative to the “null vehicle” which has the lowest technology in the
2008 model year. 4 The third column shows our calculated marginal cost of energy efficiency,
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, the change in incremental cost divided by the change in fuel economy. Using the first
two rows, we have (1,388–321)/(52.1–36.5 ) = 68 (in dollars per additional mpg). Then we
                                                     � = 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑/𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀). For the same example,
calculate the proportional change in marginal cost (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀
the percentage change in the marginal cost from 36.5 to 52.1 mpg is (153–68)/68 = 1.24 (or,
124%). Our calibrated 𝛽𝛽 in either the low- or high-cost scenarios is only a point calculation
(at 36.5 mpg or 36.4 mpg). These mpg’s are between the 2015 CAFE standard and the 2016
CAFE standard for passenger cars (i.e., between 36.2 mpg and 37.8 mpg).
        The last four columns of Table G1 show the calculation of 𝛽𝛽 for each 𝐴𝐴0 and 𝛼𝛼. The
table shows that a smaller minimum fuel economy 𝛼𝛼 tends to yield a larger 𝛽𝛽. The calculated
𝛽𝛽 is generally higher in the low-cost scenario than in the high-cost scenario. In either panel,
and in our other calculations below, 𝛼𝛼=0 can yield high and unstable values of 𝛽𝛽. When 𝛼𝛼 is

 Technologies are added to improve the fuel economy of the null vehicle in order to meet the current and future
CAFE standards. See NRC (2015) for more technical descriptions of the null vehicle.

Note: Data are taken from the DOE (2016a). SEER stands for Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is a
measure of an air conditioner’s efficiency. A SEER rating is the ratio of cooling in British thermal unit (BTU) to
the energy consumed in watt-hours. The federally regulated minimum SEER for air conditioners are 13 or 14
depending on geographical locations. Choices of 𝐴𝐴0 for sensitivity analysis are 0, 8, 9, and 10.


           Next, we show calibration results for residential central air conditioning units in Table
G3, furnaces in Table G4, and refrigerator-freezers in Table G5. These selections are major
appliances that consume much household energy, and ones for which incremental costs are
available from DOE (2011, 2016a, 2016b). The first column in Tables G3 and G4 shows the
measured energy efficiency (the SEER rating for air conditioners and AFUE rating for
furnaces). 6 Their associated installed costs are provided by DOE (2016a, 2016b) and shown in
the second column of both tables. To calculate marginal costs of energy efficiency in the third
column, we divide the difference between installed costs in the second column by the increase
in energy efficiency in the first column. For example, in the third column of Table G3, the
marginal cost 156 = (4,935 – 4,779)/(15.0-14.0). Then, the table shows the percentage change
in marginal costs, followed by the cost curve parameter 𝛽𝛽 (in the last four columns). The
minimum energy efficiency 𝐴𝐴0 is a technological parameter, not related to policy, so we vary

  A SEER rating is the ratio of cooling in British thermal unit (BTU) to the energy consumed in watt-hours. A
furnace with an AFUE rating of 90 would mean that it can convert 90% of its fuel into usable heat.

central air conditioners and furnaces varies around 2.

Note: For each maximum energy use (first column), DOE (2011) calculates incremental cost (third column). The
text describes how we convert their maximum energy use to a measure of required energy efficiency for our
model (second column), in cubic feet cooled per kWh per day. The last four columns show our calculated 𝛽𝛽 for
alternative assumptions about 𝐴𝐴0 in kWh/year (namely, 0, 500, 550, and 600).

            Table G5 presents calculations for refrigerator-freezers, where efficiency is measured
as the annual energy use. The federal standard before September 15, 2014 for top-mount
refrigerator-freezers is stated as a maximum energy use, for example 432.8 kWh per year. 7
DOE (2011) provides calculations for each annual energy consumption (kWh/year) shown in
the first column. In our analytical model, however, energy efficiency is measured as services
per unit of energy (𝜖𝜖𝜖𝜖 = 𝑆𝑆/𝐸𝐸). Therefore, we convert the efficiency of refrigerator-freezers to
volume cooled per unit of electricity per day. To do so, we multiply the size of the appliance
(16 cubic feet) by the number of days per year (365.25) and divide by annual energy use.
Results are shown in the second column of Table G5. The third column is the incremental cost
of DOE (2011), from which we calculate marginal cost in the fourth column (and change in
marginal cost in the fifth column). Using four alternatives for 𝐴𝐴0 (in kWh per year), the last

 This figure is calculated as 9.80 times the adjusted volume of the appliance in cubic feet, plus 276. If the
volume is 16 cubic feet, then the maximum energy use is 9.8 ×16+276= 432.8 kWh per year.

four columns show the calibrated 𝛽𝛽. We generally vary the minimum energy efficiency 𝐴𝐴0
below the federally required minimum efficiency for each appliance.
            In general, Tables G1-G5 confirm that cost parameters can vary across vehicles and
appliances and also depend on methods and assumptions. Our calibration section describes
how we choose a pair of parameters that best fit the calculations appearing in all these tables.

            This appendix uses equations (2.1) - (2.9) and (9.1) from the text to solve for changes

Appendix I: An Upward-Sloping Supply of Energy

            This appendix considers an upward-sloping supply of energy, and it solves for changes
in prices and quantities that result from a tighter efficiency standard (𝜂𝜂̂ > 0). Like Appendix

Appendix J: Calibration for Vehicles Separately from Household Appliances

           As in the main calibration of section 6, we obtain 2015 residential energy expenditure
data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Data on gasoline and other
motor fuels are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
           For household vehicles and parts, we use EIA data to calculate that the annualized cost
for energy efficiency is 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 344.342 ($B). Thus, the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used for energy
                                                -A15-

                         � ) is 344.342/18,037 = 0.019. Total expenditure on gasoline and other
efficiency (𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≡ 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 /𝐾𝐾
motor fuels is 270 ($B). The ratio of this energy use to total energy use is 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ≡ 𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ⁄𝐸𝐸 =
270/1,127 = 0.240, and the fraction of energy used in production of the composite good 𝑋𝑋 is
0.760. We keep other parameters the same as in the case with all cars and appliances together,
and we check the condition in Proposition 2 to make sure that the fuel efficiency standard is
binding. All direct and rebound effects are shown in the figure below.
        For household appliances other than vehicles, our calibrated annual cost for energy
efficiency is 𝑃𝑃𝐾𝐾 𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 = 330.658 ($B), so the fraction of 𝐾𝐾 used for energy efficiency is 𝛾𝛾𝐴𝐴 ≡
      � = 330.658/18,037 = 0.018. The total energy used for these appliance services (without
𝐾𝐾𝐴𝐴 /𝐾𝐾
motor fuel costs) is 248 ($B). Thus the ratio of this energy use to total energy use is 𝜆𝜆𝑆𝑆 ≡
𝐸𝐸𝑆𝑆 ⁄𝐸𝐸 = 248/1,127 = 0.220, and the fraction of energy used in production of the composite
good is 0.780. We keep other parameters the same as in the case with household vehicles, and
we check the condition in Proposition 2 to make sure that the appliance standard is binding.
All direct and rebound effects are shown in another figure below.
