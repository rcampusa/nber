                                             ABSTRACT

We show how to construct optimal policy projections in Ramses, the Riksbank’s open-economy medium-sized
DSGE model for forecasting and policy analysis. Bayesian estimation of the parameters of the model
indicates that they are relatively invariant to alternative policy assumptions and supports our view
that the model parameters may be regarded as unaffected by the monetary policy specification. We
discuss how monetary policy, and in particular the choice of output gap measure, affects the transmission
of shocks. Finally, we use the model to assess the recent Great Recession in the world economy and
how its impact on the economic development in Sweden depends on the conduct of monetary policy.
This provides an illustration on how Rames incorporates large international spillover effects.

1. Introduction

We study optimal monetary policy in Ramses, the main model used at Sveriges Riksbank for
forecasting and policy analysis. Ramses is an estimated small open-economy dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium (DSGE) model, developed by Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé, and Villani (ALLV) [4]
and [3].
    By optimal monetary policy we mean policy that minimizes an intertemporal loss function.
The intertemporal loss function is a discounted sum of expected future period losses. We choose a
quadratic period loss function that corresponds to flexible inflation targeting and is the weighted
sum of three terms: the squared inflation gap between 4-quarter CPI inflation and the inflation
target, the squared output gap between output and potential output, and the squared quarterly
change in the Riksbank’s instrument rate, the repo rate. We interpret such a loss function as con-
sistent with flexible inflation targeting and the Riksbank’s mandate, which implies that monetary
policy is directed towards stabilizing both inflation around an inflation target of 2 percent and
resource utilization around a normal level ([36]).1
    A fundamental assumption in our analysis is that Ramses is a structural model whose parameters
are invariant to the changes in monetary policy we consider. We estimate the model parameters
with Bayesian techniques under diﬀerent assumptions about the conduct of monetary policy. First,
as in ALLV [3], we estimate the model under the assumption that the Riksbank has followed a
simple instrument rule during the inflation-targeting period which started in 1993:1.2 Second,
we estimate the model under the assumption that the Riksbank has minimized an intertemporal
loss function during the inflation-targeting period. The estimates of the instrument-rule and loss-
function parameters provide benchmarks for the subsequent policy analysis. A finding in the
empirical analysis is that whether past policy of the Riksbank until 2007:3 (the end of the sample
used) is better explained as following a simple instrument rule or minimizing a loss function depends
on whether the simple instrument rule and the optimal policy rule has a white-noise policy shock
(control error) or not. Without a shock in both rules, we find that optimal policy fits the data
   1
     In some simple models, quadratic approximations of the welfare of a representative household results in a similar
period loss function (Woodford [38]). Such approximations of household welfare are very model-dependent and reflect
the particular distortions assumed in any given model. Household welfare is in any case hardly an operational central-
bank objective, although it may be of interest and relevant to examine how household welfare in particular models is
aﬀected by central-bank policy. Such an undertaking is beyond the scope of the present paper, though.
   2
     The inflation-targeting period is assumed to start 1993:1 (the estimation sample in this paper ends 2007:3). Prior
to this period (1986:1—1992:4), the conduct of policy is assumed to be given by a simple instrument rule. The switch
to the inflation-targeting regime in 1993:1 is assumed to be completely unanticipated but expected to be permanent
once it has occurred.




                                                          1
equally well as the simple instrument rule. With a shock in both rules, there is a clear improvement
in the empirical fit of both rules. Furthermore, the simple instrument rule has a slight empirical
advantage relative to optimal policy. Hence, for the particular sample period in question, with policy
shocks the simple instrument rule oﬀers a slightly better characterization of monetary policy. Our
results are hence slightly diﬀerent than those reported by Wolden Bache, Brubakk, and Maih [37]
on Norwegian data, which stems from the fact that they do not allow for a control error in their
analysis.
   One contribution of our paper is to provide a detailed analysis of how to do optimal policy
projections in an estimated linear-quadratic model with forward-looking variables, extending on
previous analysis by Svensson [28] and Svensson and Tetlow [34]. A key issue for a flexible inflation-
targeting central bank is which measure of resource utilization to stabilize. We use the output gap as
measure of resource utilization and study alternative definitions of potential output and the output
gap, in order to make an assessment to what extent the formulation of the output gap in the loss
function aﬀects the conduct of monetary policy and propagation of shocks. More precisely, we report
results from three alternative concepts of output gaps ( −̄ ), deviations of actual (log) output ( )
from potential (log) output (̄ ), in the loss function. One concept of output gap is the trend output
gap where potential output is the trend output level, which is growing stochastically due to the
unit-root stochastic technology shock in the model. A second concept is the unconditional output
gap, where potential output is unconditional potential output, which is defined as the hypothetical
output level that would exist if the economy would have had flexible prices and wages for a long time
and would have been subject to a subset of the same shocks as the actual economy. Unconditional
potential output therefore presumes diﬀerent levels of the predetermined variables, including the
capital stock, from those in the actual economy. A third concept is the conditional output gap,
where potential output is conditional potential output, which is defined as the hypothetical output
level that would arise if prices and wages suddenly become flexible in the current period and are
expected to remain flexible in the future. Conditional potential output therefore depends on the
existing current predetermined variables, including the current capital stock.
   To illustrate how the policy maker’s choice of output measure can influence the transmission of
shocks we study impulse response functions to a persistent but stationary technology shock. Ac-
cording to the estimated model, shocks to total factor productivity is a dominant driver of business
cycles in Sweden. In addition to its economic importance, this shock is also particularly interesting
to study since it aﬀects the various output gaps diﬀerently. Conditional and unconditional poten-


                                                    2
tial output increases when a positive stationary technology shock hits the economy, whereas trend
output by definition is independent of such shocks and only depends on permanent (unit-root)
technology shocks.
    With that analysis in hand, we report and discuss optimal policy projections for Sweden using
data up to and including 2008:2. We use the model to interpret the economic development in
Sweden just at the time when the world economy fell into a deep recession due to the collapse in
the financial markets. We choose this period to highlight the sensitivity of the Swedish economy to
foreign shocks. We show projections for the estimated instrument rule and for optimal policy with
diﬀerent output gaps in the loss function, which create diﬀerent trade-oﬀs for the central bank in
stabilizing inflation and output.
    The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents Ramses in more general modeling terms.
Section 3 discusses the data and priors used in the estimation and presents estimation results for the
various specifications of the model and policy. Section 4 presents and discusses impulse response
functions to a technology shock with diﬀerent output gaps in the loss function. Section 5 discusses
how to construct optimal policy projections, and analyzes alternative projections for a policymaker
during the recent Great Recession. Finally, section 6 presents a summary and some conclusions.
Appendices A-B contain a detailed specification of Ramses and some other technical details.


2. The model

Ramses is a small open-economy DSGE model developed in a series of papers by ALLV [4] and
[3]. The model economy consists of households, domestic goods firms, importing consumption and
importing investment firms, exporting firms, a government, a central bank, and an exogenous foreign
economy. Within each manufacturing sector there is a continuum of firms that each produces a
diﬀerentiated good and sets prices according to an indexation variant of the Calvo model. Domestic
as well as global production grows with technology that contains a stochastic unit-root, see Altig
et al. [8].
    In what follows we provide the optimization problems of the diﬀerent firms and the households,
and describe the behavior of the central bank. The log-linear approximation of the model is
presented in appendix A.




                                                  3
2.1. Domestic goods firms

The domestic goods firms produce their goods using capital and labor inputs, and sell them to a
retailer which transforms the intermediate products into a homogenous final good that in turn is
sold to the households.
   The final domestic good is a composite of a continuum of diﬀerentiated intermediate goods,
each supplied by a diﬀerent firm. Output,  , of the final domestic good is produced with the
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function
                                    ⎡1            ⎤

where  , 0 ≤  ≤ 1, is the input of intermediate good  and  is a stochastic process that
determines the time-varying flexible-price markup in the domestic goods market. The production
of the intermediate good  by intermediate-good firm  is given by

                                      = 1−   1− −                              (2.2)

where  is a unit-root technology shock common to the domestic and foreign economies,  is a do-
mestic covariance stationary technology shock,  the capital stock and  denotes homogeneous
labor hired by the  firm. A fixed cost   is included in the production function. We set this
parameter so that profits are zero in steady state, following Christiano et al. [11].
   We allow for working capital by assuming that a fraction  of the intermediate firms’ wage
bill has to be financed in advance through loans from a financial intermediary. Cost minimization
yields the following nominal marginal cost for intermediate firm :

                                 1      1                                      1 1

where  is the gross nominal rental rate per unit of capital, −1 the gross nominal (economy
wide) interest rate, and  the nominal wage rate per unit of aggregate, homogeneous, labor  .
   Each of the domestic goods firms is subject to price stickiness through an indexation variant of
the Calvo [10] model. Each intermediate firm faces in any period a probability 1 −   that it can
reoptimize its price. The reoptimized price is denoted  . For the firms that are not allowed
to reoptimize their price, we adopt an indexation scheme with partial indexation to the current
inflation target, ̄ +1 , since there is a perceived (time-varying) CPI inflation target in the model ,

2.2. Importing and exporting firms

The importing consumption and importing investment firms buy a homogenous good at price ∗
in the world market, and convert it into a diﬀerentiated good through a brand naming technology.
The exporting firms buy the (homogenous) domestic final good at price  and turn this into
a diﬀerentiated export good through the same type of brand naming. The nominal marginal
cost of the importing and exporting firms are thus  ∗ and   , respectively, where  is the
nominal exchange rate (domestic currency per unit of foreign currency). The diﬀerentiated import
and export goods are subsequently aggregated by an import consumption, import investment and
export packer, respectively, so that the final import consumption, import investment, and export
good is each a CES composite according to the following:

where 1 ≤   ∞ for  = {  } is the time-varying flexible-price markup in the import
consumption (), import investment () and export () sector. By assumption the continuum
of consumption and investment importers invoice in the domestic currency and exporters in the
foreign currency. To allow for short-run incomplete exchange rate pass-through to import as well as
export prices we introduce nominal rigidities in the local currency price. This is modeled through


                                                                    5
the same type of Calvo setup as above. The price setting problems of the importing and exporting
firms are completely analogous to that of the domestic firms in equation (2.5).3 In total there are
thus four specific Phillips curve relations determining inflation in the domestic, import consumption,
import investment and export sectors.


2.3. Households

There is a continuum of households which attain utility from consumption, leisure and real cash
balances. The preferences of household  are given by

where  ,  and   denote the   household’s levels of aggregate consumption, labor supply
and real cash holdings, respectively. Consumption is subject to habit formation through −1 ,
such that the household’s marginal utility of consumption is increasing in the quantity of goods
consumed last period.   and   are persistent preference shocks to consumption and labor supply,
respectively. Households consume a basket of domestically produced goods ( ) and imported
products ( ) which are supplied by the domestic and importing consumption firms, respectively.
Aggregate consumption is assumed to be given by the following CES function:
                         h                                                        i ( −1)

where   is the share of imports in consumption, and   is the elasticity of substitution across
consumption goods.
       The households can invest in their stock of capital, save in domestic bonds and/or foreign bonds
and hold cash. The households invest in a basket of domestic and imported investment goods to
form the capital stock, and decide how much capital to rent to the domestic firms given costs
of adjusting the investment rate. The households can increase their capital stock by investing in
additional physical capital ( ), taking one period to come in action. The capital accumulation
equation is given by
                                   +1 = (1 − ) + Υ [1 − ̃ ( −1 )]                                   (2.8)

̃ 00 , and Υ is a stationary investment-specific technology shock. Total investment is assumed to be
given by a CES aggregate of domestic and imported investment goods ( and  , respectively)

       Each household is a monopoly supplier of a diﬀerentiated labor service which implies that
they can set their own wage, see Erceg, Henderson and Levin [15]. After having set their wage,
households supply the firms’ demand for labor,
                                                        ∙        ¸    

at the going wage rate. Each household sells its labor to a firm which transforms household labor
into a homogenous good that is demanded by each of the domestic goods producing firms. Wage
stickiness is introduced through the Calvo [10] setup, where household  reoptimizes its nominal
wage rate  according to the following4

tax,  
        a pay-roll tax (paid for simplicity by the households), and  =  −1 is the growth rate

of the unit-root technology shock.
       The choice between domestic and foreign bond holdings balances into an arbitrage condition
pinning down expected exchange rate changes (that is, an uncovered interest rate parity condition).
To ensure a well-defined steady-state in the model, we assume that there is premium on the foreign
bond holdings which depends on the aggregate net foreign asset position of the domestic households,
see, for instance, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe [23]. Compared to a standard setting the risk premium
is allowed to be negatively correlated with the expected change in the exchange rate (that is, the
expected depreciation), following the evidence discussed in for example Duarte and Stockman [14].

For a detailed discussion and evaluation of this modification see ALLV [3]. The risk premium is

where  is government expenditures,  and  are the foreign demand for export goods which
follow CES aggregates with elasticity   , and  = +1  is the monetary injection by the
central bank. When defining the demand for export goods, we introduce a stationary asymmetric
(or foreign) technology shock ̃∗ = ∗  , where ∗ is the permanent technology level abroad, to
allow for temporary diﬀerences in permanent technological progress domestically and abroad.


2.4. Structural shocks, government, foreign economy

The structural shock processes in the model are given by the univariate representation

                                                                          ¡       ¢

where   = {  ,           Υ  ̃    ̄   ̃∗ },  = {   }  and a hat denotes the
deviation of a log-linearized variable from a steady-state level (̂ ≡   for any variable  , where
 is the steady-state level).  and  are assumed to be white noise (that is,  = 0  = 0).
    The government spends resources on consuming part of the domestic good, and collects taxes
from the households. The resulting fiscal surplus/deficit plus the seigniorage are assumed to be
transferred back to the households in a lump sum fashion. Consequently, there is no government
debt. The fiscal policy variables — taxes on labor income (̂  ), consumption (̂  ), and the pay-
roll (̂ 
          ), together with (HP-detrended) government expenditures (̂ ) — are assumed to follow an

identified VAR model with two lags,

                                       Θ0   = Θ1  −1 + Θ2  −2 +                                     (2.16)


                                                                 8
where   ≡ (̂   ̂   ̂         0
                                  ̂ ) ,   ∼  (0  ),  is a diagonal matrix with standard deviations and

Θ−1
 0    ∼  (0 Σ ).

     Since Sweden is a small open economy we assume that the foreign economy is exogenous.
Foreign inflation,  ∗ , output (HP-detrended), ̂∗  and interest rate, ∗ , are exogenously given by
an identified VAR model with four lags,

                       Φ0 ∗ = Φ1 −1
                                    ∗         ∗

where ∗ ≡ ( ∗  ̂∗  ∗ )0 , ∗  ∼  (0 ∗ )   ∗ is a diagonal matrix with standard deviations
and Φ−1
     0 ∗ ∗  ∼  (0 Σ∗ ). Given our assumption of equal substitution elasticities in foreign

consumption and investment, these three variables suﬃce to describe the foreign economy in our
model setup.


2.5. Monetary policy

Monetary policy is modeled in two diﬀerent ways. First, we assume that the central bank minimizes
an intertemporal loss function under commitment. Let the intertemporal loss function in period 

where the central bank’s target variables are; model-consistent year-over-year CPI inflation rate,
 − −4 , where  denotes the log of CPI and ̄  is the 2 percent inflation target; a measure of
the output gap,  − ̄ ; the first diﬀerence of the instrument rate,  − −1 , where  denotes the
Riksbank’s instrument rate, the repo rate, and  and ∆ are nonnegative weights on output-gap
stabilization and instrument-rate smoothing, respectively.5
     We report results from three alternative concepts of output gaps ( −̄ ) as measures of resource
utilization in the loss function. One concept of output gap is the trend output gap where potential
output (̄ ) is the trend output level, which is growing stochastically due to the unit-root stochastic
technology shock in the model. A second concept is the unconditional output gap, where potential
output is unconditional potential output, which is defined as the hypothetical output level that
   5
     We use the 4-quarter CPI diﬀerence as a target variable rather than quarterly inflation since the Riksbank and
other inflation-targeting central banks normally specify their inflation target as a 12-month rate.

would exist if the economy would have had flexible prices and wages for a long time and would
have been subject to the same shocks as the actual economy except mark-up shocks and shocks to
taxes which are held constant at their steady-state levels. Unconditional potential output therefore
presumes diﬀerent levels of the predetermined variables, including the capital stock, from those
in the actual economy. A third concept is the conditional output gap, where potential output is
conditional potential output, which is defined as the hypothetical output level that would arise if
prices and wages suddenly become flexible in the current period and are expected to remain flexible
in the future. Conditional potential output therefore depends on the existing current predetermined
variables, including the current capital stock. In precise form the three diﬀerent concepts of potential
output are
                                                   ̄trend =  

                                                 ̄cond = ·  

                                                ̄uncond = ·  

where  is the unit-root technology shock, the row vector · expresses output as a function of
the predetermined state variables in the flex-price economy,  is the vector of predetermined state
variables in Ramses, and  is the state vector in the economy with flexible prices and wages.
    Second, we assume that monetary policy obeys an instrument rule, following Smets and Wouters
[25]. Instead of optimizing an intertemporal loss function, the central bank is then assumed to adjust
the short term interest rate in response to deviations of CPI inflation from the perceived inflation
target, the trend output gap (measured as actual minus trend output), the real exchange rate
(̂ ≡ ̂ + ̂∗ − ̂ ) and the interest rate set in the previous period. The log-linearized instrument
rule follows:
                                               h          ¡              ¢                      i

                                                                                          b̃−1             (2.20)

where  ≡ ̂ (the notation for the short nominal interest rate in Ramses), and  is an uncor-
related monetary policy shock. Since ̂  and ̂ are forward-looking variables, this is an implicit
instrument rule (see appendix B.4).6
   6
     As reported in ALLV [3], the output gap resulting from trend output seems to more closely correspond to the
measure of resource utilization that the Riksbank has been responding to historically rather than the unconditional
output gap. Del Negro, Schorfheide, Smets, and Wouters [13] report similar results for the US.

2.6. Model solution

After log-linearization, Ramses can be written in the following state-space form,
                           ∙         ¸      ∙     ¸          ∙    ¸

Here,  is an  -vector of predetermined variables in period  (where the period is a quarter);
 is an  -vector of forward-looking variables;  is an  -vector of instruments (the forward-
looking variables and the instruments are the nonpredetermined variables);7  is an  -vector of
i.i.d. shocks with mean zero and covariance matrix  ; , , and , and  are matrices of the
appropriate dimension; and, for any variable  , + | denotes E + , the rational expectation of
+ conditional on information available in period . The variables are measured as diﬀerences
from steady-state values; thus their unconditional means are zero. The elements of the matrices
, , , and  are estimated with Bayesian methods and are considered fixed and known for the
policy simulations. Then the conditions for certainty equivalence are satisfied. Thus, we abstract
from any consideration of model uncertainty in the formulation of optimal policy.8
    The upper block of (2.21) provides  equations that determine the  -vector +1 in period
 + 1 for given  ,  ,  and +1 

                                    +1 = 11  + 12  + 1  + +1                                     (2.22)

where  and  are partitioned conformably with  and  as
                                 ∙          ¸           ∙    ¸

                                   21 22                2

The lower block provides  equations that determine the  -vector  in period  for given +1| ,
 , and  
                                       = −1

We hence assume that the  ×  submatrix 22 is nonsingular.9
    We assume that the central bank’s  -vector of target variables, measured as the diﬀerence
from an  -vector  ∗ of target levels  ≡ ( − −4 − ̄    −̄    − −1 )0, can be written as a

      A variable is predetermined if its one-period-ahead prediction error is an exogenous stochastic process (Klein
[20]). For (2.21), the one-period-ahead prediction error of the predetermined variables is the stochastic vector +1 .
    8
      Onatski and Williams [22] provide a thorough discussion of model uncertainty. Svensson and Williams [32] and
[33] show how to compute optimal policies for Markov Jump-Linear-Quadratic systems, which provide a quite flexible
way to model most kinds of relevant model uncertainty for monetary policy. Levin, Onatski, Williams and Williams
[19] study optimal policy when the central bank faces uncertainty about the true structure of the economy (i.e., they
look at the entire posterior distribution of the model parameters).
    9
      Without loss of generality, we assume that the shocks  only enter in the upper block of (2.21), since any shocks
in the lower block of (2.21) can be redefined as additional predetermined variables and introduced in the upper block.

several alternative algorithms, for instance those developed by Klein [20] and Sims [24].10 The
choice and calculation of the initial Ξ−1 is further discussed in footnote 14 and appendix B.3.
       When policy instead is described by the simple instrument rule in (2.20), there exists  and
 matrices such that the intertemporal equilibrium diﬀerence equations (2.26) and (2.27) are still
valid but with Ξ = 0 for  ≥ 0.


3. Estimation

3.1. Data, prior distributions, and calibrated parameters

We use quarterly Swedish data for the period 1980:1-2007:3 and estimate the model using a Bayesian
approach by placing a prior distribution on the structural parameters.1112
       As in ALLV [3], we include the following  = 15 variables among the observable variables:
GDP deflator inflation (  ), real wage (  ), consumption ( ), investment ( ), real exchange
rate (̃ ), short interest rate ( ), hours worked ( ), GDP ( ), exports (̃ ), imports (̃ ), CPI
inflation ( cpi                                   def
              ), investment-deflator inflation (      ), foreign (trade-weighted) output (∗ ), foreign
inflation ( ∗ ), and foreign interest rate (∗ ). We use first diﬀerences of the quantities and the real
  10
     See Svensson [28] and [29] for details of the derivation and the application of the Klein algorithm.
  11
     All data are from Statistics Sweden, except the repo rate which is from the Riksbank. The nominal wage is
deflated by the GDP deflator. Foreign inflation, output, and interest rate are weighted together across Sweden’s 20
largest trading partners in 1991 using weights from the IMF.
  12
     In the data, the ratios of import and export to output are increasing from about 025 to 040 and from 021
to 050, respectively, during the sample period. In the model, import and export are assumed to grow at the same
rate as output. We have removed the excess trend in import and export in the data to make the export and import
shares stationary. For all other variables we use the actual series (seasonally adjusted with the X12-method, except
the variables in the GDP identity which were seasonally adjusted by Statistics Sweden).

The growth rates are computed as quarterly log-diﬀerences, while the inflation and interest-rate
series are measured as annualized quarterly rates. It should be noted that the stationary variables
b̃ and ̂ are measured as deviations around the mean and the HP-filtered trend, that is, 
                                                                                                b̃ ≡
                        ¡         ¢
(̃ − ̃) ̃ and ̂ ≡  − HP HP , respectively.13 Finally, all real variables are measured in
per-capita units.
    We estimate 13 structural shocks, of which 8 follow AR(1) processes and 5 are assumed to
be i.i.d. (as described in section 2.4). In addition to these, there are 8 shocks provided by the
exogenous (pre-estimated) fiscal and foreign VARs, whose parameters are kept fixed throughout
the estimation of the model (uninformative priors are used for these stochastic processes). The
shocks enter in such a way that there is no stochastic singularity in the likelihood function.
    To compute the likelihood function, the reduced-form solution of the model (2.26-2.27) is trans-
formed into a state-space representation that maps the unobserved state variables into the observed
data.14 The posterior mode and Hessian matrix evaluated at the mode is computed by standard
numerical optimization routines (see Smets and Wouters [25] and the references there for details).
    The parameters we choose to estimate pertain mostly to the nominal and real frictions in
the model and the exogenous shock processes.15 Table 3.1 shows the assumptions for the prior
distribution of the estimated parameters. For the model with a simple instrument rule, we choose
identical priors for the parameters in the instrument rule before and after the adoption of an
  13
      The reason why we use a smooth HP-filtered trend for hours per capita, as opposed to a constant mean, is that
there is a large and very persistent reduction in hours worked per capita during the recession in the beginning of the
1990s. Neglecting taking this reduction into account implies that the forecasting performance for hours per capita in
the model deteriorates significantly, as documented in the forecasting exercises in ALLV [3]. Rather than imposing a
discrete shift in hours in a specific time period, we therefore decided to remove a smooth HP trend from the variable.
This choice is not particularly important for the parameter estimates, but has some impact on the 2-sided filtered
estimates of the unobserved states of the economy.
  14
      We use the Kalman filter to calculate the likelihood function of the observed variables. The period 1980:1—
1985:4 is used to form a prior on the unobserved state variables in 1985:4, and the period 1986:1-2007:3 is used for
inference. During estimation the Lagrange multipliers, Ξ  are updated through the Kalman filter just as the other
state variables. When the instrument rule is active Ξ equals zero, and in 1993:1, when policy (unexpectedly) switches
to minimizing the loss function, we assume commmitment from scratch so that the initial Lagrange multipliers are
zero.
  15
      We choose to calibrate those parameters that we think are weakly identified by the variables that we include in
the vector of observed data. These parameters are mostly related to the steady-state values of the observed variables
(that is, the great ratios:  ,  , and  ). The parameters that we calibrate are set as follows: the money
growth  = 1010445; the discount factor  = 0999999; the steady state growth rate of productivity  = 1005455;
the depreciation rate ̃ = 0025; the capital share in production  = 025; the share of imports in consumption and
investment  = 035 and   = 050, respectively; the share of wage bill financed by loans  = 1; the labour supply
elasticity  = 1; the wage markup  = 130; inflation target persistence  = 0975; the steady-state tax rates on
labour income and consumption   = 030 and   = 024, respectively; government expenditures-output ratio 030;
and the subsitution elasticity between consumption goods   = 5.

inflation target in 1993:1. For the model with optimal policy during the inflation-targeting regime,
we use very uninformative priors for the loss-function parameters ( and ∆ ), as indicated by the
high standard deviations. As mentioned in the introduction, the switch from the simple instrument
rule to the inflation-targeting regime in 1993:1 is modelled as unanticipated and expected to last
forever once it has occurred.
       Relative to other estimated small open-economy DSGE models (for instance, Justiniano and
Preston [16]), the international spillover eﬀects are relatively large due to the inclusion of a world-
wide stochastic technology shock. This means that the open-economy aspects are of particular
importance in our setting.


3.2. Estimation results

In table 3.1, we report the prior and estimated posterior distributions. Three posterior distributions
are reported. The first, labeled “Simple inst rule”, is under the assumption that the Riksbank
has followed a simple instrument rule during the inflation-targeting period (see equation (2.20)).
The second, labeled “Loss function”, is under the assumption that the Riksbank has minimized a
quadratic loss function under commitment during the inflation-targeting period, with the output
gap in the loss function being the trend output gap (see equation (2.19)). In this case, the optimal
policy rule does not include a policy shock. The third, labeled “Loss fn params”, only estimates
the two parameters in that loss function.16




  16
    The estimations are based on allowing the inflation target to be time-varying. The parameter estimates are,
however, robust to keeping the inflation target fixed at 2% during the the inflation-targeting period.

    There are two important facts to note in the first two posterior distributions. First, it is clear
that the version of the model where policy is characterized with the simple instrument rule with an
exogenous policy shock is a better characterization of how the Riksbank has conducted monetary
policy during the inflation-targeting period. The diﬀerence between log marginal likelihoods is
almost 23 in favor of the model with the instrument rule compared to the model with optimal
policy. In terms of Bayesian posterior odds, this is overwhelming evidence against the loss-function
characterization of the Riksbank’s past policy behavior. However, this result crucially depends on
the assumption that the simple instrument rule includes a policy shock (control error) and that
the optimal policy rule does not. If we follow Wolden Bache, Brubakk, and Maih [37] and treat
the two cases symmetrically by not including a policy shock in the simple rule during the inflation
targeting period, that is, we impose  2 = 0, then the log marginal likelihood falls to −26545,
which is almost the same as for the optimal policy, implying that optimal policy fits the data
equally well in this case. Alternatively, we can treat the two cases symmetrically by including a
shock in the optimal policy rule. This improves the fit of optimal policy, but the log marginal
likelihood (−26368) is then still lower than the log marginal likelihood for the simple instrument
rule with a policy shock in table 3.1. Hence, for the particular sample period in question, with
policy shocks in both rules the simple instrument rule oﬀers a slightly better characterization of
monetary policy. Compared to optimal policy the Bayesian posterior odds speak clearly in favor
of the simple instrument rule, but in practice we have seen that log marginal likelihood diﬀerences
(Laplace approximation) of these magnitudes do not necessarily generate very large discrepancies
in terms of the forecasting accuracy, see ALLV [3] and Adolfson, Lindé and Villani [7]. Thus, the
improvement in fit relative to optimal policy is moderate.
    Second, perhaps more relevant for our purpose, the non-policy parameters of the model are fairly
invariant to the specification of how monetary policy has been conducted during the inflation-
targeting period. This is also true for the non-policy parameters of the model with the simple
instrument rule without the policy shock.17
    One way to assess the quantitative importance of the parameter diﬀerences between the instru-
ment rule and the loss function (columns “Simple inst rule” and “Loss function”) is to calibrate all
parameters except the coeﬃcients in the loss function to the estimates obtained in the simple rule
specification of the model, and then reestimate the coeﬃcients in the loss function conditional on
   17
      It should be noted that data are informative about the parameters as the posteriors are often diﬀerent, and
more concentrated, than the prior distributions. Moreover, Adolfson and Lindé [6] use Monte Carlo methods to study
identification in a very similar model, and find that while a few parameters are weakly identified in small samples,
all parameters are unbiased and consistent.


                                                        16
these parameters. If the loss function parameters are similar, we can conjecture that the diﬀerences
in deep parameters are quantitatively unimportant. The result of this experiment is reported in
the last column in table 3.1 labeled “Loss fn params”, and, as conjectured, the resulting loss func-
tion parameters are very similar to the ones obtained when estimating all parameters jointly. We
interpret this result as support for our assumption that the non-policy parameters are unaﬀected
by the alternative assumptions about the conduct of monetary policy we consider below.
   In the subsequent analysis we use the posterior-mode estimates of the non-policy parameters for
the model with the simple instrument rule. In most cases, the model with the simple instrument
rule is also used to generate the (partly) unobserved state variables. For consistency reasons, the
associated estimated loss function parameters  = 1102 and ∆ = 0369 are therefore used in the
analysis below.


4. Monetary policy and the transmission of shocks

According to the estimated model, shocks to total factor productivity play a dominant role in
explaining business cycle variations in Sweden, as these shocks can explain the negative correlation
between GDP growth and CPI inflation in our sample. In Adolfson, Laséen, Lindé and Svensson
[2], we show that stationary technology shocks are the single most important driver of output
fluctuations around trend. To interpret and understand the development of the Swedish economy,
it is therefore of key importance to analyze and understand the eﬀects of this type of technology
shock.
   To illustrate how optimal policy projections are aﬀected by which output measure the central
bank tries to stabilize we therefore start by looking at impulse response functions to a stationary
technology shock. Although this type of technology shock ( ) is estimated to be quite persistent
( = 0966) it does not aﬀect trend output in the model (which by definition is only influenced
by the permanent technology shock,  ). In contrast, the output level under flexible prices and
wages, flexprice potential output, increases with the shock. Abstracting from the policy response
to the shock this means that the trend- and flexprice-output gaps, by definition, will behave quite
diﬀerently following this shock.
   Figure 4.1 shows impulse response functions to a positive (one-standard deviation) stationary
technology shock under the instrument rule and under optimal policy with diﬀerent output gaps.
The plots show deviations from trend, where by trend we mean the steady state. Output thus
equals the trend output gap. The real interest rate is defined as the instrument rate less 1-quarter-

ahead CPI inflation expectations. All variables are measured in percent or percent per year. The
impulse occurs in quarter 0. Before quarter 0, the economy is in the steady state with  = 0 and
Ξ−1 = 0 for  ≤ 0 and  = 0 and  = 0 for  ≤ −1.
   The dashed curves show the impulse responses when policy follows the instrument rule (which
responds to the trend output gap). For the central bank, the stationary technology shock creates
a trade-oﬀ between balancing the induced decline in inflation and the improvement in the (trend)
output gap. Since the shock is very persistent ( = 0966) this trade-oﬀ will last for many quarters,
and it takes time before inflation can be brought back to target. The instrument rule keeps the
nominal interest rate below the steady state for the 20 periods plotted and longer. The real interest
increases and remains positive for about a year, whereas there is a real depreciation of the currency.
The result is a relatively large positive output gap and a negative inflation gap between inflation



                                                                18
and the target. These gaps remain for a long time. The instrument rule is obviously not successful
in closing these gaps with the time-period plotted.
   The dashed-dotted curves show the responses under optimal policy when the trend output gap
enters the loss function of the central bank. The weights in the loss function, as for all responses
under optimal policy in this figure, are  = 11, and ∆ = 037, the estimated weights in table 3.1
when the non-policy parameters are kept at their posterior mode obtained under the instrument
rule. We see that this optimal policy stabilizes inflation and the output gap more eﬀectively over
time than the instrument rule, although optimal policy (with the trend output gap in the loss
function) initially allows for a larger fall in CPI inflation. This requires initially tighter monetary
policy than the instrument-rule, as demonstrated by initially higher nominal and real interest rates
and a real appreciation of the currency.
   The solid curves show the impulse responses under optimal policy when the output gap in
the loss function is the conditional output gap. Hence, potential output plotted in the figure is
conditional potential output, and the output gap plotted is the conditional output gap. We see
that this optimal policy successfully stabilizes 4-quarter CPI inflation around the inflation target.
It also successfully stabilizes the output gap, and we see that the conditional output gap is much
smaller than the trend output gap and initially even negative. Due to sticky prices and wages, the
stationary technology shock aﬀects potential output quicker than actual output and the flexprice
(conditional and unconditional) output gaps are therefore initially negative, whereas the trend
output gap is positive. This implies that the interest rate responses will diﬀer depending on which
output gap the central bank tries to stabilize. With the flexprice output gap in its loss function,
the central bank does not face an unfavorable trade-oﬀ between stabilizing inflation and output
after a technology shock. Optimal policy takes into account that conditional potential output is
high because productivity is temporarily high and therefore allows for more expansionary policy
(as shown by lower nominal and real interest rates) and higher actual output than when the trend
output gap is the target variable or when the instrument rule is followed. This in eﬀect implies that
inflation can be stabilized much quicker than for policy with the trend output gap, even though
the weights in the loss function are the same in the two cases.
   That the instrument rule is specified in terms of the trend output gap (rather than, for instance,
the conditional output gap) is also one of the main reasons why the instrument rule does not bring
inflation quickly back to target in this particular situation. Had the rule instead been specified
with a stronger inflation response than the estimated one or using a response to the conditional or


                                                  19
unconditional output gap, the ineﬃcient trade-oﬀ between inflation and output stabilization would
be less pronounced.
   The dotted curves in figure 4.1 show the impulse responses when the output gap in the loss
function is the unconditional output gap. Comparing with the impulse responses with the condi-
tional output gap in the loss function, we see that potential output levels diﬀer from period 1 and
onwards. This occurs because the conditional and unconditional potential output levels are com-
puted from diﬀerent predetermined variables (those in the actual sticky-price economy, and those
in the hypothetical economy with flexible prices and wages in the past and present, respectively).
Thus, unconditional potential output is independent of policy, whereas conditional potential output
depends on policy through the endogenous predetermined variables. When the shock hits the econ-
omy in quarter 0, the two output-gap definitions will be equal (since the economy by assumption
starts out in steady state in quarter −1, which is the same for both the actual economy and the
hypothetical flexprice economy), but in quarter 1 they will diverge. The predetermined variables
in quarter 1 in the sticky-price economy will diﬀer from those in the flexprice economy because the
forward-looking variables and the instrument rate in quarter 0 will diﬀer between the sticky-price
and the flexprice economies. Even if no new innovations have occurred between quarter 0 and quar-
ter  the levels of the predetermined variables used for computing the two potential output levels
will thus diﬀer. Since actual output and conditional potential output share the same predetermined
variables in each period, we would expect the conditional output gap will normally be smaller than
the unconditional output gap.


5. Optimal policy projections and the Great Recession

Having estimated the model and obtained an understanding of the role of diﬀerent monetary policy
assumptions can play for the propagation of shocks, we now turn to a discussion about how to
compute optimal policy projections with the model. We also consider an application to the Great
Recession in the world economy that was initiated during 2008.


5.1. Information and data

To calculate the optimal policy projection for a policy maker in period(quarter)  we assume the
following. The information set, I , in the beginning of period , just after the instrument setting




                                                20
for quarter  has been announced, is specified as

                                             I ≡ {  −1  −2  }

where  is the  -vector of observable variables that satisfies the measurement equation,
                                               ⎡      ⎤
                                                  
                                        = ̄ ⎣  ⎦ +   
                                                   

and where ̄ is a given matrix and   is an  -vector of i.i.d. period- measurement errors with
distribution  (0 Σ ).
       For the monetary-policy decision at the beginning of quarter , the matrices , , , and 
as well as the state vectors, denoted − | , − | , − | , and  − | for  ≥ 1, are formed by the
posterior mode estimates in table 3.1 We also specify the estimate of  , denoted | , as

                                    | = 11 −1| + 12 −1| + 1 −1|                                    (5.1)

where the estimated shocks | = 0 since  is not in the information set I .18
       With respect to projections in period , we regard the matrices , , , and  as certain and
known. Then we can rely on certainty equivalence–under which conditional means of the relevant
variables are suﬃcient for determining the optimal policy–and compute the optimal projections
accordingly.19


5.2. The projection model and optimal projections

Let  ≡ {+  }∞
                    =0 denote a projection in period  for any variable  , a mean forecast conditional

on information in period . The projection model for the projections (         ) in period  is
                             ∙            ¸      ∙           ¸
                               + +1            + 
                                              =               + +                             (5.2)
                               + +1           + 
                                                  ⎡           ⎤
                                                    + 
                                      +  =  ⎣ +  ⎦                                         (5.3)
                                                     + 
  18
     Thus, the estimated/expected shock + | and + | for  ≥ 0 are zero, whereas the estimated shocks
− | and − | for  ≥ 1 are given by − | = − | − 11 − −1| − 12 − −1| − 1 − −1 and − | =
              0        0              0
− − ̄(−   |  − |  − ) , and are normally nonzero.
  19
     It should be noted that the setup here diﬀers compared to what was used in, for example, ALLV [3] and [5],
which examine forecasts using an instrument rule. There uncertainty about both parameters, the current state of the
economy, the sequence of future shocks as well as the measurement errors were allowed for (see Adolfson, Lindé and
Villani [7] for a description). However, this uncertainty is additive so certainty equivalence holds. Also our timing
convention for the projections diﬀers. In ALLV [3], [5], and [7] it is assumed that the projections are carried out at
the end of period  (using the estimated instrument rule). That is,  is observed and considered to be known at the
time of the projection in ALLV [3], [5], and [7].


                                                           21
for  ≥ 0, where
                                                     = |                                                (5.4)

where | is given by (5.1). Thus, we let “ ” and “|” in subindices refer to projections and
estimates (rational expectations) in the beginning of period , respectively. The reason for this
separate notation for the projections is that they are conceptually distinct from the equilibrium
rational expectations and include possible hypothetical projections contemplated by the central
bank during its decision process. The feasible set of projections for given | is the set of projections
that satisfy (5.2)-(5.4).
       The policy problem in period  is to determine the optimal projection in period , denoted
(̌   ̌  ̌  ̌  ). The optimal projection is the projection that minimizes the intertemporal loss
function,
                                                   ∞

                                                    =0

where the period loss, +  , is specified as

                                            +  = +  0  +                                       (5.6)

where  is symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with diagonal (1,  ∆ )0 . The minimization
is subject to the projection being in the feasible set of projections for given | .20
       When the policy problem is formulated in terms of projections, we can allow 0   ≤ 1, since
the above infinite sum will normally converge also for  = 1. The optimization is done under
commitment in a timeless perspective (Woodford [38]). The optimization results in a set of first-
order conditions, which combined with the model equations, (2.21), yields a system of diﬀerence
equations (see Söderlind [27] and Svensson [29]) that can be solved with several alternative numerical
algorithms (see section 2.6 for references).21
       Under the assumption of optimization under commitment in a timeless perspective, one way to
describe the optimal projection is by the following diﬀerence equations,
                                   ∙          ¸      ∙             ¸

                                                =                                                             (5.7)
                                     ̌+            Ξ+ −1
                               ∙              ¸       ∙             ¸
                                  ̌+ +1              ̌+ 
                                                =                                                             (5.8)

  20
     Policy projections when monetary policy is characterized by a simple instrument rule are described in appendix B.
  21
     As discussed in Woodford [38] and Svensson [29] and [30], optimization under commitment in a timeless per-
spective allows optimal policy that is consistent over time. Svensson [30] also discusses optimal projections under
discretion.



                                                           22
for  ≥ 0, where ̌ = | . The matrices  and  depend on , , , ,  , and , but are
independent of . The independence of  demonstrates the certainty equivalence of the projections.
The  -vector Ξ+  consists of the Lagrange multipliers of the lower block of (5.2), the block
determining the projection of the forward-looking variables. We assume that the optimization is
under commitment in a timeless perspective, so that the initial Lagrange multiplier, Ξ−1 , is non-
zero. Commitment is thus considered having occurred some time in the past, and more precisely
we assume policy has been optimal since the start of the inflation targeting in 1993:1.22


5.3. An application to the Great Recession

Next, we use the model to interpret the future economic development in Sweden for a policy maker
standing in 2008:3. This period is especially interesting to analyze since the world economy were
just about to enter a deep recession in the following quarters.
      Figure 5.1 show projections from Ramses using data up to and including 2008:2, for 10 key
variables: foreign output, foreign annualized 1-quarter CPI inflation, foreign interest rate, the real
exchange rate, 4-quarter CPI inflation, the output gap, the instrument rate, the real interest rate
(the instrument rate less 1-quarter-ahead CPI inflation expectations), output and potential output.
The plots show deviations from steady state. The solid vertical line marks 2008:3, which is quarter
0 in the figure. The curves to the left of the line shows the history of actual data up to and including
2008:2, which is quarter -1 in the figure. The state in 2008:2, and its history, is estimated using
policy with the instrument rule.
      The solid curves to the right of the solid vertical line show the projections for a policy maker
following the estimated instrument rule. We see that Ramses’ VAR-model for the three foreign
variables did not forecast the large drop in the world economy that occurred in the next few
quarters after 2008:3, following the turbulence in the financial markets. In reality, world output
diminished by almost 4 percent in the next three quarters and world inflation approached 0 percent.
Given the VAR-model’s counterfactual view of the foreign economy, Ramses projected Swedish CPI
inflation to be close to 2 percent and output to be less than 05 percent below its trend level. Ex
post, we know Swedish GDP decreased by almost 6 percent in the next year and consumer prices
actually declined.
      We know from VAR evidence that international spillover eﬀects to small open economies are
generally large. Lindé [18] shows, using a block exogenity assumption in a VAR model on Swedish
 22
      See appendix B.3 for a discussion about alternative methods to calculate the initial Lagrange multipliers.


                                                          23
data, that foreign shocks account for around 50 percent of the fluctuations around trend in Swedish
output and domestic inflation. Can then the substantial drop in the world economy explain the
economic development in Sweden during the financial crisis? To analyze this we compute a forecast
with Ramses that is conditional upon the decline in foreign output during 2008:4 - 2009:2. After
those three quarters the forecast is endogenously determined by the model, which is marked by
a dashed vertical line. It is assumed that the agents in the model fully anticipate the path of
foreign output during 2008:4 - 2009:2. The expectations in the model are thus consistent with the
conditional path of foreign output. We use the method in Laséen and Svensson [17] to calculate
how large time-varying intercepts in the VAR equation for foreign output are needed to replicate
the drop in foreign output. Foreign inflation and the foreign interest rate is then determined
endogenously within the foreign VAR model.
   The dashed curves in figure 5.1 show this conditional projection when policy follows the esti-
mated instrument rule. The cumulative drop of about 37 percent in world output implies that
world inflation drops 1 percent below steady state and that the world interest rate almost hits the
zero lower bound. The steady state level of the nominal interest rate in both Sweden and the rest
of the world is assumed to be 425 percent, and, as stated above, the plots show deviations from
steady state. The substantial fall in foreign output implies less demand for Swedish export goods,
and domestic output drops below trend by about 15 percent. We see that the spillover to Swedish
production is approximately 50 percent of the drop in the world economy. However, CPI inflation
in Sweden decreases by more than the decline in the world economy. From figure 5.1 we also see
that the instrument rule implies that the Swedish interest rate is lowered by about 2 percentage
points below its steady state level. Since the foreign interest rate falls by more, this implies that
the nominal (not depicted) and real (depicted) exchange rate appreciates, due to the UIP condition
in the model. In reality we saw a large flight from the Swedish krona, however.
   To account for the large depreciation of the real exchange rate, the model needs risk premium
shocks that can capture the deviations from interest rate parity. In reality, substantial declines in
investment and exports also occurred. To capture all components in the GDP identity (and thereby
describe the entire fall in Swedish GDP), the model additionally requires shocks to investment
technology and the export markup. The large fall in foreign output can thus not alone explain all
aspects of the development of the Swedish economy during the financial crisis.
   There are several reasons for why the model scenario under consideration cannot fully capture
the fall in domestic GDP that actually occurred. The scenario above, with a decline in foreign

output only, works through the trade and real exchange rate channels of the model. In reality,
the recession was created in the financial sector which caused the spread between inter-bank rates
and the instrument rate to increase dramatically. As in most DSGE models, Ramses lacks such a
financial sector that includes a financing premium which could have further dampened domestic
GDP. If we would have been able to consider both shocks simultaneously, this would have caused
the zero bound on nominal interest rates to bind for Sweden’s most important trading partners and
in all likelihood also for the Swedish economy. This channel, per se, would have amplified the fall
in domestic output even further.
   Finally, we assess how the projections during the financial crisis could have been aﬀected by
alternative monetary policies. Depending on the state of the economy (and thus the current size of
the shocks that persistently die out over the projection horizon), the policy assumption of which
output measure to stabilize can matter quite a bit for the projections, as shown in section 4. In

figure 5.2 we therefore compare projections with the instrument rule and projections with policy
for diﬀerent output gaps in the loss function. In all the optimal policy projections in this figure, we
assume commitment in a timeless perspective and compute the initial vector of Lagrange multipliers
for the equations for the forward-looking variables (Ξ−1 ) under the assumption that policy during
the inflation-targeting period has been optimal (see appendix B.3).23 As in figure 5.1 we condition
all the projections on the decline in foreign output during the first three quarters after 2008:3.
      The dashed curves in figure 5.2 reprints the conditional projections from figure 5.1 where policy
follows the instrument rule. The solid curves show optimal policy projections with the conditional
output gap in the loss function. The dotted curves show the optimal policy projections when the
output gap in the loss function is the unconditional output gap (which is computed using equation
 23
      It should, however, be noted that the results do not change much to setting the Lagrange multipliers to zero.




                                                                        26
(C.7) with flexible prices from 1993:1 and onwards to form the state vector under flexible prices).
The dashed-dotted curves show the optimal policy projections with the trend output gap in the
loss function.
   In figure 5.2, we see that 4-quarter CPI-inflation and the output gap falls quite a bit when
policy follows the instrument rule. Optimal policy, with the trend output gap in the loss function,
is shown with the dash-dotted curves. It is able to stabilize both inflation and the output gap much
better. With the instrument rule’s slow adjustment of the instrument rate, the real interest rate
initially increases because inflation falls so quickly and is then followed by a compensating modest
fall in the real interest rate. Optimal policy initially increases the real interest rate less and then
lowers the real interest rate substantially. This implies substantially more expansionary policy and
succeeds in preventing large falls in both CPI inflation and output. In spite of the non-negligible
weight on instrument-rate smoothing, optimal policy allows the instrument rate to first increase
and then fall substantially, a much more eﬀective policy than the instrument rule’s smooth fall and
rise of the instrument rate. It is important to understand that the initial increase in the nominal
instrument rate for the loss function with the trend gap is driven by the initial state of the economy.
Had the economy been in steady state when the negative foreign demand shocks hit the economy,
the instrument rate for the loss function with the trend gap would have been lowered directly.
   Optimal policy with the unconditional output gap in the loss function and potential output
given by unconditional flexible-price output is shown with the dotted curves. The fall in world
output and the other foreign shocks imply a large fall in potential output. Optimal policy results
in a small positive output gap. This requires a large fall in output, which requires contractionary
monetary policy in the form of a high real interest rate and a real appreciation of the currency.
This results in an intermediate fall in CPI-inflation.
   Optimal policy with the conditional output gap in the loss function and potential output given
by conditional flexible-price output is shown with the solid curves. The shocks from the world
economy results in a fall and then a rise in potential output. Optimal policy results in first a
positive and then a negative output gap, corresponding to positive output falling to the steady-
state level and then rising above. CPI inflation falls modestly below target and then rises above.
This requires expansionary monetary policy, with a significant fall in the real interest rate and
initially much smaller real appreciation of the currency than the other policies.
   Clearly, it matters quite a bit for optimal policy what output gap enters the loss function, with
diﬀerent consequences for the dynamics of output and inflation and the optimal policy response.


                                                  27
Some policies result in considerably more output and CPI stabilization than others. Clearly it is
important to determine what potential-output definition is the most appropriate.


6. Conclusions

In this paper, we have shown how to construct operational optimal policy projections in the Riks-
bank’s model Ramses, a linear-quadratic open-economy DSGE model. By optimal policy projec-
tions we mean projections of the target variables and the instrument rate that minimize a loss
function. We have illustrated the use and consequences of diﬀerent output-gap concepts in the loss
function and clarified the diﬀerence between output gaps relative to conditional potential output,
trend output, and unconditional potential output, where conditional refers to the dependence on
existing endogenous predetermined variables, such as the capital stock. When productivity is tem-
porarily high, conditional potential output exceeds trend output. Then optimal policy projections
in this case diﬀer substantially depending on whether conditional or trend output gaps enter the
loss function.
   We have also illustrated how the model interpreted the economic development in Sweden with
the Great Recession ahead in 2008:3, using diﬀerent policy assumptions. We studied the direct
impact of the fall in the world economy, but not the financial spillover that must have accounted
for a large share of the Swedish output decline. An important challenge ahead for the profession is
to develop DSGE models with elaborate financial frictions.
   With the tools we have demonstrated, we believe optimal policy projections in Ramses and sim-
ilar DSGE models can now be applied in real-time policy processes and provide policymakers with
useful advice for their decisions–together with the usual input of detailed analysis and estimation
of the initial state of the economy, policy simulations with historical policy reaction functions, other
forecasting models, judgment, concerns about model uncertainty, and so forth.

A. Ramses in some detail

This appendix presents the loglinear approximation of the model. For a more detailed description of
the complete model and the derivation of the loglinear approximation, see ALLV [4]. A hat denotes
the deviation of a loglinearized variable from a steady-state level (̂ ≡   for any variable  ,
where  is the steady-state level), and delta denotes the log-diﬀerence of a variable (∆ ≡  − −1
for any variable  ). Since all real variables grow with the non-stationary technology shock  ,
we have to divide all quantities with the trend level of technology to make them stationary. We
denote the resulting stationary variables by lower-case letters, that is,  =    ̃ =   (we
denote investment by ̃ to avoid confusion with the monetary-policy instrument  ), +1 =  
(capital-services), ̄+1 = ̄+1  (physical capital stock),  =  (  ) (real wage).

measures the degree of asymmetry in the technological level between the domestic economy and

    The exogenous shocks of the model are AR(1) given by the representation

Furthermore, as discussed in ALLV [3], for estimation purposes it is convenient to rescale the markup
                                                                                                                (1−  )(1−  )

the markup shock. Then the new coeﬃcient on them in the Phillips curve is unity. Similarly, we
rescale the investment specific technology shock Υ̂ , the labor supply shock   , and the consumption
preference shock   , so that these shocks enter in an additive fashion as well.24
    The fiscal policy variables are assumed to be exogenously given by an identified VAR model with

government expenditures. The fiscal policy VAR(2)-model is given by

      Although this is not of any major importance for the baseline estimation of the model in ALLV [3], it is
important when carrying out the sensitivity analysis there because the eﬀective prior standard deviation of the
shocks changes with the value of the nominal and real friction parameters. Smets and Wouters [26] adopt the same
strategy. Therefore, to obtain the size of the four truly fundamental markup shocks, the estimated standard deviations
reported in table 31 should be divided by their respective scaling parameter (for instance, (1−   )(1−  )
                                                                                                 (1+ )
                                                                                                                in the case
of the domestic markup shock).
  25
     The reason why we include foreign output HP-detrended and not in growth rates in the VAR is that the foreign
output gap enters the log-linearized model (for instance, in the aggregate resource constraint). This also enables
identification of the asymmetric technology shock.

       The model can then be written on the form (2.21), where the specification of the predetermined
variables  , the forward-looking variables  , the policy instrument  , and the shock vector  can
be found in the technical appendix [1].


B. Optimal projections in some detail

B.1. Information and data

First we clarify the information assumptions underlying the conditional expectation E used in the
loss function (2.18). Let E [·] ≡ E[·|I ] where I denotes the information set in period . In the
standard and simple case when all variables are observed, we can specify

                       I ≡ {     ; −1  −1  −1  −1 ; −2  −2  −2  −1 ; }

This can be interpreted as information in the beginning of period . We can understand this
as the agents of the model (the central bank, the private sector, the fiscal authority, and the
rest of the world) entering the beginning of period  with the knowledge of past realizations of
shocks, variables, and instruments, −1  −1  −1  −1  −2  −2  −2  −2 ,...26 Then, at
the beginning of period , the shock  is realized and observed, and  is determined by (2.22)
and observed. We also assume that the agents know the model, including the matrices , , ,
, , and  and the scalar , so either  or  is suﬃcient for inferring the other from (2.22),
given that previous realizations are known. Then the central bank determines, announces, and
implements its instrument setting,  , which is hence observed by the other agents. After this, the
expectations +1| are formed, and  is determined by (2.24).27 In equilibrium, both  and 
will be a function of  and previous realizations of  , consistent with this specification of the
information set.
       However, Ramses makes more elaborate and realistic information assumptions as shown in
section 5.1. The variables  and  include (serially correlated) shocks and some other unobservable
variables for which no data exists. Furthermore, the elements of  ,  , and  are in many cases
quarterly averages, which have not been realized until the end of quarter .
  26
       Only the linear combination  of the shocks  matters, not the individal shocks  .
  27
       More precisely, the expectations +1| and  are simultaneously determined.

B.3. Determination of the initial Lagrange multipliers

As discussed in Svensson [28, Appendix A],28 the value of the initial Lagrange multiplier, Ξ−1 , is
zero, if there is commitment from scratch in period , that is, if any previous commitment is disre-
garded. This reflects a time-consistency problem when there is reoptimization and recommitment
in later periods, as is inherently the case in practical monetary policy. Instead, we assume that the
optimization is under commitment in a timeless perspective. Then the commitment is considered
having occurred some time in the past, and the initial value of the Lagrange multiplier satisfies

                                              Ξ−1 = Ξ−1−1                                           (B.7)

where Ξ−1−1 denotes the Lagrange multiplier of the lower block of (5.2) for the determination of
−1−1 in the decision problem in period  − 1. The dependence of the optimal policy projection
in period  on this Lagrange multiplier from the decision problem in the previous period makes the
optimal policy projection depend on previous projections and illustrates the history dependence of
optimal policy under commitment in a forward-looking model shown in Backus and Driﬃll [9] and
Currie and Levine [12] and especially examined and emphasized in Woodford [38].
       We now discuss how to compute the initial Lagrange multiplier, Ξ−1 when no explicit opti-
mization was done in previous periods. In doing so, we assume that past policy has been optimal.29
       Note that (5.8) and (B.5) imply that, in real time, the Lagrange multiplier Ξ satisfies

if the commitment occurred from scratch in period  −  , so Ξ− −1− = 0. Here  is partitioned
conformably with  and Ξ−1 so

    The appendix is availabale at www.larseosvensson.net.

    In the working paper version of the paper, we also consider another method which assumes that past policy has
been systematic but not necessarily optimal. This method seems less restrictive but is not used in this paper.


                                                       36
Recall that that  will depend on the weight matrix  in the period loss function and hence vary
with the assumed or estimated loss function.

This treats estimated realized − ( = 0 1   ) as resulting from optimal policy under com-
mitment. The lag  may be chosen such that (ΞΞ ) Ξ is suﬃciently small.


B.4. Projections with an arbitrary instrument rule

With a constant (that is, time-invariant) arbitrary instrument rule, the instrument rate satisfies
                                                     ∙    ¸
                                                       
                                        = [  ]
                                                       

for  ≥ 0, where the  × ( +  ) matrix [                    ] is a given (linear) instrument rule and
partitioned conformably with  and  .30 If  ≡ 0, the instrument rule is an explicit instrument
rule; if  6= 0, the instrument rule is an implicit instrument rule. In the latter case, the instrument
rule is actually an equilibrium condition, in the sense that in a real-time analogue the instrument
rate in period  and the forward-looking variables in period  would be simultaneously determined.
       An arbitrary more general (linear) policy rule (  ) can be written as

                                     +1| +  +1| =   +   +                        (B.9)

where the  × ( +  ) matrix  ≡ [  ] is partitioned conformably with  and  and the
 × ( +  +  ) matrix  ≡ [   ] is partitioned conformably with  ,  , and  . This
general policy rules includes explicit, implicit, and forecast-based instrument rules (in the latter
the instrument rate depends on expectations of future forward-looking variables, +1| ) as well as
targeting rules (conditions on current or expected future target variables). When this general policy
rule is an instrument rule, we require the  ×  matrix  to be nonsingular, so (B.9) determines
 for given  ,  , +1| , and +1| .
       The general policy rule can be added to the model equations (2.21) to form the new system to
be solved. With the notation ̃ ≡ (0  0 )0 , the new system can be written

C. Flexprice equilibrium and alternative concepts of potential output

Under the assumption of flexible prices and wages and an additional equation that determines
nominal variables (inflation, the price level, the exchange rate, or some other nominal variable),
the flexprice model can be written
                                                                 ⎡

with the new ( + )× matrix   and ( + + )×( + + ) matrix  . There are hence
 extra equations added to the lower block of the equations (the block of equations determining the
forward-looking variables), as many equations as the number of policy instruments. The discussion
here is restricted to the case  = 1 (as is Ramses), so only one equation needs to be added, such
as

where 1 here denotes a row  -vector with the first element equal to unity and the other elements
equal to zero (reflecting that domestic inflation, ̂  , is the first forward-looking variable).
     The matrix  has been modified so there is no eﬀect on the endogenous variables of the four
time-varying markups ̂ ,  ∈ { mc mi }, since these time-varying distortions would introduce
undesirable variation in the diﬀerence between the (loglinearized) eﬃcient and flexprice output.
This is achieved by setting the corresponding elements in 11 and 21 equal to zero. With the
same argument one may also want to eliminate the eﬀect on the endogenous variables of time-
varying tax rates.
     Let ̃ ≡ ( 0   0 )0 and  denote the realizations of the nonpredetermined and predetermined
variables, respectively, in a flexprice equilibrium for  ≥ 0 , where 0 is some period in the past with
given predetermined variables 0 from which we compute the flexprice equilibrium. The flexprice
equilibrium is the solution to the system of diﬀerence equations (C.1) for  ≥ 0 . It can be written
                                       "     #             "      #

for  ≥ 0 , where   and   are matrices returned by the Klein [20] algorithm and 0 = 0 . In
particular, one of the elements of  (and ̃ ) is ̂ , output in the flexprice equilibrium. We can
therefore write flexprice output in period  ≥ 0 as

                                                   ̂ = ·  

where the row vector · is the row of the matrix   that corresponds to output.

C.1. Unconditional potential output

Consider now a hypothetical flexprice equilibrium that has lasted forever, the unconditional flexprice

equilibrium. The hypothetical realization of the predetermined variables in period , denoted ;−∞ ,
then satisfies
                                                                           ∞

and hence depends on the realizations of the shocks  , −1 , ... The corresponding flexprice output
is
                                                                     ∞

     We refer to this output level as unconditional potential output. It hence corresponds to the
output level in a hypothetical economy that has always had flexible prices and wages but is subject
to the same shocks as the actual economy. It hence has a diﬀerent capital stock and diﬀerent
realizations of the endogenous both predetermined and nonpredetermined variables compared to
the actual economy. It corresponds to the natural rate of output consistent with the definition of
the natural rate of interest in Neiss and Nelson [21].


C.2. Conditional potential output

Consider also the hypothetical situation in which prices and wages in the actual economy unex-
pectedly become flexible in the current period  and are then expected to remain flexible forever.
                                                                
The corresponding flexprice output in this economy is denoted ̂; and given by

                                                     
                                                   ̂; ≡ ·                                                   (C.4)

We refer to this output level as conditional potential output (conditional on prices and wages becom-
ing flexible in the same period and therefore conditional on the existing predetermined variables,
including the capital stock). It corresponds to the definition of the natural rate of output presented
in Woodford [38, section 5.3.4].
     We then realize that we can define conditional- potential output, where  ∈ {0 1 } refers to
prices and wages unexpectedly becoming flexible and expected to remain flexible forever in period
                                                                                  
 − , that is,  periods before . This concept of potential output is denoted ̂;−| and is given
by
                                                                                            −1
                                                                                            X
                                      
     ̂;− ≡ · ;− ≡ · (  −1;− +    ) ≡ · [(  ) − +              (  )   − ]   (C.5)
                                                                                            =0


                                                          40
Conditional- potential output hence depends on the state of the economy (the predetermined
variables) in period  −  and the shocks from  −  + 1 to . Conditional-0 potential output is
obviously the same as conditional potential output. Unconditional potential output is the limit of
conditional- potential output when  goes to infinity,

                                                        →∞


C.3. Projections of potential output

Consider now projections in period  of these alternative concepts of potential output. The projec-
                                                                 ∞
tion in period  of unconditional potential output, {̂+ ;−∞ } =0 (where the first subindex,  +  ,

refers to the future period for which potential output is projected; the second subindex, −∞, in-

where the unconditional flexprice equilibrium is approximated by a flexprice equilibrium that starts
in a particular period 0  , 0 | denotes the estimate conditional on information available in
period  of the predetermined variables in period 0 , and −| denotes the estimate conditional in

for  ≥ 0. Note that the projection of conditional potential output in period  +  then refers to the
flexprice output for a flexprice equilibrium that starts in the future period  +  , not in the current
period period . In the latter case, it would instead be the projection of conditional- potential
output in period  +  . Therefore, the projection of the predetermined variables in period  +  of

projection of the conditional- flexprice predetermined variables, {+ ;+ − } =0 , and is given

for  ≥ 0. That is, the projection of the conditional- predetermined variables in period + enters
in (C.9), the predetermined variables in the flexprice equilibrium that starts  periods earlier, in
period  +  − . Furthermore, this projection is given by
                                                                −1

where the summation term is zero when  ≥ . Thus, the projection in period  of the realization
                                                      
of conditional- potential output in period  +  , ̂+ ;+ − , depends on the projection of the

predetermined variables in period  +  −  of the actual economy (with sticky prices and wages),
+ − , and when    also on the estimated shocks −| for  = 0, 1, ...,  −  − 1. (For   ,
+ −| = 0).


C.4. Output gaps

We can then consider several concepts of output gaps: We have the trend output gap, the gap
between actual output and trend output, ̂ (recall that ̂ is the deviation from trend). For each
concept of potential output, we have a corresponding concept of output gap: The unconditional
output gap,
                                                                
                                       ̂ − ;−∞ ≡ ̂ − · ;−∞ ;

the conditional output gap,
                                                  
                                           ̂ − ; ≡ ̂ − ·  ;

and the conditional - output gap,

                                                                 
                                       ̂ − ;− ≡ ̂ − · ;− 

     The projections of the diﬀerent output gaps are then defined in analogy with the projections of
the diﬀerent potential outputs.
