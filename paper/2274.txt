                          Is the U.S. a Spendthrift Nation?




                                      ABSTRACT



    The belief that the U.S. is a nation of spendthrifts, unwilling to pro—
v-ide for the future, rests on observations of particular narrow definitions
of capital formation, on the use of nominal values that ignore inter-
national differences in the relative prices of capital goods, and on con-
centration on the ratio of capital formation to total output rather than on
the amount of capital formation per capita.

    By a broad definition of capital formation, the U.S. has been investing
a proportion of its gross output in the last decade and a half that is not
far below that of other developed countries, even in nominal terms. In
world prices, or real terms, U.S. capital formation was a higher proportion
of output than in nominal terms.

    Real gross capital formation per capita in the U.S., even by a narrow def i-
nition of capital formation, was above the average for developed countries. By
a broad measure of capital formation, few countries surpassed the U.S. in per
capita real capital formation.

                                     Introduction


     Ever since World War II, the U.S. has been thought of as a spendthrift

nation — a country that consumes almost all its income and that saves and

adds to its capital stock at a low rate, not quite the lowest perhaps, but

far down in the standings in the world saving league. Questions have been

raised also about the quality of American investment. Americans are thought

to have invested relatively large amounts in housing and consumer durables

which are supposedly less productive than investments in industry or construc-

t ion.


     If the standard data on the proportion of output devoted to gross capital

formation are taken at face value, they show that for the U.S., the ratio of

gross capital formation to GNP since 1960 has not differed much from that of

the period 1860-1938; it was 19.0 per cent in the earlier period and 17.9 per

cent in the later one (Table 1).

         For the 40 years or so before 1910, and still during the period between

the two World Wars, the U.S. ranked very high in the proportion of output

devoted to capital formation in the conventional sense. Of 10 developed

countries studied by Kuznets (1966), the U.S. had the highest investment rate

(gross domestic capital formation relative to GNP) in the 1870's and 1880's,

the second highest in the 1890's and 1900's, and the third highest in

1909-1929. By the 1950's, however, the U.S. had next to the lowest rate,

ahead only of the U.K. Later decades found the U.S. still at the bottom of

this list, in a tie with the U.K. At the other end of the distribution, Japan

 devoted the highest proportion of its output to capital formation.

     The U.S. apparently fell from saving leader to saving laggard because

 the ratio of gross capital formation to total output changed little in the

 U.S. between the pre-WW II years and the later period, while it increased in

every other country, including even the U.K. Since the 1960's, the United

States and the United Kingdom have had the lowest capital formation ratios.

However, the rough constancy in the U.S. ratio was unique; the closest was

 the Canadian ratio which has been only a little more than 10 per cent above

the pre—WW II level. In the other countries, the ratio rose by at least a

third, and they more than doubled in a couple of cases. Thus, in the decades

following WW II, even relatively low-saving countries have invested more of

their incomes in fixed capital than formerly high-saving countries such as

Canada and the U.S. had invested in the past.

Finding a Yardstick to Measure Saving and Investment

    The usual picture of the current, or recent standing of the U.S. as a

saver is based on the personal saving rate: saving by individuals as a per

cent of disposable personal income, the saving rate regularly reported by the

Department of Commerce and widely publicized. The comparison for this type of

saving can be summarized in the fact that over the decade 1970-1980 the U.S.

household saving rate was less than two thirds of the average in eight other

OECD countries for which roughly comparable data could be obtained (Table 2).

As can be seen from the table, it makes a considerable difference whether we

look at national saving or household saving and whether we look at gross or

net saving.

 net saving and capital formation. There are several reasons for that choice.

One is skepticism regarding available measures of capital consumption, and

particularly their comparability among countries (Blades and Sturm, 1982).

For example, Hayashi (1986) points out that Japanese depreciation is calcu-

lated on the basis of historical cost and that the adjustment to a replacement

cost basis amounted to as much as 30 per cent of reported private saving in

some years. Another reason for the use of gross measures is the belief that

the introduction of new capital equipment brings new technology into the

production process, whether or not the new equipment is nominally a repla-

cement for old equipment embodying past technology. If technology, rather

than the "volumet' in some sense of capital equipment, is what drives econo-

mic growth, it is the gross rather than the net capital formation that is

relevant for explaining growth. A country in which gross capital formation

was equal to calculated depreciation, and therefore resulted in no net

capital formation, would nevertheless reap economic growth from the substi-

tution of new technology for old technology.

    Turning from the statistics of capital formation to the data on

saving,1 we find that all measures here show the U.S. saving rate to have

been low in the 1970's by comparison with that of other countries. That is

particularly the case for net saving. Among 24 OECD countries the U.S. was

the lowest on net (48% of the average of the others) and gross (76%)

national saving. Gross and net household saving data are available for

fewer countries. As compared with 8 other countries that Blades and Sturm

examined more closely and for which household saving rates were available, the



   11n the OECD accounts that we use in this paper the sum of domestic
capital formation and net foreign investment is defined to be equal to
domestic saving. We focus on domestic capital formation in our calcula-
tions, but alternate between that concept and domestic saving in corn-
                                       —4—

U.S. national net saving rate was 45% below the average while the gross was

only 24% below. The difference was smaller for the household saving rate, 37%

on net, 20% on gross.

       For several reasons we focus on aggregate private or national saving,

rather than household saving, for our international comparisons. One reason

is that the household data are too inaccurate in each country and raise more

problems of international comparability than the aggregate private or national

data. Another is that there is evidence of substitution between household

saving, business saving, and at least the social insurance part of government

saving. A third is that for explaining economic growth, aggregate saving and

investment are more relevant than the saving of any single sector.

       In addition to the economic significance of national as compared with

household saving, there is good reason to believe that the national saving

data, while subject to many problems of measurement, are more accurate than

household saving measures. The national data are protected in a sense by the

availability of a control total: aggregate domestic saving must, by defini-

tion, equal aggregate domestic capital formation plus net foreign invest-

ment, the estimates for which merit more confidence. There is no such

independent and relatively reliable check on estimates of the saving of any

single sector.

    By and large, long-run trends in domestic saving and domestic capital
formation are similar for most countries over most periods. Similarly, the
ranking of countries by saving rates is close to their ranking by capital
formation rates. We do, therefore, draw inferences about one from the
other at times, but we do point out some differences between the saving and
capital formation measures, particularly in discussing recent events in the
U.S.

              Broad Measures of U.S. Saving or Capital Formation

    Aside from the issue of whether to measure saving gross or net of capi-

tal consumption, touched on earlier, the major issue in measurement is the

distinction between current expenditures and capital expenditures. What

kind of expenditures should be categorized as yielding income beyond the

current period?

    Broad measures of investment, and correspondingly broad output measures,

have been calculated for the United States by Kendrick (1976) and Eisner

(1985).2 Both authors include in Investment such items as investment in human

capital, including education, on—the-job training, child rearing costs, and

costs of labor mobility and migration, investment in tangible household capi-

tal, such as durable consumer goods, and investment in intangible capital such

as research and development. Kendrick's adjustments to the conventional NIPA

measure for the United States (as available to him at that time) raised the

estimated share of gross investment in GNP as follows:

Source: Kendrick (1976), Tables 3-2 and C-i.

Not only was the 1969 level more than tripled but the decline in the ratio

between 1929 and 1969, shown in the official data, was reversed.

    Eisner's alterations to the official U.S. accounts apply only to the




   2Some alternative calculations of household saving and different views
on its correct measurement can be found in Auerbach (1985) and Hendershott
and Peek (1985).

years after World War II but the story they tell of much higher levels of

saving and capital formation than in the official records is similar

(Table 3). Eisner's concept of capital accumulation includes semidurables with

durables as a form of investment and, more important, includes net real capi-

tal gains and losses. The latter addition makes the series much more volatile

relative to GNP. If we exclude the revaluations and investment in household

semidurables, the modified Eisner estimates are still at least twice as high

as the official ones over most of the period. They show a rising trend through

the 1960's and approximate stability after that.

     Perhaps the most radical restructuring of national accounts encompassing

the widest range of investment in human capital is that in Jorgenson and

Pachon (1983). This calculation includes imputations for the value of time

spent in schooling not only during working age but also before working age.

Furthermore, the value of time spent in schooling is calculated from the

increment in lifetime earnings rather than from the value of foregone earnings

in the labor market. The estimates included values of human capital based on

lifetime earnings for those born in each year and for immigrants. The results

of these calculations are:

                                                   1950-59   1960-69   1970-73

"Human Saving" as % of "Full Saving"                 94.3      95.9    96.0


     In other words, private saving in the U.S. has been more than two thirds

of private expenditures through the postwar period and rose to about three

quarters in the 1960's and 1970's. Thus, by these measures, the private eco-

nomy of the United States was consuming less than a third, and later less than

a quarter, of its income. Saving and capital formation as conventionally

defined were an almost negligible part--less than 5 per cent--of total private

saving and capital formation.

  International Comparisons of Saving and Capital Formation on a Broad Basis

    Unfortunately, broad measures of saving and capital formation have not

been calculated on a comparable basis for a large number of countries over

long periods of time. The important question for our purposes is whether the

use of these broader definitions would raise the calculated saving rate of

other countries by similar proportions, still leaving the U.S. a relatively

low saver, or whether the ranking of the U.S. as a saver depends on the def i-

nition of saving.

    In order to answer this question, we experiment with the saving ratios

for the 1970s and 1980s, calculating the effects of extending the scope of the

saving measure to include provisions for the future that fall outside the con-

ventional national accounting concept of saving. These extensions, and others,

have been considered by Kendrick and Eisner in their work on the U.S., but our

efforts here are confined to those for which some calculations were available,

or could be performed fairly readily, for a considerable number of countries.

We draw on the work of Blades and Sturm (1982) and Blades (1983) who had a

similar objective and sought also to improve comparability among countries,

but we have made our own calculations.

Consumer Ourables. The logic of treating households' purchases of consumer

durables as capital formation, corresponding to business purchases of durable

producers goods, is similar to that for the treatment of house purchases as

capital formation in the present systems of national accounts. These goods
                                     -8-

 produce services over a long period of time, and the services are, in many

 cases, very similar to those yielded by the durabls bought by business. Cars,

the largest item in consumer durables, give transportation service whether

they are owned by businesses or by households. Some of those owned by busi-

nesses are leased to households for their own use. Refrigerators, freezers, or

 laundry machinery often provide services to households even if they are owned

by businesses. In fact, the distinction between consumer and producer durables

in the national accounts rests on ownership rather than function.

    To treat purchases of consumer durables as capital formation in the same

way as purchases of owner-occupied housing, it is necessary to make two

adjustments. One is to add to conventional gross fixed capital formation

household expenditures on consumer durables (treated as consumption in both

the SNA and the U.S. national income accounts). The second is to add to con-

sumption and output a measure of the current services of consumer durbles.

This adjustment requires information on the stock of consumer durables and

calculations of the services derived from them by consumers.   Unfortunately,

such calculations are available in detail only for the United States, but we

have made some rough estimates of the necessary magnitudes. We have done this

by combining OECD data on purchases of consumer durables with Go1dsmfths

estimates of the stock of consumer durables for a number of countries and

assuming that missing ingredients of the calculation could be filled in by

using the U.S. relationships.

   The effect of adding purchases of consumer durables to the conventional

measures of capital formation can be seen in the following comparison:

This adjustment alone eliminates more than a quarter of the difference bet-

ween the U.S. and the other countries. It also compresses the range of saving

ratios slightly, since the addition is smallest for Japan and relatively

large for the U.S. A possible interpretation of this reduction in the range of

rates is that there is some substitution between investment in consumer

durables and other forms of saving.

Education. Ideally, we would wish to add to conventional capital formation

measures all forms of human capital investment. These would include the ear-

nings foregone by students while they are in school and the costs of on-the-

job training. However, such data are not available in any internationally

comparable form. The one part of such investment for which we can make calcu-

lations for a fair number of countries, and even these require some bold esti-

mating, is expenditures on education. These expenditures yield a return over a

long period of time in the form of higher earnings in the labor force. They

also probably yield returns in the form of better care of children and greater

efficiency in consumption, even after retirement. Some part of the cost of

education might more properly be treated as consumption, but any over-estimate

of capital formation on that account should be more than balanced by our
                                      - 10   -



 omission of foregone earnings. The effect of making this adjustment alone can
 be seen in the following:

Once again, the effect of the broadening of the concept of capital formation

is to move the United States somewhat closer to the average of the other deve-

loped countries, reducing the gap by more than a quarter.

    We can combine the adjustments for consumer durables and education for

only 11 of the 14 countries, because data on consumer durables were not

available for Australia, Belgium, and Germany. The results are only slightly

affected by this limitation, since the average saving rate for the 11

countries, including education expenditures, is only sli9htly higher than that

for the 14. The effect of the combination of the two adjustments is as

follows:

Almost half of the apparent gap in investment rates between the U.S. and the

other 11 countries is eliminated when we broaden the concept of investment to

encompass expenditures on both consumer durables and education.

Research and Development. Research and development is an activity that is pro-

bably more forward-looking than much of investment in equipment and probably

includes less current consumption than education. It is thus an even stronger

candidate for treatment as capital formation.

    Incorporating R & 0 expenditures into the measures of capital formation

involves, in some cases, an addition to the measure of total output as well.

The shift of government and private nonprofit R & D does not require any

adjustment, since they are treated in the SNA and the U.S. NIPA as government

and household sector consumption, and therefore as final product. However,

business enterprise expenditures on R & 0 are treated in these accounts as

costs of current production. The shift to treatment of these as capital for-

mation requires that they be removed from current expenditures, raising the

level of business enterprise saving and capital formation, and therefore of

gross output also. These calculations are described in the Appendix. The

effect of adding R & 0 expenditures alone is small, since the range is only

from 1 per cent to less than 2½ per cent of GOP, but the result of adding

them, along with education expenditures, to gross capital formation is as

follows:

    The broadening of the capital formation concept, as before, substantially

reduces the gap between the U.S. and the other developed countries, now by

over 40 per cent. If we add to these two adjustments the inclusion of consumer

durables expenditure, as we can do for 10 of the 12 countries other than the

U.S., the gap is reduced still further:

Half of the gap is eliminated, and the U.S. capital formation rate is only

about 10 per cent below that of the other countries.

Military Capital Formation

    It is conventional, and part of both the UN's System of National Accounts

and the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts, to treat expenditures on

construction and equipment for defense as current government consumption

rather than capital formation. Yet, whatever their other faults and virtues,
                                       - 13   -



and whatever their contribution or lack of contribution to the growth of non-

military output, these expenditures are intended to yield output over a long

period of time. If we are interested in the extent to which a country sacrifi-

ces present consumption for future gains, these expenditures are as relevant

as those for civilian consumption.

   The inclusion of military capital formation, as we would expect, raises

the U.S. saving rate relative to all but one of the other countries for which

we can make the comparison, and particularly relative to Japan.

With military capital formation included, the gap between the U.S. and the

other developed countries is reduced by about 60 per cent.

Other Adjustments to the Investment Concept. The adjustments we have made

bring the U.S. investment ratio from less than 80 to over 90 per cent of

those of the other major industrialized countries. There are some further

adjustments we did not attempt. One would be to add investment in the form of

the foregone earnings of students. A recent estimate puts this item at over 60

per cent of expenditures on education (Johnson, 1985). As the proportion of

working-age students attending higher education institutions is higher in the

U.S. than in all or most of the other countries, the inclusion of this form of
                                     - 14   -



 investment would raise the U.S. investment rate and bring it closer to the

 average.

    Among other possible adjustments, the inclusion of more of the house-

hold economy in the accounts (in addition to owner-occupied housing and consumer

durables) would probably raise the denominator (GNP) most for countries with low

female labor force participation rates, and thus lower their saving rates rela-

tive to countries such as Sweden. The addition of rearing costs to investment,

as in Kendrick (1976), would raise saving rates for countries with relatively

rapid population growth such as Canada and the U.S., relative to the European

countries.

    As mentioned above, we have followed, with modifications, some of the

procedures of the earlier comparisons in Blades and Sturm (1982) and Blades

(1983). However, we have been a little more free, or perhaps reckless, in

estimating missing observations. rn general, our results confirm theirs

despite the differences in method. Both suggest that the more readily feasible

adjustments eliminate about half or more of the observed differences between

the U.S. and other developed countries in the shares of total output devoted

to gross capital formation. That leaves the U.S., as measured, almost 10 per

cent below the average of the others, although still low in the ranking:

ninth out of eleven in our calculations. And both suggest that the unmeasured

items might well erase much of that remaining gap. Similarly, a more recent

comparison of household saving rates in the U.S. with those of 5 other deve-

loped countries in 1980-82 by the Deutsche Bundesbank (1984) suggested that

about half of the difference between the U.S. and the other five, including

Japan, and more than half of the difference between the U.S. and the European
                                         - 15   -



countries,     were the consequence of differences in methods of calculating

saving.

     One can think of shares of saving or capital formation in GOP as

measuring some type of investment "effort" or willingness to sacrifice present

consumption for future benefits. By a standard that includes both conventional

and some non-conventional types of capital formation, the U.S. ranks in the

second half of the distribution of industrial countries and is about average

for that group.

The evidence of these data does not suggest that Americans have been

substantially more "present-minded," or neglectful of future needs, than the

citizens of most other developed countries.

Real Investment Ratios: How Much Capital Goods Does the Saving of Different

Countries Buy?

   While the share of total output in current prices may reflect a country's

willingness to sacrifice present consumption to increase welfare later, it

does not necessarily indicate how much capital is being acquired through that

sacrifice. The reason is that capital goods are more expensive relative to

other goods in some countries than in others. Capital goods are cheaper rela—
                                       — 16 —


 tive   to prices in general in the U.S. than in most other countries.

    As between two countries with the same nominal saving or capital for-

mation ratios and equal GOPs, as measured in the usual way in each country's

own prices, the one in which the prices of capital goods are low will be

setting aside more current output in physical terms for the production of

future income; its real capital formation ratio will be higher. Thus, it is to

be expected that the U.S. real capital formation ratio will compare more

favorably with that of other countries than will its nominal (own-price)

ratio.3

    The impact of these differences in price relationships on comparative

capital formation ratios is summarized below for 1975 and 1980, years for

which detailed comparisons of prices and real product are available from

the UN International Comparison Project for a substantial number of our

countries. Ratios of conventionally—defined capital formation to GOP, both

measured in nominal prices (based on own-country prices), corresponding to

the ratios in earlier text tables, are shown in column 1.




   3The comparisons here are based on U.S. prices. They are obtained by
dividing own-currency expenditures by the purchasing power of the national
currency vis-a-vIs the U.S. dollar. To shift these to comparisons based on
world prices, it would be necessary to multiply each component PPP by the
international price, as given in the last column of Table 6.3, pp. 176-179,
and Appendix Table 6.3, pp. 208-215, of Kravis, Heston, and Summers, 1982.

In these two years, the shift to real investment ratios raises the U.S. ratio

of capital formation to GOP by 4 and 6 percentage points, relative to the

average, to 76% and 90% (column 2). When the concept of investment is

broadened to include other provisions for future flows of goods and services,

still retaining the real investment ratio concept, the inclusion of expedi-

tures on education and R & 0 reduces the margin between the U.S. and the other

seven countries by about half (column 3). The further inclusion of spending on

consumer durable goods brings the reduction in the difference to more than a
                                      - 18   -



 half.   Finally, when we add military capital formation, the U.S. ratio of

 capital formation to GOP rises to 91 per cent of the average of the other

 eight countries in 1975 and 99 per cent in 1980.

     Among the other countries, shown individually in the Appendix, Japan's

 real ratio on our most inclusive basis was still the highest, almost 40 to 42

per cent compared to 31-43 per cent for Belgium, France, Germany, and the

Netherlands.

    Since this comparison is confined to two years and to eight countries, two

other points should be noted. One is that 1975 was a particularly unfavorable

year for the U.S., to judge from the conventional investment ratios. For the

other countries, taken as a group, the investment ratio in 1975 was close to

the average of 1970-84, but in the United States it was 8 per cent below the

period average. The other is that the comparison with these eight countries

shows the U.S. in a less favorable light than the earlier comparisons with 11

or 14 countries. These facts suggest that a comparison of broadly defined

investment ratios for the whole period and for more countries would almost

certainly find the U.S. close to the average of the other countries.


                         Per Capita Capital Formation

    When real ratios of capital formation to GDP are compared using a

broadened definition of investment, the U.S. climbs a little from the bottom

position (the lowest ratio, well below the next lowest) into the lower rungs

of the industrial countries in 1975 and to the median position in 1980

(Appendix Table 6). That fact suggests that the U.S. ratio, applied to a

higher income than that of most other countries, may entail more real invest-

ment per capita than in other countries.

conventional and broader concepts of capital formation, the results are as

Real capital formation per capita was higher in the U.S. than it was, on the

average, in the other eight countries. Measured on the conventional basis, the

US. level was exceeded by those of Japan, Germany, and France in both 1975

and 1980, but on the most inclusive basis, per capita capital formation was

highest in the U.S. in both years, a little above that of Germany and Japan in

1980 and about 15 to 17 per cent above them in 1975 (Appendix Table 6).

       For the conventional measure of capital formation, some data are available

for 1980 covering many more countries, but at OECD prices rather than world-

wide prices as in the previous comparisons. If we compare per capita conven-

 tional   investment in 1980 for the same 8 countries and for a broader group of

 17 OECD countries, we find the following:

The U.S. margin over the other 17 countries in 1980 was a little higher than

that over the 8 countries, partly because some quite low income countries were

added to the list. Measured in these prices, conventionally defined real

capital formation per capita in the U.S. was surpassed only in Japan (by 14

per cent) and in Germany (by 7 per cent) among the 8 countries used in the

earlier calculations, and in the larger list of countries, by Canada,

Luxembourg, and Norway.

    On the whole, the evidence points to the conclusion that the U.S. is

close to the average of other developed countries in the degree to which it

has used its income for forward-looking purposes-—capital formation in a broad

sense. Since the price of capital goods has been relatively low in the U.S.,

the ratio of real capital formation, broadly defined, to real output has com-

pared more favorably with that of the other countries than investment ratios

based on each country's own relative prices. And since the U.S.        is a high-

income country, the same fraction of output devoted to investment as in other

countries has kept the U.S. investing more per capita than the others on the

average, and more per capita than almost all the individual countries.

          Has Low Saving Made the U.S. Poor in Conventional Capital?

     We can think of the purpose of saving and investment as being the

accumulation of the productive wealth that leads in turn to a high level of

production and consumption. A country's wealth at any time incorporates the

results of saving over many years. It thus-provides a summary of saving

history, although wealth can be acquired in other ways, such as by changes in

the value of assets already acquired.

     Unfortunately, wealth figures are subject to many imperfections, just as

saving data are. For one thing, calculations of wealth are almost always many

years out of date, Furthermore, records of wealth are kept in each country's

own currency, and these must be translated into a common currency for com-

parison. We do have very complete records of the rate at which at least the

major currencies exchange in world markets, but, as has been pointed out,

translation by this method does not yield comparability among countries.

Exchange rates do not reflect the relative purchasing power of currencies over

the stock of physical assets any more than they measure purchasing power over

currently produced commodities or services.

     If net saving in the United States, conventionally defined, has been low

since World War II relative to that of other developed countries, we might

wonder whether the U.S. would by now find conventionally defined capital

relatively scarce. Has the U.S. lost its position as the most capital-abundant

country? Indeed, that is the picture one finds in some calculations. For

example, in one of these, the U.S. appears to have ranked 8th among 11 deve-

loped countries in the amount of capital per person: the U.S. capital per

capita was slightly below the average of the other 10 developed countries
                                      - 22   —



(Appendix Table 8, Col. 1).
     There are at least two biases in this calculation. One is that the cumu-

lation of capital expenditures, from which the capital stock is derived,

begins in 1950, ignoring all capital available at that time. Since, as we

shall see later, the U.S. had far higher capital per person in place in 1950

than most other developed countries, the method understates the stock of capi-

tal in the U.S. Secondly, the calculation assumes that a dollar's worth of

foreign currency at 1975 exchange rates bought the same amount of fixed capi-

tal in each foreign country as a dollar in the U.S. As shown above, a dollar

bought more investment goods in the U.S. than did a dollar's worth of foreign

currency in other countries.

     If we adjust for only the latter bias, we find a different picture of

capital abundance. The U.S. real capital stock per person in 1975 was above

that of all but three other countries and more than 15 per cent above the

average (Appendix Table 8, Col. 2).

    We can make some further comparisons for a more limited group of

countries, based on a different source and for a different definition of capi-

tal stock. This measure omits residential capital, which tends to reduce the

U.S. capital stock more than that of most other countries but refers to gross

rather than net capital stock, which has the opposite effect. The U.S. appears

in these data for the late 1970's to be on a par with Canada and Germany.

Japan, France, Italy, and the U.K. appear far less capital—abundant in these

calculations.

    The largest and most carefully assembled collection of asset (and

liability) data from national sources is that of Raymond Goldsmith (1985).
                                    — 23 -


From these and a set of estimates provided by the OECD, we can make a com-

parison of capital per person among a dozen countries in the late 1970s and

1980 (Appendix Table 9). Using the conventional measure of net capital stock,

we find that the U.S., despite two or three decades of low conventional saving

rates, still had in the late 1970s and in 1980 one of the highest levels of

capital per person. It was the highest among the major countries, with the gap

remaining very large between the U.S.and the U.K., France, Japan, and Italy.

Where both net and gross capital stocks were available from the same source,

the gap was larger for gross stocks than for net. It may be that the U.S.

capital stock is older than most others, or that it depreciates faster, or

that a faster rate of depreciation is used in the U.S. calculations.

     We are inclined to emphasize the broadest measures of capital we can find

(and regret the narrowness even of these) on the grounds mentioned earlier

with respect to capital formation. We therefore prefer measures that include

at least consumer durables, on the belief that the ownership of a car, for

example, by a household does not mean that the car performs services substan-

tially different from those provided by leased cars, taxis or public transpor-

tation, although the purchase of a car is not counted as investment and its

services are not included in income and output in official calculations.

     It is in the high level of consumer capital that the U.S. is most dif-

ferent from other countries.

When these are added in to the conventional stock, the U.S. is shown to have

had more capital per person than any country except Canada (about equal to the

U.S.), and to have led the major industrialized countries by 20 per cent or

more (Appendix Table 9).

    Although most of these measures show that at least the major foreign

countries had not yet caught up with the U.S. in their conventional capital

endowments by the mid— or late 1970s, there is little doubt as to the trend.

For example, Maddisons presumably consistent measures over the quarter cen-

tury after 1950 show every country gaining on the U.S. in conventional capital

per person.

    All these countries except Canada were at least a third below the U.S. in

1950, and all gained on the U.S., even, to some extent, the U.K., a relatively

low-saving country. The greatest transformation took place in Japan, of

course. Even in 1960, the Japanese level capital stock per person was as far

below that of the U.S. as some developing countries have been in recent years.

Since 1950, it had been multiplied more than three times relative to that of

the U.S. to a level above that of Italy and close to that of the U.K., but

still well below France and Germany. The results of the high level of Japanese

saving are thus evident in the growth of capital stock but still leave Japan

far behind other developed countries, a fact that it is hard to keep in mind

in view of Japan's trade performance.

   A somewhat different measure of changes over 25 years or so for a small

set of partially overlapping countries can be derived from OECO data.

    Although there are moderate differences in relative levels of per capita

fixed capital where the two sets of data overlap, the direction of change

seems clear. In the OECD data also, every country shown increased its per

capita stock relative to that of the U.S., whether that stock is measured

gross or net or including or excluding residential capital. Thus the relati-

vely low rate of saving in the U.S., conventionally measured, did result in a

relatively low rate of growth in capital stock, conventionally measured, but

it still left the major industrial countries below the level of U.S. capital

per person in 1980.

    Unfortunately, we have little data on stocks of capital outside of conven-

tional capital and consumer durables. We can get some indication of the stock
                                     — 27 —


of   educational capital from data on years of education of various levels. The

high level of U.S. capital formation in this form is reflected in the higher

average years of formal education in the population, as shown below;

     The stock of educational experience was larger in the U.S. than in the

other countries, on the average, and in this respect the U.S. also ranked

high--second only to Germany in the stock of secondary education and first, by

a long distance, in higher education.


                Has the U.S. Misallocated its Capital Formation?

      It is widely believed that the U.S. not only saves relatively little in

conventional terms but also funnels excessively large shares of its saving

into residential construction and consumer durables, while other countries

channel their saving into forms of investment that are regarded as more pro-

ductive, such as machinery and equipment. We investigate this question with

respect to both conventional capital formation and the broader concept and

also with respect to the stock of capital.

     The question we can answer is whether there are large differences between

the U.S. and other countries in the allocation of capital. The question we

would wish to answer, ideally, is whether the allocation of capital has been
                                                 - 28   —



so distorted by tax or other preferences that the productivity of capital has

been seriously reduced in the U.S. relative to other countries. This question

 is extremely complex, and involves, among other problems, separating the

effects of tax preferences on the allocation of capital by sector of ownership

 (households vs. business firms) from effects on the type of capital for—

mation (houses vs. factories, or cars vs. machinery). We do not know of any

attempts to perform such an analysis across countries and discuss here only

the facts about the allocation of capital.

The Distribution of Conventional Capital Formation Among Types of Assets

     The share of conventional capital formation going into residential

building has not been exceptionally high in the U.S.

Over the whole period, half of the countries devoted more of their capital

formation to residential building. The share in the U.S. was about 6 per cent

above the average of 13 or 14 other developed countries, but it was above the

average by a large margin only in the 1960's and has been below it for the

1980's.

       Over the entire 1960-84 period, it was Denmark, Germany, and France that

invested most heavily in residential building, and Norway the least. Japan

invested a relatively small share in housing during the 1960's, about 25 per

cent below the average of the other countries listed. It moved closer to the

average in this respect in the 1970's and 1980's, but remained below average.

It should be kept in mind that these ratios represent the cost of building and

land improvement but not the cost of land, which is exceptionally high in

Japan relative to other costs of housing.

       To the extent that rapid growth is associated particularly with high

levels of producer durable or machinery and equipment investment, one might

expect to find that the U.S. has been neglecting this type of capital for-

mation, while that of the fast—growing countries was heavily tilted in this

direction.

       Again, at least for the last 15 years, the data do not bear out this

expectation. The share of producer durables, both transport equipment and

other machinery and equipment, in conventional capital formation was above

average in the U.S. It was the U.K., a slow-growth, low-investment country
                                            - 30   -



that   had the highest share of capital formation going into machinery and

equipment, while the share in Japan was below that of the U.S. and below the

average of the other industrial countries.

            If we broaden the concept of capital formation to include consumer

durables, about half of which are cars, we find some considerable differences

in the allocation of investment. The U.S. led in the proportion of investment

going into consumer durables, as we might expect from the much-discussed

favorable tax treatment of interest on consumer borrowing, only now removed

from the federal tax law.

However, the proportion of capital formation going into consumer durables in

Canada was the same as that in the U.S. Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and

the U.K. were not far behind. The country that allocated very little of its

investment to consumer durables was Japan, where the share was under 10 per
                                       — 31 —


cent,    less than half the average of other countries outside the U.S. The

United States spent most heavily, by far, on "personal transportation

equipment," especially in the 1960's, the share being almost twice the average

in 9 other countries. OECD data are not available for Japan, but the ratio

must have been low, to judge from the spending on all consumer durables. The

high expenditure on personal transportation equipment in the U.S. accounted

for all the difference between the U.S. and the other countries in the share

of durable consumer goods. In other consumer durables, the U.S. share was no

higher than that in other countries.

The Distribution of Broadly-Defined Capital Formation

distribution, by type of investment, of our broad measures of capital for-

mat ion.

     When we compare the U.S. with the average of 10 other countries, it is

clear that conventionally-defined capital formation is a much smaller part of
                                     — 32 —


broadly-defined   capital formation in the U.S. than in other countries. That is

one reason for the large gap between the U.S. and others in the usual

comparisons. The U.S. invested a lower share in every conventional form of

capital formation and a higher share in each of the non-conventional forms.

The U.S. share in construction was particularly low, even compared with the

share of its capital formation in non—military producer durables. On the other

side, the share of U.S. investment going into R & 0 and military capital for-

mation far exceeded that in other countries.

    Japan was the only country with more than three quarters of its capital

formation in the types of investment conventionally included in national

accounts. It is this concentration, particularly on construction, that places

Japan so far above other countries in the usual compilations. The other side

of the story is the extremely low share of capital formation going into con-

sumer durables in Japan, hardly more than half the share in the next-lowest

countries. Japan is also at the bottom of the list in the share of investment

going into education, although several other countries are close in this

respect. The heaviest investors in R & 0 and in military capital formation

relative to other forms of investment, were the U.S. and the U.K., also the

countries with the lowest shares of investment going into construction. These

figures again do not indicate any particularly large share of U.S. capital

formation or even of U.S. construction expenditures going into residential

construction.

    As was noted earlier in comparisons with conventional measures of capital

formation, the U.S. had the highest share of investment applied to consumer

durables. However, the shares of some other countries were close to the U.S.
                                     — 33 -


level.   If the experience of other countries is any criterion, it is difficult

to see in these proportions any enormous distortions in the composition of

U.S. capital formation from the favorable tax treatment of consumer interest

during these years.

     The distribution of capital formation can be different when measured in

real values or quantities--that is, quantities valued at a common set of prices

for all countries-—from what it is in nominal (own-currency) values. The transla-

tion via common prices reduces the share of a type of investment that is par-

ticularly expensive in a country and increases the share of a type that is

relatively cheap. The effect of using real comparisons can be seen in the

following:

    More often than not, the translation into international prices shows the

U.S. to have been closer to the average in the shares of capital formation

going into various types of conventional capital formation than the nominal

figures suggest, because these types of capital were relatively cheap in the

U.S. Two exceptions to the relative cheapness of capital formation in the
                                      — 35 —


U.S. in both years were non-building construction and education. Shares of

both were lower in real terms because these types of investment were relati-

vely expensive in the U.S.

        Measured in own—country prices, the share of broadly-defined capital for-

mation devoted to construction was substantially higher in Japan--about half of

the total—-than in other countries, as can be seen in Appendix Table 6e. But,

measured in world prices, that share was not as high; construction was relati-

vely costly in Japan relative to other types of investment. However, the propor-

tion of investment going into non-building construction, mainly infra-structure,

was notable in Japan in both years and in Germany in 1975, whichever prices were

used.

    We noted earlier that the share of producer durables -in Japan was not

exceptional, but measured in world prices that share was the highest among the

countries shown in 1975 and second highest in 1980. Producer durables were

cheaper relative to other forms of investment in both Japan and the U.S., so

that, measured at world prices, the share of investment the Japanese were

devoting to producer durables was above average, and the share in the U.S. was

close to the average.

    The high proportion of U.S. capital formation allocated to consumer

durables, particularly consumer transportation equipment, and to education

was noted earlier. The translation to world prices leaves the share allocated to

consumer durables in the U.S. about 15 per cent above the average for the other

countries. The share in education expenses is cut sharply by measuring it -in

world prices and is like that of several other countries, because education was

extremely expensive in the U.S. relative to other forms of investment.

 The Distribution of the Stock of Capital Among Types of Assets

            Another way to examine the allocation of investment is through the

distribution of the stock of capital. This can be done using Goldsmith's data

for reproducible tangible assets in the late 1970's. The distribution of the

stock of capital incorporates not only the cumulation of investment and depre-

ciation over time but also the effects of any differences among the various

types of assets with respect to price movements.

       The shares of dwellings in reproducible assets, summarized below, rein-.

force the impressions from shares in capital formation.

The data do not give the impression that this category absorbed an excep-

tional share of investment in the U.S. A few western European countries, in

particular, had higher proportions of assets in that form. As might be
                                    — 37 —


expected, the share of dwellings was low in Japan: the lowest among the deve-
loped countries. It must be kept in mind, especially in connection with Japan,

that land is not included in reproducible assets and in national capital for-

mation, although it does enter the capital formation of individual sectors.

Land is extremely expensive in Japan and is a large part of tangible assets:

over half as compared with no more than a quarter in any of the other

countries recorded (Goldsmith, 1985, Table 37).

    Consumer durables play a larger part in U.S. reproducible tangible assets

than in those of any other country. These assets were less than half as impor-

tant in Japan, but there were some European countries where the consumer

durables shares were even lower.

    We can summarize by saying that the U.S. seems to be at the upper end of

the distribution with respect to investment shares in consumer durables but

not in homes, while Japan is at the lower end in both groups. If we think of

these two assets as producing services directly for households, we find that

France and Italy had about half of their reproducible tangible assets per-

forming this role, and the U.S. and most European countries had 35-45 per cent

of such assets in that role. At the other extreme, Japan, Australia, Norway,

and Switzerland devoted only about a quarter of these assets to such services.

     It is important to keep in mind that as far as consumer durables are

concerned, they are not the only non-housing assets devoted to providing con-

sumer services. The category is distinguished by ownership rather than by

function. Countries with low proportions of consumer durables in their assets

may have large proportions of similar types of capital under the category of

producer durables if they are owned by business firms rather than by house-
                                     - 38   —


holds (e.g., consumer durables in rented houses as opposed to those in owner-

occupied houses).

SavinQ vs. Capital Formation

    We have discussed saving and capital formation rates as if they were iden-

tical although they differ to the extent that a country is financing its capi-

tal formation by borrowing from foreigners or is financing other countriest

capital formation by lending to foreigners. We have been able to do this in

analyses of long-run developments because, for developed countries, over

periods long enough to average out cyclical changes, the two measures are

typically very similar. Kuznets (1966, p. 240), in discussing trends in the

share of capital formation and saving in output, pointed out that the dif-

ference was important for only the U.K., among lending countries, and for some

of the small borrowing countries in the early stages of development. For the

developed countries considered here, the two ratios are very similar, as has

been pointed out by Feldstein and Horioka (1980). They reported that for the

period 1960-74, the average absolute difference between gross saving and gross

capital formation ratios among 21 developed countries was a little over 1 per-

cent of GDP and a little over 5 percent of the saving ratio, 4 percent for the

countries we discuss in this chapter. For 1970-79, the difference was about 4

percent of gross capital formation for the 15 countries we cover, but it rose

to over seven percent in 1980-84 (Appendix Table 16). Thus, for most periods,

and particularly for judging changes over longer spans, it is appropriate to

use the saving rate and the capital formation rate interchangeably.

    The latest period, 1980-84, shows an unusual degree of divergence between

the two, and the absolute amounts, particularly f or the U.S., are enormous.

However, even the 1984 U.S. deficit in the $100 billion range was only 2.5 per-

cent of GOP, and the deficit of 1980-84 averaged under 4 per cent of gross

capital formation. Half of the countries covered here were borrowing from

abroad larger portions of the financing of their domestic capital formation in

1980-84 than the U.S. was.

   The 1984 deficit was, of course, much larger relative to gross capital

formation -   over   13 per cent. It is that very recent history, and its con-

tinuation into the present and the future, that provokes alarm. In judging

long-term trends, however, it is important to keep in mind that such deficits

have not been typical of the U.S.

                                   Summary

    We have found that, by a broad definition of capital formation, the U.S.

has been investing a proportion of its gross domestic product that is not

far below that of other developed countries over the past decade and a half.

Thus, the U.S. has not been a particularly extravagant nation, although most

countries invest larger shares of their output.

    The U.S. long run ratio of gross capital formation to GNP, measured by the

conventional definition, was about the same before and after World War II.

In the earlier period (1869-1938), that ratio placed the U.S. in the front

ranks of countries in this respect, but since 1950, the ratios for other

countries have risen to higher levels. While the proportion of output devoted

to capital formation may have been a little lower in the U.S. than in other

countries, the U.S. got more real capital than most countries out of a given

amount of investment because prices of capital goods were relatively low in

the U.S. Thus, in world prices, or real terms, U.S. investment was higher

relative to output than in the nominal terms in which the comparison is

usually made.

    If we examine real capital formation per capita, even by a narrow defini-

tion of capital formation, the lower U.S. proportion of capital formation in

output, combined with the higher U.S. output per capita, resulted in a U.S.

investment per capita above that of developed countries as a group. For a

broad measure of capital formation, the U.S. margin relative to the average

was even larger, and few countries surpassed the U.S.

   The results of many years of capital formation, as incorporated into capi-

tal stock measures, confirm the impression that the U.S. continues to be rela-
                                      - 41   -



tively   rich in capital. Even by conventional definitions of capital stock or

only slightly expanded definitions, the U.S. remained, at the beginning of the

1980's, as the country with the largest real capital stock per capita.

Although a few small countries may have moved ahead of the U.S. in this

respect, the major developed countries, and particularly Japan, remained

substantially below the U.S. level.

    Within the total of capital accumulation the U.S. did not, as is often

supposed, devote an exceptionally large share to residential construction or a

particularly small share to machinery and equipment. The U.S. did devote a

relatively large part of capital formation to consumer durables but again, the

real outlier was Japan, in which the share of such investment was very low

compared to almost all the other countries. It should be noted that consumer

durables are distinguished from producer durables not by their function or by

whether they serve the production of consumer goods rather than producer

goods, but by the fact of their ownership by households. Some part of producer

durables in one country may be performing the same functions, under different

ownership, as consumer durables in another country.

   Taking the broader view of capital formation, we found that Japan devoted

an exceptionally large part of total investment to the conventional forms,

particularly to construction, and the U.S. an exceptionally small fraction.

That is part of the reason why Japan's capital formation ratio appears so high

and that of the U.S. so low relative to other countries when the comparisons

are based on the conventional definitions. The U.S. spent relatively large

proportions of capital formation on consumer durables, military capital for-

mation, R&D, and, to a smaller extent, on education.

    What does this record say about the widespread impression that the U.S. is a

nation of spendthrifts, unwilling to provide for the future? We conclude that

this belief rests on observation of a particular narrow definition of capital

formation, on the use of nominal values that ignore international differences in

the relative price of capital goods, and on concentration on the ratio of capi-

tal formation to total output rather than on the amount of capital formation per

capita. By some measures of capital formation we find the U.S. to be similar to

other developed countries and by others, above them in the extent to which pro-

duction is applied to future needs. We do not know which of these measures of

capital formation is best related to the prospects for future growth but we know

of no basis for assuming that the conventional definition is most appropriate.
