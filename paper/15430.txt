                                             ABSTRACT

We document and analyze the emergence of a substantial gender gap in mathematics in the early years
of schooling using a large, recent, and nationally representative panel of children in the United States.
There are no mean differences between boys and girls upon entry to school, but girls lose more than
two-tenths of a standard deviation relative to boys over the first six years of school. The ground lost
by girls relative to boys is roughly half as large as the black-white test score gap that appears over
these same ages. We document the presence of this gender math gap across every strata of society.
We explore a wide range of possible explanations in the U.S. data, including less investment by girls
in math, low parental expectations, and biased tests, but find little support for any of these theories.
Moving to cross-country comparisons, we find that earlier results linking the gender gap in math to
measures of gender equality are sensitive to the inclusion of Muslim countries, where in spite of women’s
low status, there is little or no gender gap in math.

        The gender gap in mathematics is an important and extremely divisive issue of academic

debate (e.g. Sweeney 1953, Fennema and Sherman 1977, Goldin 1994, Hausmann et. al 2008.)

Figure 1 plots the gender gap on the mathematics and verbal components of the Scholastic

Aptitude Test (SAT) – over the past forty years. On the math section, female scores are on

average 0.30 standard deviations lower than male scores; on the verbal portion there is no clear

gender difference (College Board 2007).1 An important shortcoming of the SAT data is that the

population taking the test is not representative, and sample selection may occur differently across

gender. For instance, since college attendance rates are presently higher for females, the female

sample of SAT takers may be drawing more heavily from the middle or left tail of the ability

distribution. Data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), a nationally

representative sample that does not have sample selection problems, also shows boys

consistently outperforming girls in fourth and eighth grade over the last two decades, though the

magnitude of the gap is smaller (Lee, Grigg, and Dion 2007). The bulk of the evidence in the

past 50 years suggests that the gender gap in mathematics does not exist before children enter

school, but is large and significant in the middle school years and beyond. For instance, in a

meta-analysis of 100 studies with a total sample of more than 3 million students, Hyde et al

(1990) found a .29 standard deviation gender gap in math in high school.2

        The patterns on math tests are especially striking when one considers that females either

systematically outperform males or have made enormous gains on many educational dimensions.

The high school dropout rate is 28% for females compared to 35% for males (Greene and
1
          Among elite achievers, these differences are even more pronounced. Men outnumber women by more than
two to one above the 99th percentile in SAT mathematics scores (College Board 2007). Males also score four
percent higher on AP calculus exams and 6 percent higher on AP science exams (Freeman 2004, College Board
2007).

Winters 2006). As noted by Goldin, Katz, & Kuziemko (2006), in 2003 there were 1.35 females

graduating from four-year colleges for every male. In stark contrast, in 1960 there were 1.6

males graduating from 4-year colleges for each female. In 1970, women made up only 9% of

combined Medicine, Dentistry, and Law degree recipients. Thirty years later, women accounted

for 47% of full time, and 44% of part-time students pursuing such degrees (Freeman 2004).

Women make up 45% of all doctorate degrees (Freeman 2004). A 2000 study, commissioned by

the U.S. Congress, found that “[t]he large gaps in educational attainment that once existed

between men and women have in most cases been eliminated” (Bae et al. 2000).

         A wide range of theories have been explored to explain the gender gap in mathematics.

One strand of the literature looks to biological differences. These biological theories argue that

innate differences in spatial ability, higher order thinking, or brain development produce a gap in

achievement (Wilder and Powell 1989).3 Another group of researchers emphasize societal

factors as the cause of the gap.4 Societal explanations focus on how girls are socialized into

believing that math is not important, useful, doable, or part of the identity of a girl (Wilder and

Powell 1989).5 Gaining a better understanding of the gender gap in mathematics is an issue of

first-order importance. Paglin and Rufolo (1990) argue that the observed difference in



3
           Research in this domain includes work on differences in brain composition (Gur et al 1999; De Bellis et al
2001; Cahill 2005; Gallagher and Kaufman 2005), differences in hormone levels (Davison and Susman 2001),
differences in strategy (Carr and Jessup 1997; Fennema and Carpenter 1998; Kucian et al 2005), and differences in
spatial ability (Johnson and Meade 1987; Witelson 1976, Lawton and Hatcher 2005).
4
           Gneezy, Nierderle, and Rustichini (2001) argue then boys males are more competitive, leading to better
test performance. Others argue that sex-typing in the wording of items plays a role (McLarty, Noble, and Huntley
1989; Kepner and Koehn 1977; Moss and Brown 1979). Voyer, Rodgers, and McCormick 2004 argue that males do
better in timed settings. Math Anxiety on the part of females is another possibility (Hsiu-Zu et al 2000; Tobias
1976.)
5
           These theories take a number of forms: differential parental treatment or expectations (Eccles and Jacobs
1986; Parsons et al 1982; Muller 1998; Bouffard and Hill 2005; Bhanot and Jovanovic 2005), differential treatment
by teachers (Dweck et al 1978; Heller and Parsons 1981; Leinhardt et al 1979; Parsons et al 1982), stereotype threat
(Spencer et al 1999; Brown and Joseph 1999; O’Brien and Crandall 2003), and other environmental factors (Gneezy
et al 2003; Levine et al 2005).
                                                         3
mathematical ability between women and men explains much of male-female differences in

occupational choice and wages among recent college graduates.

       In this paper, we utilize the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort

(ECLS-K) to shed new light on the gender gap in mathematics. ECLS-K is a data set

administered by the Department of Education. The survey covers a sample of more than 20,000

children from roughly 1,000 schools entering kindergarten in the fall of 1998. An enormous

amount of information is gathered for each individual, including family background, school and

neighborhood characteristics, teacher and parent assessments and expectations, and test scores,

which allows us to test several important theories for gender differences within a unified

framework. The original sample of students has been subsequently re-interviewed in the spring

of kindergarten, first grade, third grade, and fifth grade.

       The results we obtain using these new data are informative and, in some cases, quite

surprising. Consistent with the prior literature, when children enter kindergarten, girls and boys

are observationally equivalent in both math and reading. By the end of fifth grade, however, girls

have fallen more than 0.2 standard deviations behind their male counterparts in math.6 The math

gap is equivalent to 2.5 months of schooling. Girls are losing ground in math in every region of

the country, every racial group, all levels of the socio-economic distribution, every family

structure, and in both public and private schools. By the end of the sample, girls do significantly

worse than boys on every math skill tested. Underperformance by girls is evident not just in

mean test scores, but also in the upper tail of the math distribution. On entry to kindergarten,

girls make up 45 percent of the top five-percentiles in math test scores; by the end of fifth grade




6
        Over that same time span there is little change in the reading gender gap, which consistently favors girls.
                                                        4
just 28 percent of the top five percent are female. Girls are underrepresented in the bottom tail of

the math distribution in kindergarten, but overrepresented in the bottom tail by fifth grade.

        Due to limitations of the data, we can test only a subset of the possible socialization

theories for the divergent trajectory of girls’ math scores in the early years of school, and none of

the biological explanations. Among those hypotheses that we can test, we fail to uncover

compelling support for any of them. Although teachers tend to rate girls more favorably than

test scores would predict, girls lose nearly as much ground on subjective teacher ratings of math

ability as they do on standardized tests, suggesting that the poor relative performance by girls is

not simply an artifact of standardized testing. We attempt to test socialization hypotheses in a

number of ways. Parental expectations regarding math are lower for girls than boys even after

accounting for test scores, but controlling for these expectations does nothing to reduce the

gender gap. We also find that girls with mothers working in math-related occupations lose just

as much ground as those whose mothers are not in math-related occupations, making it unlikely

that low familial expectations for girls in math lie at the root of the issue.7 Parents report

spending equal amounts of time with boys and girls doing math-related activities. As a result,

including these variables has no effect on the gender gap.

        If broader societal forces are working to undermine girls in math, then one might expect

to see females fall further behind in states with greater levels of gender inequality in wages,

employment, or education. Again, including these variables as covariates does little to alter the

gender gap. An important caveat is that some socialization forces, such as the media, operate on

an even broader level. Jacobs and Eccles (1985) argue that the mass media has the ability to be a


7
          We define a “mathematical occupation” as: engineers, surveyors, & architects; and natural scientists &
mathematicians. Roughly one percent of the students in our sample have a mother with a math occupation and four
percent of fathers are in math occupations.
                                                       5
socializing force that can both alter parental responses to stereotypes (sometimes reinforcing,

sometimes counteracting) and affect the salience of various issues (gender stereotyping

included).

        Having exhausted our ability to explain the gender gap in math using ECLS and

concerned about the appropriate level of aggregation to test socialization, we turn our attention to

data from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS 2003) and

Program for International Student Assessment (PISA 2003), the only two datasets with which

one can make reasonable comparisons of math achievement across countries. PISA is a triennial

world-wide test of academic achievement among 15 year olds. TIMMS is an international

assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth grade students from

around the world. Following Guiso et al. (2008), we investigate the relationship between the

gender math gap and societal level female socialization as measured by the World Economic

Forum’s (WEF) gender gap index which reflects economic and political opportunities, education,

and well-being for women.8

        We are able to replicate the findings of Guiso et al. (2008) using PISA data: there is a

strong positive association between the WEF measure of female opportunity and the relative

performance of girls in math. In stark contrast, however, there is no such relationship between

gender equality (as measured by the WEF index) and female math performance in TIMMS. The

difference in results across these two datasets is driven by the samples of countries included;

when one restricts TIMMS to the same countries as PISA, the positive relationship reemerges.

The primary difference between the two data sets is that TIMMS includes a large number of

Middle Eastern countries that are absent in PISA. Surprisingly, although these Middle Eastern

countries have a high degree of gender inequality, there is no gender gap in math on average in

these places.



        Our paper contributes to the gender gap literature in three important ways. First, our data

are more recent, nationally representative, and remarkably rich relative to the previous literature

– containing five assessments over the first six years of schooling. This not only provides the

most accurate picture of the gender gap in early schooling, it allows us to test many of the

socialization theories in a single unified framework. Second, contrary to the previous literature,

we find gender gaps in mathematics that arise as early as third grade and are present in every

strata of society. Third, our analysis of cross country data show the sensitivity of previous results

to the inclusion of a larger set of countries. Fourth, we are the first to show that countries with

high gender inequality and same-sex schools have no gender gap.

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the data used in

the analysis. Section III presents the basic facts and patterns in test scores in the first six years of

school using these data. Section IV investigates the extent to which a variety of alternative

hypotheses can account for the fact that girls are steadily losing ground in mathematics. Section

V explores the patterns in two cross-country data sets. Section VI concludes.



II. The Data

        The primary dataset used in this paper is the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study

Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) – a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 children

entering kindergarten in 1998. Information on these children has so far been gathered at six

                                                  7
separate points in time. The full sample was interviewed in the fall and spring of kindergarten,

spring of first grade, spring of third grade, and spring of fifth grade. A random sample of one-

fourth of the respondents was also interviewed in the fall of first grade. The sample will

eventually be followed through eighth grade. Roughly 1,000 schools are included in the sample,

with an average of more than twenty children per school in the study.

        A wide range of data is gathered on the children in the study, as described in detail at the

ECLS website http://nces.ed.gov/ecls. We utilize just a small subset of the available information

in our baseline specifications.

        Summary statistics for the variables we use in our core specifications are displayed by

gender in Table 1. Students who are missing data on test scores or gender are dropped from our

sample. To keep the sample constant, we further restrict the sample to students who have valid

test scores in all waves.9 Our primary outcome variables are math and reading standardized test

scores.10 The math test evaluates number recognition, counting, comparing and ordering

numbers, solving word problems, and interpreting picture graphs. The reading test includes

questions designed to measure basic skills (print familiarity, letter recognition, beginning and

ending sounds, rhyming sounds, and word recognition), vocabulary and comprehension, listening

and reading comprehension, knowledge of the alphabet, and phonetics. The values reported in

the table are item response theory (IRT) scores provided in ECLS-K, which we have transformed




9
          We have ensured that this sample restriction is of no consequence for our results by comparing our sample
with regressions in which we only exclude students who don’t have valid test scores in each wave. The results of
this exercise are available from the authors upon request.
10
          These tests were developed especially for the ECLS, but are based on existing instruments including
Children’s Cognitive Battery (CCB); Peabody Individual Achievement Test-Revised (PIAT-R); Peabody Picture
Vocabulary Test-3 (PPVT-3); Primary Test of Cognitive Skills (PTCS); and Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-
Educational Battery-Revised (WJ-R).
                                                        8
to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one for the overall sample on each of the tests and

time periods.11 In all instances sample weights provided in ECLS-K are used.12

        In the fall of kindergarten math test, male students score -.004 standard deviations below

the mean in math and female students score .005 standard deviations above the mean, yielding a

trivial achievement gap in favor of girls. By the spring of their 5th grade year, the math picture

shifts dramatically. Male students score .096 above the mean in mathematics and girls score .101

below the mean – roughly a .2 standard deviation gap in achievement. In reading, girls start .15

standard deviations ahead of boys and maintain almost all of their initial advantage.

        The remainder of Table 1 presents summary statistics for the other variables used in the

analysis. The appendix contains precise definitions and details of the construction of these

variables. In contrast to the test scores, for which we have observations at multiple points in

time, most of the control variables are either collected only once (typically kindergarten fall, but

in some cases kindergarten spring), or exhibit little variation over time for individual students.

Thus we report only a single entry for these variables, rather than separate values for each wave.

        For the purely demographic variables (e.g. socio-economic status of the family, whether

the mother works in a math occupation, etc.), mean differences across gender are small because

children’s gender is more or less randomly assigned across families. This need not be the case

for the covariates which have a behavioral component. For instance, boys in the sample are


11
          Because children were asked different questions depending on the answers they provided to the initial
questions on the test, IRT-adjusted scores are preferable to simple test-score measures reflecting the number of
correct answers a child provided. For more detail on the process used to generate the IRT scores, see chapter 3 of
the ECLS-K Users Guide. Tests were administered orally to the full sample in the fall of kindergarten and in the
spring of first grade. Tests in the third and fifth grade combined oral and written components. Tests in the fifth
grade are more writing intensive.
12
          Because of the complex manner in which the ECLS-K sample is drawn, different weights are suggested by
the providers of the data depending upon the set of variables used. We utilize the weights recommended for making
longitudinal comparisons (i.e. C1_6FC0). None of our findings are sensitive to other choices of weights, or not
weighting at all.
                                                       9
slightly older than girls, implying that parents are more likely to delay kindergarten entry for

boys. Parents also report having lower expectations for their daughters when it comes to math.

There is no evidence, however, of large differences across gender in the mean frequency that

parents engage in math or reading activities with the child, although they believe girls will

complete more years of schooling.

       To compare the gender gap across countries, we use data from the Program for

International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in Mathematics and Science Study

(TIMMS). Countries included in either sample are described in Appendix Table 1. PISA is a

triennial world-wide test of academic achievement among fifteen year olds (roughly ninth

grade). Every period of assessment focuses on one particular subject, but also tests the other

main areas studied. The implementation of PISA is coordinated by the Organization for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The first PISA exam was administered in

2000 and focused on reading literacy. The 2003 assessment specialized in mathematics (testing

real life situations in which mathematics is useful). Given our focus is on mathematics

achievement, we focus on the 2003 PISA. Over 275,000 students from 41 countries took the two-

hour handwritten PISA test in 2003, including all 30 OECD countries.13

       TIMMS is an international assessment of the mathematics and science knowledge of

fourth and eighth grade students from around the world. TIMMS was developed by the

International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement to allow participating

nations to compare student’s educational achievement across borders. TIMMS was first

administered in 1995, and has been given every 4 years thereafter. To make comparisons with

PISA, we use the 2003 TIMMS cohort which contains 47 countries.


13
        Britain’s data collection did not meet PISA’s quality standards and all UK data was subsequently omitted.
                                                      10
       TIMMS consists of an assessment of mathematics and science, as well as student,

teacher, and school questionnaires. The assessment includes topics that students have likely been

exposed to up to and including grades 4 and 8. A key difference between PISA and TIMMS is

that PISA asks students to apply their mathematical knowledge to solve problems in various real-

world contexts. TIMMS, on the other hand, measures more traditional classroom context such as

an understanding of fractions and decimals and the relationship between them. The TIMMS

assessment divides mathematical domains into two dimensions: cognitive and content. The

cognitive domains that the assessment covers are “Knowing Facts and Procedures, Using

Concepts, Solving Routine Problems and Reasoning.” The content domains are “Number,

Algebra, Measurement, Geometry, and Data.”

       Following Guiso et al, (2008), to test the impact of country level socialization on the

gender achievement gap, we link the above data on achievement with the World Economic

Forum’s Global Gender Index (WEF-GGI). The index is comprised of four sub-indices which

measure economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, political empowerment,

health and survival. For example, the Economic Participation and Opportunity Sub-index is a

weighted average of the ratio of female to male: (1) labor force participation, (2) income, (3)

legislators, senior officials, and managers, (4) wage equality for similar work, and (5)

professional and technical workers. More details of the index are described in Appendix Table 2.



III. The gender gap in test scores over the first six years of school

       Table 2 presents a series of estimates of the gender gap in the ECLS data for the tests

taken in the fall of kindergarten through the spring of fifth grade. The specifications estimated

are of the form

                                                  11
(1)

where i indexes students. Gender is an indicator variable. In our most fully parameterized

models, the vector of other covariates, denoted Xi, includes an exhaustive and mutually exclusive

set of race indicators, age and age squared, socio-economic status, a categorical variable for the

mother’s age at birth, and whether or not the family participates in the WIC program – similar to

the parsimonious specification estimated in Fryer and Levitt (2004). In all instances, the

estimation is done using weighted least squares, with weights corresponding to the sampling

weights provided in the data set.

       The first five columns of Table 2 report the raw gender gap from the time students enter

kindergarten through the spring of their fifth grade year. These numbers parallel those found in

Table 1. Over the first year of school, the gender gap in math is statistically indistinguishable

from zero. By the end of first grade the gap increases to .076 standard deviations and is

marginally significant. In the spring of their third grade year, female students are doing .205

standard deviations worse than their male counterparts. Given the progress of a typical student

over the course of a school year, this amounts to roughly 2.5 months of schooling. The gap

remains roughly constant between third and fifth grade and is similar in magnitude to the gaps on

the mathematics section of the SAT reported in the Introduction.

       The last five columns in Table 2 include the full set of controls. The gender gap story is

little changed when the covariates are added. Boys and girls remain indistinguishable upon entry

to kindergarten, but steadily lose ground through the end of 3rd grade. The magnitude of the

gender gap after controlling for other factors is slightly larger than the raw gap: .226 standard

deviations.



                                                 12
       The magnitude and sign of the other covariates appear plausible. Black and Hispanic

students perform significantly worse than whites; Asians perform significantly better. Age, age

of the child’s mother at birth, and socioeconomic status are all positively related to achievement.

WIC participation is negatively correlated with test scores, suggesting that it is capturing aspects

of poverty not detected by our SES measures, rather than any true underlying benefits of the

program.

       Table 3 provides a parallel analysis on reading achievement. Female students enter

school ahead of boys in reading and these differences persist through fifth grade in raw scores as

well as after controlling for our set of controls. As was the case with math, including the

controls slightly improves the performance of boys relative to girls.

       Although not shown in tabular form, we have explored the sensitivity of our findings to

different choices of weights (including giving all observations equal weight); the gender gap in

math and reading are virtually unchanged. Similarly, employing an alternative test score

measure (T-scores, which are norm-referenced measurements of achievement), has almost no

impact on the results.

       Thus far we have concentrated on the mean gender math gap that emerges over the first

six years of life. It is also informative to investigate the distribution of math achievement and

how it evolves as children age. The ratio of girls to boys in the full sample is .949. If girls were

equally represented throughout the achievement distribution, we would expect any cut of the

distribution to have a girl to boy ratio of approximately .949.

       Table 4 reports the ratio of girls to boys in different parts of the raw test score

distribution. Upon kindergarten entry, the ratio of girls to boys above and below the median is

similar to the overall sample. By the spring semester of their fifth grade year, the distribution has

                                                 13
shifted in favor of the boys: the ratio of girls to boys above the median is .80 and below is 1.125.

The tails of the distribution are even more pronounced. The ratio of girls to boys in the top 5% of

the distribution is .811 when they enter kindergarten and .381 in the end of fifth grade.14



IV. Why are girls losing ground in mathematics in ECLS-K?

        As a first attempt at understanding the forces driving the divergence in test scores across

genders, Table 5 examines how the gender gap in math varies across sub-samples of the data.15

To the extent that either the absolute magnitude of the gap, or the degree of widening varies

along observable dimensions, it may shed light on the sources of the gap. The first two columns

of Table 5 report the estimated gender gap in math scores upon entry to kindergarten and at the

end of fifth grade, respectively. Column 3 is the difference between those numbers, i.e. the

amount of ground lost or gained by girls over the first six years of school. In all cases, the values

reported in the table are the coefficients on the indicator variable for gender from regressions

including the full set of controls. Each entry in columns 1 and 2 comes from a separate

regression.

        Each row of the table corresponds to a different subset of the data. The top row of the

table presents the baseline results using the full sample. These numbers match the corresponding

numbers presented in Table 2. The next five rows divide the sample by race of the child. Upon

entry to kindergarten (column 1), we cannot reject gender equality of math scores for any of the

racial groups. Girls of every race lose ground (column 3), with the biggest losses relative to boys

observed for whites and the smallest losses for Asians. Asians are the only race for which we

14
          Ellison and Swanson (2009) use the American Math Competition tests to study the far right-hand tail of
the math distribution, finding a large gender gap among very high math achievers.
15
          We have also analyzed differences across sub-samples in reading test scores, and these are available from
the authors on request.
                                                        14
cannot reject equality of scores for boys and girls at the end of fifth grade, in part due to large

standard errors because of the small number of Asians in the data.

         The next five rows segment the sample into quintiles using the composite SES measure.

Again we cannot reject equality of math scores across genders upon entry to school, but in every

quintile of the SES distribution girls trail boys substantially six years later. The greatest decline

for girls relative to boys is in the top quintile of SES, where girls lose almost 0.3 standard

deviations.

         The next three breakdowns of the data are by family structure, region, and urbanicity, all

of which confirm our original results. We observe little difference in the trends across marital

status, or mother’s age at the time of the child’s birth. Looking regionally, girls lose the most

ground in New England and fare the best in the South. The patterns look similar in cities and

suburbs; girls in small towns are not losing quite as much ground.

         Girls appear to fall further behind in private schools than in public schools, more when

the mother is highly educated, and more when the mother is out of the labor force over the years

the child goes from kindergarten to fifth grade. It does not appear to matter whether the mother

is in a math-related occupation (engineer, architect, scientist, e.g.) or whether the mother is more

highly educated than the father.

         In summary, Table 5 demonstrates that girls are losing ground in every category we

examine. If anything, the losses are greatest at the top of the SES/educational spectrum.

Otherwise, there is little in Table 5 that points to a likely source for the phenomenon, suggesting

instead that whatever forces are at work are quite widespread.16



16
           Ellison and Swanson (2009) come to a similar conclusion when analyzing the far right-tail of the
distribution of math achievers.
                                                         15
Are the results simply an artifact of standardized testing?

         Given the potential difficulties of evaluating student achievement using standardized tests

in children so young, one possibility is that our results are simply an artifact of standardized

testing. To assess this hypothesis, we examine the relative performance of children on an

alternative measure of math skill: subjective teacher evaluations. Teachers were asked to answer

20 questions about the child’s academic performance, ranking them on a scale of “Not Yet” to

“Proficient.” These answers were then transformed into IRT scores. As was done with test

scores, these subjective assessments have been re-normalized to have mean zero and a standard

deviation of one. We run regressions controlling for the same set of covariates as with test

scores. In addition, because of concerns about heterogeneity across teachers in the way they may

rate students on these subjective evaluations, we include teacher-fixed effects. Thus, the

estimates are based on a student’s evaluation relative to other students in the same classroom.

The results, reported in Appendix Table 3, show that teachers rate girls .075 standard deviations

(se=.05) higher than boys in math in the fall of kindergarten, but .172 standard deviations

(se=.06) behind boys by the end of fifth grade.17 The change in teacher assessments of roughly

.25 standard deviations for girls relative to boys is remarkably similar in magnitude to the decline

observed on standardized tests, suggesting that our findings are not simply an artifact of the

particular tests in the ECLS.



Do girls spend less time studying math and thus fall behind?



17
          On teacher assessments of reading skills, girls go from having a .169 standard deviation advantage
(se=.03) in fall of kindergarten to .261 standard deviations (se=.04) in spring of fifth grade. Thus girls gain roughly
one-tenth of a standard deviation in reading relative to boys over the same time period that they lose .25 standard
deviations in math.
                                                          16
        While some of the gains that students experience as they age may be due purely to brain

maturation, it seems likely that much of the improvement in mathematical performance is due to

human capital investment. If girls are investing less than boys at these ages, it could explain why

they are losing ground. Unfortunately, ECLS-K contains only a very crude proxy for the time

and effort devoted to math – the parent’s response to a question about how many times per week

the child engages in math activities. We do not observe any clear gender differences on this

variable. Parents report that their girls spend 2.27 days per week on math related activities and

their boys spend 2.29 days per week.18 While we cannot rule out this explanation, we have no

affirmative support for it.



Can low parental expectations explain why girls fall behind in math?

        As noted in the summary statistics in Table 1, parents have lower math expectations for

their daughters, which could adversely affect female math trajectories. When we include

parental expectations with respect to math as a covariate in our regressions, however, the gender

gap decreases by at most .04 standard deviations. In some of our regressions it even increases

slightly. This lack of impact on parental expectations is consistent with the absence of an impact

of being in a family where the mother has more education than the father, or where the mother

works in math-related professions.




18
          Even if we did observe gender differences, there is no systematic relationship between responses to this
question and the child’s math score in the spring of fifth grade. The question may simply not be capturing
effectively human capital investment. Alternatively, it may be the case that parents work more with those students
who are most in need of remedial help in math, so that reverse causality obscures the positive impact of the
investment.
                                                        17
Does the material tested change as children age in a manner that lowers the relative

performance of female students?

         If gender differences vary across different mathematical subjects, then the measured

performance of girls might decline over time simply due to changing composition of the test. 19

Table 6 reports the estimated gender gap in the probability of proficiency on a particular math

skill by grade. These regressions control for the same set of covariates as in earlier tables. We

report coefficients only for those grade/math skill combinations where there is substantial

variation across children, e.g. by spring of first grade almost all students have mastered counting

so no entries are made in the table only in kindergarten for counting. Standard errors are

reported in parentheses. In kindergarten and first grade, girls outperform boys on some aspects

of the test and do worse on other portions. By third grade, however, boys have higher

proficiency rates on each of the math skills examined. The same is true for fifth grade. Gender

differences in math performance on these tests are widespread; they are not concentrated in just

one or two types of math.20

         In summary, our search for sharp explanations for a gender gap in mathematics within

ECLS-K must be judged a failure. Our tests of a wide range of a priori plausible stories generate

little strong support for any particular causal pathway. Rather, it appears that girls are losing

ground at a relatively similar magnitude more or less regardless of their circumstances. There is

19
          In personal correspondence, ECLS reports that the fraction of the exam devoted to each set of skills
remains constant as children age. In the fall of kindergarten, few children are expected to correctly answer questions
involving multiplication and division, and by the spring of first grade, few children are expected to miss questions
involving counting. Even though the same share of the test is devoted to each set of skills, the portion of the test that
provides the identifying variation changes over time. If almost all students (or, equivalently, virtually none of the
students) have mastered a task, then there is little variation in scores on that part of the test, and consequently it does
not contribute to measured gender differences.



20
          In contrast, girls outperform boys in every facet of reading in every grade.
                                                            18
one major caveat: we are unable to account for societal level socialization factors that operate at

a macro level.



V. Cross-country analysis of the gender gap in mathematics

       Having learned what we can from the ECLS-K, we conclude our analysis by studying

cross-country data on gender differences in math. In a recent paper, Guiso et al. (2008) use the

PISA exam of fifteen year olds to estimate gender gaps in math across forty countries. Largely

consistent with the ECLS-K data for the United States, they find that boys outperform girls in

math in the great majority of countries, whereas girls outperform boys in reading in every

country in the sample. Guiso et al. (2008) further demonstrate that the gender gap in math scores

is strongly negatively correlated with various measures of gender equality such as the World

Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index (WEF-GGI) and an index of cultural attitudes toward

women based on questions in the World Values Surveys.

       In more gender-equal countries like Norway and Sweden, the gender gap disappears

completely. The results from Guiso, et. al. (2008) suggest an important role for a country’s

culture influencing the relative performance of girls on both math and reading. Our inability to

isolate strong determinants of the gender gap within a single country in the ECLS-K, while not

direct support for this hypothesis, is consistent with their conclusion.

       Figure 2 presents graphically the relationship in the raw PISA data between a country’s

gender gap in math (panel A), reading (panel B) and gender equality as measured by the WEF-

GGI. As noted by Guiso et al. (2008) and as evidenced by the regression line superimposed on

the data, a positive correlation (ρ=.424 for math and ρ=.407 for reading exists.



                                                 19
        PISA is not the only cross-country test of math achievement. A second data set capturing

international math patterns is TIMMS – developed by the International Association for the

Evaluation of Educational Achievement to measure trends in students’ mathematics and science

achievement. There are 17 countries included in both PISA and TIMMS, and the WEF survey of

gender equality. The correlation in math scores across PISA and TIMMS for that subset of

countries is .89. Thus, it is not surprising that when we plot the TIMMS scores for these

overlapping countries against gender equality in panel A of Figure 3, the observed patterns are

similar to those presented earlier using PISA data.

        What is surprising, however, is what happens to the relationship between the gender gap

in math and gender equality when we use all the TIMMS sample for which WEF gender gap

index data are available (41 out of 47 countries), as opposed to only the subset of countries that

are also included in PISA.21 A graph of the full data is also shown in panel A of figure 3. To

facilitate comparison, the countries that are in both datasets are shown in, as is the regression line

corresponding to those countries. The additional countries, along with the regression line that

fits the whole data set, are shown in gray. Using the broader set of nations, any relationship

between gender equality and the gender gap in math disappears. Indeed, in countries like

Bahrain and Iran, which are among the worst in terms of gender equality, girls are actually

outperforming boys on math, and this is due to relatively strong performance by girls, not an

unusually bad showing among the boys. Consequently, the gender gap in math scores over this

full sample actually disappears.22



21
          To be included in the WEF Survey of Gender Equality a country must have data on 12 out of 14 sub-
indices of the WEF-GGI.
22
          The strong performance by girls in the set of countries with very low WEF scores does not appear to be
due to selection, i.e. a smaller share of girls in school to be tested. See Appendix Table 1
                                                        20
         Table 7 adds more structure to the discussion above by estimating a series of equations

similar to (1) for the full sample of PISA (columns 1 through 3), the full sample of TIMMS

(columns 4 through 6) and the set of 17 countries that are in both PISA and TIMMS (columns 7

through 9). For each sample, we estimate three equations. The first regresses the gender gap on

theWEF-GGI measure. The second equation estimated adds GDP, and the third adds the gender

ratio of test takers to the second equation to account for the possibility of sex-specific selection

as to who is taking the test. The coefficient on WEF-GGI is positive and significant in PISA and

in the set of countries where TIMMS and PISA overlap. In the full TIMMS sample, however,

the coefficient on gender is small and insignificant,

         There are a number of possible explanations for the stark difference between these

samples. One possibility is that the results based on the PISA countries are spurious, and

introducing more data reveals this to be the case. An intriguing alternative hypothesis emerges

from another cut of the data. Using information provided in TIMMS, we identify those countries

in which same-sex classrooms or schools are prevalent. For most of the world, almost all

education is done in mixed-gender settings. In a handful of countries in TIMMS (Bahrain, Iran,

Jordan, Palestine, and Saudi Arabia), virtually all secondary schooling is sex-segregated. In a

few other countries there is a mix of same and mixed gender classrooms, but the majority of

students are in same-sex classrooms (Egypt, Korea, Syria). The fact that the set of countries that

have gender-segregated classrooms are largely Muslim countries confounds the analysis. In

Figure 3B, these countries with a high-degree of sex-segregated education are shown in gray,

whereas other countries are in black.23 Regression lines for those two subsets of the data are also

presented. When the countries with sex-segregated classrooms are not included, a positive

23
         One worry is that there is selection on gender in these countries as to who takes the test. Controlling for the
gender ratio of test takers does not alter the results.
                                                          21
relationship between gender equality and relative female test scores once again emerges. The

regression line for countries with single-sex education has a similar slope, but is shifted upwards

by roughly 0.1 standard deviations .24 Controlling for other country level covariates such as GDP

does not alter the results. Although imprecisely estimated, it appears both that girls are doing

better in the single-sex countries, and that the boys are doing worse.

         While of course highly speculative, these cross-country data are consistent with the

hypothesis that mixed-gender classrooms are a necessary component for gender inequality to

translate into poor female math performance, although it is difficult to distinguish single-sex

classrooms from Islamic religion in the data.25




VI. Conclusion

         In this paper, we analyze the emergence of the gender gap in math using ECLS-K, a

nationally representative data set from the United States. There are no mean differences between

boys and girls upon entry to school, but girls lose one-fourth of a standard deviation relative to

boys over the first six years of school. The ground lost by girls relative to boys is half the

24
           Because of the small sample of countries with sex-segregated classrooms and the fact that there is a limited
amount of variation in the WEF gender equality index for these countries, the slope of the line for this subset of the
data is imprecisely estimated. The difference in intercept relative to the broader set of countries, however, is highly
statistically significant. When we include a dummy for countries having the majority of students in same sex
classrooms in a regression on the whole TIMMS sample, the coefficient on that dummy is .16 with a standard error
of .07.
25
           There are at least three reasons why sex segregated schools might have a positive influence on math
achievement for girls. First, as discussed in Wilder and Powell (1989), differential treatment of male and female
students by teachers may perpetuate stereotypes of gender roles (girls are more verbal, boys are more cognitive,
e.g.). Second, single-sex education has, in some instances, been able to increase levels of self-esteem in girls (Haag
2000). Third, as demonstrated in Lee and Marks (1990), girls that underwent single-sex schooling were less likely to
hold stereotypical views of gender roles even after single-sex schooling had concluded. There is a substantial
literature examining the impact of same-sex schools and classrooms at the micro level (e.g. Lee and Bryk 1986,
Lepore and Warren 1997, Younger and Warrington 2006), yielding mixed results. The identification strategies used
in many of these studies is questionable, and those with any form of plausibly exogenous variation have had small
samples that limit inference.

magnitude of the black-white test score gap that appears over these same ages. We document the

presence of this gender gap across every strata of society. We explore a wide range of possible

explanations in the U.S. data, including less investment by girls in math, low parental

expectations, and biased tests, but find little support for any of these theories.

       Although we are not successful at isolating the root causes of the gap in the ECLS-K

data, we are able to test a number of potentially important prior explanations, finding scant

support for any of these. For instance, our evidence suggests that the gender math gap is

especially large among children who attend private schools, have highly-educated mothers, and

have mothers working in math-related occupations -- all factors that one might think under some

theories would be conducive to girls’ success in math.




                                                  23
Data Appendix
We describe below how we combined and recoded some of the ECLS variables used in our
analysis.

Socio-economic Composite Measure.
The socioeconomic scale variable (SES) was computed by ECLS at the household level for the
set of parents who completed the parent interview in Fall Kindergarten or Spring Kindergarten.
The SES variable reflects the socioeconomic status of the household at the time of data
collection for spring kindergarten. The components used for the creation of SES were:
Father/male guardian’s education; Mother/female guardian’s education; Father/male guardian’s
occupation; Mother/female guardian’s occupation; and Household income.

Child’s Age.
We used the Child’s Age at Assessment Composite variable provided by ECLS. The Child’s age
was calculated by determining the number of days between the child assessment date and the
child’s date of birth. The value was then divided by 30 to calculate the age in months.

Mother’s Age at First Birth.
Mothers were asked how old they were at the birth of their first child.

WIC Participant
Parents were asked whether their child received any benefits from the WIC program. WIC is a
nutrition program aimed at low income mothers and children.

Mother/Father in Math Intensive Occupation
Parents were asked for their respective occupations.
We consider the following occupational categories in ECLS to be math intensive:“engineers,
surveyors, & architects”; and “natural scientists & mathematicians.”
The occupational categories not considered to be math intensive are: “executive, admin,
managerial”; “social scientist/workers, lawyers”; “physicians, dentists, veterinarians”;
“registered nurses, pharmacists”; “health technologists & technicians”; “technologists, except
health”; “university teachers, postsecondary counselors”; “teacher, except postsecondary”;
“writers, artists, entertainers, athlete”;
“marketing & sales occupation”; “administrative support, including clerk”; “service”;
“agriculture, forestry, fishing”; “mechanics & repairs”; “construction & extractive occupations”;
“precision production occupation”; “production working occupation”; “transportation, material
moving”; “handler, equip, cleaner, helpers, labor”; “unemployed or retired”.

Mother’s/Father’s Occupational Prestige Score
ECLS provides a prestige score for the occupations of a child’s parents. The raw score ranges
from 29-78. We use this information to create two variables indicating the quintile into which a
child’s mother and father fall.

Teacher Evaluations


                                                24
Teachers were asked 20 questions in which they rated a student’s proficiency in several skills
based on the teacher’s past observation and experience with the child. The scale on which each
item is rated ranges from 1 (“net yet [proficient]”) to 5 (“proficient”). Item Response Theory is
then used to combine the teacher’s answers into three continuous scores, which reflect a child’
achievement in mathematical thinking, language and literacy, and general knowledge. We use
the math and language scores, after normalizing them to each have mean 0 and a standard
deviation of 1.

Parental Expectations Educational Attainment
Parents were asked how far in school they expected their child to go. Answer choices were 1--
“receive less than a high school degree”, 2--“graduate from high school”, 3--“attend two or more
years of college”, 4--“finish a 4-or-5-year college degree”, 5--“earn a master’s degree or
equivalent”, 6--“get Ph.D., or MD, or higher degree”. We use this information to construct six
mutually exclusive indicator variables.

Parental Expectations Relative Performance
Parents were asked how well they think their child is doing in math and reading, respectively,
compared to other children in the same school. Answer choices ranged from 1 (“much worse”) to
5 (“much better”). Based on this we construct five mutually exclusive indicator variables.

Frequency of Math Activities
Parents were asked how many times they, or any other family member, did math related
activities with their child in the week after July 4th. Examples of math related activities were
“learning numbers”, “adding”, “subtracting”, and “measuring”. Answer choices were “never”,
“once or twice”, “three to six times”, and “everyday”.

Frequency of Reading Activities
Parents were asked how many times they, or any other family member, read books to their child
in the week after July 4th. Answer choices were “never”, “once or twice”, “three to six times”,
and “everyday”.

Wage Inequality Index
We use the location of the school each child attends (state), from the unrestricted ECLS-K data
file, to merge the data with state-level information from the 2000 Census. Our measure of wage
inequality is the ratio of full-time year-round female workers' median income in a particular state
to that of their male counterparts.

Employment Inequality Index
We use the location of the school each child attends (state), from the unrestricted ECLS-K data
file, to merge the data with state-level information from the 2000 Census. Our measure of gender
inequality in employment is the ratio of employed females relative to employed males.

NOTES: The entries are means and standard deviations of student-level data for those students in ECLS-K
who do not have missing values for gender, age, and test scores. Test scores are IRT scores, normalized to
have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 in the full, weighted sample. Parental Expectations are
categorical variables. Educational Attainment indicates the highest level of education the parents expect their
child to attain: 1 - HS dropout; 2 - HS grad; 3 - some college; 4 - Bachelor; 5 - Masters; 6 - Ph.D. The category
white includes only non-Hispanic whites. Relative Performance indicates how well, compared to other children,
parents expect their child to do: 1 - much worse; 2 - a little worse; 3 - about the same; 4 - a little better; 5 - much
better. The SES composite measure incorporates information on parental education, occupational status, and
family income. The SES measure ranges from -5.88 to 3.46 in the sample, with larger numbers indicating
higher SES. Indices of gender inequality are means of state level data on: full-time year-round female workers'
median income relative to male's; ratio of employed females relative to employed males;and the ratio of
females with a graduate education relative to males. Precise definitions of the variables are provided in the data
appendix. The total number of students in the sample who receive a positive weight in the estimation is 9500.
The bottom panel of the table reports the number of missing values for the covariates. Sample weights are
used.

NOTES: Specifications are variations on those reported in table 2, columns 6 and 10. Only
the gender coefficients are reported. The top row simply reproduces the baseline results in
columns 6 and 10 of table 2. The remaining rows correspond to separate regressions run using
different weights, test score measures, or particular subsets of the data. For further details of
the baseline specification, see the notes to table 2.

Notes: Entries are adjusted mean proficient probability score differences on specific areas of questions.
Standard errors are given in parentheses. Mean probability scores for the whole sample are reported in
square brackets. These scores are constructed using IRT scores and provide the probability of mastery of a
specific set of skills. We adjust for our parsimonious set of controls and refrain from reporting minuscule
differences. ** denotes significance at 5%-level; *** denotes significance at 1%-level.

NOTES: Estimation is done using ordinary least squares. Test scores are standardized by country to have mean 0 and standard deviation over the full weighted
sample. Gender gap is calculated as the weighted mean score of females minus the weighted mean score of males. Gender ratio was constructed at the country
level as the weighted ratio of female to male among test takers. GDP was divided by 1000. Standard errors of coefficients are reported in parentheses. * denotes
significance at 5% level; **denotes significance at 1% level.

NOTES: The table entries are estimated gaps in IRT scores and subjective teacher assessment of
student achievement provided by teachers in fall kindergarten, spring first grade, spring 3rd grade,
and spring 5th grade. The odd columns are raw gaps; the even columns are residual gaps after
controlling for the parsimonious set of controls and teacher fixed effects. Test scores and teacher
assessments are normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 in the weighted
sample of students with valid test scores. The method of estimation is weighted least squares
using sample weights provided by ECLS. The number of observations is 6096 for reading and
2445 for math, which is the set of children for whom teacher assessments and test scores were
available at every point in the time. Standard errors are given in parentheses. * denotes
significance at 5% level; ** denotes significance at 1% level.
