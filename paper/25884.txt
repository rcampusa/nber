                                           ABSTRACT

This paper studies the immediate and long-run mortality effects of the first community-based
health intervention in the world – the Framingham Health and Tuberculosis Demonstration,
1917-1923. The official evaluation committee and the historical narrative suggest that the
demonstration was highly successful in controlling tuberculosis and reducing mortality. Using
newly digitized annual cause-of-death data for municipalities in Massachusetts, 1901-1934, and
different empirical strategies, we find little evidence to support this positive assessment. In fact,
we find that the demonstration did not reduce tuberculosis mortality, all-age mortality, nor infant
mortality. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate on whether public-health interventions
mattered for the decline in (tuberculosis) mortality prior to modern medicine. At a more
fundamental level, our study questions this particular type of community-based setup with non-
random treatment assignment as a method of evaluating policy interventions.

1         Introduction
In the United States, the tuberculosis (TB) mortality rate fell from above 200 in the beginning
of the 20th century to about 60 per 100,000 in the mid-1930s (Cutler and Meara, 2004). Was
this decline mainly due to public health policies? So far, research has provided different answers
to this question. In his classic work, McKeown (1976) argued that public policy played a
limited role in reducing TB mortality prior to antibiotics. By contrast, Preston (1975), Szreter
(1988), Cutler et al. (2006), and others highlight the important role of various public health
interventions that were set in motion by the germ theory of disease in the 1880s.1
        In this paper, we provide a rigorous quantitative analysis of the effects of the first public
health demonstration, the Framingham Community Health and Tuberculosis Demonstration, on
TB mortality, total mortality, and infant mortality.2 The Demonstration was made possible
by a donation of 200,000 US dollars made by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to the
National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (henceforth the National
Association) in 1916. Later that year, Framingham, Massachusetts, was chosen as a typical
American community, and the Demonstration was carried out from 1917 to 1923 with increased
efforts to control TB through a consultation service and informational campaigns. After
the Demonstration ended in 1923, an official evaluation found that TB and infant mortality
decreased more in Framingham compared to similar pre-selected control communities during
the Demonstration period 1917-1923. The TB mortality rate in Framingham fell 69 percent,
compared with that of seven control communities in which the fall was 32 percent (Monograph
No. 10, 1924: p.40).3 It is still believed to have been successful. In fact, Kannel and Levy (2005)
conclude that the Demonstration not only showed that TB could be controlled but that the
approach taken by the Demonstration could be a foundation for the investigation of the causes
and control of other chronic diseases that impact the population. Moreover, the Framingham
Demonstration inspired a number of contemporary health demonstrations, and community-wide
    1
     Empirical work supporting that clean water and sanitation mattered includes Cutler and Miller (2005),
Ferrie and Troesken (2008), Clay et al. (2014), and Alsan and Goldin (forthcoming). On the contrary, Anderson
et al. (2018b) find that the effect of different clean water actions was limited.
   2
     An article in the Boston Globe from March 18, 2016 states that, according to Framingham History Center
executive director Anne Murphy, the Framingham Demonstration was the first community-based participatory
health study in the world (West, 2016).
   3
     The National Association published 10 monographs on Framingham, see Framingham Community Health
and Tuberculosis Demonstration of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis
(1918-1924). In the text, we refer to these volumes as, for example, Monograph No. 1 for the first volume, and
so on.


                                                      1
demonstration projects are even used in developing countries today.
   To evaluate the effects of the Framingham Demonstration, we use newly digitized vital
statistics for municipalities (i.e., towns and cities) in Massachusetts. The official evaluation
(Monograph No. 10, 1924) used seven pre-selected control municipalities in Massachusetts to
measure whether the Demonstration reduced TB mortality in Framingham during the Demon-
stration period (1917-1923). We extend the number of potential control municipalities within
Massachusetts to study whether the Demonstration reduced TB mortality. The Massachusetts
cause-of-death data set allows us to study the Demonstration more systematically and to apply
methods that take into account that we have only one treated unit and transitory shocks in the
outcome. We apply the synthetic control method, pioneered by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003)
and Abadie et al. (2010), a recent extension of this method by Doudchenko and Imbens (2016),
and standard differences-in-differences methods, but again taking into account that only one
unit was treated.
   In contrast to the positive conclusions found in Monograph No. 10 (1924) and the historical
narrative, we find that the Framingham Demonstration did not have any effects on TB, infant
mortality, or total mortality. We do, however, find some evidence that it increased the number
of discovered TB cases.4 These findings imply that the original conclusion regarding the effect
of the Demonstration on tuberculosis is debatable.5
   The paper makes at least two contributions. First, it contributes to the literature on the
historical mortality decline. McKeown, along with Fogel (1994, 1997), emphasize the role of
nutritional improvements as a main factor behind the mortality decline. Egedesø (2018) reports
evidence on this based on data for US prisons. He finds that increases in spending on provisions
per prisoner can explain about 26 percent of the prison mortality decline. Moreover, recent
research by Anderson et al. (2018a) partly supports McKeown’s conclusion regarding public
health policy and finds that the first campaign against TB had limited success prior to 1918 in
the United States. By contrast, research by Hollingsworth (2014) and Egedesø et al. (2017)
suggest that interventions targeted at TB were, in fact, successful in the pre-antibiotic era. The
evidence obtained on the effect of the Framingham Demonstration is more in line with the view
of McKeown and Fogel.
   4
     Positive evaluations are given in, e.g., Shryok (1957), Comstock (1980), and Kannel and Levy (2005).
D’Antonio (2017) notes that the results of the Framingham Demonstration suggested that case finding and
treatment could reduce tuberculosis mortality.
   5
     We also do not find any evidence of spillover effects of the Demonstration to nearby communities when we
exclude municipalities within 50 kilometers of Framingham.


                                                     2
    Second, at a more fundamental level, our paper relates to the literature on the effects
of demonstration projects in developing countries today, such as the Millennium Villages
Project (Clemens and Demombynes, 2011) and the Southwest Project in China (Chen et al.,
2009). This literature aims to evaluate the effects of demonstration projects using possible
non-random assignment into treatment as was the case for Framingham. Focusing on a historical
demonstration project offers a unique possibility to leverage annual panel data to study the effects
over a longer period than in the development literature and to test maintained assumptions
needed for the empirical strategy. By contrast, difference-in-differences estimation with two
to three surveys and a shorter period are often used in the development literature. Clemens
and Demonbynes (2011) and Chen et al. (2009), for example, only have data after initial
treatment and are, therefore, unable to evaluate the parallel trend assumption needed for the
validity of difference-in-differences estimation. Our historical study documents that it is difficult
to evaluate such demonstration projects in terms of statistical precision, even when pre- and
post-intervention data are available for a longer period of time, questioning this type of research
design with one or a few treated units and non-random treatment assignment.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides historical background on
the Framingham Demonstration explaining the intervention in detail. Section 3 describes the
data collected. Section 4 presents the empirical strategy. Sections 5 reports the results. Section
6 concludes.


2     Historical background
This section provides more details on the Framingham Community Health and Tuberculosis
Demonstration as well as other background material. We first describe the background for the
donation to the National Association and why Framingham was chosen as the location for the
Demonstration. Second, we describe the key elements of the Demonstration. Third, we discuss
other Demonstrations that followed after the Framingham Demonstration. Finally, we take an
initial look at the differences between Framingham and other municipalities in Massachusetts in
terms of pulmonary TB death rates.




                                                 3
2.1    The donation and the choice of location
In May 1916, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company donated 100,000 US dollars to the
National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis. The gift was given for the
purpose of carrying out a community health and TB Demonstration. The insurance company
had an interest in the Demonstration, as 16 percent of the deaths in its industrial department
were due to TB. In 1915, the company paid claims of over 4 million dollars on the lives of
14,325 policy holders dying from the disease (Monograph No. 1, 1918: p.9). The purpose of
the investigation was to demonstrate what may be possible with a united action of prevention
and control of TB (Monograph No. 1, 1918: p.12). Soon after the Demonstration had begun, it
was deemed impossible to fight TB without carrying out a program for improving the general
health of the community. By mid-1919, all Demonstration activities were under way, and it was
too soon to judge their effects (Shryock, 1957). To allow activities to continue, the insurance
company increased the appropriation to 200,000 US dollars and the Demonstration was therefore
able to run for a period of seven years (Hall, 1933).
   Initially, the location of the Demonstration had not been determined. In November 1916,
the choice fell on Framingham, a town located 21 miles west of Boston (D’Antonio, 2017;
Monograph No. 1, 1918); see also the map of Massachusetts in Figure 1 with the location of
the municipalities in the sample. It was a “typical community” of second and third generation
white Irish Americans, whose immigrant population of 27 percent mirrored that of the United
States as a whole (d’Antonio, 2017). Monograph No. 1 (1918) describes Framingham as a
community with mixed industries, varied racial groups, a good health organization linked with
an excellent State Department of Health, a normal amount of disease – particularly TB, well
trained physicians, and good hospitals. Moreover, Monograph No. 10 (1924) adds that the
town was an autonomous, economically independent, and essentially non-commuting settlement.
Framingham is also described as an average town with the properties mentioned above and “a
sufficient promise of cooperation from medical, industrial, commercial and social organizations
to give reasonable assurance of success” (Monograph No. 10, 1924: p.17).

2.2       The elements of the Demonstration
As mentioned above, the Demonstration ran from 1917 to 1923. It included several elements
that may be grouped under primary research activities and health services which we explain
below. We also provide a description of the evolution of health services based on the Board of
Health Reports.

2.2.1      Primary research activities

The first year of the Demonstration was mainly devoted to primary research activities. As
detailed in the Monographs No. 2, 5, and 6, these research activities included a sickness survey,6
the Von Pirquet Tuberculin Survey of children, and studies of the sanitary conditions in schools
and factories. In 1918, a tuberculin survey of cattle was carried out. Research and investigation
constituted roughly 52 percent of the costs incurred as part of the Demonstration in 1917, which
had decreased to 17 percent by 1922 (Monograph No. 10, 1924).
      Shryock (1957) notes that the research activities produced a number of by-products. They
not only resulted in a medical survey of the population in the course of which many children
were tuberculin tested, but also in the systematic use of X-ray as a diagnostic aid.

2.2.2      Establishment and expansion of services

Consultation service During the first year of the Demonstration, a consultation service was
established. Dr. P.C. Bartlett was the chief medical examiner and expert consultant. His job
included helping local Framingham physicians with diagnosing TB. This helped to increase the
number of known TB cases from 27 to 185 as well as the number of active cases from 13 to
59 (Monograph No. 10, 1924). Related to diagnosis, Comstock (2005) points out that the use
of methods such as “fluoroscopy was almost routine and chest radiographs were made when
indicated. Both were rarely available in small towns at that time.” In line with this, Shryok
(1957) emphasizes that Framingham was the earliest instance in which expert consultation
services were made available to local practitioners for the diagnosis of pulmonary and cardiac
conditions. The consultation service also acted as a connecting link between “physicians and
patients, between the patients and treatment, and between physicians and scientific knowledge
and methods” (Monograph No. 10, 1924). Matson (1924) believed that the consultation service
was the most valuable of the services set up by the Demonstration. He described the service as
  6
      Shryock (1957) notes that the sickness survey covered 38.7 percent of the Framingham population.


                                                       5
“an expert consultation service, offering consultations to local physicians, factory medical and
nursing staffs on cases of suspected tuberculosis, or respiratory infections” (p.1243).7


Infant welfare work Initially, infant welfare work was carried out and expanded by a private
organization called the Civic League, which itself was established in 1917. From 1920, this
work was taken over and expanded by the Board of Health, which established infant welfare
clinics. According to the 1921 Framingham Board of Health report, the work of the infant
welfare department consisted in ensuring that 1) prospective mothers received adequate care; 2)
mothers were taught the value of fresh milk for their babies and were instructed not to wean
them too soon; 3) mothers who were not fortunate enough to have mother’s milk, obtained
good cow’s milk for their babies; and 4) mothers were taught when and how to begin to give
their children foods other than milk. The 1920 Framingham Board of Health report explains
that babies attending the clinic would be weighed and examined by a clinic physician and that
directions would be given to see the family physician when necessary. Other activities after 1919
included hiring one visiting TB nurse, two infant and pre-school nurses, and three part-time
infant welfare physicians as well as establishing an infantile paralysis clinic and one venereal
disease clinic (Monograph No. 10, 1924).


Existing services The Demonstration also implied an expansion of existing services. The
budget for health work in the Framingham schools quadrupled from USD 1,500 to USD 6,000.
The health department was also more active in TB work and work on sanitary conditions. The
leading industry in Framingham increased its nursing and clinical work. Moreover, there was
also increased coordination among voluntary health agencies. Other changes to health services
included provision of dental services in the industries and the increased fraction of pasteurized
milk available in the community. In addition, the Demonstration published “Health Letters,”
which provided health education and ran five children’s summer camps (Monograph No. 10,
1924).


Spending on health services The spending on health services increased from USD 6,400 in
1916 to USD 50,000 in 1923, with both Demonstration spending and the spending by private
   7
    Monograph No. 10 (1924) lists the possible treatments being offered to TB patients. These include TB
dispensaries providing home treatment and sanatoria providing institutional treatment. It is well-known that
none of these offered an effective cure prior to the invention of streptomycin.



                                                     6
and public agencies contributing to the increase. In per capita terms, this was an increase from
USD 0.40 per capita in 1916 to USD 2.75 in 1923 (Monograph No. 10, 1924).8

2.2.3     Services provided by the Board of Health

To obtain information on which services were publicly provided before, during, and after the
Demonstration, we have read through the annual reports of the Framingham Board of Health
for the years 1910-1930. The annual reports of the Board of Health reveal how health spending
was distributed within one of the central units in the Framingham Demonstration. Moreover,
they contain information on some of the services provided by the Board of Health.
      The spending in the years 1913-1916 reveals that there were some developments taking
place prior to the Demonstration. In the years 1913-1914, about a quarter of the budget
went towards care of “contagious cases.” Other significant spending was on inspections of
slaughtering and on plumbing. In 1915, a small amount was spent on a TB dispensary, which
was founded in that year. This appears to have been the main new activity of the Board of
Health prior to the Demonstration. There is no budget printed in 1917, but as of 1918 expenses
on laboratory equipment and management are included. From 1920, spending on the Infant
Welfare department is included along with the names of two infant welfare nurses, and the
reports from 1920-1930 all contain descriptions of or references to infant welfare clinics. In line
with the narrative above, the 1920 report mentions that the Board of Health took over the
infant welfare work from the Civic League.
      The 1924 report (p.255) states that the death of Dr. Bartlett had left Framingham without
an expert on TB. His death had led to the suspension of the consultation service (p.259). The
1925 report further states that the consultation service, which focused on TB and was established
as a vital part of the Demonstration, had been replaced by a weekly clinic. Moreover, a monthly
clinic was operated by the State Board of Health, which also provided services for 13 surrounding
municipalities.9 For the subsequent years, there are only references to one consultation service
in the Framingham Board of Health reports.
  8
     Shryock (1957) notes that the spending levels per capita at the end of the Demonstration became the
desirable public health expenditure levels for other communities.
   9
     The Annual Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts also mentions this clinic in 1925, but
there is no reference to it in later volumes.




                                                    7
2.3       Other health demonstrations
According to Monograph No. 10 (1924), the Demonstration was a forerunner of many demonstra-
tions of similar character. Monograph No. 10 (1924) contains the following list of demonstrations
ongoing or planned in 1924: the Hagerstown, Maryland, health demonstration; the Mansfield
child health demonstration; the child health demonstrations by the American Child Health
Association in Fargo, North Dakota, in Athens, Georgia, in Rutherford County, Tennessee, and
on the Pacific Coast; the Detroit tuberculosis demonstration; the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company infant welfare demonstration in Thetford Mines, Quebec; the tuberculosis and health
demonstration in Montreal; the expanded tuberculosis program for the Province of Quebec; and
the Milbank Memorial Fund health demonstrations in Cattaugarus County, N.Y., in Syracuse,
and in New York City. The list illustrates that demonstrations were carried out in different
parts of the United States and also spread to Canada.10


2.4       Tuberculosis in Massachusetts, 1901-1934
As the Demonstration had a strong focus on TB, we provide a brief description of the disease
and how it evolved in Framingham and the rest of Massachusetts. As for TB itself, the disease is
caused by the bacteria of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex discovered by Robert Koch
in 1882. The most common type of TB is pulmonary TB, but TB can also affect other organs.11
       As shown in Figure 2, pulmonary TB mortality was high in the early 20th century but was
declining throughout the period as demonstrated by the mortality rate in Framingham and other
municipalities in Massachusetts from 1901 to 1934 (Panel B).12 The level for Framingham is
mostly seen to be lower than the one for the other municipalities. There is no clear break during
the period of the Demonstration. In Panel A of Figure 2, we compare Framingham to the seven
control municipalities in Massachusetts chosen prior to the Demonstration: Chicopee, Clinton,
Fitchburg, Gardner, Marlboro, Milford, and North Adams. The Framingham monographs
are silent on why these municipalities were chosen, but they do mention that the control
  10
     Health demonstrations were also carried out in France by the Rockefeller Foundation.
  11
     Transmission of TB occurs by inhalation of infectious droplet nuclei containing viable bacilli, known as aerosol
spread. Mycobacteria-laden droplet nuclei are formed when a patient with active pulmonary TB coughs or sneezes,
and they can remain suspended in the air for several hours. After the initial infection with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the individual either clears the infection, contains a latent TB infection without symptoms but
with the bacilli remaining, or develops active TB (Hemskerk et al., 2015).
  12
     We use municipalities with a population from 5,000 inhabitants up to 50,000 inhabitants to facilitate a
reasonable comparison to Framingham.



                                                         8
municipalities were chosen with the advice of the Massachusetts State Health Department.
Relatively lower pulmonary TB death rates become visible a few years prior to 1917 and remain
during the Demonstration in Framingham, but then at the end of the 1920s Framingham looked
like the control municipalities. In the early 1930s, Framingham experienced some reductions
but these were later reversed. Thus, the visual impression is that Framingham had lower
pulmonary TB mortality rates than other Massachusetts municipalities, but compared to the
control municipalities, the differences are only clearly visible a few years before and during the
Demonstration.

                                         [Figure 2 about here]


3        Data
Our data are from the following sources: first, the “Annual report on the vital statistics of
Massachusetts” published by the Division of Vital Statistics for the Commonwealth contain
cause-of-death statistics and infant mortality for municipalities in Massachusetts over the period
1901-1934. Second, data on TB cases from the years 1906-1934 are digitized from the “Annual
Report of the State Board of Health of Massachusetts.” From the “Annual report on the vital
statistics of Massachusetts” we define two categories of causes of death as controls: 1), Infectious
diseases, composed of death by diphteria and croup, whooping cough, bronchitis, pneumonia,
measles, erysipelas, and meningitis and 2), non-communicable diseases, composed of deaths by
stroke and appendicitis. Finally, we have obtained the following municipality level variables as
controls from the full-count US Census microdata in 1910 (Ruggles et al., 2015): share aged
0-14, share aged 45-59, share aged 60 and above, share foreign born, share literate, and average
occupational based earning scores.
       We obtain a balanced panel of 267 municipalities for pulmonary TB death rates and 92
municipalities when considering municipalities with a population between 5,000 and 50,000
inhabitants in 1915 as used in the analysis. We refer the reader to Figure 1 and Appendix Table
A.1 for an overview of exactly which municipalities are included.13 For infant mortality the data
are only available for 47 municipalities and this is reduced to 36 when we impose the restriction
on population size. We generally use log rates and the smallest rate larger than zero when
  13

deaths are equal to zero to obtain a balanced panel. We interpolate to avoid gaps in the data.14
       Regarding the quality of cause-of-death statistics for Massachusetts, Shryock (1957) observes
that “Massachusetts led the way in the United States when, about 1870, it inaugurated the first
reliable registration of deaths and their causes.” The main features of an adequate system had
been adopted and put into operation by 1890. Only one or two percent of the births and deaths
that occurred in the state were not registered. Moreover, the returns of the causes of death
had attained a high degree of accuracy and reliability according to Gutman (1959). Even so,
this does not mean that the data contained no errors. During the period of the Demonstration,
some causes of death from bronchitis were mistaken for deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis
(Monograph No. 3, 1918: p.15): “It is unquestionable that the work of the Demonstration will
lead to better diagnosis of tuberculosis, and an increase in the registered mortality from the
disease reasonably might be expected if this factor alone were operative.”15


4        Empirical strategy
As our aim is to isolate the effect of the Framingham Demonstration on TB and other causes
of death, we outline several empirical strategies designed to deal with the fact that the design
only has one treated unit as well as other empirical challenges. First, we apply synthetic control
estimators (SCE), which are typically applied when only one unit is treated. Specifically, we
use the SCE suggested by Abadie and Gardezaval (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010). Yet, this
method is known to deal inadequately with transitory shocks in the outcome (Powell, 2018). As
the TB mortality series for Framingham is much more volatile than the average TB mortality
for the control groups, we also apply a new SCE suggested by Doudchenko and Imbens (2016),
which better deals with transitory shocks. Both SCEs compare TB mortality in Framingham to
a “synthetic Framingham.” Second, we apply a difference-in-differences (DD) framework for
comparison. We note that the DD framework requires that Framingham was on a parallel trend
to the control group prior to treatment and is not designed to deal with transitory shocks to the
outcome.
  14
     The difference-in-differences results are robust to dropping missing values due to log transformations of zero
deaths instead of this procedure. The synthetic control estimates require balanced panels.
  15
     For the case of Denmark, Egedesø et al. (2017) emphasize that methods of diagnosis, such as X-rays and
tuberculin tests, were in existence by 1910. The problem of misclassifying TB as bronchitis is mentioned but was
mainly an issue in the 1890s according to these authors. In the case of Framingham, the use of X-rays was not
common prior to the Demonstration, and as noted above this was uncommon for smaller municipalities. Also,
tuberculin testing does not seem to have been common.


                                                       10
    The SCE provide a treatment effect in the case of a single treated unit and a number of
control units, with pre-treatment and treatment periods being observed for all units (Doudchenko
and Imbens, 2016). Consider the following panel data setting with N + 1 cross-sectional units
observed in time periods t = 1, . . . , T . Each of the cross-sectional units in each of the time
periods is characterized by a pair of potential outcomes, Yi,t (0) and Yi,t (1), of the control
and treatment, respectively, where the causal effects at the unit and time level are given by
τi,t = Yi,t (1) − Yi,t (0) for i = 0, 1, . . . , N and t = 1, . . . , T . Units i = 1, . . . , N are control units,
which do not receive the treatment in any of the time periods. Unit 0 receives the control
treatment in periods 1, . . . , T0 and the active treatment in periods t = T0 + 1, . . . , T0 + T1 . We
are interested in the treatment effects of unit 0 denoted by τ0,t . Let treatment received during
the active treatment period be the indicator, Wi,t . Hence, we observe:

    We are interested in the pair Yt,post (1) and Yt,post (0), but we only observe Yt,post (1). The
problem lies in imputing Yt,post (0) using the three different sets of control outcomes Yc,post (0),
Yt,pre (0), and Yc,pre (0), and then using the imputed values to estimate the causal effect, τ0,t .
Setting aside covariates, Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) show that the estimators we use in this
paper share a common linear structure for imputing Y0,post (0), here shown for the post-treatment
period, χ:

where the imputed outcome is a linear combination of the control units with intercept µ and
weight ωi for unit i. The methods differ in the way the parameters µ and ω = (ω1 , . . . , ωN )0 are
chosen based on the aforementioned three sets of control outcomes. One strategy might be to


                                                       11
estimate (µ, ω) by regressing Yt,pre (0) on Yc,pre (0), but this is only possible if T0 > N + 1, which
in many application is not the case. This highlights the need for regularization or restrictions
on µ and ω which the three methods used in this paper achieve in different ways.
   The SCM method of Abadie et al. (2010) imposes the following restrictions: no intercept,
µ = 0; the weights sum to one, N
                              P
                                i=1 ωi = 1; and no-negative weights, ωi ≥ 0 , i = 1, . . . , N .

The weights, ω̂ SCM , are chosen such that they minimize the squared distance between the
pre-treatment outcome and possibly a set of pre-treatment covariates for the treated unit and
the weighted control units.16
       Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) suggest a method of estimating equation (1) using regular-
ization of the parameters, allowing the researcher to impose fewer restrictions on the parameters.
Compared to the SCM of Abadie et al. (2010), we relax the restriction of non-negative weights
and that the weights sum to one, but we keep the restriction of no intercept. Imposing that
the weights sum to one and no intercept requires that the treated unit is not systematically
smaller or larger than the control units. Yet, we allow for more flexibility compared to the
SCM by relaxing the restriction that the weights sum to one. Assuming non-negative weights is
important for the SCM to regularize estimation results with many control units and could be
justified if raw correlations between the treatment and control units are positive but positive raw
correlations do not imply that the partial correlations are positive and lifting the restriction may
improve out-of-sample prediction; see Doudchenko and Imbens (2016). The weights ω̂ DI are
chosen using Elastic net regularization, which implies regressing Yt,pre (0) on Yc,pre (0) including
  16
    Specifically, the weights ω̂ SCM are chosen to match the pre-treatment outcomes and a set of pre-treatment
covariate matrices (Xt , Xc ) of dimensions M × N , by solving:

a loss term consisting of the weighted L1 norm and squared L2 norm of ω DI .17 We refer to this
SCE as the Elastic net estimator. We follow Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) and do not include
additional predictor variables, as they tend to play a minor role in practice.
       For inference both Abadie et al. (2010) and Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) suggest using
permutation inference. An empirical p-value is obtained from the position of the estimated
treatment effect of the actual treated unit within a distribution of counterfactual treatment
effects. This distribution is formed by calculating a counter factual treatment effect for each
control city.
       The Elastic net estimator has the advantage of imposing a more flexible set of restrictions
than the SCM and the DD estimators. The fewer imposed restrictions on the weights compared
to the SCM and DD estimators will generally lead to a better pre-treatment match between the
synthetic unit and the treated unit, a match on which the consistency properties of the SCEs
are derived (Abadie et al., 2010).
       Finally, we apply a DD framework, comparing TB in Framingham to other municipalities
before and after the Demonstration started. Compared to the SCEs the DD estimator imposes
the restrictions of equal, non-negative weights that sum to one for the control municipalities.
The estimation equation takes the following form:

                                       Yi,t = βDemoi,t + φi + φt + εi,t ,                                      (3)

where Yi,t is the dependent variable in municipality i in year t, Demoi,t is an indicator switching
on in 1917 for Framingham, and φi and φt are municipality and year fixed effects respectively.
The standard errors, εi,t , are clustered at the municipality level in order to take possible serial
correlation into account. However, this approach is problematic as our framework includes
only one treated unit, Framingham (Conley and Taber, 2011). For this reason, we will rely
on empirical p-values as suggested by Conley and Taber (2011) akin to the inference method
suggested by Abadie et al. (2010) and Doudchenko and Imbens (2016) outlined above.

Elastic net regression, including both a Ridge, kω DI k22 , and a Lasso, kω DI k1 , regularization term. The tuning
parameters are chosen by k-fold cross validation to be the set that minimizes the cross validation error; see
Doudchenko and Imbens (2016).

       The inference problem of the DD estimator can be solved by permutation inference (Conley
and Taber, 2011). Yet, the assumption of parallel trends, which we test by event studies, can
be violated if the single treated unit differs substantially from the control units, and the DD
estimator is not well suited to handle transitory shocks. The SCE strategies are more likely to
improve the match on both the trend and volatility in the pre-treatment period.


5        Results
5.1       The original results of the Framingham monographs
The final publication in the Framingham series of monographs (Monograph No. 10, 1924)
provides an overview of the most important findings of the Demonstration. This includes an
evaluation of TB mortality in Framingham, compared to the original seven Massachusetts
control municipalities: Chicopee, Clinton, Fitchburg, Gardner, Marlborough, Milford, and North
Adams. To evaluate the original findings, we start by investigating the similarity between
Framingham and the original control municipalities. Table 1 reports balancing tests comparing
TB mortality and TB case rates, infectious and non-communicable disease mortality rates,
population size, share aged 0-14, 45-59, and 60 and above, share literate and foreign born, and
income per worker (occupational earnings score). The variables are measured for 1910, as most
are derived using Census data in 1910. Investigating the table, we observe that in particular the
population size and structure appear different in Framingham compared to the average of the
control municipalities. Also, the TB case rate and the share of literate residents are smaller in
Framingham.18

                                           [Table 1 about here]

       Data on TB mortality before and after the Demonstration from the original evaluation makes
it possible to calculate DD estimates. The original TB mortality rates in Framingham and the
MA control municipalities are shown in columns (1) and (2) of Table 2.19 We calculate the DD
  18
     With eight observations formal tests of differences in means are likely not valid.
  19
     It is worthwhile to notice that the TB mortality rates for Framingham, reported in the summary report, are
based on whether the deceased had any contact with the town of Framingham within a certain time period,
which then includes both residents and non-residents. It was not possible to do a similar detailed correction
for the control municipalities, although an effort was made to correct the mortality on a residence basis (see
Monograph No. 10, 1924). Our analysis is based on municipality tabulated mortality data, and such adjustments
are, therefore, impossible.

estimates in column (3) of Table 2 by obtaining the difference in TB mortality rates between
Framingham and the control municipalities for the years 1917, . . . , 1923 and then subtract
the corresponding difference in average TB mortality rate during the pre-Demonstration years
1906 to 1917. We report the effect in percent in column (4). The estimates show that the
Demonstration reduced the TB mortality rate during the entire Demonstration period with an
average effect of 36 percent. Yet, there are reasons to believe that this naive DD estimate should
not be given a causal interpretation which is why we focus on the methods outlined above.

                                       [Table 2 about here]


5.2    Synthetic control results
Figure 2 illustrates why we turn to Synthetic Control Estimators. In Panel A, we compare the
development of the TB mortality rate in Framingham to the seven original control municipalities.
Both series exhibit a downward trend prior to the beginning of the Demonstration. Yet, the
TB rate in the control municipalities appears to be trending slightly upwards in the years
immediately before the Demonstration. In panel B, we compare the TB mortality rate in
Framingham to the average rate in the extended sample of 92 municipalities. Again, we observe
a declining trend in the TB mortality with a plateau before the Demonstration. In both Panels A
and B, we observe that the TB mortality rate exhibits high volatility in Framingham. Together
with non-parallel trends, higher volatility could obscure the potential effect of the Demonstration
in a naive DD estimate.
   To implement the SCM, we include predictors to establish which municipalities receive
weight in the synthetic control. These include the mean of the dependent variable over the
pre-treatment period and always the mean over the pre-treatment period of the log death rates
of: TB, infectious diseases, non-infectious diseases, and the log TB case rate. We also include
the following variables from the 1910 census: log population, share aged 0-14, 45-59, and 60
above, share of foreign born, share literate, and log occupational earnings score per worker,
which provides a good pre-treatment fit.
   Figure 3 depicts the estimates from the SCM strategy. We also note that the weights
assigned to municipalities in the donor pool are reported in Appendix Table A.2, and Table A.3
reports the balance between the synthetic control and the treated unit. The SCM inherently
assigns weights to few units, and interestingly none of these units are the original control


                                                15
municipalities. The weights assigned to the nine municipalities are: Franklin (0.132), Hingham
(0.030), Ipswich (0.063), Monson (0.075), Montague (0.058), Orange (0.213), Swampscott (0.039),
Wareham (0.223), and Wellesley (0.167) with the weights reported in parentheses. The remaining
municipalities are assigned zero weight. Considering next the balance between the synthetic unit
and Framingham in Table A.3, we observe that the synthetic control unit resembles Framingham
along most of the dimensions, although Framingham appears to have a larger population and a
smaller share aged 0-14. Turning to the synthetic control estimates in Figure 3, the synthetic
unit matches the TB mortality rate in Framingham quite well, though not perfectly, in the
pre-Demonstration period from 1901 to 1916 in Panel A. Panel B shows the effect of the
Demonstration as the difference between the synthetic unit and Framingham represented by a
solid line. Panel B also shows Placebo results for the rest of the sample, which are displayed
as shaded lines. After the Demonstration started in 1917, the results suggest that there was
little effect of the Demonstration. Thus, the SCM estimation cannot confirm the negative effect
on TB mortality found in the original study. In fact, the Demonstration had no statistically
significant effect according to the empirical p-values reported in Panel C.

                                     [Figure 3 about here]

   The fact that the SCM does not find an effect of the Demonstration can be an artifact of
the highly volatile nature of TB mortality and difficulties in matching the pre-Demonstration
mortality changes. Although the match between Framingham and the synthetic unit in Figure 3
is indeed improved compared to the match between the MA municipalities and Framingham in
Panel B of Figure 2, the volatility is not captured perfectly. Theoretically, the Elastic net SCE
of Doudchenko and Imbens (2016), described in section 4, can provide a better pre-treatment
match between the treated and the synthetic unit with fewer imposed restrictions. This is
evident in Figure 4 which presents the results of using the Elastic net regressions. In Panel A,
we observe a much better pre-treatment match between the synthetic unit and Framingham,
but as is apparent it does not change the conclusion. Judging by both the point estimates
of the effect displayed in Panel B and the statistical significance in Panel C, we fail to find
discernible effects of the Demonstration. The Elastic net regression assigns positive weights
to 32 municipalities and negative weights to 12 municipalities; see Appendix Table A.4. 11
municipalities receive weights of 0.05 or larger in absolute magnitude: Rockland (0.122), Walpole
(0.094), Newburyport (0.068), Hudson (0.065), Great Barrington (−0.055), Braintree (−0.055),

                                               16
Athol (0.055), Wakefield (0.054), Concord (−0.051), Easthampton (0.050), and Abington (0.050).
   In Appendix Figures A.8 and A.9, we consider a sample that excludes municipalities within
50 kilometers of Framingham to address concerns about spillovers being important for our
conclusions. For both SCEs, we still do not find that the Demonstration reduced TB mortality
in Framingham.

                                       [Figure 4 about here]

   As described in Section 2, the first year of the Demonstration was devoted to primary research
activities, and a sickness survey of the population was carried out. Along with the establishment
of the consultation service, this increased the number of known TB cases according to Monograph
No. 10 (1924). Hence, we now turn to investigating the effect of the Demonstration on the
number of active TB cases per year, which we expect to increase in the initial years. The
development of the log TB case rate in Framingham and the MA sample is depicted in Appendix
Figure A.1. Figures 5 and 6 show SCM and Elastic net estimation results on the log TB
mortality case rate, respectively. We use the same predictors for the case rate in the SCM
estimation as we did for the TB mortality rate. The SCM estimator achieves a good balance for
the predictors and assigns weight to four municipalities; see Appendix Tables A.5 and A.6 for
the weights and balance of the predictors. The data on TB cases are available only from 1906,
and the SCM estimator achieves a somewhat poor fit in the pre-treatment period; see Panels A
and B of Figure 5. Inspecting the path of Framingham and the synthetic unit in the first years
of the Demonstration in Panel A, we observe what could be considered a spike in TB cases in
the initial year, consistent with the narrative in the monographs. However, the volatility of the
effect in Panel B before and after the start of the Demonstration likely favors the null hypothesis
of no effect, which is also the conclusion to be drawn from the empirical p-values reported in
Panel C. The Elastic net estimation on the log TB mortality case rate in Figure 6 performs
much better in matching the synthetic unit and Framingham in the pre-Demonstration period.
The Elastic net estimator uses 26 of the municipalities to construct the synthetic unit with a
positive weight placed on 23 of the municipalities and a negative weight placed on three; see
Appendix Table A.7. Investigating Panels A and B of Figure 6 reveals a spike in the initial year
of the Demonstration and a spike in 1924-25, the two years after the end of the Demonstration.
Panel C shows that only the initial spike in 1917 is significant at the 10 percent level, although
the spike in 1925 is close to being significant at this level. These findings are consistent with the

                                                 17
narrative in the monographs, where the initial health survey uncovered a larger rate of TB in the
population of Framingham. The spike in 1924-25 could be consistent with the Demonstration
ceasing its activities in 1923, but the p-values and the lack of evidence of a change in the TB
mortality after the Demonstration had ended casts doubt upon this interpretation.

                                        [Figure 5 about here]
                                        [Figure 6 about here]

       While the Demonstration had a particular focus on controlling TB, the public health
activities carried out by the Demonstration might have improved the general health environment
in Framingham as well. Along with the TB activities of the Demonstration infant welfare
services with home visiting nurses were expanded. Monograph No. 10 (1924) highlights that the
infant mortality rate was down by 40 percent compared to 1916 and that the crude death rate
was down by 9 percent in the last two years of the Demonstration compared to 1907 to 1916.
To investigate this further, we evaluate the effect of the Demonstration on infant mortality and
total mortality rate. Unfortunately, in both cases data are only available for 38 municipalities;
e.g. Appendix Figures A.2 and A.3 for a depiction of development of infant mortality rate and
the total mortality rate in Framingham and the municipalities in the MA sample, respectively.
We note that both trend downwards and that the total mortality rate is less volatile than, for
example, the TB mortality rate.20
       First, we consider the results for infant mortality in Figures 7 and 8, which present the
SCM and Elastic net results on the log infant mortality rate. The SCM includes the same
predictors as previously as well as the log infant mortality rate. The weights assigned to control
municipalities and the balance of the predictor variables can be found in Appendix Tables A.8
and A.9. The estimator achieves a good balance of the predictors but performs badly in the
pre-treatment period with a somewhat poor fit between the synthetic unit and Framingham,
and we cannot establish an effect of the Demonstration on the log infant mortality rate with
the SCM. Turning to the Elastic net results, the pre-treatment match between the synthetic
unit and Framingham performs much better, but despite a more convincing fit we still cannot
establish an effect on infant mortality. For the weights assigned to the control municipalities in
Elastic net estimation, see Appendix Table A.10.
  20
    The mortality rates in Framingham and the MA municipalities sample trend nicely together, both with a
spike in 1918 due to the Spanish Flu.



                                                   18
                                      [Figure 7 about here]
                                      [Figure 8 about here]

   We next investigate the effects on the total mortality rate. Figures 9 and 10 show the SCE
and Elastic net results, respectively. Like in the case of infant mortality, the SCE do not achieve
the best pre-treatment match. Two years, 1920 and 1921, display a significantly positive effect
at the 10 percent level, but the poor pre-treatment match of the synthetic unit and Framingham
calls the validity of the inference into question. For the weights assigned and the balance of the
pre-treatment predictors, see Appendix Tables A.11 and A.12.
   The Elastic net estimate on the log mortality rate in Figure 10 achieves a better match
between the synthetic unit and Framingham in the pre-treatment period. The weights assigned
to the control municipalities by the Elastic net estimator can be found in Appendix Table A.13.
Focusing on the path of mortality in Framingham and the synthetic unit in Panel A and the net
effect in Panel B, we see that the spike in mortality in 1918 around the Spanish Flu, is larger in
Framingham than in the control municipalities and is significant at the 10 percent level. Apart
from the jump in mortality in 1918, the mortality in Framingham and the synthetic unit trend
together in the Demonstration period, without us being able to establish an effect. However,
the rates diverge significantly with a fall in mortality in Framingham from 1930 and onwards.
We are hesitant to attribute this fall in mortality to an effect of the Demonstration, as the last
year of treatment was in 1924.

                                      [Figure 9 about here]
                                      [Figure 10 about here]


5.3    Difference-in-differences results
Next, we present DD results of a comparison to the results of the SCE. We start by presenting
balance tests between Framingham and the MA municipalities and a number of event studies.
   Table 3 presents balance tests comparing Framingham and the MA municipalities across
the same variables as used in the balance tests of the original control municipalities in Table 1.
Compared to the latter, formal statistical testing of differences in means is possible with a larger
sample of 92 observations. We do not observe a difference in means across the TB mortality
rate, income per worker, and share of foreign born between Framingham and the average of
the MA municipalities. However, we find significant differences in the disease environment, TB

                                                19
case rate, share literate, and the population structure, leading us to conclude that there are
differences between Framingham and the control municipalities.

                                      [Table 3 about here]

   Now, we turn to event studies on log TB mortality rate, log TB case rate, log infant mortality
rate, and log total mortality rate depicted in Appendix Figures A.4 to A.7. The event-studies
enable us to assess the validity of the parallel-trends assumption and how we should interpret
the DD results.
   From the event study on TB mortality, we observe that the estimates are volatile both before
and after the start of the Demonstration. There is no particular trend or jump in the estimates
indicating an effect of the Demonstration. Perhaps a rise in the TB mortality after the end of
the Demonstration in 1923, but the coefficients are reverting to around zero. From the event
study on TB cases, we observe less volatility in the pre-treatment period with a jump in the case
rate in 1917 when the Demonstration started and in 1925, two years after the Demonstration
ended. In the last period, the coefficients are estimated to be around zero. In the event study
on infant mortality, we observe a high volatility of the estimates in the period of investigation.
There is an increasing trend in the coefficients on the infant mortality rate throughout the
sample period. Lastly, the event study on total mortality shows a positive trend in the estimated
coefficients prior to the Demonstration, a large and negative estimate in the first period of the
Demonstration, which reverts to a zero estimate in 1918. The event studies and the balance
tests suggest that DD estimation will be neither appropriate nor informative with the type of
estimation problem that we face.

                                      [Table 4 about here]

   We next present DD results in Panel A of Table 4 of estimating equation (3) on the log
TB mortality rate, log TB case rate, log infant mortality rate, and log total mortality rate.
In Panel B we present estimation results with the same dependent variables, but with the
intervention indicator split into two – one indicating Framingham during the Demonstration
(1917-1923), another indicating Framingham after the Demonstration (1924-1934). In brackets
we show empirical p-values from permutation inference. Clustered standard errors are reported
in parentheses, but we emphasize that these are not valid; see the discussion in Section 4. Hence,
inference should be done using only the empirical p-values.

                                               20
    The results on TB mortality shown in column (1) in Table 4 display no significant effect of
the Demonstration in neither Panel A nor B. Although not close to being statistical significant,
the point estimate of the effect during the Demonstration in Panel B shows a 13.5 percent
decline in TB. In comparison, the numbers in the Framingham monographs suggested an effect
of 36 percent.
    The estimates on TB cases in column (2) are large but statistically insignificant. Panel A
shows a increase of 26 percent in the case rate, and Panel B shows an increase of 25 percent
during the Demonstration and an increase of 8.5 percent after. This is consistent with the
results of the SCEs showing a spike in the case rate in the first year of the Demonstration.
    Column (3) presents the results on infant mortality. The point estimates are large but not
significant. In Panel A, the point estimate suggests that the Demonstration increased the infant
mortality rate by 40.6 percent and with a p-value of 10.5, which is borderline significant. In
Panel B, the estimates show an increase of 18.2 percent in the Demonstration period, with a
very large increase of 44.8 percent after the Demonstration ended. In the event study of the
infant mortality rate, we observed positively trending estimates, which potentially explain these
results.
    Finally, in column (4) we also find a statistically, insignificant effect on the total mortality
rate. The point estimate in Panel A suggests an increase of 6.8 percent in the mortality rate,
and Panel B shows an increase of 10.7 percent during the Demonstration, and 3.5 percent after.
Thus, the DD estimates cannot establish any effects of the Demonstration on total mortality.


6     Conclusion
This research has challenged the conventional view that the Framingham Demonstration suc-
ceeded in reducing TB mortality. Contrary, to the beliefs of the National Association and
historical accounts, the systematic evidence we offer suggests that the Demonstration cannot be
leveraged as evidence for the success of pre-antibiotic era health policies.
    The implication of these findings is that the Framingham Demonstration was not as successful
as believed by the National Association and would tend to support McKeown’s (1976) contention
that public health policy was not a decisive factor in the reduction of TB mortality. Yet,
Hollingsworth (2014) presents evidence that sanatoria may have played some role for TB
mortality in North Carolina through health education and isolation, and Egedesø et al. (2017)


                                                21
show that personalized information on how to avoid spreading TB reduced mortality in Danish
cities. What is true about the Framingham Demonstration is that it relied very much on general
health education through the health letters, and none of the monographs emphasize a role
for more personalized information for the TB patients. This could be one reason that the
Demonstration was not as effective as hitherto believed.
   The bottom line for our knowledge on the effectiveness of efforts to reduce TB in the past is
that this seems to have depended on the intervention. We leave it for future research to expand
our knowledge on which other past interventions were effective.

Note: This table reports balancing tests where we compare the Massachusetts municipalities with a population of between 5,000
and 50,000 inhabitants to Framingham. The variables compared across are: TB mortality rate; TB case rate; infectious disease
mortality rate excluding TB; non-communicalble disease mortality rate; population size; share aged 0-14; share aged 45-59; share
aged 60 or above; share literate; share foreign born; and income per worker using earnings score. In the last column we report
p-values from tests of differences in means between the MA municipalities and Framingham. They are obtained by regressing the
variable in question on a constant and a Framingham indicator using robust inference. All variables are measured in 1910.

Note: The table reports least squares estimates. In Panels A and B the dependent variable is log TB mortality per 1,000 in column
(1); log TB cases per 1,000 in column (2); log infant mortality per 1,000 in column (3); and log total mortality per 1,000 in column
(4). The panel is the Massachusetts municipalities with a population of between 5,000 and 50,000 inhabitants. In Panel A the causes
of death are regressed on an indicator for Framingham turning on when the Demonstration starts in 1923. In Panel B the causes
of death are regressed on an indicator for Framingham turned on in the Demonstration years 1917 to 1923 and an indicator for
Framingham turned on after the Demonstration ended in 1924. All regressions include municipality and year fixed effects. P-values
based upon permutation inference suggested by Conley and Taber (2011) are reported in brackets. Robust standard errors clustered
at the municipality level are in parentheses.

Note: This figure shows the estimation results of the SCM on log TB mortality per 1,000, where the predictors of the log TB rate
in the pre-Demonstration period (1901-1916) are: log TB mortality rate (1901-1916), log TB case rate (1906-1916), log infectious
disease rate (1901-1916), log non-infectious disease rate (1901-1916), log population (1901-1916), share aged 0-14 (1910), share aged
45-59 (1910), share aged 60 and above (1910), share foreign born (1910), share literate (1910), and log occupational earnings score
per worker (1910). The synthetic control is constructed from the municipalities in Massachusetts with populations from 5,000 and
up to 50,000 inhabitants. Panel A shows the path of Framingham’s log TB mortality rate, along with the (counterfactual) synthetic
path. The in-place placebo effects, along with the “true” Demonstration effect, and the resulting (empirical) p-values are displayed
in Panels B and C, respectively. Placebo municipalities in the pool for inference are excluded if their pre-treatment RMSPE is
greater than two times the pre-treatment RMSPE of the synthetic Framingham. The vertical red line indicate the start of the
Demonstration in 1917. See Appendix Tables A.2 and A.3 for the weights assigned to the municipalities forming the synthetic
control and the balance between the synthetic control and the treated unit before 1917, respectively.

Note: This figure shows the estimation results of the SCM on log infant mortality per 1,000, where the predictors of the log
infant mortality rate in the pre-Demonstration period (1901-1916) are: log infant mortality rate (1901-1916), log TB mortality
rate (1901-1916), log TB case rate (1906-1916), log infectious disease rate (1901-1916), log non-infectious disease rate (1901-1916),
log population (1901-1916), share aged 0-14 (1910), share aged 45-59 (1910), share aged 60 and above (1910), share foreign
born (1910), share literate (1910), and log occupational earnings score per worker (1910). The synthetic control is constructed
from the municipalities in Massachusetts with populations from 5,000 and up to 50,000 inhabitants. Panel A shows the path of
Framingham’s log infant mortality rate, along with the (counterfactual) synthetic path. The in-place placebo effects, along with
the “true” Demonstration effect and the resulting (empirical) p-values are displayed in Panels B and C, respectively. Placebo
municipalities in the pool for inference are excluded if their pre-treatment RMSPE is greater than two times the pre-treatment
RMSPE of the synthetic Framingham. The vertical red line indicates the start of the Demonstration in 1917. See Appendix Tables
A.8 and A.9 for the weights assigned to the municipalities forming the synthetic control and the balance between the synthetic
control and the treated unit before 1917, respectively.

Note: This figure shows the estimation results of the SCM on log TB mortality per 1,000, where the predictors of the log TB rate
in the pre-Demonstration period (1901-1916) are: log TB mortality rate (1901-1916), log TB case rate (1906-1916), log infectious
disease rate (1901-1916), log non-infectious disease rate (1901-1916), log population (1901-1916), share aged 0-14 (1910), share
aged 45-59 (1910), share aged 60 and above (1910), share foreign born (1910), share literate (1910), and log occupational earnings
score per worker (1910). The synthetic control is constructed from the municipalities in Massachusetts with populations from 5,000
and up to 50,000 inhabitants, excluding municipalities within a radius of 50 kilometers of Framingham. Panel A shows the path
of Framingham’s log TB mortality rate, along with the (counterfactual) synthetic path. The in-place placebo effects, along with
the “true” Demonstration effect, and the resulting (empirical) p-values are displayed in Panels B and C, respectively. Placebo
municipalities in the pool for inference are excluded if their pre-treatment RMSPE is greater than two times the pre-treatment
RMSPE of the synthetic Framingham. The vertical red line indicate the start of the Demonstration in 1917. See Appendix Table
A.14 and A.15 for the weights assigned to the municipalities forming the synthetic control, and the balance between the synthetic
control and the treated unit before 1917, respectively.
