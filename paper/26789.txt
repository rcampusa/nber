Transit infrastructure is a critical asset for economic activity yet costly to build in dense urban
environments. We measure the benefit of the Second Avenue Subway extension in New York
City, the most expensive urban transit infrastructure project in recent memory, by analyzing local
real estate prices which capitalize the benefits of transit spillovers. We find 8% price increases,
creating $6 billion in new property value. Using cell phone ping data, we document substantial
reductions in commuting time especially among subway users, offering a plausible mechanism
for the price gains. The increase in prices reflects both higher rents and lower risk. Infrastructure
improvements lower the riskiness of real estate investments. Only 30% of the private value
created by the subway is captured through higher property tax revenue, and is insufficient to
cover the cost of the subway. Targeted property tax increases may help governments capture
more of the value created, and serve as a useful funding tool.

1    Introduction
Adequate infrastructure is an essential input into economic growth. In developing coun-
tries, the demands from economic development and a rising population drive investment
needs in transportation, power, water, telecom, and real estate assets. In the developed
world, aging infrastructure needs maintenance and upgrades as urban density grows and
technologies change. In 2015, the world spent $2.5 trillion on economic infrastructure in-
vestment, and $9.5 trillion on a broader asset definition that includes real estate, oil and
gas, mining, and social infrastructure. Yet, to keep pace with GDP growth, the world will
need to an invest an average of $3.7 trillion on economic infrastructure each year between
2017 and 2035, or 4.1% of GDP. This is nearly $70 trillion in aggregate projected future
spending, $20 trillion of which is in the United States (McKinsey, 2017). These massive
spending needs take place against a reality of fiscal constraints in the public sectors in
the U.S., Europe, and many other countries. Private capital will need to play a materially
larger role in infrastructure finance (Walter, 2016). Indeed, assets under management in
private equity funds specialized in infrastructure investments have already grown ten-
fold over the past decade to nearly $500 billion (Andonov, Kr¨
                                                             aussl, and Rauh, 2019).
    The largest category of economic infrastructure is transportation. The costs of build-
ing public transportation improvements are high. Subway investments, which offer the
prospect of carrying the most passengers in the densest urban locations have particularly
large costs. Nowhere is this more true than in the largest cities in the United States. Re-
cent extensions of the 7 and the Q subway lines in New York City cost about $2.5 billion
per mile. These high costs make it essential to measure the benefits of additional subway
construction in order to assess whether the expansion is worthwhile. This paper focuses
on measuring the benefits from the 2nd Avenue Subway (Q-train) expansion, the most
substantial investment in public subway infrastructure in the United States over the past
several decades.
    Prior literature has identified several potential benefits of subway construction projects.
New transportation lines can improve access to workplaces and amenities due to shorter
commuting times (Kahn and Baum-Snow, 2000, 2005; Severen, 2018), which in turn can
boost labor force participation (Black, Kolesnikova, and Taylor, 2014), reduce traffic con-
gestion on roads and other public transportation, and reduce pollution (Anderson, 2014).
Other associated benefits of new transit linkages include improved urban amenities such
as increased retail presence (Kahn, 2007), noise and crime reductions around stations
(Bowes and Ihlanfeldt, 2001), and less drunk driving (Jackson and Owens, 2011). These
diffuse benefits are often difficult to measure directly, complicating a straightforward


                                              1
cost-benefit calculation. The public return to infrastructure investment, defined narrowly
as the user fees net of operational expenditures and more broadly to include the incre-
mental property, sales, and labor income tax revenues, captures only a part of the to-
tal benefit of infrastructure investment because it ignores the positive externalities that
the infrastructure generates for the private sector. Failure to appropriately account for
private-sector benefits may result in important infrastructure investments remaining un-
funded.
   Our analysis makes progress on the measurement of the benefits of infrastructure im-
provements in two ways. First, we provide novel estimates on the commuting time ben-
efits of subway construction using granular location data. Second, we then take advan-
tage of the fact that transportation infrastructure and real estate assets are complements;
as a result, real estate values in the vicinity of public transportation hubs capitalize the
present value of all future benefits that accrue to households and business from trans-
portation gains. To perform this calculation, we measure how residential and commercial
real estate asset values change after the extension of public transportation using granular
property transactions data.
   We pursue a difference-in-difference approach. We define geographical areas that are
"treated" by the subway extension. We compare the changes in real estate values in the
treated areas to the changes in real estate prices in the "control" areas in a difference-in-
difference setup. Our baseline treatment definition selects all properties in a rectangular
area between 59th and 100th streets and between First and Third Avenues (the "2nd Av-
enue corridor"). The control area is the rest of the Upper East Side (UES) of Manhattan,
the remaining properties between 59th and 100th streets between Fifth Avenue and the
East River. We consider three alternative treatment definitions. The second treatment is
defined as the area within a 0.3 mile walking distance from one of the three new stations
that were added as part of the subway expansion. The third treatment definition consid-
ers buildings whose distances to the nearest station on any subway line are reduced after
the opening of the new subway stations. The fourth treatment looks at the intersection of
the first three treatment definitions.
   The Q-line extension opened on January 1st 2017. We start the Post period four years
earlier, to capture the fact that there was little residual uncertainty over eventual subway
completion as early as 2013. Since real estate prices are forward-looking, they should an-
ticipate the benefits from the future subway extension. In a second specification, we break
up the pre-2013 period into the pre-2006 and the 2007­2013 periods. This specification al-
lows for six additional years of potential anticipation effects. It also captures potential
disamenities (noise, pollution, business disruption) from heavy construction, which was

                                             2
concentrated in 2007­2013.
   Our data combines deeds and property tax records from NYC's Department of Fi-
nance with unit and building characteristics scraped from StreetEasy, an online real estate
listing platform. Our final sample covers about 50,000 arms length transactions of condo
and coop units on the UES. From the same data source, we also collect rental listing in-
formation on about 100,000 rental units. We augment this sample with high-frequency
geolocation information from mobile phones, which allows us to track exact commute
lengths at the individual level, before and after the subway opening, as well as the mode
of commuting.
   We find compelling evidence that the 2nd Avenue Subway expansion led to strong
changes in commuting patterns. Using our benchmark difference-in-difference specifica-
tion, we find that residents in areas served by the new subway expansion experience a
decline in commute lengths of 3­5 minutes (7.5% reduction). These gains increase to 14
minutes among subway commuters. We find evidence that new migrants into the area,
who are likely to be marginal price setters in the real estate market, are disproportionately
likely to take the Q-train.
   We then link the subway expansion to a sizable increase in real estate values. Our
benchmark difference-in-difference specification estimates a 8.3% increase in real estate
values when comparing the prices ten years before 2013 to the prices six years after. Prices
on the 2nd Avenue corridor increase 11.2% relative to 2003­2006, with nearly half of this
gain (5.0%) manifesting during the construction period 2007­2013. The three alternative
treatment definitions result in similar point estimates: 5.7%, 6.0%, and 6.8% when com-
paring the post-period to the entire pre-period, and 8.2%, 7.9%, 7.3% when comparing the
post-period to the pre-2006 period.
   We also estimate specifications which control more finely for building amenity effects
through the use of building fixed effects or unit-specific characteristics through a repeat-
sales approach. Though smaller, the 2­6% price increases we find in these specifications
still suggest substantial value creation in the area around subway construction.
   We find evidence that larger and newer housing units experience a larger value gain.
We conjecture that one channel through which the subway created increases in real estate
values was the stimulus of real estate development. Building permit data confirms a pos-
itive housing supply response that is (at least directionally) consistent with this channel.
   Next, we ask whether the price increase reflects a cash flow or discount rate effect
(Campbell and Shiller, 1988). We collect asking rents, and unit and building characteris-
tics for rental apartment buildings from StreetEasy. Our sample contains about 100,000
rental units. Using the same difference-in-difference model as for sales, we also show

                                             3
that rents increase in response to subway construction. We go further and ask whether
infrastructure investment affects the expected return, the discount rate, of real estate in-
vestments.
   We find that about half of the price increase is due to changes in rents, and half is due to
changes in the price-rent ratio, a proxy for the (inverse of the) discount rate. This finding
is consistent with results in Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin (2006) that discount
rate variation drives U.S. residential real estate markets, and similar results in Plazzi,
Torous, and Valkanov (2010) for commercial real estate. Our contribution is to emphasize
that infrastructure improvements lower the riskiness of real estate investments. While
intuitive, this is a novel point in the literature.
   In the last part of the paper, we estimate the aggregate real estate value created by the
subway extension, and how much of that value flows back to government coffers in the
form of higher property taxes. This analysis proceeds in several steps. The first task is
to value the stocks of owner-occupied residential, renter-occupied residential, and com-
mercial real estate in the treatment area prior to the subway (as of 2012). To that end,
we combine our main data set on residential units that are sold or rented in our sample
period and on the total number of units in the building with a data set on property tax
assessments, and with our dynamic DiD estimation. Our approach estimates a $32 billion
aggregate valuation for owner-occupied residential, $27 billion for renter-occupied resi-
dential, and $12 billion for commercial real estate properties on the 2nd Avenue corridor
in 2012. Second, we apply our baseline 8.3% price increase estimate to the $71 billion in
aggregate property value, resulting in a $5.89 billion windfall to private real estate own-
ers. Third, we analyze how much of this value creation flows back to the government. To
the extent that the property tax system is able to recoup some of these expenses, this pro-
vides a natural mechanism for local governments to finance infrastructure investments.
However, there are good reasons to think that the local government captures only part
of the value created. Detailed analysis of property tax data shows that NYC recuperates
30.6% of the increase in market values in present value terms. This amounts to $1.8 bil-
lion in extra property tax revenue. As a result, though the subway generated more value
than the $4.5 billion cost of construction, this value largely accrues to private landowners,
rather than the city government. The city's own cost-benefit shortfall is $2.7 billion.
   This analysis motivates the possibility for additional value capture taxes which may
help recoup an additional component of the investment cost, and thereby make possible
additional public infrastructure investments. Cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong have suc-
cessfully employed such value capture in the past. Our findings are policy-relevant and
timely given ongoing debates in New York City on the future extension of the 2nd Avenue

Subway line, the repair of the L line, and the East Side access project. They also have rami-
fications for the broader debate on how to finance an upgrade to U.S. infrastructure assets
and how to provide new infrastructure in developing countries whose governments have
limited borrowing and taxation capacities. Given that infrastructure projects entail enor-
mous expenditures of public resources, it is essential to have a full accounting of the total
benefits resulting from these infrastructure expansions, which our work helps to provide.


Literature Review        Our paper relates to a large literature investigating the effectiveness
of infrastructure investments. Previous research has found a wide range of estimates for
the return on infrastructure investment, depending on the assumptions made on the ef-
ficiency of an expansion of the public capital stock, the strength of the crowd-out effect
on private investment, and the timing vis-`                                 ¨
                                          a-vis the business cycle (Cadot, Roller, and
Stephan, 2006; Andonov, Kr¨
                          aussl, and Rauh, 2019; Castells and Sol´
                                                                 e-Oll´
                                                                      e, 2005; Finken-
zeller, Dechant, and Sch¨
                        afers, 2010; Bom and Ligthart, 2014; Ramey, 2020). The uncer-
tainty over these estimates suggests that the approach of inferring the returns to infras-
tructure investment from real estate return is a useful complement to the traditional ap-
proach.
    Our paper also belongs to an active literature that studies the land or house price
capitalization of urban rail.1 Price premium estimates for real estate surrounding tran-
sit hubs typically range from 3% to 10%, with some outliers at the upper end of 40-45%.
Kahn (2007) finds that new pubic transit has the biggest impact on real estate prices when
the new transit connects an area to a vibrant downtown, which is the case for the New
York City 2nd Avenue subway expansion. A few studies have identified negative rela-
tionships between distance to transit stations and prices (Bowes and Ihlanfeldt, 2001; Pan
and Zhang, 2008), reflective of disamenities of transit stations (e.g. crowding, noise, and
crime). Our paper is the first to study the recent subway expansion in New York City.
The New York City subway system is one of the oldest and most widely used public
transit systems, and the one with the most stations. As argued, this expansion was the
most expensive per-mile expansion in U.S. transportation history. The urban density and
pre-existing transportation network make for an important and interesting context.
    We contribute further by investigating the interplay between the ownership market

(condos and coops) and the rental market. Our results indicate that infrastructure im-
provements affect both the cash flows and their riskiness, allowing us to connect to the
asset pricing literature on the role of cash flows and discount rates in the stock market
(Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Koijen and van Nieuwerburgh, 2011; Cochrane, 2011) and in
real estate markets (Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin, 2009; Plazzi, Torous, and Valka-
nov, 2010; Van Nieuwerburgh, 2019). We find that infrastructure investments increase
cash flows and lower the risk of real estate investments.
    A new literature, including Athey, Ferguson, Gentzkow, and Schmidt (2019), Chen,
Haggag, Pope, and Rohla (2019), and Chen and Rohla (2018), has begun to use rich geolo-
cation data from smart phone pings to track individual trajectories. Our paper is the first
to use this data to study commuting lengths. This data are uniquely well-suited to this
task because ping data allow us to capture actual commuting lengths, rather than the esti-
mated commuting lengths from surveys used in prior research (as in Couture, Duranton,
and Turner (2018)). Doing so allows us to quantify the transportation gains resulting from
the subway extension, which we then tie to complementary real estate valuation gains.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides institutional back-
ground. Section 3 contains the empirical specification. Section 4 discusses the data. Sec-
tion 5 analyzes our commuting results. The main real estate valuation results are in Sec-
tion 6. Section 7 contains the analysis on rents and price-rent ratios. Section 8 computes
the aggregate value creation from the subway extension and how much of it flows back
to the government. Section 9 concludes. The Appendix contains some auxiliary empirical
results.


2    Institutional Background
Elevated rail lines were formerly running on 2nd and 3rd Avenues in New York as a
part of citywide system of "el" trains operated by privately managed and jointly funded
companies. This network was gradually replaced with underground subways starting
in 1904. A 2nd Avenue Subway, in particular, was a major component of a subway ex-
pansion proposed in 1920 by the Independent Subway System (IND), a publicly owned
and operated managed entity. Ultimately, the IND was combined with two other private
companies and placed under government control. The elevated 2nd Avenue line was
torn down in 1942 in anticipation of a new underground 2nd Avenue Subway. However,
construction plans hit numerous difficulties across several decades, including the Great
Depression, World War II, and the NYC funding crisis of the 1970s, and remained a "pipe

dream."
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority started a new study exploring various op-
tions for the 2nd Avenue subway in 1997 and approved an environmental impact state-
ment in 2004. New York voters passed a crucial transportation bond issue to fund the
expansion in November 2005. The Department of Transportation authorized funding for
construction in 2006. Construction work on the line started in 2007. Construction of the
subway tunnel was completed in 2011. By 2013, it was clear that the end of construction
was on the horizon and a Community Information Center opened up on the UES. The
grand opening of the subway was on January 1, 2017. Figure 1 shows the timeline.
   Figure 2 highlights the subway line in the context of the local area. The Q-line runs for
8.5 miles, including the 1.8 mile stretch of the completed 2nd Avenue Subway extension
between 59th Street and 96th Street. The construction included three new subway stations
on 2nd Avenue at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street, as well as a subway tunnel
connection to the existing Q-line stop on 59th Street and Lexington Avenue. The total cost
of the 2 mile expansion project was $4.5 billion, making the expansion the most expensive
subway construction project per mile in history.2
   2 An interesting question, outside the scope of this article, is why construction was so expensive. An

investigation by the New York Times explores several possibilities. See https://www.nytimes.com/2017/
12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-construction-costs.html.

3     Empirical Specification

3.1   Baseline Definition of Treatment Areas
The key empirical challenge is that the value of real estate depends on a myriad of factors
beyond the opening of a new subway line. Other changes in the local economic environ-
ment may confound the effects from the transit improvements on real estate values. To
address this challenge, we conduct a differences-in-differences analysis, comparing val-
uations on the 2nd Avenue corridor before and after the subway extension, relative to
outcomes in a control group.
    In our baseline specification, we define the treatment group to be all the land parcels
between 59th street and 100th street and between First Avenue and Third Avenue, taking
the midpoint of the avenues as the demarcation line. This is what we call the 2nd Avenue
corridor. Our control group consists of three corridors that make up the rest of the UES.
The Lexington Avenue corridor is the collection of parcels between 59th street and 100th
street and between Third and Park Avenues. The Madison Avenue corridor is the collec-
tion of parcels between 59th street and 100th street and between Park and Fifth Avenues.
Its western border is Central Park. Finally, the York Avenue corridor is the collection of
parcels between 59th street and 100th street to the east of the midpoint of First Avenue.
Its eastern border is the East River.
    This choice of baseline treatment and control group is driven by a trade-off between
minimizing the treatment effect on the control group and maximizing the similarity in

                                             8
terms of common drivers of real estate valuations. By differencing out trends in real es-
tate values in the control group, we remove common drivers of real estate prices that
affect the entire area (UES) and isolate the effects of the subway extension. The Lexing-
ton Avenue corridor is geographically the closest to the 2nd Avenue and may be affected
the strongest by the neighborhood trends that affect real estate valuation on 2nd Avenue
other than the subway extension. However, the Lexington Avenue control group may also
be directly affected by the subway extension. Residents in the Lexington corridor benefit
from the new subway line, either because it directly shortens their commutes or because it
alleviates congestion on Manhattan's busiest line, the 4-5-6, which runs under Lexington
Avenue and parallel to the Q-line. The resulting improvement in transportation from the
2nd Avenue subway extension may affect real estate values in the Lexington Avenue cor-
ridor. Removing those effects tends to bias downward our estimate of the value created
by the subway extension. A countervailing effect that tends to bias our treatment effects
estimation upward is that the subway expansion may have made 2nd Avenue more com-
petitive in terms of attracting residential, retail, and other commercial tenants away from
Lexington Avenue. Residents living in the York Avenue corridor also potentially benefit
from the Q-line extension. Indeed, for most of them, the new 2nd Avenue subway sta-
tions are the closest ones. We consider York Avenue corridor residents to be in the control
group in our baseline specification because they are fairly far from the new subway sta-
tions. However, we study alternative treatment definitions in section 6.4 where properties
in the York Avenue corridor are part of the treatment group. In section 6.3, we explore
a specification where the Madison Ave corridor is the control group. Given its distance
from the subway and its socio-economic make-up, it is arguably unaffected by the Q-line
extension. This specification justifies our baseline choice of treatment and control groups.
   Panel A of Figure 3 indicates the buildings where we have at least one apartment
transaction in our sample. Apartments in treated buildings are colored in blue while
buildings in the control sample are in red. The large black dots indicate subway stations
on the UES, including the three new stops on the 2nd Avenue subway.
   A second research design question is where to draw the demarcation line between
the pre- and post-treatment periods. The subway went into operation on January 1st,
2017. While there was considerable uncertainty about the exact opening date until the
last minute, eventual project completion was long anticipated. Construction started in
April 2007. Tunnel excavation began in May 2010 and blasting concluded in March 2013.
In 2011, the original 2013 completion date was pushed back to December 2016. Forward-
looking developers and property owners willing to tolerate the inconvenience of the con-
struction project could capture some of the potential future benefits by acting prior to

              Panel A: Second Ave Corridor (Treat1)                       Panel B: Within 0.3 Miles (Treat2)




Panel C: Change in Distance to Nearest Station (Treat3)                        Panel D: Combination Treatment (Treat4)




Notes: Panel A shows treatment definition 1 which corresponds to properties that are on the 2nd Avenue Corridor defined as between
1st and 3rd Avenues. Panel B shows treatment 2 which consists of properties that are within 0.3 miles in walking distance of one of the
new Second Avenue stops. Panel C shows treatment 3 which captures properties with a reduction in distance to the nearest subway
station. Panel D shows treatment 4 which is the intersection of the first three treatments.



the subway opening. These anticipatory effects should be reflected in real estate prices,
which reflect the expected discounted value of future rents. In our benchmark analysis,
we strike a middle ground and take January 1st 2013 as the demarcation line between the
before and after. This allows for four years of anticipation effects prior to the inaugura-
tion of the new subway line. A subway community information center was opened in

                                                                 10
2013, signaling that project completion was no longer in doubt. This choice also provides
a large enough sample in the before and after period.


3.2    Empirical Specification
Our core empirical specifications are difference-in-difference specifications defined across
two dependent variables: commute times and real estate transaction prices. While tran-
sit expansions may have complicated impacts on real estate prices throughout the entire
transportation network, several aspects of our research setting argue for a more local ap-
proach. First, the 2nd Ave expansion did not cut across several pre-existing lines, but in-
stead jutted out as an additional spoke into a previously unserved neighborhood. Second,
the region of the UES that was affected by the construction does not have a substantial of-
fice presence nor major urban amenities that attract visitors. Instead, the area is predom-
inantly residential, and locals are able to use the subway to commute to work through a
faster route. These distinctive features of the subway construction justify a difference-in-
difference specification. While we expect general equilibrium effects on prices resulting
from a more complete infrastructure system to be small in our setting, such effects would
bias down our estimates, making our conclusions on value creation conservative.
   Our commuting regressions can be expressed as:

      yit =  + 1 · Treatmenti + 1 · Postit +  1 · Treatmenti × Postt + X it ·  +  it ,      (1)

in which yit represents commute time for a person i in seconds. The omitted pre-period
in this analysis refers to the period June 2016­Dec 2016; and the "Post" period refers to
the time after subway construction, from Jan 2017­Aug 2017. The resulting  1 coefficient
captures the impact of subway construction on commuting times.
   We also estimate a triple-interaction specification with an indicator for subway usage:

yit =  + 1 · Treatmenti + 1 · Postt +  1 · Treatmenti × Postt + X it ·                      (2)
      + 2 · Subwayit +  2 · Subwayit × Postt + 3 · Subwayit × Postt × Treatmenti +  it .

In this specification, a key coefficient is 3 , which captures the differential effect of being
in the treatment area, in the post period, for subway users.
   Our main specification for the real estate pricing regressions is:

   ln( pit ) =  + 1 · Treatmenti + 1 · Postit +  1 · Treatmenti × Postt + X it ·  +  it , (3)



                                              11
where pit reflects the transaction sale price of a unit i in period t. We consider a much
longer time span in our real estate analysis, with the pre-period making up January 2003­
December 2012; and our post-period January 2013­March 2019. The key parameter of
interest is  1 , which corresponds to the treatment effect corresponding to our various
treatment definitions (for instance, properties along the 2nd Avenue corridor), in the pe-
riod.
   To investigate the presence of additional anticipation effects, we also consider an em-
pirical specification using our real estate outcomes which splits the "Pre" period into two
subperiods: January 2003­December 2006 and January 2007­December 2012. We call the
latter period the Construction Period because it coincides with the period of heavy tunnel
blasting. In those specifications, real estate prices in the Construction and Post periods
are estimated relative to the omitted 2003­06 period. This specification is:

  ln( pit ) =  + 1 · Treatmenti + 1 · Postt +  1 · Treatmenti × Postt + X it · 
           + 2 · Construction Periodt +  2 · Treatmenti × Construction Periodt +  it .(4)

The additional parameter of interest is  2 , which corresponds to the relative price increase
in the construction period (2007­12) relative to the earlier period (2003­06). The coeffi-
cient is the net effect of early anticipatory price effects and disamenity effects resulting
from the construction.
   Our difference-in-difference analysis accounts for the level differences in prices be-
tween treatment and control areas. However, if there are changes over time in the average
characteristics of transacted properties which differ between treatment and control group,
then that could affect the estimate of the subway extension. Therefore, our main specifi-
cations will control for building and housing unit characteristics X it . We also consider a
specification that adds building fixed effects.
   We focus on whether we observe convergence in prices. If the value gap for the 2nd
Avenue corridor is driven by scarce access to public transportation options, we expect
price convergence after subway construction.
   To directly test for the presence of confounding variables, we also examine changes
in median income along the 2nd Ave corridor as well as other regions of the UES in Ap-
pendix Figure A1. We find that both treatment and control areas appear to be along paral-
lel trends in terms of income growth well prior to the subway's construction, going back
to 1990, and showing little differential change through subway construction. These fac-
tors argue against the idea that the subway's construction was motivated by differential
trends in the area, or that exposure to concurrent confounding factors such as gentrifica-


                                             12
tion may be otherwise biasing our results. This is consistent with Nobbe and Berechman
(2013), who argue that the 2nd Avenue subway project selection and completion was the
was largely determined by local politics rather than transport-economic considerations.


4      Data

4.1     Location Data
Mobile location data was obtained from VenPath--a global provider of compliant smart-
phone data. Our data provider aggregates information from approximately 120 million
smart phone users across the United States. Global Positioning System (GPS) data were
combined across applications for a given user to produce pings corresponding to time
stamp-location pairs. Ping data include both background pings (location data provided
while the application is running in the background) and foreground pings (activated
while users are actively using the application). Ping data provides nearly continuous-
time location information (every 1-3 seconds) throughout the day. Our sample period
covers June 2016­October 2017, an ideal time frame since the subway opened on January
1st, 2017, right in the middle of this time frame.
     To identify commuting lengths, we use the panel dimension of our mobile phone data.
We use a Microsoft open-source data set to define the physical footprint of buildings.3 We
isolate possible home locations by first selecting all nighttime pings by a building's users
(from midnight to 7am). We require that users have a minimum presence in the buildings
of three night-time pings on five different days. Then, to identify homes for these users,
we require that these users ping at possible home locations at least twice on two different
nights. We then pick the home location as the building in which individuals ping most
often over the sample. Similarly, we define possible work locations as the building in
which individuals ping most often between the hours of 10am­1pm and 2pm­7pm. We
select the building with the most frequent day-time ping activity as the work location.
This classification produces a list of home and work locations, from which we select those
with home locations on the UES.
     We define morning commute length as the time difference between the last ping ob-
served in the home location, and the first ping observed in the work location. Evening
commutes are similarly defined as the difference in time between the last ping observed
at work and the first ping observed at home. We require that commutes be at least 0.4 km
in distance, and so exclude individuals who work at home or have minimal commutes.
    3 See   https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints.


                                                 13
Commutes are expressed in seconds. The final sample contains 27,549 commutes. To
validate our sample coverage against the general population, we find a 89% correlation
between the mobile phone population of ZIP codes and the Census population in those
same ZIP codes. When we focus on commuters in the Census data and in our cell phone
data, we find a 82% correlation.
   We define a subway commuter as an individual who pings close to a subway stop on
either the Q line or the 4-5-6, and one other station in NYC during the commute time
window. We define a recent mover as a user whose home location is in the UES after
January 1, 2017 and elsewhere before.


4.2   Condo and Coop Sales Data
We build a new dataset of all residential transactions on New York City's UES from Jan-
uary 2003 until March 2019. The two primary data sources are the New York City deeds
records and StreetEasy.
   The deeds records have information on the the sale price, sale date, address, as well
as a tax ID (the BBL code). From StreetEasy we collect information on all past residential
real estate sales on the UES via web scraping. We add properties between 96th Street
and 100th Street, which StreetEasy considers to be part of East Harlem. We also eliminate
properties that are above 100th Street along Fifth Avenue, which StreetEasy considers to
be part of the UES.
   StreetEasy has apartment unit and building characteristics, which are absent in the
deeds records. We obtain the following building characteristics: exact street address,
latitude and longitude, year of construction of the building, and building amenities. The
amenity vector contains: doorman, bike room, gym, elevator, laundry room, concierge,
live-in super, pool, storage room, roof deck, children's playroom, parking. Based on the
exact location, we use Google Map's API to compute walking distance to Central Park,
a major amenity, and walking distance to Grand Central Terminal, a major employment
center.
   The unit characteristics we have are apartment unit name (e.g. 17A), the number of
bedrooms, number of bathrooms, an indicator variable for condo, an indicator variable
for coop, an indicator variable for studio, the square footage of the unit, and of course
the transaction date and the transaction price. We infer the floor of the unit based on the
apartment unit name.
   A text field in the StreetEasy data describes the transaction in more detail. Based on
the text field, we eliminate transactions that are commercial space, storage units, maid's


                                            14
rooms, parking spots, or garages. We also eliminate units that have zero bathrooms and
zero bedrooms but are not studios. Importantly, we remove all "sales" which are neither
reported as "sold" nor as "recorded closing." Cross-checking against the deed records
database reveals that these "sales" are not actual sales but merely removed listings.
   We express all transaction prices in real terms by scaling by the Consumer Price In-
dex based in December 2017. We then eliminate all transactions with a real price below
$400,000 and above $10 million. Transactions below $400,000 in 2017 dollars are unlikely
to be arms-length transactions for actual apartment units on the UES of Manhattan. Trans-
actions above $10 million are unlikely to be affected by the 2nd Avenue subway and dis-
tort sample averages. The final sample contains 44,299 transactions.

    Table 1 provides summary statistics from our data. The top panel reports properties
on the 2nd Avenue Corridor, which are treated according to our baseline treatment area
definition. The bottom panel reports properties in the baseline control group (Madison
Ave, Lexington Ave, and York Ave corridors). We have 17,161 sales in the treatment group
and 27,138 in the control group, so that 38.7% of transactions are treated observations. The
average property on 2nd Avenue costs $1.22 million, is about 1093 square feet large, costs
$1119 per sqft, has 1.6 bedrooms bathrooms, and is in a building that is 43 years old at the
time of transaction. The treatment group has 40% condos and 60% coops. Apartments
in the control group cost substantially more. The typical sale price is $1.99 million or
$1289 per sqft. Units are 200 sqft larger, have 2 bedrooms and 1.9 bathrooms, and are
older (58 years). There is a smaller fraction of studios (3% vs. 6%), while the condo-coop
breakdown tilts more towards coops at 30%­70%.


4.3   Rental Data
We also collect data from StreetEasy on all rental buildings in the UES. For each apartment
unit in the rental data (with a rental listing at some point between 2006 and 2019) we
obtain the same unit and building characteristics as for the sales transactions sample:
exact location (in treatment area or not, distance from Central Park, distance from Grand
Central), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, studio flag, floor, the same building
amenities as listed above, year built, and total number of units in the building.


5     Commuting Length Results
We begin with an analysis of how the extension of the 2nd Avenue Subway affected com-
mute lengths. Table 2 shows the results from the difference-in-difference estimation of
equation (1) with commute length (expressed in seconds) as the dependent variable. The
Post period refers to January­October 2017, the period after subway opening. We use
four treatment definitions corresponding to the benchmark Second Avenue corridor treat-
ment, defined above, and three alternative definitions of treatment, defined in more detail
in Section 6.4.
    Panel A of this table shows the effect of subway extension on commute times for all
affected residents, regardless of their choice of commuting method. Our baseline specifi-
cation, in column 1, shows a reduction in typical commute lengths of 193 seconds (over 3
minutes) for smart phone users who live in the treated corridor. This is a 7.4% reduction
relative to a pre-treatment mean commuting time of 43.6 minutes in the treatment group.

                                            16
We find comparable treatment effects between 160 and 251 seconds when looking at alter-
nate treatment definitions in the remaining columns. The effects are estimated precisely.
Before the Q-line extension, residents in the Second Ave corridor commute 359 seconds (6
minutes) longer than other residents in the UES. The new subway line closes the average
commuting gap by more than half, effectuating substantial convergence.
    Panel B of Table 2 breaks out the effect by commuting mode, as in equation (2). We
are particularly interested in the triple interaction of "Subway × Post × Treatment." Our
results show that subway users experience a substantial reduction of 850 seconds (14 min-
utes) in commute lengths in the treated areas in the aftermath of the Q-line opening. We
define subway commuters by their commute choices in the post period. As a result, our
measure includes reductions in commute lengths from individuals who shift to subway
commutes from another mode of transportation in the pre-period, as well as from those
who were already commuting by subway. The large improvement in commute times,
concentrated among actual subway commuters in the treatment area, points to the large
impact of the Second Ave subway extension on residents' access to work.
    We further note that the interaction of "Subway × Post" is also significantly negative
(at the 5% or 10% level depending on the treatment definition) and estimated to be around
180-210 seconds. This shows that the Q-line extension reduced commuting times also for
subway users in the control area, either because they too started using the Q train to
commute to work or because the Q train alleviated congestion on the 4-5-6 line.
    Next, we analyze the choice of commuting by splitting residents into recent movers
to the UES and everyone else. Figure 4 shows that recent movers are substantially more
likely to use the Q-line as their primary commuting choice. The difference is 16.5% points,
and statistically different from zero (t-stat of 2.29). Since recent movers are more likely to
be the marginal buyers and renters, the large gains in commuting suggest one important
channel through which the Second Avenue subway extension may have increased prices
and rents in real estate markets. We investigate this in the following section.

6.1   Corridors: Baseline Treatment and Control
The previous section established the strong impact of the Q-line construction on commut-
ing patterns. Individuals in treated areas saw substantial declines in commuting, driven
by subway commuters. New residents were disproportionately likely to use the Q-line
train. Given the complementarity between transportation improvements and real estate,

Notes: Post is an indicator variable for the period from January 1st 2017­October 2017. Treatment is an indicator variable for units
exposed to the subway extension that varies by column. Treatment definition 1 corresponds to properties that are on the 2nd Avenue
Corridor defined as between 1st and 3rd Avenues. The second treatment definition consists of properties that are within 0.3 miles in
walking distance of one of the new 2nd Avenue stops. The third treatment definition captures individuals with a reduction in distance
to the nearest subway station. The fourth treatment definition is a composite requiring that all three treatments hold. Panel A runs a
difference-in-difference specification, following equation 1, across these four treatment definitions before and after subway extension
on commute times. Commutes are defined as the time difference between pings observed at home and work locations, as described
in the text. Panel B shows a triple interaction with the effects broken out by whether users use the subway. Subway usage is defined
as whether individuals (in the post-period) ping close to either the 4-5-6, Q-line, and one other station in NYC during the commute
time window. Standard errors in parentheses.

we investigate the hypothesis that these transportation improvements led to valuation
gains in real state markets.
   Table 3 presents our main treatment estimates to measure the real estate capitaliza-
tion effect of subway construction. The Post variable in this specification captures the
price impact after January 2013, and so accounts for any general time-series increase in
price; relative to the entire pre-period of January 2003­December 2012. In column 1, for
instance, the coefficient on Post is 0.0575 on log price. This suggests that the post-period
is associated with a price premium of exp(0.0575) - 1 = 5.9%. This variable accounts for
the general increase in valuation of UES apartments. The Treat coefficient captures the
value differential associated with being "On 2nd Avenue" in general. This effect is quite
negative. Properties in the 2nd Avenue corridor generally transact for 35.4% less than
properties in the control group, i.e, in the rest of the UES, before considering controls.
   The key coefficient of interest is that on the interaction effect "Post × On 2nd Ave."
This coefficient measures the differential price impact of being on the 2nd Avenue corridor
after 2013, the time period when subway completion was either imminent or achieved.
This period captures at least some of the anticipatory effects of subway completion on real
estate values, namely those between January 1st 2013 and subway opening on January 1st
of 2017. It also contains the subsequent price effects in 2017, 2018, and the first quarter of
2019. The coefficient on the interaction term in column 1 suggests that the 2nd Avenue
Subway resulted in a statistically significant and economically large price rise of 12.2%
for properties transacting on the avenue. This number suggests that the construction of
the subway was associated with a substantial value creation. We observe convergence in

Notes: Post is an indicator variable for the period after January 1st 2013. Constr. Period is an indicator variable for the construction
period between January 1st 2007 and December 31, 2012. On 2nd Ave is an indicator variable for a unit located in the Second Avenue
Corridor as defined in the main text. Controls include: an indicator variable for a condo transaction; an indicator variable for a studio;
number of bedrooms; number of bathrooms; the floor of the building; the year of construction; distance to Central Park; distance
to Grand Central Terminal; indicator variables for building amenities (doorman, bike room, gym, elevator, laundry room, concierge,
live-in super, pool, storage room, roof deck, children's playroom, parking); as well as indicators if the control variables are missing.

prices: subway construction closes over 1/3 of the gap in valuations between the 2nd Ave
corridor and the rest of the UES.
     Our main specification is reported in column 2. It adds a number of important con-
trols to account for the differences in unit and building characteristics documented above.
Controls include: an indicator variable for a condo transaction, an indicator variable for
a studio, categorical variables for the number of bedrooms (1BR, 2BR, 3BR, 4+BR), the
number of bathrooms, the floor of the building, the year of construction, the distance to
Central Park (an important recreational amenity), the distance to Grand Central Terminal
(an important central business district), and indicators for the various building amenities
described above; as well as indicators if the control variables are missing. These control
variables boost the R2 value from 7.1% in column 1 to to 65.9% in column 2. The lower
coefficient (in absolute value) of "On 2nd Ave" indicates that about half of the uncondi-
tional difference in valuations between the treatment and control group is accounted for
by different average characteristics. However, the estimate of Post × On 2nd Ave remains
large and precisely estimated at exp(.0796) - 1 = 8.3%. It indicates even faster conver-
gence of property prices than in column 1: nearly 1/2 of the price difference between


                                                                   20
2nd Ave properties and properties in the rest of the UES is eliminated around the time of
subway completion.
    One possibility is that there are additional property characteristics beyond those in-
cluded in column 2, and unobserved to us, that matter for real estate values. We cap-
ture constant latent differences across neighborhoods and buildings by including build-
ing fixed effects in column 3 of Table 3.4 This specification compares transactions in the
same building before and after the subway. Our sample is dominated by transactions in
large buildings; 92% of observations are in buildings that contain at least five transactions
in the Pre period and at least five transactions in the Post period. Thus, we have enough
power to identify most building fixed effects accurately. Adding building fixed effects in
column 3 increases the R2 to 76.4%. In this specification, property values are 3.4% higher
on Second Avenue in the Post relative to the Pre period and relative to the control group.
The estimate is significant at the 1% level and remains economically large.


6.2    Additional Anticipation Effects
We consider the possibility of additional anticipation effects as far back as 2007, the year
when the decade-long subway construction endeavor began. We include an indicator
variable "Constr. Period" which takes the value of 1 for transactions between January
2007 and December 2012, allowing for six more years of potential anticipation effects.
This being also the period of heaviest construction, it is plausible that this period expe-
rienced a reduction in property values due to disamenities (noise, pollution, closure of
retail) related to construction activity. The interaction effect of "Constr Period × On 2nd
Ave" estimates the net effect of additional anticipation and disamenities on prices in the
2nd Ave corridor, relative to the omitted category of 2003-06. The coefficient on "Constr.
Period" shows the general price trend on the entire UES during this period, relative to
the omitted category of 2003­2006. Under this specification, the "Post × On 2nd Ave" co-
efficient measures the price change between the period 2013­2019 and the earlier period
2003­2006 (rather than relative to 2003­2012 in columns 1 and 2).
    Column 4 of Table 3 shows that the construction period was associated with a sub-
stantial increase in real estate values in general on the UES. Prices were 6.7% higher in
real terms in 2007­12 relative to 2003­06, after controlling for property characteristics.
Properties on the 2nd Ave corridor appreciated by 5% more than properties in the control
group over this period. The point estimate is statistically significant and demonstrates
   4 The
       coefficient on the treatment variable is not separately identified from the building fixed effects so
we drop it in the specifications with building fixed effects.

the presence of additional anticipation effects, strong enough to outweigh the disamenity
effects from construction.
   In the Post period, properties on 2nd Ave are 11.2% more valuable than in 2003­06, rel-
ative to the control group. In sum, subway construction triggered an initial appreciation
of 5% in 2007­12 and a further appreciation of 6.2% (11.2% - 5%) in 2013­2019.
   Figure 5 illustrates this result graphically for raw prices under our baseline treat-
ment specification. We show the the coefficient estimates from a dynamic difference-in-
differences specification on the log of sales price, in which each calendar year is allowed
to have its own treatment effect. We see positive price coefficients that are stable around
5% in the construction period of 2007­2012. The price effects grow stronger after 2013,
and are especially large in 2016­2018, a period centered around subway opening. This
helps alleviate the concern that other trends are driving the effect. The graph also illus-
trates that our results are not sensitive to various choices of demarcation between Pre and
Post periods between 2007 and 2015. By the end of the sample in 2019.Q1, the treatment
effect ceases to grow, suggestion that the market has largely priced in the full impact of
subway construction.
   In column 5 of Table 3, we add building fixed effects to the specification of column
4. The early anticipation effect during the construction period is smaller at 1.3% but is
no longer statistically precisely estimated. Property values in the Post period are 4.1%
higher than in the 2003­06 period on 2nd Avenue compared to the control group. This is
an economically and statistically significant difference.


6.3   Unpacking the Control Group
In Table 4, we revisit our main specification but unpack the control group into its con-
stituent corridors. The omitted corridor is the Madison Ave corridor (spanning from
Fifth Ave to Park Ave), so that all changes are measured relative to that Madison Ave
corridor. Since this corridor is the farthest removed from the 2nd Ave subway and since
it contains very wealthy residents who are less likely to use public transportation, this
is a natural choice for the omitted category. Column 1 shows that property prices in the
pre period (after controlling for building and unit characteristics) were the lowest on 2nd
Ave, closely followed by York Ave, then Lex Ave, and highest on Madison Ave (omitted
category).
   We continue to see our main treatment effect: prices appreciate by 9.1% more in the
2nd Ave corridor in the Post period relative to the Madison Ave corridor. In contrast, we
see no change for the Lexington Ave corridor. The null effect on Lexington Ave suggests


                                             22
Figure 5: Dynamic Treatment Effects - Baseline Treatment




                          23
that the potential benefits from reducing congestion on the 4-5-6 line did not affect relative
property prices on Lexington Avenue, or were entirely offset by reductions in relative
prices due to increased competition in the neighboring real estate submarket of 2nd Ave.
The York Avenue corridor sees a substantial 3.9% price change. The estimate is about half
as large as the treatment effect for the 2nd Ave corridor and is significant at the 1% level.
This evidence suggests that York Ave may have been at least partially affected (treated)
by the subway extension. We study this possibility in more detail below.
    Column 2 adds building fixed effects. It finds a 3.0% price gain on Second Ave, that is
precisely measured, and no price gain on Lexington Ave nor on York Ave.
    The last two columns consider the specification with the construction period broken
out. Column 3 shows a strong 11.6% capital gain on 2nd Ave, relative to Madison Ave
and relative to the pre-construction era of 2003-006. The gain of 4.3% in the construction
period underscores early anticipation effects. Lexington Ave shows no change in either
period, relative to Madison. Property prices on York Ave do not appreciate in the 2007­12
period relative to Madison Ave, but catch up relative to Madison Ave in the Post period,
for a combined effect of 3.7%. Finally, in column 4, we add building fixed effects. While
the post-period real estate capital gain remains at 2.2% the construction-era effect disap-
pears.


6.4      Alternative Treatment Definitions
6.4.1    Distance to New Stations

One drawback of our baseline definition of treatment is that we assume that all prop-
erties along the 2nd Avenue Corridor are equally treated by new subway construction.
This may not be the case if areas far from the subway stops, along 2nd Ave, do not find
much of a benefit from using the new subway. To analyze this possibility, we consider a
second treatment definition which includes all properties within 0.3 miles of one of the
three new 2nd Avenue subway stops.5 If the properties which benefit the most from the
subway construction, they should expect the greatest property price appreciation. But,
disamenities from construction may also have been greatest closest to the subway stops.
    Table 1 refers to this alternative treatment definition as "treat2". It shows that 80.9%
of the transactions on the 2nd Avenue corridor and 21.6% of the transactions in the Madi-
son, Lexington, and York Ave corridors fall within 0.3 miles of one of the new subway
   5 Distance is defined by walking distance as calculated by Google Maps. For each of our buildings, we

feed in the street address into the Google Maps API and obtain the distance to each subway station entrance
(multiple per station) on the UES, to Central Park, and to Grand Central Terminal.

stations. In other words, this treatment is strongly but not perfectly correlated with our
baseline treatment. Figure 3, Panel B shows the treated and control buildings. The 0.3-
mile distance requirement traces diamond-shaped areas around the three new subway
stations.
     Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 revisit our main difference-in-differences estimation for
this alternative treatment definition and for our preferred specifications with building
and unit controls, and with building fixed effects. We find a strongly positive and statis-
tically significant increase in value due to the subway for those properties that are within
0.3 miles of one of the three new Q-line stations. The headline increase is 5.7%, while the
increase with building fixed effects is 3%. The corresponding numbers for the baseline
treatment were 8.3% and 3.4%. This comparison suggests that properties in the 2nd Av-
enue corridor that are not within 0.3 miles from a new station benefitted slightly more
from the subway than properties in the Lexington Ave or York Ave corridors that are
within 0.3 miles of a new 2nd Ave subway station.

Notes: "Post" is an indicator variable for the period after January 1st 2013. "Treat" is an indicator variable which take son the value
of 1 if a transaction is in the treatment area. The table considers three alternative treatment definitions, as indicated in the last row.
Columns 1 and 2 use treatment definition 2 which takes the value of 1 for a transaction located within 0.3 miles of one of the three new
subway stations on the Second Avenue subway and 0 otherwise. Columns 3 and 4 use the change in distance definition (treatment
3) which is 1 for a transaction located in an area that experienced a change in distance to the closest station after the Second Avenue
subway and 0 otherwise. Columns 5 and 6 use the all of the above definition (treatment 4) which is 1 for a transaction located in
treatment areas 1, 2, and 3 and 0 otherwise. Controls are the same as in Table 2. Standard errors in parentheses.

     Further investigation, reported in Appendix Table A1, breaks down the treatment
group into transactions that are between 0 and 0.10 miles, between 0.10 and 0.20 miles,
and between 0.20 and 0.30 miles from a new Q-line station. The overall 5.7% price gain
results from a large and precisely estimated gains of 8% in properties between 0.2 and 0.3
miles away from the station and 4.7% in properties between 0.1 and 0.2 miles away. The
gain closer by is 0.9% and not significant. The analysis also shows a small price decline
closest to the station during the construction period. This is exactly where we expect the
disamenities from construction to show up. In contrast, prices in the 0.2­0.3 mile ring
appreciate 8.70% during the construction period and an additional 4.4% (for a total effect
of 13.1%) in the Post period.


6.4.2     Closest Subway Station Becomes Closer

We explore a second alternative treatment definition which places greater weight on pe-
ripheral properties which experienced possibly large gains in transit access. For every
apartment in our sample, we compute the distance to the nearest subway station on any
line serving the UES, both before and after the addition of the three stations on the Second
Avenue subway line (8 stations in total). Distance is calculated as walking distance based
on Google Maps taking into account that each station has multiple entrances.

                                                                   26
   Table 1 reports that for the average unit in the 2nd Ave corridor, the closest station was
0.32 miles away before the Q-line extension and 0.18 miles after, for an average distance
reduction of 0.14 miles (225 meters). For the residents of the other three corridors in Panel
B, the average reduction was smaller at 0.07 miles (113 meters). The latter is the combina-
tion of a zero reduction for all residents of the Madison corridor and most residents of the
Lexington corridor, on the one hand, and a large reduction for the residents on the York
Ave corridor, on the other hand. We define an apartment as treated if there is a strictly
positive distancef reduction to the nearest subway station on the UES. Table 1 refers to this
alternative treatment definition as "treat3". It shows that 78.8% of the transactions in the
2nd Avenue corridor and 32.4% of the transactions in the Madison, Lexington, and York
Ave corridors are in a building which experiences a reduction in distance to the nearest
station. Again, this treatment is strongly but not perfectly correlated with our baseline
treatment. Figure 3, Panel C shows the treated and control group buildings according to
this second alternative treatment definition. The largest change with the baseline and this
alternative treatment is that nearly all properties east of Second Avenue are now treated.
   Columns 3 and 4 of table 5 shows the difference-in-difference estimates. For our main
specifications, we find a similar effect from the subway extension: 6% without and 1.2%
with building fixed effects.
   Further investigation, reported in Appendix Table A2, breaks down the treatment
group into units that experienced a reduction in distance (i) between 0 and 0.10 miles,
and (ii) greater than 0.10 miles. The latter group consists mostly of units east of 2nd Ave.
The 6% overall price effect is the average of 13.6% estimated gains in the former group,
and 2.8% in the latter group. Both are significant at the 1% level. While one might think
that properties experiencing a larger reduction in distance are "more intensively" treated,
the data suggest that the gains are largest for those who experience a modest reduction
in distance. For some far east residents, it is possible that the 2nd Ave subway remains
too far away to be useful. Alternate transportation options may dominate even after the
new subway becomes available. Also, properties close to the East River are 8.3% more
expensive in the Pre period, suggesting a wealthier clientele that may have lower utiliza-
tion of public transportation in the first place. Nevertheless, even the 2.8% price gain is
substantial and helps to put in context the York Ave results presented above.


6.4.3   All of the Above

A final alternative treatment definition combines the first three treatments. We consider
a unit treated if it is treated under all three previous definitions. This treatment isolates


                                             27
properties on the 2nd Ave corridor, close to a new subway station, for which one of the
new stations is the closest subway option (i.e., there is a distance reduction). Table 1
reports that 72.8% of units on the 2nd Ave corridor satisfy this requirement ("treat4")
and none of the units on the other corridors, by construction. About 28.2% of the overall
sample receives this combination treatment. Figure 3, Panel D shows the treatment and
control groups according to the combination treatment definition.
   Columns 5 and 6 of Table 5 show the difference-in-difference estimates. For our main
specifications, we find a 6.8% and 3.1% subway effect, both of which are precisely esti-
mated. In conclusion, the analysis in this section confirms large and robust estimated
effects from the Q-line subway extension.


6.5   Heterogeneous Treatment and Supply Response
Though our results suggest substantial effects of the Q-line construction on prices on av-
erage, we also consider the possibility that the subway extension had different effects on
newer buildings. We define newer buildings to be those constructed after January 2003.
The categorical variable "NewConstr" isolates transactions in these buildings. Table 1
shows that 6.8% of units transacted in the treatment group are in newer buildings com-
pared to 4.4% in the control group. Table 6 estimates the triple interaction effect "Post x
Treat x NewConstr." We find a 7.4% larger appreciation for units in newer buildings in
the treatment area after subway construction than for older buildings. The appreciation
is 7.7% for older buildings and 15.1% for newer buildings. The additional 7.4% is pre-
cisely estimated despite the relatively small share of transactions in buildings built after
2003. The remaining columns of Table 6 show an even larger treatment effect for recently
constructed units when using the alternative treatment definitions. The treatment effect
for units built before 2003 remains statistically and economically large in all specifications,
however. In sum, one channel through which the 2nd Ave subway has resulted in conver-
gence in real estate values between the 2nd Ave subway corridor and the rest of the UES
is by promoting the development of new residential units. Units in newer buildings trade
at a substantial premium to existing units, as can be seen in the exp(0.360) - 1 =36.7%
estimate on "NewConstr." While the new-building premium fell substantially in the Post
period in the control group (-12.0%), it fell much less in the treatment group (-12.0% +
9.1% = -2.9%). A larger prevalence of new units on the 2nd Ave corridor then contributes
to the convergence.
   Motivated by this result, we investigate further whether the 2nd Ave subway exten-
sion triggered a housing supply response. We measure new construction from permit

data. We obtain data on the number of building permits issued, the number of build-
ing permits for new construction jobs, the total estimated cost of the permitted projects,
and the number of new residential buildings that receive a permit. The difference-in-
difference analysis is in Appendix Table A3. We find economically meaningful housing
supply responses; all four variables increase between 3.8% and 36.6%. However, none
of the effects are measured precisely, since variables that count the number of permits
are only available at the level of the treatment and control area (34 annual observations).
The fourth variable, the estimated cost of the permitted construction, is available at the
unit level but is a noisy estimate of new apartment construction. It includes all renova-
tion jobs--which dwarf new construction permits in number--and the variable is just an
initial estimate of the cost of the work.
     We explore a second source of heterogeneity in the treatment effect. Appendix Table
A4 reports treatment effects by apartment size, measured as the number of bedrooms.
The omitted category is units with zero bedrooms (studios). We find significant treatment
effects across all apartment sizes but the percentage gains are monotonically increasing
in the size of the apartment: around 5.3% for one-bedroom units rising to 20.1% for 2BR,


                                                                     29
26.0% for 3BR, and 48.1% for units that have four or more bedrooms. The estimates are
similar for all four treatment definitions.
    The results in this section suggest that gains were unequally distributed and were
strongest for larger and newer housing units.


6.6    Repeat Sales
In Table 7, we perform a repeat-sales analysis. This commonly used approach in real
estate valuation compares the prices of properties with the previous price paid for the
same property. It has the virtue of holding (most) unit characteristics constant. It has
the well-known limitation that we are only able to analyze properties that do, in fact, re-
peatedly transact in this period. We have 14,144 repeat sales, representing only 31.9% of
the total number of transactions, confirming a large reduction in sample size. Column 1
repeats the earlier analysis (main specification with controls) on the subset of apartments
that transacts at least twice.6 The repeat-sales sample features a smaller estimate of the
baseline treatment effect: a 2.8% value creation estimate from the subway extension com-
pared to a 8.3% effect for the full sample. In other words, this one-third subsample with
repeat transactions displays a baseline treatment effect that is one-third as large as the
full-sample estimate.
    With that new baseline estimate in mind, column 2 adds the log residual sale price of
the previous transaction of the same unit, i.e., from the first leg of the repeat sale. This
residual sale price is the unexplained component from a regression of the log sale price
on Post, Treat, Post × Treat, and controls. This procedure removes the subway effect
from the transaction price paid in the first leg of the transaction. The residual contains
all other unmeasured unit and building characteristics that impact valuation. The lagged
residual price enters strongly significantly with a coefficient around 0.6 and boosts the re-
gression R2 from 73.8% to 86.3%. The last six columns repeat the same two specifications
for the three alternative treatment definitions. In all cases, we continue to find significant
treatment effects with point estimates on Post × Treat between 2.2% and 5.8%. In sum,
controlling for additional unit characteristics via repeat sales results in robust baseline
gain estimates.
   6 When   determining whether a transaction in our 2003­2019 dataset is a repeat sale, we look for trans-
actions in StreetEasy before January 2003 to avoid selection on properties that transact twice within the
2003­2019 time frame. Despite limited data coverage prior to 2003, this results in several hundred addi-
tional repeat sales included in the analysis. Also, if a property is the subject of two (or more) repeat sales,
both (all) repeat-sales transactions for which the second leg of the trade pair is in our sample period 2003­
2019 enter the repeat sales sample.

6.7        Contrasting Price Effects and Commuting Estimates
Before continuing on to an analysis of rental prices and valuation, we perform a simple
analysis connecting our estimates on the reduction in commuting time with our estimates
on the house price impact. While the value of commuting presents a lower bound on the
welfare gains from subway construction, it provides a useful starting point to understand
the scope of value generated.
     Recall that we observed 5­10% price increases for properties in our treatment area (the
median treatment property in our sample is worth $845,036), while subway construction
lowered one-way commutes by 3 minutes. These estimates correspond to $14,000­$28,000
increases in house prices per minute of commute saved. While apparently large, these
estimates correspond closely to estimates drawn from other sources on the gradient be-
tween commuting into NYC and house prices. The New York Times estimates, for instance,
that shorter commuting times along the Metro North light rail line heading into Grand
Central Station result in higher house prices with a range from about $10,000 to $36,000
per minute in commute time saved.7
     An alternate back-of-the-envelope calculation contrasting house price incorporates the

value of time saved. A typical resident of the UES earns $100,000 per year, works 2000
hours, and has an hourly wage of $50/hour. If this individual saves 3 minutes for each
commute completed five days a week, for 50 weeks out of the year--the corresponding
value of time saved is $1,250 per year. As this value accrues every year into the future,
it can be valued as a perpetuity. Using a discount rate of human capital of r = 2.5%, as
estimated by Lustig, Van Nieuwerburgh, and Verdelhan (2013), results in a value of time
saved of $50,000. This is close to the baseline estimated capital gain for apartments on
the UES of $70,000 (8.3% of $845,036), and closer still to some of the smaller gains in the
specifications with fixed effects or repeat sales.
    While these estimates ignore the various benefits of transit expansion which are cap-
italized in the price yet not measured through work commutes alone, they illustrate the
general plausibility of our findings. The price gains we observe seem generally in line
with the transit improvements, and suggest large real estate price gains from alleviating
commute lengths.


7    Rental and Valuation Analysis
The real estate value creation effects from the subway extension, found in the prior anal-
ysis, not only manifest themselves in price gains on owner-occupied units but also in rent
increases in rental buildings. We use the universe of rental listings to repeat the difference-
in-differences analysis on log asking rents. We include the same, long list of property and
unit characteristics to control for observable differences in order to isolate the subway ef-
fect. One caveat to this analysis is that the data set contains asking rents not contract rents.
To the extent that this creates measurement error, it would attenuate the coefficient of in-
terest. We only include one rental observation per unit-year to avoid double-counting
repeated listings of the same unit. The final sample contains 99,034 rental unit-year ob-
servations.
    Columns 1 and 2 of Table 8 show the treatment estimates for the rental sample. In
column 1, we repeat the main specification from the sales analysis, with the Post period
starting in 2013 and controls included. We find that rents are 1.8% higher on the 2nd Ave
corridor in the Post period. This rental increase closes nearly 1/3 of the 6.19% gap in rent
levels between the 2nd Ave corridor and the rest of the UES. The effect is economically
large and precisely estimated.
    In column 2, we redefine the Post period as the period after January 1, 2017. This date
marks the opening of the subway. In this specification, we find annual rents that are 0.69%

Notes: The dependent variable in columns 1 and 2 is log asking rents at the unit level. The dependent variable in columns 3 to 8 are log
rents, log prices, and log price/rent ratios at the tax block level. Log rents (log prices) at the tax block level are obtained as the fixed
effects in a first-stage regression of log rents (log prices) of individual apartment units on tax block x year fixed effects and a vector of
unit and building controls, except for distance to Central Park and to Grand Central. `Controls' indicate different control variables in
each specification. In columns 1 and 2, the controls refer to the same unit characteristics used for our main regressions with sales data.
In columns 3-8, controls refer to the tax block-level distance from Central Park and Grand Central Station.



higher in our main treatment area. The effect is precisely estimated. Comparing columns
1 and 2, we find some anticipation effects in the rental market as well. This is consistent
with tenants that expect to stay for multiple years and move in anticipation of the subway
opening. It is also consistent with a rebound in local area amenities (e.g., street-level retail)
after 2013, which were temporarily depressed during the heavy construction phase from
2007 to 2012.
     The asset pricing (Campbell and Shiller, 1988; Cochrane, 2011) and real estate litera-
tures (Campbell, Davis, Gallin, and Martin, 2009; Plazzi, Torous, and Valkanov, 2010; Van
Nieuwerburgh, 2019) strongly suggest that discount rates may not be constant. Having
shown positive responses of both prices and rents to the 2nd Ave subway construction,
an interesting question is what happens to valuation ratios, which are a good proxy for
the (inverse of the) discount rate.
     When forming price-rent ratios, it is important to compare similar units that are for
sale and for rent. This is feasible in a dense urban neighborhood like the UES where
both owner- and renter-occupied units are prevalent, often of similar type and quality, on
nearly every block.
     To construct the log price-rent ratio in a given tax block and year for a comparable
property, we first estimate separate regressions for log prices and log rents on a full set of


                                                                    33
tax block × year fixed effects and full set of control variables, using our sales transactions
and rental listing data sets, respectively.8 We then subtract the block-year fixed effect,
estimated from the log price regression, from the corresponding block-year fixed effect,
estimated from the log rent regression, to form the log price-rent ratio for each block-
year. We sort tax blocks into Treatment and Control areas based on their location, using
our main treatment definition.
    We then regress the log rent, the log price, and the log price-rent indices at the tax
block level on Post, Treat, Post×Treat, and controls for distance to Central Park and to
Grand Central Terminal. In columns 3-5 of Table 8 the Post period is post-2013, while
in column 6-8 the Post period is post-2017. Since the analysis is at the block level, there
are fewer observations (1,789) and consequently less power. The earlier regressions of
log price and log rent at the unit level already established significance, so that we can
focus on economic magnitudes for this exercise. In column 5, we find that slightly less
than half of the treatment effect on log price is accounted for by an increase in the log
price-rent ratio, while in column 8 we find that substantially more than half is accounted
for by discount rates. Thus, the Second Ave subway expansion reduced the discount rate
on residential real estate by about 2-5% points. In sum, the subway not only increased
future cash flows but also--in at least equal part--lowered risk premia on real estate. The
finding that infrastructure investment lowers risk in real estate markets is novel to the
literature, and points to an interesting complementarity.


8     Value Capture
In this section, we take our baseline estimates for the value created by the subway based
on the observed transactions and use them to compute the aggregate value creation for
the stock of residential real estate on the UES. We then use property tax data to compute
how much of this value creation flows back to the city in the form of higher taxes. We
find that while there is an overall gain, there is a significant public shortfall compared to
the cost of the subway extension.


8.1     Baseline Valuation of the Stock of Real Estate
We start by valuing the stock of real estate in the treatment area in the period before
subway construction. We choose 2012 as a base year, the last year of our "Pre" period.
    8 We omit the controls distance to Central Park and distance to Grand Central Terminal in these first-stage

regressions since these controls are not separately identified from the block-year fixed effects.


                                                      34
This stock consists of owner-occupied residential real estate, renter-occupied residential
real estate, and commercial real estate.


8.1.1   Owner-occupied Residential Buildings

Imputing the value of owner-occupied residential real estate occurs in three steps.


Step 1: Transacted Units     For each apartment in the baseline treatment area (2nd Ave
corridor) for which we observe at least one sale, we use the dynamic difference-in-differences
specification with controls to impute an annual valuation for the year 2012. The imputa-
tion uses the actual apartment unit and building characteristics alongside the estimated
coefficients. Since the regression specification includes a condo indicator variable, valua-
tion differences between coop and condo units are taken into account.


Step 2: Other Units in Coop Buildings with Transactions          Even though we observe
more than 16 years of transactions in a liquid market, many coop units never transact in
our sample. Based on building-level data, we know how many units there are in each
coop building and therefore what fraction f of units we are missing. We obtain the val-
uation of the entire building by multiplying the cumulative value of the units for which
we have trades by 1 + f . The underlying assumption is that the average characteristics of
the missing coop units are the same as those of the transacted units.


Step 3: All Other Units Based on a master list of all tax identifiers (Borough-Block-Lot
or BBL codes) from the New York City Department of Finance, we obtain a list of all condo
units and coop buildings in the Second Avenue corridor and their 2012 "estimated market
value" (EMV). After comparing this master list against our transactions data, we obtain
the BBLs for which we see no transactions. Each condo unit has its own BBL whereas
all units in a coop building share the same BBL. For each condo unit and coop building
valued in steps 1 and 2, we calculate an EMV multiple. The EMV multiple is the ratio
of our 2012 valuation to the 2012 EMV in the tax roll data. We then average the EMVs
separately for condos and coops and for each tax block. There are 83 tax blocks in our
Second Avenue treatment area. The 2012 value of a missing condo unit is its 2012 EMV
from the city records times the average EMV multiple for condos in that tax block. The
value of a missing coop building is the 2012 EMV for that coop building times the EMV
multiple for coop buildings in that tax block.




                                            35
8.1.2   Renter-occupied Buildings

Next, there is a large stock of rental buildings to consider. After all, the home ownership
rate on the UES is only 41%. For each unit in our rental building sample, we obtain a 2012
value by combining its own unit and building characteristics and the dynamic difference-
in-difference coefficients, estimated from the condo and coop transactions. We set the
condo flag equal to 0.5, assuming that rentals are valued at the average of coops and
condos. To obtain the total value of the building, we scale up the cumulative value of the
transacted units by 1 + f , where f is the fraction of missing units in the building.
   For every rental building thus valued, we compute the EMV multiple as the ratio of
our 2012 valuation to the city's 2012 EMV. We average the EMV ratios for rental buildings
by tax block. We value the rental buildings (BBLs) for which we have no StreetEasy rental
data by multiplying their EMV from the tax roll data by the EMV multiple for rental
buildings in that tax block. Our valuation approach is consistent with New York City's
Department of Finance approach which values all owner-occupied buildings as if they
were rental buildings.


8.1.3   Commercial Properties

The final property type is commercial, non-residential real estate: retail, office, and in-
dustrial properties. Since the 2nd Ave corridor is largely a residential neighborhood, the
dominant type of commercial real estate is street-level urban retail (shops and restau-
rants), followed by parking garages. Since we observe very few transactions data for
these properties and lack sufficient building characteristics for the transactions we do
observe, we exclusively use the EMV approach. Specifically, we calculate the average
EMV ratio in each tax block pooling all condo, coop, and rental BBLs. We then value the
commercial BBLs as the product of their 2012 EMV by the average EMV multiple in the
corresponding tax block.
   As shown in the first column of Table 9, we estimate the total 2012 market value of
real estate in our treatment area at $71 billion across the three categories of real estate.


8.2     Tax Pass-through
To assess the amount of property taxes that typically passes through to the city govern-
ment in response to property appreciation, we make use of tax assessment records for
New York City. For owners of condos and coops, the city assess property taxes on a por-
tion of the property's market value, the so-called assessed value. This assessed value is


                                              36
calculated using several steps.
   First, the property's EMV is calculated as follows. The city imputes the annual Net Op-
erating Income (NOI) per sqft based on comparable rental buildings, typically the average
of three buildings that are geographically close to the building in question, of similar size
and similar vintage. This annual NOI is then divided by a cap rate, the ratio of NOI to
price, to produce the EMV. The city's records indicate that the cap rate was set uniformly
at 12.42% in January 2018. The true market cap rate at that time was around 4%, so that
the EMV is about three times smaller than the actual market value. Next, the property
assessed value is set at 45% of the EMV, and owners pay a 12.9% tax rate on the assessed
value, minus exemptions. Absent exemptions, the tax rate is 5.8% of EMV. Changes in
property taxes--due to changes in NOI of comparable rental buildings-- are gradually
phased in over a five year period. While we do not observe tax exemptions, we have tax
paid in 2015 for all properties. This data suggests a non-trivial role for exemptions, and
indicates that actual tax paid is 4.8% of EMV.
   To understand how the subway construction affects tax revenue, we start with a sim-
ple example for the typical condo building in the 2nd Ave corridor. Suppose a building
has 90 units, and a total of 140,000 sqft. Suppose the true market value is $175 million,
or $1,250 per sqft. Given a NOI of $50 per foot, this valuation corresponds to a 4.0% cap
rate. The EMV is based on a 12.42% cap rate and so is $37.65 million, or $269 per sqft. The
assessed value is 45% of EMV or $16.94 million. This becomes $14 million after the 17.5%
condo abatement, a common form of exemption. Annual tax paid is $1.8 million for the
building or $20,000 per unit, which is 4.8% of EMV and 1.0% of true market value.
   Suppose now that the 2nd Ave subway increases the value of this building by 8.3%,
the (exponentiated) point estimate in column 2 of Table 3, or $14.52 million. The EMV
increases by $3.12 million, and the assessed value by $1.41m. Taxes paid will increase
annually by $149,561 in year 5 and beyond, and gradually be phased in before that. As-
suming a government discount rate of 3%, corresponding to NYC's municipal bond yield,
the subway results in $4.44 million in extra tax revenue in present value terms. The esti-
mate of value capture, or how much of the price increase accrues to the city government
is $4.44m / $14.52m = 30.6%. This pass-through estimate is not far from the nation-wide
average long-run elasticity of property tax revenue to house prices, estimated at 0.4 by
Lutz (2008).
   We adopt this 30.6% pass-through estimate to calculate the additional present value
tax revenue increase NYC may expect due to the Second Avenue extension. The first row
of Table 9 shows the estimated log change in market value across our main specifications
from Table 3, repeated for convenience. The second row exponentiates these numbers to

                                             37
obtain percentage changes. Rows 3-5 apply these percentage gains to the estimated 2012
market value of real estate in our treatment area, per the calculations detailed above. The
assumption is that the value gain from subway construction was uniform across property
types.
   We estimate that the subway construction led to a total value increase of $5.89 billion in
our benchmark specification. For different specifications in columns 3-5, estimates range
between $2.41 and $7.95 billion. However, the city is able to capture only 30.6% of this
value in the form of higher taxes. This table displays our estimates of the amount captured
by the city government in present value terms from increased property taxation under the
row "Property Tax Receipts." The baseline specification predicts a $1.8 billion increase;
the other specifications produce estimates ranging from $0.74 to $2.43 billion. We contrast
these numbers with the construction cost of $4.5 billion, and show in the last row the
shortfall in revenue. The baseline estimate is a $2.69 billion public shortfall. Even though
the value generated from subway construction was substantial enough to exceed the (very
large) subway construction cost, the gains largely accrued to private owners of condo and
co-op units and landlords managing rental and commercial real estate properties. The
city suffered a substantial shortfall, especially under the more conservative value gain
estimates.

8.3   Value Capture Through Micro-targeted Property Taxes
Our paper demonstrates that it is technically feasible to determine how much each hous-
ing unit benefited from the new transit infrastructure, taking into account its exact loca-
tion, and its unit and building characteristics. In theory, local government could levy
a unit-specific property tax surcharge proportional to the value created. Such micro-
targeted property tax surcharges would not only be based on objectively measurable
value increases and property characteristics, and hence be fair, they could also become
an important financing tool to fund future infrastructure needs.
    Strikingly, nearly all of our estimates of the value gain from the Second Ave Subway
construction itself exceed the cost of construction. Our estimates suggest that while the
cost of construction of the subway is quite high; so is the value generation, at least in
densely populated areas such as the Upper East Side.
    Two caveats are in order. First, it may be politically difficult to levy micro-targeted
property taxes. Second, it is an empirical question how large the elasticity of tax revenue
is to increases in property taxes. Haughwout, Inman, Craig, and Luce (2004) provide
evidence that property prices fall in response to higher property tax rates. They find that
New York City was close to the peak of its tax revenue hill in the late 1990s. The extent to
which these estimates are still relevant thirty years later is an open question.


9     Conclusion
Mass public transit is a critical infrastructure asset in dense urban environments, but con-
struction costs have risen to enormous amounts. To justify further expansion, transit must
demonstrate significant returns either directly or through the capitalization of external-
ities in real estate prices. Exploiting one of the most expensive extensions in one of the
oldest and largest subway systems in the world, the Second Ave subway extension in
New York City, we find evidence of such capitalization using a difference-in-difference
framework. Our data set allows us to control finely for building and unit characteris-
tics. Our estimates suggest price appreciation of 5­10% across specifications. Much of the
value gain occurs in anticipation of the subway opening.
    Using new mobile phone location data, we document substantial improvements in
commuting lengths, which are concentrated among individuals who live near the new
subway stations and take the subway. Q-line subway usage is also higher among new
residents, suggesting that the composition of residents was also affected by the subway
construction. Such immigrants are likely marginal buyers and renters in the area. The


                                             39
commuting results provide one plausible channel for the price effects.
   We also find significant increases in rents that are consistent with the capitalization
effects. Increases in price-rent ratios in the treatment area reflect not only higher rents but
also lower risk premia on real estate brought about by the infrastructure investment.
   Valuing the total stock of treated real estate at $71 billion pre-treatment, our baseline
estimate suggests a $5.89 billion gain from the 2nd Ave subway extension to private land-
lords. We estimate that the city will only recoup about 30% of the gain, or about $1.8
billion, in the form of future property taxes. The former number well exceeds the $4.5
billion cost of the project, while the latter number falls significantly short. This suggests
that additional taxation, in the form of targeted property tax increases, might be useful to
fill the gap. More broadly, value capture could prove a useful instrument in the financing
tool box to help fund the large future infrastructure needs.
