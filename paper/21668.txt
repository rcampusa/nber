                                             ABSTRACT

Our simple model features agents heterogeneous in skill and risk aversion, incomplete financial markets,
and redistributive taxation. In equilibrium, agents become entrepreneurs if their skill is sufficiently
high or risk aversion sufficiently low. Under heavier taxation, entrepreneurs are more skilled and less
risk-averse, on average. Through these selection effects, the tax rate is positively related to aggregate
productivity and negatively related to the equity risk premium. Both income inequality and stock prices
initially increase but eventually decrease with the tax rate. Investment risk, stock market participation,
and skill heterogeneity all contribute to inequality. Cross-country empirical evidence supports the
model’s predictions.

1.        Introduction
In recent decades, income inequality has grown in most developed countries, triggering
widespread calls for more income redistribution.1 Yet the effects of redistribution on in-
equality are not fully understood. We analyze those effects through the lens of a simple
model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. We find that redistribution af-
fects inequality not only directly, by transferring wealth, but also indirectly through selection,
by changing the composition of agents who take on investment risk. Through the same se-
lection mechanism, redistribution also affects aggregate productivity and asset prices, which,
in equilibrium, feed back into inequality.

       Income inequality has been analyzed extensively in labor economics, with a primary focus
on wage inequality.2 While wages are clearly the main source of income for most households,
substantial income also derives from business ownership and investments in financial markets,
whose size has grown alongside inequality.3 We examine the channels through which financial
markets and business ownership affect inequality. To emphasize those channels, we develop
a model in which agents earn no wages; instead, they earn business income, capital income,
and tax-financed pensions. In our model, investment risk and differences in financial market
participation are the principal drivers of income inequality.

   Our model features agents heterogeneous in both skill and risk aversion. Agents optimally
choose to become one of two types, “entrepreneurs” or “pensioners.” Entrepreneurs are active
risk takers whose income is increasing in skill and subject to taxation. Pensioners live off
taxes paid by entrepreneurs. Financial markets allow entrepreneurs to sell a fraction of their
own firm and use the proceeds to buy a portfolio of shares in other firms and risk-free bonds.
Since entrepreneurs cannot diversify fully, markets are incomplete.

       In equilibrium, agents become entrepreneurs if their skill is sufficiently high or risk aver-
sion sufficiently low, or both. Intuitively, low-skill agents become pensioners because they
would earn less as entrepreneurs, and highly risk-averse agents become pensioners because
they dislike the idiosyncratic risk associated with entrepreneurship. These selection effects
are amplified by higher tax rates because those make entrepreneurship less attractive. When
the tax rate is high, only agents with the highest skill and/or lowest risk aversion find it
optimal to become entrepreneurs. Therefore, under heavier taxation, entrepreneurs are more
   1
     For example, Alvaredo et al. (2013), Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011), and many others document the
growth in inequality. Piketty (2014), the Occupy Wall Street movement, and others call for redistribution.

     Non-wage income is earned by households across the whole income distribution, and it is the dominant
source of income at the top. Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Stevens (2015) show that non-wage income represents
44% of total income for households that participate in financial markets in 1989 to 2013.

skilled and less risk-averse, on average, and total output is lower.

    Inequality initially increases but eventually decreases with the tax rate. When the tax
rate is zero, all agents choose to be entrepreneurs because pensioners earn no income. As the
rate rises, inequality rises at first because agents who are extremely risk-averse or unskilled
become pensioners. Such agents accept the low consumption of pensioners in exchange for
shedding idiosyncratic risk, thereby increasing consumption inequality.4 As the tax rate rises
further, inequality declines due to the direct effect of redistribution.

      There are three sources of inequality: investment risk, stock market participation, and
heterogeneity in skill. Investment risk causes differences in ex-post returns on entrepreneurs’
portfolios, in part due to idiosyncratic risk and in part because entrepreneurs with different
risk aversions have different exposures to stocks. While entrepreneurs participate in the
stock market, pensioners do not. Entrepreneurs consume more than pensioners on average,
in part due to higher skill and in part as compensation for taking on more risk. Finally, not
surprisingly, more heterogeneity in skill across entrepreneurs implies more inequality.

      To explore the welfare implications of redistribution, we analyze inequality in expected
utility, which we measure by certainty equivalent consumption. Inequality in expected utility
is smaller than consumption inequality, in part because pensioners not only tend to consume
less than entrepreneurs but also face less risk. An increase in the tax rate reduces inequality
in expected utility but it also reduces the average level of expected utility. In addition, the
model yields a right-skewed distribution of consumption across agents.

      The model’s asset pricing implications are also interesting. First, the expected stock
market return is negatively related to the tax rate. The reason is selection: a higher tax rate
implies lower average risk aversion among stockholders, which in turn implies a lower equity
risk premium. Second, the level of stock prices exhibits a hump-shaped relation to the tax
rate. On the one hand, a higher tax rate reduces stock prices by reducing the after-tax cash
flow to stockholders. On the other hand, both selection effects mentioned earlier push in the
opposite direction. When the tax rate is higher, entrepreneurs are more skilled, on average,
resulting in higher expected pre-tax cash flow, and they are also less risk-averse, resulting
in lower discount rates. Both selection effects thus induce a positive relation between stock
prices and the tax rate. The net effect is such that the stock price level initially rises but
eventually falls with the tax rate. This asset price pattern feeds back into income inequality
through the investment risk component, contributing to its hump-shaped pattern.

      Last but not least, the model implies a positive relation between the tax rate and aggre-
  4
      In our simple model, consumption equals income, so consumption inequality equals income inequality.


                                                     2
gate productivity. The reason, again, is selection: a higher tax rate implies that those who
create value in the economy—entrepreneurs—are more skilled. At the same time, heavier
taxation implies fewer entrepreneurs and more pensioners, and thus lower total output. In
short, a higher tax rate makes the economy smaller but more productive.

      While our main contribution is theoretical, we also conduct simple cross-country empirical
analysis to examine the model’s predictions. We use data for 34 OECD countries in 1980
through 2013. We measure the tax burden by the ratio of total taxes to GDP, inequality by
the top 10% income share and the Gini coefficient, productivity by GDP per hour worked,
the level of stock prices by the aggregate market-to-book ratio, and market returns by the
returns on the country’s leading stock market index. The evidence is broadly consistent with
the model. The tax burden is strongly positively related to productivity, as predicted by
the model. The relation between inequality and the tax burden is negative, consistent with
the model, but it does not exhibit concavity. The relation between the average stock market
return and the tax burden is negative, as predicted, but not always significant. The relation
between the level of stock prices and the tax burden is concave and negative, as predicted,
but the negativity is significant only after the inclusion of macroeconomic controls.

   This paper spans several strands of literature: income inequality, redistributive taxation,
entrepreneurship, and asset pricing with heterogeneous preferences and incomplete markets.
The vast literature on income inequality focuses largely on labor income, as noted earlier.
A recent exception is Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Stevens (2015) who show empirically that
inequality in capital income contributes significantly to total income inequality. Kacperczyk
et al. also analyze inequality in a model of endogenous information acquisition. In their
model, agents have the same risk aversion but different capacities to learn. In addition, assets
differ in their riskiness. In our model, assets have the same risk but agents differ in their risk
aversion. We also model skill differently, as the ability to deliver a high return on capital
rather than the ability to learn about asset payoffs. The two models are complementary,
generating different predictions for inequality through different mechanisms.5

      In our incomplete-markets model, agents can hedge against idiosyncratic risk by trading
stocks as well as by borrowing and lending. In addition, agents can escape idiosyncratic risk
completely by becoming pensioners and consuming tax revenue. Redistributive taxation
thus effectively represents government-organized insurance that supplements the insurance
obtainable by trading in financial markets. The insurance benefits of redistribution come at
the expense of growth due to a reduced incentive to invest. The tradeoff between insurance
  5
    Another mechanism through which capital income can affect inequality has been verbally proposed by
Piketty (2014). His capital accumulation arguments extend those of Karl Marx.

benefits and incentive costs of taxation is well known in the optimal taxation literature.6
Unlike that literature, we do not solve for the optimal tax scheme. Instead, we simply
assume proportional taxation, take the tax rate as given, and focus on its implications for
income inequality and asset prices.

      In our model, the tax rate affects the selection of agents into entrepreneurship. Selection
based on skill has its roots in Lucas (1978); selection based on risk aversion goes back to
Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979). In those models, the alternative to entrepreneurship is working
for entrepreneurs; in our model, it is living off taxes paid by entrepreneurs. We show that
heavier taxation amplifies both selection effects, with interesting implications for inequality
and asset prices. Hombert, Schoar, Sraer, and Thesmar (2014) review other reasons, besides
skill and risk aversion, for which agents become entrepreneurs. Hombert et al. also extend
Lucas (1978) by making entrepreneurship risky and adding government insurance for failed
entrepreneurs. In contrast, in our model, redistribution does not provide insurance against
poor ex-post realizations. Instead, it insures agents against being born with low skill or high
risk aversion. Agents endowed with such characteristics choose to live off taxes.

      Given our emphasis on financial markets, our work has parallels in the asset pricing
literature. Like us, Fischer and Jensen (2015) also analyze the effects of redistributive
taxation on asset prices. In their model as well as ours, tax revenue is exposed to stock
market risk. However, their model has only one type of agents (and thus no selection effects),
one risky asset (and thus no idiosyncratic risk), and output that comes from a Lucas tree
(and thus does not depend on taxation). Moreover, they focus on stock market participation
rather than inequality. Studies that relate inequality to asset prices, in frameworks very
different from ours, include Gollier (2001), Johnson (2012), and Favilukis (2013). More
broadly, our work is related to the literatures on asset pricing with heterogeneous preferences7
and uninsurable idiosyncratic income shocks.8 While we do not calibrate our incomplete-
market model with heterogeneous preferences to quantitatively match the data9 , we add
endogeneous agent type selection and redistributive taxation. Finally, our paper is related
to the literature exploring the links between asset prices and government policy.10

2.      Model

There is a continuum of agents with unit mass. Each agent i is endowed with a skill level
µi , risk aversion γi , and Bi,0 units of capital at time 0. Agents are heterogeneous in both
skill and risk aversion but their initial capital is the same, Bi,0 = B0 .

     Agents with more skill are more productive in that they earn a higher expected return
on their capital if they choose to invest it. Each agent’s capital endowment is technology-
specific; it can be invested only in a production technology that requires this agent’s skill
to operate. Specifically, each agent i can invest B0 in a constant-return-to-scale technology
that produces Bi,T units of output at a given future time T :

                                       Bi,T = B0 eµi T + εT + εi,T ,                                   (1)

where εT and εi,T are aggregate and idiosyncratic random shocks, respectively. These shocks
are distributed so that all εi,T are i.i.d. across agents and E(eεT ) = E(eεi,T ) = 1. Agent i’s
skill, µi , is therefore equivalent to the expected rate of return on the agent’s capital:
                                                  
                                              Bi,T
                                         E           = eµi T .                                         (2)
                                              B0
Agent i has a constant relative risk aversion utility function over consumption at time T :
                                                        1−γi
                                                      Ci,T
                                          U (Ci,T ) =        ,                                         (3)
                                                      1 − γi
where Ci,T is the agent’s consumption and γi > 0 is the coefficient of relative risk aversion.11

     At time 0, each agent decides to become either an entrepreneur or a pensioner. En-
trepreneurs invest in risky productive ventures and are subject to proportional taxation. If
an agent becomes an entrepreneur, he starts a firm that produces a single liquidating divi-
dend Bi,T at time T . An entrepreneur can use financial markets to sell off a fraction of his
firm to other entrepreneurs at time 0. The proceeds from the sale can be used to purchase
stocks in the firms of other entrepreneurs and risk-free zero-coupon bonds. Each entrepreneur
faces a constraint inspired by moral hazard considerations: he must retain ownership of at
least a fraction θ of his own firm. Due to this friction, markets are incomplete.
  11
    The mathematical expressions presented here assume γi 6= 1. For γi = 1, the agent’s utility function is
log(Ci,T ) and some of our formulas require slight algebraic modifications. See the Internet Appendix.


                                                    5
   The second type of agents, pensioners, do not invest; instead, they live off taxes paid
by entrepreneurs. We interpret pensioners as including not only retirees but also anyone
collecting income from the government without making a direct contribution to total out-
put, such as government workers (whose contribution is indirect), people on disability, etc.
Because they do not invest, agents who choose to become pensioners effectively abandon
their technology-specific capital endowments in exchange for future tax-financed pensions.
Pensioners cannot sell claims to their pensions in financial markets.

   While the agents’ initial capital B0 could be physical or human, the latter interpretation
seems more natural. If we interpret B0 as the capacity to put in a certain amount of labor,
we can easily justify two of our assumptions. First, all agents are endowed with the same
amount of B0 , which can be thought of as eight hours per day. (The skill aspect of human
capital is included in µi .) Second, by becoming pensioners, agents give up their B0 . That
is, entrepreneurs deploy their labor productively whereas pensioners do not.

   Finally, there is a given tax rate τ > 0. For simplicity, we do not model how the
government chooses τ . The sole purpose of taxes is redistribution. All taxes are collected
from entrepreneurs at time T and equally distributed among pensioners.


2.1.    The Agents’ Decision

At time 0, each agent chooses one of two options: (1) invest and become an entrepreneur, or
(2) do not invest and become a pensioner. At the time they make this choice, agents know
all the parameters of the model (i.e., µi , γi , τ , θ, and B0); the only thing they do not know
is the future realizations of εT and εi,T . Let I denote the set of agents who decide to invest
and become entrepreneurs. The set I is determined in equilibrium as follows:

                                    I = i : V0i,yes ≥ V0i,no
                                       
                                                               ,                               (4)

where V0i,yes and V0i,no are the expected utilities from investing and not investing, respectively:

                     V0i,yes = E [U (Ci,T ) | investment by agent i]                           (5)
                      V0i,no = E [U (Ci,T ) | no investment by agent i] .                      (6)

As we show below, both V0i,yes and V0i,no depend on I itself: each agent’s utility depends on
the actions of other agents. Solving for the equilibrium thus involves solving a fixed-point
problem. Before evaluating the agents’ utilities, we compute their consumption levels.



                                                 6
2.1.1.     Pensioners’ Consumption


Pensioners’ only source of consumption at time T is tax revenue, which is the product of the
tax rate and the tax base. The tax base is total output at time T . Since only entrepreneurs
engage in production, total output is given by
                                            Z
                                      BT = Bi,T di ,                                     (7)
                                                         I

so that total tax revenue is τ BT .12 Let m (I) =
                                                              R
                                                                  I
                                                                      di denote the measure of I, that is, the
fraction of agents who become entrepreneurs. Since tax revenue is distributed equally among
1 − m (I) pensioners, the consumption of any given pensioner at time T is given by

                                                τ BT
                                    Ci,T =                     for all i ∈
                                                                         /I.                                     (8)
                                             1 − m (I)

This consumption, and thus also V0i,no in equation (6), clearly depend on I.

Proposition 1: Given I, pensioner i’s consumption at time T is equal to 13

                                                                           m (I)
                                Ci,T = τ eεT B0 EI eµj T |j ∈ I
                                                               
                                                                                   .                             (9)
                                                                         1 − m (I)

    Each pensioner’s consumption is the same since Ci,T is independent of i. Pensioners’
consumption increases with m (I) for two reasons: a higher m (I) implies a higher tax
revenue as well as fewer tax beneficiaries. In other words, the pie is larger and there are
fewer pensioners splitting it. An increase in τ has a positive direct effect on Ci,T by raising
the tax rate but also a negative indirect effect by reducing the tax base, as we show later.

    Since pensioners do not invest, they do not bear any idiosyncratic risk. Yet their con-
sumption is not risk-free: it depends on the aggregate shock εT because tax revenue depends
on εT . This result illustrates the limits of consumption smoothing by redistribution.14

functional forms for this distribution in some of the subsequent analysis. Also note that in I Bi,t di, each
agent’s capital is scaled by di to take into account the agents’ infinitesimal size. Given the continuum of
agents, each agent’s capital is given by Bi,t di, but to ease notation, we refer to it simply as Bi,t . In the same
way, we simplify notation for other agent-specific variables such as consumption and firm market value.
  13
     The notation EI (xi,T |i ∈ I) denotes the average value of xi,T across all agents in set I. The notation
E(xi,T ), used elsewhere, is the expected value as of time 0 of the random variable xi,T realized at time T .

     In our simple model, there is no intertemporal smoothing. In more complicated models, the government
could in principle provide more insurance to pensioners by saving in good times and spending more in bad
times, though the practical difficulties of saving in good times are well known.

2.1.2.    Entrepreneurs’ Consumption


Entrepreneur i’s firm pays a single dividend Bi,T , given in equation (1). The fraction θ of this
dividend goes to entrepreneur i; 1 − θ goes to other entrepreneurs who buy the firm’s shares
at time 0. Let Mi,0 denote the equilibrium market value of firm i at time 0. Entrepreneur
i sells 1 − θ of his firm for (1 − θ) Mi,0 and uses the proceeds to buy financial assets for
diversification purposes. The entrepreneur can buy two kinds of assets: shares in other
entrepreneurs’ firms and risk-free zero-coupon bonds maturing at time T , which are in zero
net supply. Let N0ij denote the fraction of firm j purchased by entrepreneur i at time 0
and let N0i0 be the entrepreneur’s (long or short) position in the bond. The entrepreneur’s
budget constraint is                         Z
                            (1 − θ) Mi,0 =          N0ij Mj,0 dj + N0i0 ,                   (10)

where the price of a risk-free bond yielding one unit of consumption at time T is normalized
to one (i.e., the bond is our numeraire). Entrepreneur i’s consumption at time T is therefore
                                                Z

                                                 I\i

The first term is the after-tax dividend that the entrepreneur pays himself from his own
firm. The second term is the after-tax dividend from owning a portfolio of shares of other
entrepreneurs’ firms. The last term is the number of bonds bought or sold at time 0.

   Each entrepreneur chooses a portfolio of stocks and bonds N0ij , N0i0 by maximizing his
                                                            

expected utility V0i,yes from equation (5). These equilibrium portfolio allocations depend on
I, and so does the integral in equation (11); therefore, Ci,T and V0i,yes depend on I as well.

Proposition 2. Given I, entrepreneur i’s consumption at time T is equal to

         Ci,T = (1 − τ ) B0 eµi T     θ eεT +εi,T − Z + (1 − θ) α (γi ) (eεT − Z) + Z

where α (γi ) and Z are described in Proposition 4. The entrepreneur’s asset allocation is

    The entrepreneur’s consumption in equation (12) increases in µi , indicating that more
skilled entrepreneurs tend to consume more. We use the qualifier “tend to” because more


                                                    8
skilled entrepreneurs can get unlucky by earning unexpectedly low returns on their in-
vestments, leading to lower consumption. To emphasize the return component of an en-
trepreneur’s consumption, we rewrite equation (12) as follows:

         Ci,T = Mi,0 θ 1 + Ri + (1 − θ) α (γi ) 1 + RM kt + (1 − θ) (1 − α (γi )) ,
                                                                              

where Ri is the stock return of firm i between times 0 and T and RM kt is the return on the
aggregate stock market portfolio over the same period. These returns are defined as15
                                                  (1 − τ )Bi,T

                                                     Mi,0
                                                  (1 − τ )BT
                                       RM kt    =              −1 .                                      (17)
                                                     M0P

    The entrepreneur’s consumption in equation (15) is the product of the entrepreneur’s
initial wealth Mi,0 and the return on his portfolio, which includes his own firm, the aggregate
stock market portfolio, and bonds. After selling 1−θ of his own firm, the entrepreneur invests
the fraction 1 − α(γi ) of the proceeds in bonds and the fraction α(γi ) in an equity portfolio.
To see that this equity portfolio is the aggregate stock market, first note from equation (13)
that agent i buys the same fractional number of shares of any stock j 6= i. Agents whose
firms are more valuable can afford to buy more shares in other firms (i.e., N0ij is increasing in
Mi,0 ), but they buy the same number of shares in each firm (i.e., N0ij does not depend on j)
because all stocks have the same exposure to risk. Yet each agent is more exposed to firms
with higher µj ’s because their shares have higher market valuations. Specifically, agent i’s
position in stock j as a fraction of the agent’s liquid equity portfolio is

                                                N0ij Mj,0       Mj,0
                                    wj =                      =      .                                   (18)
                                            (1 − θ)α(γi )Mi,0   M0P
Since wj are market capitalization weights, the equity part of each entrepreneur’s liquid
financial wealth is the aggregate cap-weighted market portfolio whose return is RM kt .

   Finally, equation (14) shows that the bond allocation decreases in α(γi ). Since bonds
are in zero net supply, high α(γi )’s correspond to negative bond allocations (N0i0 < 0, that
is, the agent borrows to invest more in the stock market) while low α(γi )’s correspond to
positive allocations. Since α(γi ) is decreasing in γi , in equilibrium we have more risk-averse
entrepreneurs lending to less risk-averse ones.16
                                     εT +εi,T                  εT
  15
     It can be shown that 1 + Ri = e Z       and 1 + RM kt = eZ .
  16                 0
     We can prove α (γi ) < 0 formally under the assumption that α(γi ) > 0 for all i ∈ I, i.e., that none
of the agents short the market portfolio. That assumption, which is sufficient but not necessary, holds for
many probability distributions of γi since the average value of α(γi ) across all entrepreneurs must be one in
equilibrium. The proof is in the Internet Appendix, along with the proofs of all other theoretical results.

2.1.3.   Who Becomes an Entrepreneur?


Having solved for equilibrium consumption levels in Propositions 1 and 2, we immediately
obtain the expected utilities V0i,yes and V0i,no from equations (5) and (6). We can then use
equation (4) to derive the condition under which agents choose to become entrepreneurs.

Proposition 3: Given I, agent i becomes an entrepreneur if and only if

                               


   Equation (19) shows that only agents who are sufficiently skilled—those with sufficiently
high µi —become entrepreneurs. This statement holds other things, especially γi and I,
equal. Note that µi does not appear on the right-hand-side of (19), except as a negligible
part of EI eµj T |j ∈ I . Entrepreneurs thus tend to be more skilled than pensioners.
                      


    This selection effect is amplified by higher tax rates. The right-hand side of (19) increases
in the tax rate τ , holding I constant. A higher τ thus discourages entrepreneurship by raising
the hurdle for µi above which agents become entrepreneurs. Moreover, a higher τ implies a
higher average value of µi among entrepreneurs. Intuitively, when the tax rate is high, only
the most skilled agents find it worthwhile to become entrepreneurs.

   While the effect of skill on the agent’s decision is clear, the effect of risk aversion is not,
as the right-hand-side of (19) depends on γi in a non-linear fashion. For many parametric
assumptions, though, the right-hand side is increasing in γi . One example in which we can
formally prove this monotonicity is θ → 1; see Section 3. Another example is one in which
all risk is idiosyncratic (i.e., εT = 0). In both examples, entrepreneurs bear much more risk
than pensioners, which is plausible. In such scenarios, we thus obtain another selection effect:
agents with higher γi are less likely to become entrepreneurs. Intuitively, highly risk-averse
agents avoid entrepreneurship because they dislike the associated idiosyncratic risk.

   It is possible to construct counterexamples in which the selection effect goes the other
way. The common feature of such examples is that entrepreneurs bear little risk. Consider
θ = 0, so that entrepreneurs bear no idiosyncratic risk. In that case, the right-hand side of
(19) is initially increasing but eventually decreasing in γi . The reason is that when θ = 0,
both types of agents are exposed only to aggregate risk εT . Entrepreneurs with high γi ’s can
reduce their exposure to this risk (i.e., α (γi )) by buying bonds whereas pensioners’ exposure


                                               10
to market risk is fixed, as shown in equation (9).17 Agents with sufficiently high γi ’s become
entrepreneurs because doing so allows them to choose low α (γi ) and thus face less risk than
they would as pensioners. In practice, though, entrepreneurs do bear idiosyncratic risk (i.e.,
θ > 0) and that risk is typically large.18 Therefore, it seems plausible to assume that θ
and the volatility of εi,T are large enough so that entrepreneurs bear significantly more risk
than pensioners. In such realistic scenarios, we obtain the selection effect emphasized in the
previous paragraph: entrepreneurs tend to be less risk-averse than pensioners.

    Proposition 3 also shows that a higher mass of entrepreneurs makes it less appealing for
any given agent to become an entrepreneur. Mathematically, the right-hand side of equation
(19) is increasing in m (I). Intuitively, a higher m (I) makes it more attractive to be a
pensioner because there is a larger tax revenue to be shared among fewer pensioners.

    In equilibrium, m (I) is always strictly between zero and one. If there were no en-
trepreneurs (m (I) = 0), the total tax base would be zero, implying zero income for pen-
sioners; as a result, somebody always becomes an entrepreneur. If everybody were an en-
trepreneur (m (I) = 1), though, there would be a large unallocated tax to be shared, and
it would be worthwhile for some agents to quit, shed idiosyncratic risk, and enjoy positive
tax-financed consumption. Mathematically, when m (I) → 0, the right-hand side of equation
(19) goes to −∞, and when m (I) → 1, the right-hand side goes to +∞.


2.2.     The Equilibrium

The equilibrium in our model is characterized by the consumption levels and portfolio allo-
cations from Propositions 1 and 2, the agent selection mechanism from Proposition 3, and
the conditions for market clearing and asset pricing. The latter conditions are presented in
the following proposition, which highlights the equilibrium’s fixed-point nature.
  17
     Another way to highlight the pensioners’ exposure to market risk is to rewrite equation (9) as
                                            τ M0P
                                                           1 + RM kt
                                                                     
                              Ci,T =                                       for all i ∈
                                                                                     /I .
                                      [1 − m (I)] [1 − τ ]
  The market value of total endowment at time 0, before tax, is M0P /(1 − τ ). Any given pensioner’s share of
this value is τ /[1 − m (I)]. This share earns the market rate of return between times 0 and T . For additional
insight, note that the ratio in parentheses in the last term of equation (19) can be rewritten as
                                                     h          (1−γi ) i
                                                   E 1 + RM kt
                                 ratio = h                                          i .
                                                                              1−γ
                                          E (1 + θRi + (1 − θ)α (γi ) RM kt ) i
  This ratio captures the relative risk of being a pensioner (numerator) versus an entrepreneur (denominator).
When θ = 0 and the agent’s risk aversion is average in that α(γi ) = 1, the numerator equals the denominator
and it makes no difference from the risk perspective whether the agent is a pensioner or an entrepreneur.

wi are the market capitalization weights from equation (18), and I is determined by (19).

   The proposition relies on a fixed-point condition: given Z, we can compute α(γi ) for
every i ∈ I, which then allows us to compute πT , which then allows us to compute Z.
An additional fixed-point relation is that the condition (19), which determines the set I of
entrepreneurs, depends on I itself. In this section, we assume that probability distributions
of εT , εi,T , µi , and γi are such that the equilibrium conditions are well defined, entrepreneurs
cannot default on short positions, if any, and the fixed-point system has a solution. We
prove the existence of a solution in the three special cases discussed in Section 3. Assuming
such existence here, we characterize the equilibrium properties of asset prices below.


2.3.    Asset Prices

The state price density from equation (20) can be rewritten in terms of asset returns:
                            Z
                                                                −γi

                       πT =                                          di .              (24)
                                I

Note that πT depends on the full distribution of γi across entrepreneurs.

Proposition 5: The expected return on any stock i between times 0 and T is

                                            E Ri = r ,

                                                                                                  (25)

where
                                                 1

                                                 12
   Recall from Proposition 4 that Z is the equilibrium price at time 0 of a security that
pays eεT at time T . Because E(eεT ) = 1, the expected return of this security is given by r
in equation (26). Proposition 5 shows that r is also the expected return on any stock i. All
stocks have the same expected return because they all have the same risk exposure. While
the stocks of more skilled entrepreneurs have higher expected dividends, such stocks trade at
higher prices so that expected returns are equalized across stocks. As a result, the expected
return on the aggregate stock market portfolio is also equal to r.

   The expected return depends on the tax rate τ through the selection effect of τ on the
risk aversions of agents who become entrepreneurs. This is because the expected return is
determined by Z, which depends on the state price density in equation (20), which in turn
depends on the risk aversions of all entrepreneurs. The right-hand side of equation (19)
is increasing in τ , as noted earlier. If it is also increasing in γi , which seems realistic (see
our discussion of Proposition 3), then an increase in τ leads more high-γi agents to become
pensioners. A higher τ thus reduces the average risk aversion of entrepreneurs. The lower
average risk aversion of stockholders then depresses the equity risk premium.

Proposition 6: (a) The market-to-book ratio (M/B) of entrepreneur i’s firm is

                                     Mi,0   (1 − τ ) eµi T
                                          =                .                                  (27)
                                     B0        1+r

   (b) The M/B of the aggregate stock market portfolio is

                                    (1 − τ ) EI eµj T |j ∈ I
                                                            
                            M0P
                                 =                             ,                              (28)
                            B0P               1+r

where B0P = m (I) B0 is the total amount of capital invested at time 0.

   Equation (27) shows in elegant simplicity that stock prices are equal to expected cash
flows adjusted for risk. The firm’s expected after-tax dividend, B0 (1 − τ ) eµi T (see equation
(2)), is discounted at the rate r, which performs the risk adjustment. There is no discounting
beyond this risk adjustment; as noted earlier, we use the risk-free bond as numeraire, thereby
effectively setting the risk-free rate to zero. In computing M/B, we scale market value by
the amount of initial capital whose natural interpretation is the book value of the firm.

   The market portfolio’s M/B is very similar, except that expected dividends are averaged
across entrepreneurs. The dependence of M/B on the tax rate τ is ambiguous. On the
one hand, a higher τ reduces M/B by reducing the after-tax cash flow through the (1 − τ )
term. On the other hand, a higher τ increases M/B by increasing the average skill among
entrepreneurs, and thus also EI eµj T |j ∈ I , due to the first selection effect discussed earlier.

                                                13
Finally, a higher τ increases M/B by reducing average risk aversion, and thus also r, through
the second selection effect discussed above.


2.4.     Income Inequality

Next, we analyze the model’s implications for income inequality across agents. Since all
income is received and consumed at time T , income and consumption coincide in our simple
model. We therefore focus on the inequality in consumption at time T , which is equivalent to
income inequality. We normalize each agent’s consumption by its average across all agents:
                                                     Ci,T
                                            si,T =        ,                                      (29)
                                                     CT
              R
where C T = Ci,T di = BT . Our first measure of inequality, which we adopt for its analytical
tractability, is the cross-sectional variance of si,T , computed across agents:
                                               Z
                                  Var(si,T ) = (si,T − 1)2 di .                         (30)

Note that the cross-sectional mean of si,T is equal to one, by construction.

Proposition 7: The cross-sectional variance of consumption at time T is given by

                                     (1 − τ )2 EI e2µj T |j ∈ I
                                                               
                           τ2
         Var(si,T ) =             +                               ×

                                          1 + RM kt


    This expression highlights three sources of inequality. The first one is heterogeneity
                                                                                2
in skill across entrepreneurs: the fraction EI e2µj T |j ∈ I / EI eµj T |j ∈ I is intimately
                                                                   

related to the coefficient of variation in eµj T across entrepreneurs. Not surprisingly, a larger
dispersion in skill translates into larger consumption inequality.

   The second source of inequality is differences in ex-post returns on the entrepreneurs’
investment portfolios. These differences affect inequality through the term in brackets in
the second line of equation (31). Different firms earn different returns Rj , due to idiosyn-
cratic risk. Moreover, entrepreneurs have different exposures to the market portfolio, due to
differences in α (γj ). Even if all idiosyncratic risk could be diversified away (i.e., θ = 0), cross-
sectional heterogeneity in γi would create ex-post inequality because agents with different
risk aversions take different positions in the market portfolio.


                                                 14
     The third source of inequality is that entrepreneurs consume more than pensioners on
average, for two reasons.19 First, entrepreneurs tend to be more skilled. Second, they tend to
take more risk for which they are compensated by earning a risk premium. Since pensioners’
consumption is not exposed to idiosyncratic risk, the inequality in utility between the two
types of agents is smaller than the inequality in income. In other words, income inequality
exaggerates the dispersion in happiness across agents.

     To clarify this third source of inequality, note that si,T has a mixture distribution:

               1−τ        eµi T       1 + θRi + (1 − θ) α(γi )RM kt
       si,T =        × I µT         ×                                                       for i ∈ I    (32)
               m (I) E [e j |j ∈ I]            1 + RM kt
                   τ
             =                                                                               for i ∈
                                                                                                   /I.   (33)
               1 − m (I)

From equation (32), the average consumption across entrepreneurs is (1 − τ )/m (I). If all
entrepreneurs consumed at that level, the third source of inequality would be the only source,
                                        τ2         (1−τ )2
and we would have Var(si,T ) =        1−m(I)
                                               +    m(I)
                                                              − 1, a simpler version of equation (31).

   In addition to cross-sectional variance, we measure inequality by the percentage of income
received by the top 10% of the population. Denoting the cumulative density function of si,T
by F (si,T ), we compute the top 10% relative income share as
                                              Z ∞
                              Top10 (si,T ) =     si,T dF (si,T ) ,                                      (34)
                                                        s10

where we choose s10 such that F (s10 ) = 0.90. Given the mixture distribution of si,T ,

                 F (si,T ) = F (si,T |i ∈ I) m (I) + 1{si,T >            τ
                                                                                } (1 − m (I)) .          (35)
                                                                       1−m(I)


After imposing more structure, we obtain F (si,T ) in closed form in the following section.



3.      Results under Additional Assumptions

In this section, we make additional assumptions that allow us to prove the existence of
the equilibrium and characterize it analytically. The key assumption is θ → 1, so that
entrepreneurs are allowed to sell only a negligible fraction of their firm in capital markets.
In this limiting case, the stock market capitalization is infinitesimally small and the stock
prices we calculate are shadow prices. Yet this case is particularly interesting because it
  19
     We can prove this inequality formally in two special cases: when θ → 1 and when all risk is idiosyncratic
(i.e., εT = 0). In both cases, entrepreneurs bear significantly more risk than pensioners, which is realistic.



                                                       15
allows a clean solution while preserving all other relevant aspects of the problem, including
both dimensions of agent heterogeneity and both dimensions of risk.

   The special case of θ → 1 is analyzed throughout this section except for Section 3.6.,
in which we consider two other special cases: homogeneous risk aversion and no systematic
risk. Both cases yield analytical results and admit proofs of the existence of the equilibrium
even when θ < 1. But until Section 3.6., we consider the general case from Section 2., with
heterogeneous risk aversion and systematic risk, and assume θ → 1 instead.

   We also assume that both shocks from equation (1) are normally distributed:
                                                     

                                           2
                                                     

                                           2
The non-zero means ensure that E(eεT ) = E(eεi,T ) = 1 and the specific structure for the
variances helps when we choose parameter values later in this section.

   Equation (19) then simplifies so that agents become entrepreneurs if and only if

The selection effects mentioned earlier are now particularly easy to see: agents with higher
skill (µi ) and lower risk aversion (γi ) are more likely to become entrepreneurs. The right-
hand side of equation (38), which is independent of i, is intuitive. The difference in the
curly brackets reflects the difference between the average consumption levels of pensioners
    τ                          1−τ
( 1−m(I) ) and entrepreneurs ( m(I) ), as shown in equations (32) and (33). A larger difference
indicates a larger opportunity cost to being an entrepreneur. The last term on the right-
hand side reflects the expected growth of total capital, which is unaffected by agent i’s choice
because any given agent is infinitesimally small. A higher value implies a higher expected
tax base and thus a higher expected consumption for pensioners, which again indicates a
larger opportunity cost to being an entrepreneur. Agent i becomes an entrepreneur only if
his µi is high enough and γi is low enough to overcome these aggregate effects.

   To obtain closed-form solutions for the equilibrium quantities, we add the assumption
that µi and γi are independently distributed across agents as follows:

                                µi ∼ N µ, σµ2
                                                 
                                                                                    (39)
                                 γi ∼ N γ, σγ2 1{γi >0} .

That is, skill µi is normally distributed with mean µ and variance σµ2 . Risk aversion γi is
truncated normal, with truncation at zero and underlying normal distribution with mean γ

                                              16
and variance σγ2 . Given these distributional assumptions, we solve for the equilibrium mass
of entrepreneurs m (I). We prove that

                                          ∂m (I)
                                                 <0,                                          (41)
                                           ∂τ
so that a higher tax rate shrinks the pool of entrepreneurs. This is intuitive since taxes
represent a transfer from entrepreneurs to pensioners. A higher tax rate incentivizes agents
to become recipients of taxes rather than their payers. We also solve for equilibrium asset
prices and both measures of inequality. All formulas are in the Internet Appendix.

   Next, we illustrate the model’s implications for income inequality, productivity, and asset
prices. We preserve the assumption θ → 1 and choose the following parameter values for the
distributions in equations (36), (37), (39), and (40): σ = 10% per year, σ1 = 30% per year,
T = 10 years, µ = 0, σµ = 5% per year, γ = 3, and σγ = 0.5. These choices are of limited
importance as our conclusions are robust to a wide range of plausible parameter values.


3.1.    Selection Effects

Figure 1 shows how agents decide to become entrepreneurs or pensioners. Each point with co-
ordinates (γi , µi ) represents an agent with skill µi and risk aversion γi . The circular contours
outline the joint probability density of µi and γi across agents, indicating regions containing
50%, 90%, 99%, and 99.9% of the probability mass. The threshold lines correspond to the
tax rates τ of 0.1%, 5%, 20%, and 70%. For a given τ , all agents located above the threshold
line choose to become entrepreneurs; those below the line become pensioners. We see that
agents whose skill is sufficiently high or risk aversion sufficiently low become entrepreneurs.
The linear tradeoff between µi and γi is also clear from equation (38).

   The figure also shows that higher taxes discourage entrepreneurship: as τ rises, the
threshold line shifts upward, shrinking the region of entrepreneurs. This effect is much more
dramatic for low tax rates: raising τ from 0.1% to 5% reduces the region by more than
raising τ from 20% to 70%. When τ = 0, nobody becomes a pensioner because there is no
tax revenue for pensioners to consume. When τ rises from zero to a small value, being a
pensioner becomes attractive to agents who are extremely unskilled or extremely risk-averse.
Such agents choose the near-zero consumption of pensioners because the prospect of starting
a firm and bearing its idiosyncratic risk is even worse. As τ rises further, the ranks of
pensioners grow increasingly slowly, for two reasons. First, the rising mass of pensioners
means that each pensioner’s share of the tax revenue shrinks. Second, the tax revenue itself
grows increasingly slowly, and it begins falling for τ high enough (the Laffer curve).

                                                17
   Supporting these arguments, Figure 2 shows that m (I) declines with τ in a convex
manner: it reaches the value of 0.5 quickly, at τ = 16%, but then it declines more slowly,
reaching 0.1 at τ = 61%. Figure 2 also plots the average consumption levels of entrepreneurs
                 1−τ                 τ
and pensioners ( m(I) and          1−m(I)
                                          ,   respectively). Pensioners consume almost nothing when
τ is near zero, but their consumption grows with τ . Entrepreneurs consume more than
pensioners on average for any τ , in part due to higher skill and in part due to compensation
for risk. Interestingly, the spread between the two consumption levels widens as τ rises. The
reason is that as τ grows, entrepreneurs grow increasingly more skilled and less risk-averse
compared to pensioners, so their initial wealth is increasingly high and so is their amount
of risk-taking. As a result, the income difference between the average entrepreneur and the
average pensioner increases with τ . However, when we calculate the variance of consumption
across individual agents (equation (31)), we see a hump-shaped pattern.


3.2.       Sources of Inequality

To understand the hump-shaped pattern in inequality, we decompose the consumption vari-
ance from equation (31) into three components and plot them in Figure 3. The first com-
ponent, plotted at the bottom, is due to the difference between the entrepreneurs’ and
pensioners’ average consumption levels.20 When τ is small, so is this component because
there are hardly any pensioners (i.e., m (I) ≈ 1). Even though the difference between the
average consumption levels is large (see Figure 2), this difference does not contribute much
to total variance since almost all agents are entrepreneurs. When τ rises, the component
initially rises, for two reasons. First, the difference between the average consumption levels
grows with τ , as discussed in the previous paragraph. Second, the mass of pensioners grows
as well, making this difference more important. But when τ grows so large that most agents
are pensioners, this difference becomes less important again, leading to a hump-shaped pat-
tern in the first component. In other words, as τ keeps rising, the fraction of pensioners
keeps growing, and inequality declines as more and more agents become equally poor.

   The second component of inequality is due to heterogeneity in skill across entrepreneurs.
For most values of τ , this is the smallest of the three components. The component declines
when τ rises because the rising threshold for µi reduces the heterogeneity in µi among
entrepreneurs. Loosely speaking, when the tax rate is high, heterogeneity in skill does not
matter much because all entrepreneurs are highly skilled.

   The third component, plotted at the top of Figure 3, is due to differences in returns on
 20                                  τ2           (1−τ)2
      This component is equal to   1−m(I)     +    m(I)    − 1, as noted earlier.


                                                              18
the entrepreneurs’ investments. This investment risk component, driven by pure luck, is the
largest source of inequality for any τ .21 The component initially rises because a higher τ
selects entrepreneurs whose firms are more valuable. Random fluctuations in firm values
are then bigger in units of consumption, pushing consumption variance up. The component
eventually declines with τ because the mass of entrepreneurs shrinks. That is, when the tax
rate is high, investment risk does not matter much because there is little investment.

   In addition to inequality in consumption, we also compute inequality in expected utility
to gain some insight into the welfare implications of redistribution. We express expected
utility in consumption terms, based on certainty equivalent consumption levels. Agent i’s
certainty equivalent consumption, CEi,T , is the risk-free consumption that makes the agent
equally happy as his equilibrium risky consumption Ci,T :
                                                  " 1−γ #

                           1 − m (I)
Since pensioners do not employ their skill, their CEi,T ’s do not depend on µi , but they do
depend on γi because pensioners face aggregate risk. Entrepreneurs’ CEi,T ’s depend on both
µi and γi . We scale each agent’s CEi,T by the average CEi,T across all agents, analogous to
the scaling in equation (29): sCE        R CEi,T .    We then calculate the variance of sCE
                               i,T =       CEi,T di                                      i,T across
agents, our measure of inequality in expected utility, and plot it against τ .

   Figure 4 shows that inequality in expected utility (solid line) is much smaller than in-
equality in consumption (dotted line). One reason is that realized consumption reflects
realizations of random shocks whereas expected utility does not. Another, more subtle, rea-
son is that many risk-averse agents prefer the safer consumption of a pensioner to the riskier
consumption of an entrepreneur even though the latter consumption is higher on average.
Such agents consume relatively little, enhancing consumption inequality, but their expected
utility is relatively high due to the lower risk associated with a pensioner’s income.

   Figure 4 also shows that, unlike inequality in consumption, inequality in expected utility is
a decreasing function of τ . Heavier taxation thus implies less dispersion in ex-ante happiness.
However, the average CEi,T across all agents (dashed line) also decreases with τ because
  21
    In the same spirit, Kacperczyk, Nosal, and Stevens (2015) show empirically that inequality in income
derived from financial markets contributes significantly to total income inequality.


                                                   19
higher τ implies less investment and thus a lower expected total output (dash-dot line). In
other words, a higher τ makes agents more equal in utility terms, but it also makes the
average agent worse off. As τ rises toward one, all agents become equally unhappy.

   The distribution of realized consumption is right-skewed across agents, for two reasons.
First, consumption is right-skewed among entrepreneurs, due to its convexity in µi , εT , and
εi,T (see equation (12)). Second, most entrepreneurs consume more than pensioners, due to
higher skill and larger risk exposure. This is realistic—right skewness in consumption is well
known to exist in the data. Certainty equivalent consumption is also right-skewed, due to
convexity in µi , but less so than realized consumption due to the absence of convexity in
random shocks (see equation (43)). We plot both distributions in the Internet Appendix.

   Panel A of Figure 5 plots our second measure of inequality: the income share of the top
10% of agents (equation (34)). This is the measure we use in our empirical analysis. Similar
to the first measure, the top income share is a concave function of τ , but its peak occurs
earlier so its relation to τ is largely negative.


3.3.    Productivity

Panel B of Figure 5 plots expected aggregate productivity, computed as the annualized
expected growth rate of total capital, or (1/T )E [BT /(m(I)B0 ) − 1], against τ . Productivity
increases with τ due to the selection effect described earlier: a higher τ implies a higher
average level of skill among entrepreneurs. When τ is high, only the most productive agents
are willing to become entrepreneurs. The amount of invested capital is then small, but this
capital grows fast due to entrepreneurs’ high productivity. In other words, heavier taxation
implies lower total output but higher productivity.

    We interpret the expected growth rate of capital as productivity because it captures the
ratio of output (BT ) to input (m(I)B0). As discussed earlier, a natural interpretation of the
input is the capacity to work for a given number of hours. Under that interpretation, our
productivity variable is output per hour worked, which is also the measure of productivity
that we use in our empirical analysis.


3.4.    Asset Prices

Panel C of Figure 5 plots the expected return on the market portfolio, annualized, as a
function of τ . The expected return falls as τ rises, due to selection: a higher τ implies that

                                              20
entrepreneurs are less risk-averse, on average. Given their lower risk aversion, agents demand
a lower risk premium to hold stocks, resulting in a lower expected market return.

   Panel D of Figure 5 plots the level of stock prices, measured by the market portfolio’s
M/B ratio, as a function of τ . M/B exhibits a concave and mostly negative relation to τ : it
increases with τ until τ = 15% but then it decreases. This nonlinear pattern results from the
interaction of three effects. On the one hand, a higher τ directly reduces each firm’s market
value by reducing the after-tax cash flow to stockholders. On the other hand, both selection
effects push the aggregate stock price level up. First, a higher τ implies that entrepreneurs
are more skilled, on average, pushing up the average firm’s expected cash flow. Second,
a higher τ implies that entrepreneurs are less risk-averse, on average, pushing down the
discount rate. The selection effects prevail initially because they are very strong for small
values of τ , as shown in Figure 1, but the direct effect prevails eventually.


3.5.     Varying Heterogeneity in Skill and Risk Aversion

The patterns in Figure 5 are robust to changes in σµ and σγ . When we vary these parameters
around their baseline values, we observe some level shifts but the patterns remain very similar
to those in Figure 5: hump shapes in Panels A and D, growth in Panel B, and decline in
Panel C. We summarize the results here and show the plots in the Internet Appendix.

   Higher values of σµ raise the values of all four variables from Figure 5. A higher σµ
implies more dispersion in skill and, consequently, more inequality. A higher σµ also raises
expected aggregate productivity, in two ways. First, it amplifies the selection effect whereby
only sufficiently skilled agents become entrepreneurs. Second, there is a convexity effect
whereby more dispersion in individual growth rates increases the aggregate growth rate. For
example, if half of agents have high skill and half have low skill, aggregate growth is faster
than if all agents have average skill because the high-skill agents more than compensate for
the low-skill agents in terms of aggregate growth.22 A higher σµ lifts the expected return
because it strengthens the importance of µi at the expense of γi in the entrepreneur selection
mechanism. As a result of the weaker selection on γi , a higher σµ implies a higher average γi
among entrepreneurs, which pushes up the expected return. Finally, an increase in σµ raises
M/B by increasing expected cash flow by enough to overcome the expected return effect.

   The effect of σγ on inequality is small and that on the expected return is parameter-
dependent. But an increase in σγ reduces productivity because it strengthens the importance
  22
    A closely related convexity effect is emphasized by Pástor and Veronesi (2003, 2006) who argue that
uncertainty about a firm’s growth rate increases the firm’s value.


                                                  21
of γi at the expense of µi in the selection of entrepreneurs. Due to the weaker selection
on µi , an increase in σγ reduces the average µi among entrepreneurs, thereby depressing
productivity. Since lower productivity means lower expected cash flow, a higher σγ also
reduces M/B. While the effects of σµ and σγ are interesting, we focus on the effects of τ .


3.6.     Other Special Cases

Sections 3.1. through 3.5. analyze the special case of our model in which θ, the share of firm
i that must be retained by entrepreneur i, approaches one (i.e., θ → 1). In this section,
we consider two other special cases for which we can derive analytical results and prove the
existence of the equilibrium: homogeneous risk aversion (Section 3.6.1.) and no systematic
risk (Section 3.6.2.). In both cases, we no longer assume θ → 1; instead, we consider any
θ ∈ (0, 1) and analyze the effect of θ on quantities of interest. While both of these special
cases are instructive, they have less interesting asset pricing implications than the case of
θ → 1. Discount rate effects are absent from both cases—homogeneity in risk aversion takes
away selection on γi and the exclusion of systematic risk makes the aggregate stock market
risk-free. To save space, we only summarize the results for these two special cases in this
section. A formal analysis of both cases is in the Internet Appendix.


3.6.1.   Special Case: Common Risk Aversion


In this section, we assume that all agents have the same risk aversion: γi = γ. To obtain
closed-form solutions, we also make the distributional assumptions (36), (37), and (39).

   With common risk aversion, we obtain α(γi ) = α, which implies α = 1 (see equation (23)).
As a result, the entrepreneur’s bond allocation from equation (14) simplifies to N0i0 = 0. Since
all agents are equally risk-averse, there is no borrowing or lending. All entrepreneurs have
the same investment portfolio: θ in their own firm and 1 − θ in the stock market.

   In equilibrium, agent i becomes an entrepreneur if and only if he is sufficiently skilled:

                                           µi > µ ,                                        (45)

where µ is a given cutoff. The mass of entrepreneurs, m (I), decreases with the tax rate as
well as with θ. Specifically, we prove that ∂µ/∂τ > 0 and ∂µ/∂θ > 0, so that
                                        ∂m (I)
                                               < 0                                         (46)
                                         ∂τ
                                        ∂m (I)
                                               < 0.                                        (47)
                                         ∂θ

                                              22
The first result is explained earlier in the context of equation (41). The second result is
also intuitive: a higher θ makes entrepreneurship less appealing because it increases each
entrepreneur’s exposure to idiosyncratic risk.

   The implications for inequality follow from a closed-form solution for the cross-sectional
variance of consumption. This variance is increasing with the cross-sectional dispersion in
                                                                      2
skill, σµ . The variance is also increasing with the product θ2 (eσ1 T − 1), which captures the
contribution of investment risk to inequality. A higher value of σ1 indicates higher volatility
of idiosyncratic shocks, and a higher value of θ implies a larger role for those shocks. The
positive effect of θ on inequality is present as long as there is idiosyncratic risk (i.e., σ12 > 0),
and the positive effect of σ1 is present unless that risk is fully diversifiable (i.e., θ > 0).

   Solving for asset prices is straightforward because the state price density πT from equation
(20) simplifies dramatically, becoming proportional to e−γεT . Interestingly, the stochastic
discount factor is independent of θ, unlike in the general case in Section 2. Since all firms
have the same risk exposure (equation (1)), all entrepreneurs’ positions are symmetric ex
ante. Therefore, the risk aversion in the economy is the common risk aversion γ and stock
prices are unaffected by θ. The M/B ratio of firm i is given by
                                  Mi,0
                                       = (1 − τ ) e(µi −γσ )T ,
                                                          2
                                                                                                  (48)
                                  B0
which is the expected after-tax cash flow adjusted for risk. The risk adjustment is simple
                                                2T
because all expected returns are equal to eγσ        − 1. We obtain a closed-form solution for the
aggregate M/B ratio by averaging equation (48) across all entrepreneurs. This M/B ratio is
increasing in σµ due to the selection effect from equation (45) as well as the convexity effect
discussed earlier. Due to the same selection effect, the effects of taxation on stock prices and
productivity are similar as before, except that there are no discount rate effects.


3.6.2.   Special Case: No Systematic Risk


We now assume that there are no systematic shocks: εT = 0 in equation (1). Since the
average of all idiosyncratic shocks is zero, the aggregate stock market portfolio is risk-free.
All entrepreneurs invest α(γi ) = 1 in the stock market and nothing in bonds.

   Assuming that µi and γi are independently distributed across agents, we prove that a
unique equilibrium exists in this economy. The independence assumption is sufficient but not
necessary. The screen for entrepreneurship is a simpler version of Proposition 3, implying
selection effects based on both µi and γi . While the selection on µi has the same effects as
before, the selection on γi has no discount rate effects because the discount rate is always

                                                 23
zero: stock prices are given by Proposition 6 with r = 0. Relations (46) and (47) hold in
this case as well, indicating that the mass of entrepreneurs decreases with both τ and θ. The
formula for consumption variance is a simpler version of equation (31), indicating a role for
θ similar to that in Section 3.6.1. Besides all these results, this case also allows us to prove
that the right-hand-side of condition (19) is increasing in γi and that entrepreneurs consume
more than pensioners on average, as noted earlier (see footnote 19).


4.      Empirical Analysis

In this section, we examine the model’s predictions empirically. To preview the results, the
evidence is broadly consistent with the model.


4.1.     Data and Variable Definitions

We collect country-level annual data for all 34 members of the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). Our tax burden variable is denoted by T AX. The
value of T AX in a given year is the ratio of total government tax revenue in that year to
GDP in the same year. These data come from the OECD Statistics database.

     Our main measure of income inequality is the top 10% income share, or T OP , obtained
from the World Top Income Database. While the database contains data on multiple per-
centage cutoffs, the top 10% share has the best data coverage. Our second measure of
inequality is the Gini coefficient of disposable income after taxes and transfers, obtained
from the OECD Income Distribution database. The data coverage for Gini is not as good as
for the top 10% income share; hence we prioritize the latter measure. Both measures exhibit
frequent gaps in the data. For example, for New Zealand, the Gini coefficient is 0.335 in
1995 and 0.339 in 2000, with missing data in 1996 through 1999. For Germany between 1961
and 1998, the top 10% income share is available only once every three years, ranging from
30.30% to 34.71%. Given the high persistence in these series, we use linear interpolation to
fill in the missing values that are sandwiched between valid entries.

     Our measure of productivity is GDP per hour worked, or P ROD. It is measured in 2005
prices at purchasing power parity in U.S. dollars. The data come from the OECD Statistics
database. The remaining macroeconomic variables also come from the OECD. Real GDP
growth, or GDP GRO, is the growth in the expenditure-based measure of GDP. To capture
the level of GDP, we use GDP per capita, or GDP P C, also measured in 2005 prices at
purchasing power parity in dollars. Finally, INF L measures consumer price inflation.

                                              24
   Aggregate stock market index returns, RET , come from Global Financial Data (GFD).
We download nominal returns from GFD and convert them into real returns by using inflation
data from the OECD. For each country, we use the returns on the country’s leading stock
market index. The stock market indices are listed in the Internet Appendix.

   We measure the level of stock prices by the aggregate market-to-book ratio, or M/B.
The value of M/B for a given country in a given year is the ratio of M to B, where M is
the total market value of equity of all public firms in the country at the beginning of the
year and B is the total book value of equity at the end of the previous fiscal year. If there
are fewer than 10 firms over which the intra-country sums can be computed, we treat M/B
as missing. The data come from Datastream’s Global Equity Indices databases.

   For all variables, we calculate their time-series averages at the country level. To calculate
the average stock market return, we use all available data from GFD. These data begin as
early as 1792 for the U.S. but as late as 1995 for Poland. Since stock returns are notoriously
volatile and roughly independent over time, it makes sense to estimate average returns from
the longest possible data series. For all other variables, which are much more persistent, we
calculate their time-series averages over the period 1980 through 2013. We choose this period
to make the time periods underlying the averages reasonably well aligned across variables,
given that different datasets begin at different points in time. For example, the tax data are
available for 1965 through 2013, the M/B data first appear in 1981, the P ROD data begin in
1970, and the Gini coefficient data begin mostly in the 1980s. The data on top income shares
begin in the 1970s and 80s for most countries, though for some countries they begin much
earlier. For the time-series average to be valid, we require at least 10 annual observations. In
the Internet Appendix, we show the results from cross-sectional regressions over the longer
1965–2013 period, which lead to the same conclusions as those from 1980–2013.


4.2.    Empirical Results

Our theory makes predictions about the effects of taxes on inequality, productivity, stock
prices, and returns. Since tax burdens are highly persistent over time, we examine their
variation across countries. To make causal statements, we would need to assume that tax
burdens are assigned to countries randomly. Some randomness is surely present because a
country’s tax burden reflects the country’s traditions and cultural values, which are exoge-
nous to a large extent. Even though the tax burdens are unlikely to be fully exogenous, our
empirical analysis seems relevant as it examines the key econometric associations predicted
by the model. While we present only correlations, we interpret them through the model.


                                              25
    Panel A of Figure 6 plots our measure of income inequality, T OP , against the tax burden,
T AX, across the OECD countries. For both variables, we plot their time-series averages in
1980–2013, as described earlier. Given the high degree of year-to-year persistence in both
variables, it makes sense to average them over time and focus on the cross-country variation.23
Another reason to take this approach is that a key variable examined below, the average
stock market return, is a time-series average, by construction. In addition to plotting the
individual country-level observations, the figure plots two lines of best fit, one from the linear
cross-country regression of average T OP on average T AX (solid line) and the other from
the quadratic regression of T OP on T AX and T AX 2 (dashed line).24 These lines indicate
a negative and approximately linear relation between T OP and T AX.

    Table 1 shows that the negative relation is statistically significant, with the t-statistic of
−3.53. The relation becomes even stronger (t = −4.46) after including the macroeconomic
controls introduced earlier, GDP GRO, INF L, and GDP P C. A negative relation between
T OP and T AX is consistent with the model. Table 2 shows no significant convexity or
concavity in this relation. While the model predicts concavity, its lack in the data does not
necessarily violate the model because the concavity is driven by very low tax rates that are
rarely observed in the data (see Panel A of Figure 5). We reach the same conclusions when
we use the Gini coefficient in place of T OP .

    Panel B of Figure 6 shows a strong positive relation between productivity, P ROD, and
T AX (t = 4.23; see Table 1), as predicted by the model. This relation survives the inclusion
of the controls. The most important control is GDP per capita (GDP P C), which enters
with a highly significant positive coefficient. This is not surprising since P ROD is GDP per
hour worked. What is interesting is that even after controlling for GDP per capita, GDP
per hour worked is significantly positively related to T AX (t = 3.53).

    Panel C of Figure 6 shows a negative relation between the average stock market return,
RET , and T AX (t = −2.92), as predicted by the model. Stock returns are in local currency
terms and adjusted for inflation.25 The negative relation weakens after adding the three
controls (t = −1.51), as shown in Table 1. Of course, with only 33 observations, regressions
of average returns on four right-hand side variables have limited power. Moreover, the
relation is economically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in T AX is associated
with a decrease in the average real local currency return by 1.23% per year.
  23
     For example, the autocorrelation in T AX exceeds 0.9 for 10 countries and 0.8 for 23 countries.
  24
     The slope estimator from this average-on-average cross-sectional regression is sometimes referred to as
the “between estimator” in panel data terminology. From now on, we suppress “average” in the description
of the variables, so that T OP and T AX refer to a country’s time-series averages of these variables.
  25
     The results for U.S. dollar returns and nominal returns are very similar. See the Internet Appendix.



                                                    26
     Panel D of Figure 6 shows a negative and concave relation between the level of stock
prices, M/B, and T AX, as predicted by the model. While the concavity is statistically
significant (t = −2.84), the negativity is not (t = −0.81). The addition of the three controls
makes the negative relation statistically significant (t = −2.16). The relation is also econom-
ically significant: a one-standard-deviation increase in T AX is associated with a decrease in
M/B by 0.11, which is substantial relative to the standard deviation of M/B.26

     We conduct various robustness tests. We consider two measures of income inequality and
three measures of stock market returns, as noted earlier. We also estimate the cross-country
relations between T AX and the other variables in different ways, as we explain next. We
summarize the results here and report the details in the Internet Appendix.

     First, instead of running cross-country regressions on time-series averages, we run the
cross-country regressions year by year and examine the time series of the estimated cross-
sectional slope coefficients, along with 95% confidence intervals. The results are very similar
to those reported here. For T OP , the point estimate of the slope on T AX is negative in
each year since 1971, and it is significantly negative ever since 1985. The relation between
P ROD and T AX is significantly positive in each year since 1971. For RET , the point
estimates of the slope on T AX are negative in every year between 1965 and 2013, and they
are statistically significant ever since 1980. For M/B, the slope estimate is negative in 27
of the 33 years, and five of the remaining six years occur around year 2000, in which stock
valuations as measured by M/B were unusually high (the Internet “bubble”). In short, the
relations of T AX to T OP , P ROD, RET , and M/B are robust. Moreover, since our plots of
the time series of cross-sectional slopes begin in 1965, they show that our choice of 1980 as
the starting date for the between-estimator analysis is not crucial to our conclusions. Finally,
we run panel regressions with time fixed effects, again reaching the same conclusions.



5.       Conclusions

Our model sheds new light on the effects of redistributive taxation. The model generates
selection effects whereby entrepreneurs tend to be more skilled and less risk-averse when
taxation is heavier. Through these selection effects, the model yields a rich set of predictions
relating the tax burden to income inequality, aggregate productivity, and asset prices. Cross-
country empirical evidence is consistent with those predictions.

     Our work can be extended in many ways. Given our focus on redistribution, our simple
 26
      The cross-country standard deviations of T AX and M/B are 7.64% and 0.29, respectively.


                                                    27
model features only two types of agents: entrepreneurs, who pay taxes, and pensioners, who
consume them. It would be natural to add a third type, “workers,” who are employed by
entrepreneurs and who can invest their wages in financial markets. The model’s implications
would depend on the assumptions about the wage contract and the role of workers in the
production function, but we believe that our main selection effects would remain present.
If all agents derive the same disutility from working, we expect agents to self-select so that
workers are more skilled than pensioners (e.g., Meltzer and Richard, 1981). And if wages are
subject to enough idiosyncratic risk (e.g., through bonuses, stock options, or job risk), we
expect workers to be less risk-averse than pensioners. We thus expect pensioners to be less
skilled and more risk-averse than both workers and entrepreneurs. Since pensioners are the
only agents excluded from both production and financial markets, we expect both selection
effects to operate in ways similar to our current framework. Future work can verify these
conjectures and, in addition, examine the model’s labor market implications.

   Another interesting extension would endogenize the tax rate, possibly allowing for pro-
gressive taxation. To do so, one would need to write down the social welfare function and
find the tax rate, or schedule, that maximizes it. The optimal tax rate will in general depend
on the parameters of the social welfare function, on the distribution of skill and risk aversion
in the economy, and on the volatilities of the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks.

   Yet another extension could add heterogeneity in the riskiness of agents’ technologies.
This third dimension of heterogeneity would significantly complicate the equilibrium, but we
have some conjectures about the solution. Given imperfect risk-sharing, agents with riskier
technologies would be less likely to become entrepreneurs. A higher tax rate would select
agents with safer technologies into entrepreneurship, resulting in less risky firms and thus a
lower expected market return. This negative relation between the expected return and the
tax rate would be similar to the negative relation found in our model, except that the latter
relation is driven by the price of risk whereas the former would be driven by the quantity of
risk. We leave a more careful examination for future research.

Figure 3. Three sources of income inequality. This figure plots three components of the variance of
consumption across agents from equation (31) as a function of the tax rate τ . The black area at the bottom
plots the component due to the difference between the entrepreneurs’ and pensioners’ average consumption
levels. This component is equal to the consumption variance if all entrepreneurs consume at the same average
level of (1−τ )/m (I). The dark-grey area at the top plots the component due to differences in ex-post returns
on the entrepreneurs’ investment portfolios. This component is equal to the difference between total variance
and the first component under the assumption that all entrepreneurs have the same skill. Finally, the light-
grey area in the middle plots the component due to heterogeneity in µi across entrepreneurs. This component
is obtained as the residual by subtracting the other two components from total variance.

Figure 5. The effects of taxes in the model. This figure plots four variables as a function of the tax
rate τ . Panel A plots income inequality, measured by the income share of the top 10% of agents. Panel B
plots expected aggregate productivity, measured by the annualized expected growth rate of total capital, or
(1/T )E [BT /(m(I)B0 ) − 1]. Panel C plots the expected rate of return on the aggregate market portfolio.
Panel D plots the stock price level, measured by the market-to-book ratio of the market portfolio. All
parameter values are equal to their baseline values.

Figure 6. The effects of taxes in the data. This figure is an empirical counterpart of Figure 5. The
figure plots four variables against the tax-to-GDP ratio (T AX) across countries. Panel A plots income
inequality, measured by the top 10% income share (T OP ). Panel B plots productivity, measured by GDP
per hour worked (P ROD). Panel C plots the average stock market index return (RET ). Panel D plots the
stock price level, measured by the aggregate market-to-book ratio (M/B). All variables are computed at
the country level as time-series averages in 1980–2013, except for RET , which uses all available data. Each
dot, labeled with the OECD country code, is a country-level observation. The solid line in each panel is the
line of best fit from a linear regression. The dashed lines are the lines of best fit from quadratic regressions
of T OP (Panel A) and M/B (Panel D) on T AX and T AX 2 .

                              The role of taxes: Linear regressions

This table reports the results from cross-country regressions of the time-series average of the dependent
variable on the time-series averages of the variables given in the row labels. There are four dependent
variables: (i) income inequality, measured by the country’s share of income going to the top 10% (columns
1 and 2), (ii) productivity, measured by the country’s GDP per hour worked (columns 3 and 4), (iii) the
stock market index return, measured in local currency in real terms (columns 5 and 6), and (iv) the stock
price level, measured by the country’s aggregate market-to-book ratio (columns 7 and 8). The independent
variables are the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio (T AX), GDP growth (GDP GRO), GDP per capita (GDP P C),
and consumer price inflation (IN F L). All time-series averages are computed from all available annual data
between 1980 and 2013, except for average stock returns, which are computed from all available data. t-
statistics are in parentheses. The coefficient on GDP P C is multiplied by 100. The intercepts are included
but not reported. ∗ p < 0.1, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

This table reports the results from cross-country regressions of the time-series average of the dependent
variable on the time-series averages of the variables given in the row labels. There are two dependent
variables: income inequality, measured by the country’s share of income going to the top 10% (columns
1 and 2), and the stock price level, measured by the country’s aggregate market-to-book ratio (columns 3
and 4). The independent variables are the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio, both plain and squared (T AX and
T AX 2 ), GDP growth (GDP GRO), GDP per capita (GDP P C), and consumer price inflation (IN F L). All
time-series averages are computed from all available annual data between 1980 and 2013. t-statistics are in
parentheses. The coefficients on T AX 2 and GDP P C are multiplied by 100. The intercepts are included but
not reported. ∗ p < 0.1, ∗∗ p < 0.05, ∗∗∗ p < 0.01.
