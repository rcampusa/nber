                  Rules Versus Discretion in Monetary Policy




                                      ABSTRACT


          This paper examines the case for rules rather than discretion in tne

conduct of monetary policy, from both historical and analytic perspectives.

The paper starts with the rules of the game unoer the gold standard.            Ihese

rules   ,ere ill—defined and    nt   adhered to; active discretionary policy was

pursued to defend the gold standard—but the gold standard caine closer to a

regime of rules than the current system.          The arguments for rules in generl

developed by Milton Friedman are described         mo    appraised; alternative rules

including tne constant money growth rati         rule,   interest rate rules, nominal

GNP targeting, and price level rules are analyzed.           Until 1977 the general

argument for monetary rules suffered from the apparent dominance of

discretion: if   a   particular monetary policy was desirable, it could always 09

adopted by discretion.       The introduction of the notion of oynamic

inconsistency made     a   stronger case for rules,      the final sections analyze   tine


case for rules rather tnan discretion in the light of recent game tineoretic

approaches to policy analysis.

            Discretionary monetary policy has long been an anomaly to liberal

 economists,     Henry Simons addressed the issue2 in his classic paper 'Rules

 versus Authorities in Monetary Policy" (1948,       original in i936;i

       The monetary problem stands out today as the great intellectual challenge
       to the liberal faith.  . . The liberal creed demands the organization of
       our economic life largely tnrough individual participation in a game xutn
       definite rules. ... [Diefinite, stable, legislative rules of tne game as
       to monej are of paramount importance to the survival of a system oased on
       freedom of enterprise. (pp. 160—162, emphasis in original;

          Simons posed the issue as one of rules versus authority or, rules

versus ziscretion.     That dichotomy should rather be seen as a continuum, in

whim     the evtent of discretion left to the monetary authority is determined by

tne specificity of the objectives it is given, and the immediacy of the link

oetween its actions and the attainment of those omiectives.        At one extreme of

Siscretion, a monetary authority could have the full powers of the Fed (to ouy

and sell securities, set tne discount rate, reserve requirements, And other

regulations( and be given the objective of promoting economic well—being.

           Bisons conscoered alternative monetary rules, including constancy ci

                 ,




was for the central bank to stabilize the price level.                           Mints 11950)        likewise

supported a price—level         ruI   for the United States                   Milton Friedman 1)948)

after echoing Bisons          point of principle, developed               a    framework in which

fiscal and monetary policy would operate automatically.                              It included 10O.

reserve money, essentially constant government spending and tax rates, and,

through full monetary financing of deficits, countercyclical monetary growth.

           Friedean 11948)      raised the question of whether long and variable lags

in the operation of policy might cause the active (thouph automatic)

countercyclical policy of the framework                  t   be destabilizing.              In   fp..rsm+cr

                         (19b0)     he argued, on the basis of research later puoliehed

in Friedman and Schwartz          (l93)   ,    that    the the Fed ha; frequently teen a source
of economic instability.            Given the record and the theoretical implicationS of

long and variable lags, Friedman advocated the rule that the growth rate of

money be held ionstant.             On the general issue of rules versus discretion, he

suggested that discretion had permitted destabilizing shifts in monetary

policy am the central bank had deen              wayd   by public opinion arid political

pressures) ar      that, zecause the criteria for judging the performance of the

monetary authority are SO           imprecise,   the   Feds   discretionary powers had

enabled it    to   escape serious public scrutiny.
             new set of arguments in the rules versus discretion debate developed

frori the   dynamic inconsistency literature brought to macroeconomics               by cydland

and Prescott l977)        At the formal level, Friedman s            analysis uffermd    from

the logical weakness that discretion seemed to dominate ruleer if                a   particular

rule would stabilize     trim       economy, then discretionary policymakerm could always

behave that way——end retain the flexibility to change the rule as rieeded.

The dynamic inconsistency literature snowed that precommitment oy monetary

authorities could improve the behavior of the economy.

            In this chapter     I   first discuss the gold standard as a quasi—automatic

monetary policy regime, then turn to the issues raised by the Chicago school.

Alternative monetary rules are esamined in Section III. The modern literature,

 variations of not much more than 1—2/. per annum to allow for changes in

The oanking school disagreed on these issues.      Botn schools oelieved that the

currency should be Kept convertiole into gold6.

           The temper of the times, soon to produce tna Corn Laws, favored tne

use of markets and not discretionary authority.       The Bank Act, reflecting

currency school views', put    a   strict limit on the Bank s issue of fiduciary

money and required all other Bank of England notes to be backed      1007.   by

gold".    The Bank of England had claimed since 1832 to be determining tne

quantity of currency by following currency acnool principles', but tns

currency school was nonetheless severely critical of the Bank a misuse of its

discretionary powers.''

          Banking scnool opponents of the Bill argued both tnat it was a

mistake to treat only currency as money, and that the gob       stancard rule for

         Despite the 1844 Bank Act! British monetary policy during tne period

from the Bank Act until 1914 was actively managec.    The need for management

arose!   as the banking scncol had anticipated, from the presence ok fractional

reserve banking.    ClAims on the Bank of England were throughout the period as

good as gold.    Virtually the entire gold reserve of the country was neld by

the Bank of England.      In several crises, the Bank in lending freely to meet


largely internal drains of currency exceeded the legal limit on its uncovered

iiabilties.     It was typically later indemnified by Act of Parliament.

         The central role to be played by bank rate in the operation of the

gold standard was not anticipated in 1844.      International capital flows

responding to interest rate differentials moved gold far more rapidly than

the classical specie—flow mechanism,    During the heyday of the international

than the level of the rate.

II. The    Chicag School    and Rules_versus Discretion.


           The Federal Reserve System was originally evpected to operate withi

a gold—5tandard setting, although in specifying that the money stock was to

be elastic, the Federal Reserve Act provided a contradictory guide to

nonetar policy.        Because it   started   operating suring World War               I   wnen many

of the belligerents were effectively not on the gold standard, tne System


 began operations witn no effective legislative criterion for determining the

total stock    of money.    The   discretionary   ludgment    of     a group of men was

inevitably    substituted for the quasi—automatic discipline 0f the gold

standard     (FrieSman and Schwartz, 1963,      p. 193).

           the dLscretionary operation of monetary policy created little

controversy so long as it was successful          during   the     1920 a.       Proposals for

monetary reform in the United States proliferates after the debacie of

monetary policy in the Breat Depression, Impressed by bank                     failures,     a group

Hart   (1952, 1935 in original) provides an account and critique of the
'Chicago Plan", which he says was independently developed by L.aucruin Currie
at Harvard.
coulo not reouce the money stock, as they had in the Great ueprssson,

Proponents included Irving Fisher (1945                  origznal in     935)2      whose simplest

plan   requirec   the      money stock   to be held      constant    alter   a currency     commission

hed bought    sufficient       governeent   securities      to   bring   reserves   up to    100%.


kmong the alternatives proposed by Fiener were constancy of the per capita

noninal money stock and a price stabilization rule.                      Fisher also implied         tr,at


interest might be paid on reserves,

          Mlthough the Chicago arguments for rules were originally developed in

the oontevt of the 100% reeerve plan, they are not inherently related.

Simons and Fisher could easily have advocated stabilizing the prize level                             in

a fractional reeerve system.             Friedman could later advocate the constant

growth rate rule without requiring the economy first to move to 100% money.

             change to 100% reserves would have removed one potential weakness

in an automatic system——the danger that a ioes of confidence would lead to

runs on banks,       But it should have been anticipated then, and is clear now

from the fate of regulation in the seventies, that it would have Been

impossible to maintain the restriction against the use of all other financial

intermediary liazilities as means of payeent.tt                     The system would have

required frequent legislative or discretionary rule changes to keep up with

private sector attempts to circumvent the artificial barrier, and increased

monetary uncertainty.           Rather than prevent sharp changes in velocity the 100%

acknowledges their meeorandum on the 100% plan as the original source of
many of the idees in the book.
2tSimons (1948, p.l72) was aware of the difficulties. He thought that a way
of handling them could be found 'when we conceive the problem broadly as
that of achieving a financial structure in which the volume of short—term
borrowing would be minieized, and in which only the government would be able
to create (and destroy) either effective circulating media or obligations
generally acceptable as hoards media."

would nave ensured continuing shifts in velocity.            Monetary rules are

discusseo in tne remaincer of this chapter without reference to         l)
reserves.

            it   is useful to distinguish two levels of argument in tie rules

versus discretion debate.          The first is general, examining tne case in

principie for rules rather than discretion, without necessarily spacsfying

the rule or details of the oiscretionary system.          The second is specific,

discussing wnetner the money supply should vary one way or the other, or

whetner ncminax interest rates should oe fixed,         and may be relevant to botn

ciscretionary and rules systems.

           Friedman s general arguments for rules ratner than discretion are

tnat   a   rule enaoies the nonetary authority to witnstand political pressures,

provides criteria for judging its performance, and ensures certainty aoout

economic policy for private agents,         His specific argument for a constant

growth rate rule was entirely pragmatic, that this would reduce economic

instaiiiity.        I   briefly discuss Friedman's general case for rules and then in

the nevt section examine alternative operating rules.

            insulating tne central bank from political pressures is,     I   believe, a

worthy purpose, though it accords ill with a general preference for

democratic decision        making.     The other two arguments are unpersuasive.


--The payment of interest on reserves would reduce the incentive to invent
non—bank depcsitory institutions, though it is unlikely even so that
attempts to differentiate sharply between ianxs and other intermediaries in
order to control the quantity of money would be successful.
Friedman 1962) remarks on the inherently undemocratic nature of central
banking, referring to the implicit view of Smile Moreau, a governor of the
Bank of France ietween the Wars, that he, Norman, Schacnt and Strong zoulo
run tne economies of tne world if only they were left alone to do so. The
more recent view is that central oanks follow the prevailing political
winds. Society of course makes arrangements to snield other types of
oecision making——for instance legal——from immediate political pressures.

Certainty iDout economic policy is not a compelling argument for rules

either.      Economic agents want certainty about prices and about output; cans

aszze      they have no inherent interest in the behavior of the stock oK money.

If   a   discretionary policy that produced an unpredictaDle             patri   for money

ensured price stability and full employment, the uncertainty about monetary

policy would be of no account.

            Leaving aside the dynamic inconsistency argument that will be

discussed later, it is difficult to evaluate the argument of principle made

by bisons and most proponents of rules.                  successful discretionary monetary

policy that maintains reasonable price stability and employment will likely

do more    t   maintain the general use of free merkets and personal freedoms

than an unsuccessful rule that causes discontent over tie basic organization

of tie economy.        I    will   therefore analyze alternative policies with differing

degrees of discretion in terms            4   the likely economic outcomes, leaving the

reader to factor in his or her preference for rules as               a   matter of principle.



III.     lternative Rules.


            In this section I ccn;ider alternative monetary policies: tnie


Friedman     cntant        money growth rule the possibility of feedback monetary

rules, including the frequent modern proposals for              a   neinal       NP   rule; the
                                                         13


Fisher-Simons rule of                a   price level target and the Fisher "compensated

dollar" proposal.              I   do not consider exchange rate based rules.

Lh_catnI_?Qth_jQAkLvFriedman's                                   argument for the constant growth

rate rule-'         rather than an active feedback rule is that there are long anb

variable lags in the effects of monetary policy.                               Thus any active policy that

esponos to current events may have its effects only at an inappropriate

time.     Let   i     oe the        level   of a target variable, say nominal SNP, and nt                   be

the level of the money stock.                    The aim of policy is to minisioe the variance

of t,,,   conditional      on infornation available up to period (t—si.                          Suppose that


cI,        Y    =   C1   m ,t        Yt—.   4   t" i,t   mt—i        +   Ct


where      .    and Si.t           are stochastic coefficients, and St               is   a   diaturoance

term, which can be taken to ie white noise.

          Consider now the role of lags.                      First, in tie absence of sags, active

policy may be unnecessary: if the m, in                       tl:k       were identically cero, anC gi 'en

that      is white noise, active monetary policy could not reduce the variance

of nominal GNP.          Long lags in the system, reflected in the m., make policy

potentially more useful.                    The mechanisms that produce such lags are likely

also to cause monetary policy to work with long lags.                               Long lags in the

effects of policy by themselves are not necessarily an impediment to tne

successful use of active countercyclical policy. lFecher end Cooper, lT73).

If    the coefficients in (1) were not stochastic, then optimal monetary policy

could evactiy offset the lagged effects of earlier disturbances and monetar,

policy by setting


"4kfter some discussion, Friedman (1960) proposes there be no seasonal
variation in the growth rate of money.   This would restore the seasonal to
interest rates.

          Une fifficulcy    with   the   policy   in   (2; is that   it   could   produce

instrument instability, requiring ever larger changes in the money stock to

offset its lagged effects (Holbrook, 1972).              it would te more likely to do so

the more slowly the effects of money on output build up; if                       were snail,

the rule ;2) would call for lerge fluctuations in the money stocu,                      In that

sense long lags of policy could make the active policy in )2                      uncesirable,

but allowing for costs of instrument instability in the objective function,

optinal policy would still in this model be active

          Uncertainty about the lag coefficients, the                      means that active

use of monetary policy adds variability to income                Active policy can still

be used, cautiously, to reduce the variance of output, but the gain may ne

smali.2         The presence of variable lags, then, makes optimal policy less

active, and in that sense is an argument in favor of the constant growth rate

rule.     Totally inactive policy could be optimal if the mere use of active

policy adds uncertainty to the system independent of the particular active

policy followed.26

          Frieomans evidence for long and variable lags               in the effects of


money is based on a comparison of turning points in the growth rate of money

and cyclical peaks in activity in NBER reference cycles. v'                  Reduced form

evidence, for example of the St Louis Fed model (Andersen and Jordan, l97(H


2This is the effect of multiplier uncertainty, discussed by Braimerd
(1967).
ThThie could be the case if econoeic agents viewed the Fed as either being
totally inactive, or else potentially a source of instability——as implicit
in Friedean e development of the case for a constant growth rate rule.
27Friedmam (1969, original in 1961) discusses his evidence and criticisms of
it.

:cnnection between money growth and the subsequent behavior of nominal GNF.'

in the It,        LouiS model active monetary policy can be stabilizing even wnen

lags are treateo as stochastic. (Cooper and Fischer, 1974

           In tne above example, a zero (logaritnm of the)                money stock minimizes

the noise aoded to tne system by active monetary policy.                    Tie question arises

0f what is the corresponding monetary policy in practice (Diamond,                     l98.
Fredman regards a policy of maintaining a constant growth rate                      of money as


inactive, tnough even in this case the monetary rule has to specify whether

past misses in attaining the given growth rate are to be ignored or

corrected.             Also to be considered are the questions of which monetary

variable to target, and wnether an alternative policy such as attempting to

fiv the nininal interest rate mignt produce                 a   lower variance of the target

        Except            if the argument for      a rule is based on the principle of

minimizing the Fed s discretion, these questions cannot be answered witnout

        The strongest argument against       a   constant groath rate rule for money

is that the velocity of all money stocks hae varied substantially end with

come short—run predictability.        It can be argued tnat these   varations are

themseivee induced by unstable monetary policy, but it is hard to oelieve

that shocks to the demand for money that cause interest rate movements, and

technical progress in the payments system will not cause continuing future

changes in velocity.     Because the behavior of the stock of money per se is

not the ultimate goal of policy, there is no reason other than the fear that

any active policy will degenerate for not taking such changes into account in

setting monetary targets.

Interest Rate versus   Mg.fl!j   Targets: In a fasous article, Poole (1970)

analyoed in the context of a fiaed price IS—UI model the guestion of whether

output would oe more stable if monetary policy held the interest rate or the

quantity of money fixed in the face of shocks to the IS curve (shocks from

imvestment, consumption, or government demand for good;) and the LM curve

(money demand shocks).     The well—known answer is that interest rate pegging

stabilioes output if shocks are primarily fros money desand, and that money

stock fixing is preferable if shocks are primarily froe the IS curve.

        If   the price level is allowed to vary, and with rational

expectations, monetary policy cannot affect the behavior of output unless the

monetary authority has an informational advantage, or equivalently, if some

prices are fixed before monetary policy decisions are made3t.         Assume as

seems realistic that the monetary authority can react after wages are set.

 n   a   model with IS and LM curves, plus an aggregate supply curve in wnicn

          N related interpretation is that under nominal ONE targeting,       tne

monetary autnority announces each period a nominal ONE target rather than           a



target growth rate of money.      With the nominal ONE target justified in

public, this     isa   policy that gives the monetary authority the ciscreticn to

adjust money growth in response to changes in velocity within the perioD.

From the control theory viewpoint this change makes it possible in principle

to come closer to achieving targets.      Whether that would actually happen

would depend am themonetary authoritys success at predicting velocity and

the entent to which the greater discretion would enable it to pursue ctner

objectives.

            On this interpretation, in the context of                           a   simple three—equation

macroeconomic model——consisting of 19 and                     L.M   curves plus the Lucam supply

However, ooviously, an adverse supply shock would raise tne price level above

its target level and reduce output below its target level.                                     )Siancnard ano

Fisher      1945, p.25         naves tne specific proposal that the Fed expand the money

mtocv when the price level falls below target and contract when the price

level rises above target.                 The dynamic properties of much                   a   policy cannot im

mvah.lated    without an explicit model; lags in the operation of monetary polcy

raise the possibility tne policy would actually be destabilizing,

particularly because monetary policy seems to operate more slowly on prices

than on real SNP,             This suggests that a Fianer—Simonm rule could cause

significant fluctuations in real                StOP   in trying to stasilize the price level.


            Fisher s "compensated sollar" proposal (1920, recently revived by

                   Yet     policy evaluation and Fed policy making continue.        Economists

with evperience confidently pronounce on tne errors of tne Fed                      s    ways.     Tne

Fed continues to make discretionary policy, recently with considerable

success in terms of its oojecties. Each is using implicit and sometimes

svplicit models, of considerable sophistication.

                   The natural vehicles for studying alternative policy rules are tne

computing ability, optimal feedback rules for monetary policy can be

calculated.                However, given the variety end inadequacies of existing models,

it would be difficult to justify snshrining any of these rules in


legislation.                Until and if ever a new generation of models that meets tne

             Until 177, it appeared that discretion dominated rules, since any

gcoo rule could be adopted by oiscretion.7 Tne concept of dynamic

inconsistency, orought to macroeconomics in the rules versus discretion

context       nydland ano Prescott, 1977;                 completely cnanged tne debate.

             lynanic inconsistency occurs wnen a future policy decision that forms

part of an optimal plan formulated at an initial date is no longer optimal

from tne viewpoint of a later data, even tnough no new information has

appeared in tne meantime.                 An example of dynamic inconsistency due to nrescott

1l977    ,   oeveioped      in Fiscner         1l9G   ,   is    tnat of optimal taxation in a system

witn capital.           Under rational expectations the solution gives tax rates tnat

are ootimai conditional on their being expected by private agents,                              But once

capital iS        in   place, its supply is inelastic and               a    government acting to

maxmice tne welfare of tne representatiie individual would                              tax capital more


neavily.      The problem is            that   if the public expecteo tne government to             iclate

its announcement, economic                welfare would         oe lower tnan    if   the government coulo

commit       tsel       following tnrougn on its promised tax rate.8'
                       to

             me    application to the rules versus discretion debate comes                      from tne

claim tnat policy           will   be    dynamically consistent         if   determined by    rules.   By



 9Friedman ;1972; had argued tnat a policy aoopteo oy rule would staoiiioe
 private  sector evpectations relative to tne same policy carrieo out 0,
 oiscretion, Dot tne basis for that argument was not clear.
 4ln this section 1 draw freely on my 19Gb survey article; see also
 Cukierman 119851.
 41frecisely the same problem occurs witn the optimal inflation tax and money
 holding ICalvo, 1978); the monetary authority can always impose a lump—sum
 tax by discretely increasing the money supply and, once tne prixwte sector
 has formed expectations, is tempted to do so.
contrast1   a   government or central bank with discretion may under rational

expectations te expected to make the snort—run optimal decision every time it

can, therefore gains nothing from its opportunism, and on average produces a

worse outcome than would a government able to tie its hands.

        In tnie     eecton   I       present e sxnple Phillips—curve example of dynamic

inconsistency, and discuee the relevance to the rules versus discretion deoatw

of the example.      In the next section          I   present extensions that take reputation

kiere y' can cc interpreted as full             employment output.         The target level cf

output exceeds the natural rate.

        The assumption k         >    1   is crucial.       The cost plausible justification is

that tax distortions cause the natural rate of employment to be too low.                         That


justification allows the lose function                I.)   I   to be consistent with the single

period utility function of private agents.                      An alternative view is that the

government has different tastes than the private sector.43

dynamic inconsistency may occur whether or not the private sector and the

government have the same tastes,


 42This structure was introduced by Kydland anc Prescott )1977i and developed
 by Barro and Gordon (1983, 1983a) , Backus and Driffill (1985, 1985a;
 Canconeri (1985), Rogoff (1985) and others.
 4mMore sophisticated theories that recognize heterogeneity in private sector
 tastes and that seek to ground the governments objective function in the
 electoral process could procuce a utility function for some governments that
 would seek to raise output above the natural rate, Cukierman )1T85

Nonetheless, it would be preferable if theory could narrow down the rings

possibilities.

         The description of the privete actor's response to the governeente

deviation as a punishment raises the hope that the design of an optical

punisheant strategy sill reduce the aultiplicity of equilibria.     But unless

the private sector is thought of as a single union, St is difficult to

conceive now it can select en optical punisheent as opposed to optimally

calculating expectations.

         The more proeising route probably lies in •nriching the description

of the environment in which the policyeakers and the private sector operate.

&   Randoeizino Soverneenti   Tabellini (1983, 1985), Backus and Driffill (i985,

i985a) and Barro (1985)    apply the Kreps—Wilson (1982) reputation eodel to the

inflation problem.     Tabellini, and Backus and Driffill consider a sonopoly

union setting wages in a game with a sonetary authority.     The alternative

                                                                  and not
assumption, eade by Barro, is that privste agents are hoeogeneous

engaged in strategic considerations vis—a—vis the policy—eaker.     The union

versus central bank game cay be appropriate for Europe, but in the United

States context the notion that private agents cannot combine egeinst the

monetary authority is core attractive than the alternative.

           The horizon is finn,.     The public bit eves tnere are two possioe

the policy cnoice.       If in any period tnt dice sase his act weak, the    pb&ac

understands ne is weak, and in each suesequent period he obtains arty the

discretionary outcome.

           The general form of tne solution is as follows."      For a long—horizon

problem the policy—maker will start out not randomizing at all and         ot
producing inflation itnis wilL seep his repi.tation unchangedi.         Because

private agents are uncertain of the policy—makers type, inflation is oeiow

its expected level all this time, causing a small recession.        Eventaally toe

end becoons, and the policy—eaker begins to randoeize.       During tnis period

his reputation is improving and the probability of playing strong is faliirg.

Then towards the end, maybe only in the last period, he inflates for sa'e.

           One result that emergee from thie framework te that as the horizon

goes to infinity, and provided the discount rate is reasonable, the

reputatienal •quilibriue with zero inflation Ic attained.        The reasoning is

similar to that ebsvei the penalty for revealing your weaknesd is a very long

period of inferior performance.

V II. Con fljg_Conments,


            Inc rules versus discretion debate in monetary policy is at least                l50

years old.      there has in that time been no monetary system whicn operated

without the exercise of suostantial discretionary authority——to be sure more

so at some times, such as after the collapse of the gold standard, amd                  in


some countries, than others.

            The pre—1977 argueents of principle for rules lacked any convincing

demonstration that rules mignt systeeatically be better than discretion.

that demonstration came with the dynamic inconsistency literature,                   however,

                                                                   under

                                                                  literature
discretion, and the role of reputation, the dynamic inconsistency

does not establish the superiority of rules.

        In thinking acout monetary policy sno rules, ii 15        useful   to discuss

who the monetary oclicy makers will be3.          For concreteness, consicer tne

example of tne United States.         At one extreme the decision on monetary policy

could be mace on the basis of current knowledge and enshrined in the

constitution.   That is unlikely to happen, given the difficulties of aner!din;

the constitution.       Nor, given the uncertainties over monetary policy, should

serious economists argue for such an amendment,         it surely ill   behooves a

profession that completely failed to anticipate the variaoiiity of real

exchange rates under      a   floating exchange rate system to believe that   t   is


capable 0f specifying a monetary policy that shoulo be changed only tnrough

tne tortuous process of constitutional amendment.         The choice in the Unitec

States is thus not between a monetary policy dsternineo by rule for all time,

and discretion, but between a monetary policy specified by the Congrsvs xnu

one chosen by the Fed,         Current U.S. fiscal policy does not suggest tnat tns

Congress woulo do   a   better job of choosing monetary policy than tne Fed,

though tnat is not to say that the Fed cannot do better.


szIn commenting on an earlier draft of this chapter, Milton Friedman
stated
   "The major comment is the omission of what I have increasingly cone to
   regard as hamlet on this issue Cruies versus discretion), namely the
   public choice perspective. To illustrate, ... you talk about a loss
   function for the policymaker chat includes eoielb inflation ano cxv
   deviation of real ouput from a target level.  If we bring this down to
   earth, these are likely to be only very inoirectly related to the real
   objectives of the actual policymakers. From revealed preference, I
   suspect that by far and away tne two most important variables in tneir
   loss function are avoiding accountability on the one hand and acnavnq
   public prestige on the other,  A loss function that contains tncse two
   elements as its main argument will I believe come far closer to
   racionalioing the behavior of the Federal Reserve over the past 73 years
   than one such as you have used."
