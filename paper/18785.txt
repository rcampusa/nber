New Evidence on the Impacts of Access to and Attending Universal Childcare in Canada

                                              ABSTRACT

In Canada, advocates of universal child care often point to policies implemented in Quebec as providing
a model for early education and care policies in other provinces. While these policies have proven
to be incredibly popular among citizens, initial evaluations of access to these programs indicated they
led to a multitude of undesirable child developmental, health and family outcomes. These research
findings ignited substantial controversy and criticism. In this study, we show the robustness of the
initial analyses to i) concerns over whether negative outcomes would vanish over time as suppliers
gained experience providing child care, ii) concerns regarding multiple testing, and iii) concerns that
the original test measured the causal impact of childcare availability and not child care attendance.
A notable exception is that despite estimated effects stemming from the policy indicating declines
in motor-social development scores in Quebec relative to the rest of Canada, our analyses imply that
on average attending childcare in Canada leads to a significant increase in this test score. However,
our analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in program impacts that occur in response to the Quebec
policies and indicates that most of the negative impacts reported in earlier research are driven by children
from families who only attended childcare in response to the implementation of this policy.

    1     Introduction

    While many parents, teachers, and politicians have concluded that there is strong evidence
    to support increased public sector support for the delivery of childcare services, the opinion
    is not supported by the entire body of evidence from the research community. Proponents
    of early childhood education often point to a large body of evidence summarized in Heck-
    man (2006, 2011) which indicates that investment and intervention aimed at young children
    will yield greater societal and individual benefits relative to those aimed at older children
    or adults. Much of this evidence is drawn from evaluations of targeted early childhood ed-
    ucation programs.1 Unfortunately, less is known about the effects of universal care on child
    outcomes. The few studies that have examined the effects of introducing universal childcare
    have yielded at best what Baker (2011) described as mixed evidence.2 Despite the paucity
    of evidence indicating its effectiveness, there has been a growing focus—in both public and
    academic spheres—on the need for governmental participation in the provision of childcare.
        Ongoing interest in childcare has been stimulated in part by trends associated with an
    increase in female labour force participation. In Canada, the employment rate of mothers
    with children under the age of six has risen from 31 percent in 1976 to 71 percent in 2008.3
    Both the supply and cost of childcare have also added impetus to demands for publicly
    funded childcare. In 2008 CBC News reported growing complaints concerning the limited
    availability of space in existing day-care facilities. The childcare Advocacy Association of
    Canada suggested that, “the federal government has simply failed to meet the childcare

1
  Findings that investing in children at early ages are not new and a wide body of research reports that
  pre-kindergarten programs can boost subsequent outcomes for disadvantaged children. See Currie (2001) or
  the wide-body of evaluation research that examined either the Perry Preschool Project or the Abecedarian
  Project.
2
  For example, Baker et al.(2008) and Datta Gupta and Simonsen (2010) report significant declines in a
  number of developmental and behavioural outcomes, whereas Havnes and Mogstad (2011) report strong
  positive effects on children’s long-run outcomes as adult.
3
  The statistics for Canada are derived by the authors from the Canadian Labour Force Survey. Note, a less
  pronounced trend exists in the United States where data from the CPS indicates that the employment rate
  of mothers with children under the age of six has risen from 34 percent in 1976 to 56 percent in 2001.

    needs of Canadian families.”4
       Regarding costs of childcare, data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation
    indicate that the average American family using childcare pays a whopping $6,708(US)
    annually for this service. In this climate, it is unsurprising that universal, publicly funded
    child care occupies a growing place on political agendas. During the 2011 federal election in
    Canada, the Liberal Party’s campaign included promises to provide the provinces with $500
    million a year to create child-care spaces. Throughout North America whenever discussions
    on reforming early childhood education are debated, Quebec’s heavily subsidized $7-a-day
    childcare system is presented as a template. Quebec’s child care system was introduced as
    a component of the Quebec Family Policy, which remains one of the most comprehensive
    policy measures taken by any North American government in response to childcare trends
    and concerns. In 1997, the Quebec government implemented a bold set of policies in hopes of
    encouraging higher birth rates, primarily by strengthening governmental support for parents.
    In large part, this support came in the form of an expansion of the childcare system. Under
    the Quebec Family Policy, parents with children aged zero to four were granted access to
    childcare at a rate of five-dollar-per-day (increased to seven-dollar-per-day in 2004).5 This
    program was implemented gradually; access was extended to children aged four in 1997,
    aged three in 1998, aged two in 1999 and aged zero to two in 2000. Additionally, full-day
    kindergarten was introduced (for children age five) and, extraneous to the aforementioned
    policy, more childcare spaces for school aged children.6
       The Quebec Family Policy’s extension of highly subsidized universally available childcare
    to children aged zero to four provides a unique opportunity to examine the impact of a switch
    to a comprehensive system of childcare support. In an influential paper, Baker, Gruber and

  Examining data from Canada, one can observe that the province of Quebec significantly increased the number
  of licensed childcare places available to children living in the province over the past 15 years. In fact, the
  OECD (2007) reports that by itself, Quebec accounts for almost all the increase in regulated early childhood
  education and care (ECEC) places in Canada since 1998.
5
  The Quebec Family Policy also increased parental leave benefits and provided families with a standard child
  allowance based on income, family type (single parent, two parent), and number of children.

    Milligan (2008) (henceforth referred to as BGM) provided the first formal analyses of the
    impacts of the Quebec Family Policy. The analyses in BGM provided evidence that the
    introduction of universal childcare led to statistically significant reductions in a variety of
    child health, developmental, and behavioural measures. Outcomes include increased hyper-
    activity, inattention, physical aggression, and decreased motor social development scores.
    In addition, the authors’ analyses indicated that parenting practices and family function-
    ing were negatively affected in Quebec.7 Their results ignited substantial controversy and
    advocacy groups such as the United Early Childhood Employees and Child Care Advocacy
    Association of Canada provided critiques.8 Several of these critiques including Cleveland
    (2007) highlighted the fact that the BGM study involved examination of the impact of ac-
    cess to childcare, not the impact of the utilization of childcare. As such, the BGM study does
    not provide evidence regarding the outcomes associated with child care attendance and use,
    which, according to the above mentioned advocacy groups, should be the true parameters
    of policy interest.
       This study extends Baker, Gruber, and Milligan (2008) in three ways. First, BGM
    evaluated the Quebec Family Policy at a time when the program was newly implemented and
    childcare centers were attempting to expand their services accordingly. The implementation
    of large scale social programs is rarely frictionless, since new programs require time for
    recruitment of high quality employees and integration in society. Therefore, early evaluations
    of child care programs may capture short-term changes that differ from results that may be
    found when child care centers are better established. Since the BGM study, two cycles of
    data have been made available from the National Longitudinal Study of Children and Youth,
    enabling the present study to revisit the original results to determine whether BGM results

7
  The authors as well as Lefebvre and Merrigan (2009) showed that the Quebec Family Policy significantly
  increase maternal labour supply. Calculations in Fortin (2011) suggest that the increases in labour supply
  generate sufficient additional tax revenue to fully finance this program.
8
  See testimony to The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology on Thursday,
  February, 14, 2008 by the late Fraser Mustard who founded the Council for Early Child Development for
  a heated critique of this research (Mustard, 2008) as well as a report by Cleveland et al. (2006) that was
  prepared for The Canadian Council on Learning.


                                                     4
    are robust to the inclusion of data from a later time period.9
        Second, we extend past research, which focused primarily on intent to treat estimates
    of childcare in Canada. Using an instrumental variables estimator, we will first attempt to
    identify the causal impact of attending childcare due to the Quebec policy on both child and
    parent outcomes. This empirical strategy allows us to report whether the negative impacts
    found by BGM are driven by childcare itself, as many readers of BGM hypothesized. From
    a policy perspective, this parameter is quite important since it provides information on all
    individuals whose childcare decisions were affected at the margin by the policy. Second,
    we will use an inverse propensity score reweighting estimator to recover the average impact
    of childcare attendance in Canada under the assumption that factors leading to childcare
    attendance are observed by the researcher. By comparing the estimates across empirical
    strategies we are attempting to uncover whether the subgroup whose childcare attendance
    decision is affected by the policy has differential impacts from the rest of the population.
        The use of different estimators allows recovery of alternative causal parameters, permit-
    ting us to begin an exploration into possible treatment effect heterogeneity. In applications
    of childcare at the universal level, as in the Quebec Family Policy, significant treatment
    effect heterogeneity is plausible. For example, children who receive high quality one-on-one
    parental care at home may experience negative outcomes when they shift to public childcare
    that includes higher adult-child ratios, while other children may benefit from the transition
    to public childcare. Further, since the universal childcare policy led to an increase in ma-
    ternal employment, newly employed parents may have higher levels of stress than they did
    prior to the implementation of the childcare policy.
        Third, we account for a statistical issue that affects the methods by which inference is
    conducted when researchers examine the effectiveness of a single policy on a multitude of
    child and family outcomes. Specifically we utilize techniques that incorporate the dependence
    in child and parent outcomes across multiple domains for the same individual. A failure

9
    Note that variants of this analysis also appear in Kottelenberg (2009) and Lefebvre et al. (2011).


                                                         5
     to account for multiple outcomes from the same treatment(s) may falsely yield significant
     results. For example, if the effectiveness of access to universal childcare is assessed on six
     outcomes, each at a significance level of five percent (two-sided tests), the chance of finding at
     least one false positive statistically significant test increases to 15.9 percent. Accounting for
     multiple outcomes can have a substantial influence on the rate of false positive conclusions.
     In the early education policy setting, where many outcomes are present, researchers may
     be tempted to select the most favourable results from an analyses, reporting significance
     where there is none. To this end, we adopted a multiple testing procedure that controls for
     the probability of at least one rejection of a true null hypothesis and allows the number of
     false rejections one is willing to tolerate to vary with the total number of rejections. In this
     way we present a more detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the policy.10 To the best of
     our knowledge, this issue has been largely ignored in the evaluation of results from natural
     experiments in Canada.
         Overall, our results are in line with BGM’s findings, namely that the introduction of the
     Quebec Family Policy led to a significant decline in child, parent and family outcomes. The
     initial estimates in BGM are robust to inclusion of additional years of data and concerns
     regarding multiple testing. Estimates of the causal impact of childcare attendance are also
     negative with the notable exception of the motor-social development score. On average,
     attending subsidized childcare leads to a significant increase in this score. Further, our
     results suggest that the negative impacts reported in BGM are driven by children in families
     who decided to attend childcare in response to the implementation of the policy. This
     heterogeneity in program impacts suggests an important avenue for further research.11
         This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a description of the data used for
     the analyses. Our empirical strategy to meet the three aims described above is presented

10
     In contrast, earlier research has examined each of these outcomes independently.
11
     In Kottelenberg and Lehrer (2012a, 2012b) we have explored heterogeneity across gender and the uncondi-
     tional outcome distribution respectively. In both papers, we present significant evidence of policy relevant
     treatment effect heterogeneity. See also Kottelenberg (2009) and Lefebvre et al. (2011) for an exploration
     into heterogeneity in program impacts based on age of child’s attendance to childcare.

     in section 3. Empirical results are presented and discussed in section 4. Finally, in the
     concluding section we summarize our findings from this paper and suggest that, given the
     substantial treatment effect heterogeneity from attending childcare, to boost child outcomes
     policy-makers should consider targeting childcare rather than developing policies that would
     introduce universal coverage.



     2     Data

     To undertake our proposed analyses, we use the National Longitudinal Study of Children
     and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally representative longitudinal study that tracks cohorts of
     Canadian children from early childhood. This study’s first sample was drawn in 1994-95 and
     consisted of Canadian children aged zero to eleven. Biannually, a new cohort of 2,000 children
     aged zero to one is added to the study and data is collected from all participating cohorts.
     The NLSCY was also used in BGM, to which we added data from cycles six (2004-05) and
     seven (2006-07).
         It is worth noting several additional details regarding the NLSCY sampling. This sam-
     ple was restricted to Canada’s ten provinces and excluded both full time members of the
     Canadian Armed Forces and people living on Aboriginal reserves.12 The NLSCY contains
     both child developmental scores and extensive questions relating to child care usage, parental
     labour supply, and other demographic characteristics, providing an opportunity to study the
     effects of child care policy on a variety of childhood development and behaviour indicators.
     Child development scores include the revised Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT)
     score for children aged four, a standardized motor and social development (MSD) score for
     children aged zero to three, and a series of child behavioural scores relating to hyperactivity,
     anxiety, physical aggression and opposition. The MSD scale consists of a set of 15 questions
     that measure dimensions of the motor, social and cognitive development of children from
     birth through three years of age, with questions that differ based on the child’s age. Each

12
     These exclusions represent about two percent of the Canadian population.
                                                        7
     item asks whether or not a child is able to perform a specific task.13 The PPVT is one of
     the most popular standardized tests used to assess children’s verbal intelligence and esti-
     mate children’s scholastic aptitude. The PPVT is a short test for which an examiner says a
     word aloud and an examinee attempts to identify, from four options, the picture that best
     represents the word. Finally, in previous research (e.g. Statistics Canada, 2003; Charach et
     al. 2010) the child behavioural scales have been shown to reliably predict related outcomes.
         Since one of our goals is to determine whether the impacts reported in BGM are transi-
     tory or permanent, we follow their sample restrictions and covariate definitions to ensure that
     any differences in study results are not due to choices made by the researcher. Specifically,
     the analyses are conducted using children from two-parent families, thereby eliminating the
     contaminating effects of pre-policy subsidization that generally have higher utilization rates
     with single-headed households. Further, this isolates an appropriate comparison group not
     affected by changes in other policies, such as paternity leave regulations that were altered
     during the data collection. While this restriction may limit the external validity of any find-
     ings, two-parent families remain a key focus of the universal childcare debate that aims to
     extend subsidized access to childcare to locations and individuals for which it was not pre-
     viously made available. Last, observations are only included if, at the time of the interview,
     the child’s age was four years.
         Table 1 presents summary statistics on a subset of child, parent, and family variables
     that are used as control variables in our analyses. For each variable in this table we report
     the mean and standard deviation values for four samples, defined by province of residence
     (Quebec or the rest of Canada) and time of survey completion (pre or post the introduction
     of the Quebec Family Policy. As shown in Table 1, in terms of demographic characteristics,
     there are no striking differences between sub sample groups or group specific trends. While

13
     Two examples of MSD questions asked of parents are whether a child has ever sat up for ten minutes without
     assistance, or whether the child has said more than two recognizable words. This scale was developed by
     Dr. Gail Poe of the U.S. National Centre for Health Statistics and has also been used in collections of the
     National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in the United States and in recent versions of the National Child
     Development Survey in England.


                                                         8
     a handful of these differences are statistically significant, we will account for these variables
     in the specification to minimize any bias from unobserved confounders. Across all Canadian
     provinces, there is a substantial increase in university completion among parents surveyed in
     later cohorts. Similar to BGM, Lefebvre and Merrigan (2008), and Lefebvre, Merrigan, and
     Roy-Desrosiers (2011), we do not believe that these statistics raise any immediate serious
     concerns for using the remaining Canadian provinces as a comparison group in the reduced
     form analyses.
         Summary statistics on the outcome variables that will be examined in this study are
     presented in Table 2. Since the questions that underlie a number of these outcome vari-
     ables are age specific, we include information on the sample size and age group of interest
     for each outcome in the last two columns of this table.14 The measures presented include:
     behavioural indices for Physical Aggression, Hyperactivity and Inattention, Emotional Anx-
     iety and Separation Anxiety for children and Family Dysfunction, and Mother’s Depression
     Score for parents. To examine the child’s health status we use an indicator variable based on
     the parent’s subjective evaluation of whether their child is “excellent health”, and reports
     indicating if the child never experienced i) a nose/throat infection, or ii) an ear infection.
     The last two rows of the Table 2 indicate that there were large increases in both maternal
     labour supply on the extensive margin and take-up of childcare following the introduction
     of the policy in Quebec relative to the rest Canada. With regard to the remainder of this
     table, there are not many substantial differences in the unconditional rates of many of the
     behaviours across regions in Canada prior to the policy but in the post policy periods trends
     in several variables, such as never experiencing a Nose or throat infection or physical ag-
     gression, differ substantially. In the next section, we will formally examine how these trends
     may have differed after policy implementation and if these changes were due to childcare
     attendance as many have hypothesized.

14
     Although available for children aged four, many of these indices are not composed of the same base questions.
     While not reported in the paper analyses with the indexes for the older children do indeed reveal a similar
     pattern as those for children aged two to three and are available upon request.

     3     Empirical Strategy

     We begin by adopting BGM’s main empirical specification which estimates the effect of access
     to universal childcare in Quebec by comparing the difference in the evolution of a series of
     outcomes in Quebec relative to the rest of Canada using data from both pre- and post-policy
     period. The regression specification for an outcome of interest Y can be expressed as:


                     Yipt = βo +δ 0 P olicyipt + β10 P ROVp +β20 Y EARt +β30 Xipt + εipt                  (1)


     where i, p, and t index individual, province, and year. The vector of covariates X, includes
     controls for child, parent, family, and geographic characteristics,15 PROV and YEAR are
     respectively a series of province and time dummies. The Policy variable is an interaction
     between the indicator for living in Quebec after 1998, the year the Quebec Family Policy was
     introduced. Thus, the coefficient of interest δ provides an estimate of the average effect of
     being eligible to attend universally subsidized childcare in Quebec on the outcome of interest.
     Intuitively, δ captures any additional change in outcomes in Quebec pre- and post-reform
     relative to the changes that occurred in the rest of Canada over the same time period. In
     the statistical treatment effect literature δ is often referred to as the intent to treat (ITT)
     parameter.
         Our work not only considers a larger number of post periods relative to BGM, but as
     noted in the preceding section, we dropped both the third and fourth cycle of the NLSCY
     data.16 We dropped data from the fourth cycle of the NLSCY since this corresponds to the
     tail end of a period in which universal childcare was being introduced to children at younger
     ages. Figure 1 illustrates that cycle 4 corresponds to a time of substantial growth in the
     number of publicly funded childcare seats. Nearly 65,000 regulated childcare seat became

15
   We use the exact same set of controls as BGM a subset of which is presented in Table 1. To reduce issues
   related to mis-specifying the functional form of the estimating equation, each of the continuous variables
   reported in Table 1 including age is discretized. For example, we create a host of discrete dummy variables
   for the various categories measured by parental education, number of siblings and community size.
16
   Note that BGM only had cycles 1-5 available at the time of their study and thus used cycles 1-2 as the
   pre-policy period and cycles 4-5 as a post-policy time frame.

                                                      12
     available between 1998-2001 (Lefebvre and Merrigan, 2008). We examined whether our full
     set of results were robust to the inclusion and exclusion of different cycles of the NLSCY
     data and we found that our results were not sensitive to the sampling scheme.17
        Equation (1) is often referred to as a difference-in-difference estimator for which recovery
     of causal effects relies on the maintenance of several assumptions in the underlying data.
     The first assumption is the absence of anticipatory behaviour in Quebec. It is unlikely that
     parents in Quebec altered their childcare decisions prior to the implementation of the Quebec
     Family Policy, meaning this first assumption is likely met. Second, an assumption of common
     trend is required: in the absence of treatment, outcomes in Quebec and the rest of Canada
     must move along a similar path. As the various panels in Figure 2 demonstrate, the slopes
     of the lines in Quebec and the rest of Canada were similar (in cycles one and two) prior to
     the introduction of the policy, suggesting the assumption of common trend is met. The final
     assumption, the assumption of common support, appears plausible since ex-ante we would
     not expect the observed and unobserved characteristics of individuals living in Quebec to
     differ substantially from those living in other provinces.18
        To move beyond estimating the impact of access to subsidized child care and to explore
     the effects of attending childcare, we reformulated the estimating equation. Equation 1 can
     be viewed as the reduced form of the following system of equations


                        Yipt = β0 +β10 Ccareipt +β20 P ROVp +β30 Y EARt +β40 Xipt +εipt                    (2)

                  Ccareipt = γ0 +γ10 P olicypt +γ20 P ROVp +γ30 Y EARt +γ40 Xipt +uipt


     where Ccare is an indicator for being in childcare. The main empirical challenge in using the

17
   The Universal childcare Benefit was introduced in 2006 providing parents $1200 annually for each child under
   the age of five. Removing the seventh cycle of the NLSCY, years 2006-07, does not effect our results.
18
   Despite evidence suggesting similarities between Quebec and the rest of Canada presented in Table 1 the
   common support assumption may also be weakened by differences in Francophone and Anglophone pop-
   ulations. To ensure the validity of our results we perform our estimation procedure on Francophone and
   Anglophone sub-samples and find that these groups are similar in their response to the policy compared to
   the full sample. These results are available upon request.

— Note: The data for this figure was taken from Lefebvre and Merrigan (2008). Some subsidies
were provided both to suppliers and families reducing the cost of childcare places prior to the
implementation of the Quebec Family Policy in 1997. Access was first granted to children aged 4
in September of 1997. In the three subsequent Septembers children aged three, two, and zero to
one became eligible for the program. Thus, the program was fully accessible by September 2000.

— Note: These figures present the proportions of two-parent families in each category. Figures 2c

school programs, the last of these two categories are less than one percent of the population.

     ordinary least squares estimator to directly estimate the first equation in (2) is dealing with
     the endogeneity of Ccare. Placing a child in care reflects a behavioural decision made by par-
     ents and may be correlated with unobservable characteristics. To overcome the endogeneity
                                                           0
     and recover unbiased parameter estimates of β1 , we consider two alternative strategies that
     rely on different assumptions regarding the parents’ choice to use subsidized day-care.
        First, we treat the Quebec Family Policy as a natural experiment with non-compliance
     and use the instrumental variables estimator allowing us to recover consistent estimates of the
     local average treatment effect (LATE). Identification of causal effects using an instrumental
     variables estimator is proven in Imbens and Angrist (1994) and relies on specific conditions
     on how access to the policy (P olicypt ) affects childcare use (Ccareipt ) and how access to
     the policy (P olicypt ) is unrelated to unobserved components of the outcome equation (εipt ).
     In the current study, all of these conditions appear plausible and with treatment effect
                                                                       0
     heterogeneity the instrumental variables estimates of β1 can be interpreted as the average
     effect of childcare for those children who only attended child-care due to the Quebec family
     policy.19
        The second empirical strategy relies on an assumption that the analyst has access to all
     of the variables that determine the childcare attendance decision. While the selection on
     observables assumption that underlies this second strategy is quite strong,20 this method
     arguably gets at the policy parameter of interest: the average effect of attending childcare,
     often referred to as the average treatment effect (ATE) in the causal inference literature.
     This parameter has the limitation of not making a distinction between universal childcare
     in Quebec and the childcare offered in the rest of Canada, and in effect treats all childcare

19
   An additional estimator that we considered was using control function methods to preserve the non-linearity
   of many of the outcomes variables. This involves determining the projection of the endogenous explanatory
   variable onto the exogenous variables and to control for endogeneity and we then add the predicted error
   term from this equation into the structural outcome equation. While this is asymptotically inefficient relative
   to MLE, it is computationally convenient. Since the control function is estimated and not the true first-stage
   errors, bootstrap procedures were used to account for this additional uncertainty. For space considerations,
   we do not report the results from the control function strategies but note that they did not differ substantially
   in sign, statistical significance or magnitude from the linear instrumental variables estimates.
20
   In the next section, we examine the sensitivity of our estimated treatment effects to the degree in which
   there is selection on unobservables.

                                                         15
     as a homogeneous good across the sample in both time and space. Specifically we follow
     the procedure introduced in Hirano et al. (2003), that first estimates the second equation
     in (2) using the non-parametric series logit estimator.21 Using the estimated coefficients,
     the predicted probabilities of receiving child-care (p̂(Xi )) are calculated for each individual.
     Estimates of the average effect of attending childcare are obtained by weighted least squares
     estimation of the outcome equation in (2) where the estimated weight (Wi ) for each individual
                             q
                               Ccareipt  1−Ccare
     is calculated as Wi =      p̂(Xi )
                                        + 1−p̂(Xiipt
                                                 )
                                                     . The weights play an important role in the
     regression specification as they ensure that the covariates are balanced between those that
     attend and do not attend childcare.22
        Prior research attempting to estimate causal impacts of Quebec family Policy has treated
     outcomes within and across domains for the same child as independent from one another;
     however, the assumption of independence across dependent variables (e.g. test scores and
     health metrics) may not be met, since the outcomes in multiple domains (e.g. Hyperactivity
     and inattention index and physical aggression index) are likely highly correlated. Making
     adjustments for the use of multiple outcomes has a long history in psychology (Benjamini
     and Yekutieli, 2001) and biostatistics (Hochberg, 1988). These techniques have also been
     adopted in some economic studies that examine multiple child outcomes (Kling et al., 2005;
     Anderson 2008; and Ding and Lehrer, 2011). Accounting for the possibility that multiple
     outcomes of interest correlate with one another avoids the possibility of over rejecting the
     null hypothesis when using univariate statistical methods. To this end we need to adjust the
     p-values for the multiple outcomes to reduce the likelihood of making type I errors. For each
     estimator and causal parameter estimated, we also report q-values that make corrections for
     the false discovery rate using the two-step procedure proposed by Simes (1986). Intuitively, q-

   The series logit estimation incorporates all of the covariates used in BGM as well as their interactions.
   Note that the results presented in the next section are robust to using both parametric probit and logit
   estimators that do not include the set of covariate interactions. As result of the inverse weighting on the
   propensity score, predictions that near zero and one may substantially effect results. Although not the case
   here differences in handling propensities at the extremes between the logit and probit models can lead to
   sensitivity in the estimates.
22
   This estimator has the desirable property of being doubly robust and will achieve consistent estimates as
   long as either the regression model or the propensity score (and thus the weights) are specified correctly.

     of making a Type I error at a fixed α (i.e. 5 percent) across the full set of outcomes.23



     4     Results

     4.1    Are the negative effects of access to universal childcare tran-

            sitory or permanent?

     Proponents of universal childcare often claim that the negative effects reported in BGM are
     transitory, and occurred as a result of the transition process that child care centres under-
     went in response to newly implemented policy. The rationale used in these arguments is
     that cycles four and five were periods during which the program was rapidly expanding to
     meet additional demand.24 It may be the case that the quality of care has since improved,
     potentially mitigating the initial negative effects.25 In addition, Figure 2 documents that
     the source of childcare provision in Quebec has shifted towards center-based care, which
     prior research (e.g. NICHD-ECCRN, 2004) associates with better academic and language
     skills relative to other types of care arrangements. The initial surge in demand for child-
     care in Quebec led to substantial growth in the provision of childcare facilities. Growth in
     home-based care operations outpaced growth in what is often termed as institutional based

23
   We also (results are available from the authors upon request) made corrections for the familywise error rate,
   which is more conservative than the FDR but has a greater likelihood of obtaining Type II errors.
24
   The implementation of childcare for all ages in Quebec was completed in 2000, however the number of
   available places in subsidized day-care did not come close to satisfying demand. Lefebvre et al. (2008)
   report that from 2000 to 2007 the province increased its available spaces in the program from approximately
   110,000 to 200,000, as seen in Figure 1.
25
   The Quebec government legislated in 2000 that two thirds of the staff at centre de petite enfants must be
   trained in early childhood education (previous requirements were at one third), while at the same time wages
   for caregivers were scheduled to rise 35 percent to 40 percent over a four year period. The concern for quality
   increases culminated in legislation in August 2006, prior to the last available cycle of the NLSCY, which
   required two thirds of staff to have college diplomas or university degrees in early childhood education.

     facilities, due to lower start up and organizational costs.26
        Despite these shifts in provider location we do not find any evidence to support optimism
     for the improved effects of childcare access in the years following program introduction. The
     findings from which we drew these conclusions are presented in Table 3. In the first column
     of this table we reproduce estimates of the intent-to-treat estimates from equation (1) that
     were reported in BGM.27 The second column, titled later time periods, includes results
     from analyses of more recent cycles of NLSCY data. The sign and statistical significance of
     the estimates of the effects of gaining access to universal childcare does not differ between
     columns for any of the child or parental outcomes. Further, the magnitude of these effects
     is larger for all outcomes with the exception of “Child in Excellent Health” for data from
     later versus earlier time periods. On average, the magnitude of the coefficient increased by
     approximately 43 percent relative to the estimates presented in BGM. Therefore, in contrast
     to described critiques, which centered around proposed mitigating effects of BGM’s study, the
     findings from our study suggest that negative effects are not transitory and are maintained

26
   The bottom right panel of Figure 2 shows that in the period immediately after the policy was introduced
   (1998-2001) that there was a small increase in usage of home-based care. However, since 2001 there has been
   a significant decline in home-based care and corresponding growth in center based care. This suggests that
   the excess demand for childcare created by the policy was initially met through the use of home-based care
   and has since shifted to center-based care.
27
   The estimates we present differ from those presented in BGM in three ways. By first replicating the standard
   errors in BGM exactly, we present p-values to facilitate comparison with their q-value counterparts. Second,
   the estimate we present corresponding to the hyperactivity and inattention index is not consistent to BGM
   due to a change in how the data was collected. Specifically this index was calculated in BGM as a sum of
   responses to questions related to frequency of various behaviours. These questions were adjusted in cycle 4
   of the NLSCY by the removal of two questions making up part of the index and one new question was added.
   In our work, this difference was overcome by the merging of the existing indices to produce one in which all
   questions are common. Finally, we do not present results for all results examined in BGM. We leave out
   several parental measures: consistency, hostile/ineffective parenting, aversive parenting, and satisfaction. In
   addition due to space constraints, we do not present results on diagnosis of asthma or having received an
   injury. The findings in BGM are robust to the addition of cycle six and seven data and are available upon
   request.

     for at least ten years after program implementation.28 Finally, while not the focus of the
     present paper, it is worth reporting that even after conditioning on the full set of controls,
     the estimates of the effect of access to childcare on maternal labour supply and childcare
     usage variables show higher levels of uptake in both categories when the additional cycles of
     data are utilized in the analyses.
         In the last column of Table 3 we report q-values that correct the statistical inference pro-
     cedure for multiple outcomes. Of the nine statistically significant intent to treat parameters
     tested in isolation, we find that all are indeed robust to multiple testing correction. This
     indicates that the negative and statistically significant results were not Type I errors. Taken
     together, the results presented in Table 3 increase our confidence that the introduction of
     universal childcare led to statistically significant reductions in a variety of child, parental
     and family measures. BGM results are indeed robust to the use of multiple testing and data
     from later time periods.


     4.2     Are the negative effects from attending childcare?

     Whether or not the negative effects found in both the current study and BGM’s study can
     be attributed to childcare attendance remains a salient question. The BGM analyses do not
     directly consider childcare attendance, thereby leaving this question unanswered. To address
     this question we consider two identification strategies used to estimate equation (2).
         Table 4 presents IV estimates of childcare that can be interpreted as a local average
     treatment effect, providing an estimate of the effect of child care on children in families
     which altered their usage as a result of the implementation of the policy. While the sign

28
     This, however, does not clarify whether negative impacts are reduced, at least to some degree, for children
     “in care” as the estimated report reflects the intent-to-treat effect and not actual attending childcare in some
     form. It is advisable to adjust intent-to-treat effects by dividing the policy coefficient by the probability of
     being treated. After accounting for the probability of receiving the given treatment, as calculated by the
     uptake in maternal labour supply and/or childcare, we find the majority of the treatment effects worsen
     in terms of magnitude. Of the child cognitive and behavioural outcomes only the MSD score is reduced
     remaining a negative effect of half of standard deviation at best. (Results available upon request). BGM
     hold discussion on the appropriate probability of being treated suggesting either the increase in childcare use
     or the increase in maternal labour supply induced by the policy. The estimates of these effects using the new
     NLSCY data are 0.19 and 0.11 respectively. The results above reflect the use of either of these probabilities.

and statistical significance of these estimates mirror the intention-to-treatment parameters,
the magnitude is substantially larger. These results confirm the pattern suggested in BGM.
Most striking is the causal relationship between childcare use and maternal depression scores.
These results suggest that mothers, whose decision to utilize childcare is tied to access to
the policy, experience a type of mental stress that the average mother does not. There are
many potential avenues which may cause this difference including the possibility that these
are families in which i) there is a higher attachment to the role as mother, ii) mothers have
less ability to handle stress in the workplace, or iii) mothers are less resilient in terms of
coping with work/life balance and demands. While future research is required to understand
the mechanisms at play in these results, this set of the results suggests that the hypothesized
pathway of negative effects of attending childcare is driven by those most affected by the
policy itself.

tion to recover the average causal effect of attending childcare are presented. This empirical
strategy reweights the populations of users and non-users of childcare as if to restore ran-
domization of other underlying factors, such as maternal labour, between these groups. If
randomization is successfully restored then isolation of the average casual impact is easily
identified by comparing outcomes between the two respective groups.
   The causal estimates using the inverse propensity weighting method differ substantially
from the intent-to-treat effects presented in Table 3. Estimates of the effects of attending
childcare on both child cognitive and behavioural measures are statistically insignificant, with
the exception of the positive effect upon MSD scores. The only child outcomes for which the
IPW estimates are similar to the ITT effects are for health, indicating that going to childcare
leads to a higher likelihood of not being considered in excellent health and having an ear,
nose or throat infection. While there were a number of changes in estimated effects upon
child outcomes, there were no major differences in terms of home environment outcomes.

     Interestingly, on average, having a child in childcare led to a small but statistically significant
     decline in maternal depression, the sole parental and family level outcome for which the sign
     of the estimated effect significantly changed from Table 3 to the IPW results in Table 4.29
     Last, with only a few exception the sign and significance of the causal effects of childcare on
     child outcomes are similar across geographic region and time. This highlights a consistency in
     the average treatment effect of childcare across different environments and implies a general
     similarity and comparability of childcare in Quebec following the policy.
        An examination of the estimates from the different empirical strategies used in the current
     study provides robust evidence of heterogeneous treatment effects. Children and parents from
     different families responded differently to both the Quebec family policy and the utilization
     of childcare. However, Kottelenberg (2009) did not find evidence of significant heterogeneity
     in the impacts of the policy across parental characteristics and household location. As
     such, it is challenging to identify which groups of children will benefit most from childcare
     policies. Yet, as evident from the contrast in the ATE and LATE estimators shown in this
     paper, children of parents who were on the margin of using childcare experience significantly
     worse outcomes relative to others who choose childcare. There are many potential scenarios
     that can explain who these families are.30 For example, when making childcare decisions,
     parents face trade-offs between leisure versus the welfare of their child.31 In equilibrium, the
     marginal rate of substitution between leisure and parental time investment into their children
     is equal to the price of leisure divided by the price of childcare. Some parents will change
     the manner in which their children receive care when the costs of childcare are lowered.

29
   In results available from the authors upon request, we repeated this exercise on samples based on geographic
   region and the waves of NLSCY data collection. There are no differences in the average effect of childcare
   on child behavioural outcomes in magnitude and statistical significance across geographic region and time.
   Further, since the sign of the effects of childcare on most child outcomes does not vary across geographic
   regions and time periods, this highlights a consistency in the average treatment effect of childcare across
   different environments and implies a general similarity and comparability of childcare in Quebec following
   the policy.
30
   There does not exist reliable statistical methods to determine who in the estimation sample changes their
   childcare decision due to the policy. This is a standard issue with instrumental variables estimation in that
   it recovers a treatment effect for a sub-population of ”compliers” that cannot be identified.
31
   Assume that both parental investments and childcare are inputs into a human capital production function
   for the child and that these inputs have different returns.

                                                       23
     There are multiple mechanisms by which the policy may influence childcare decisions and
     our parameter estimates the average effect from all of these mechanisms.
         To shed light on the underlying mechanisms would require strong assumptions about
     the data generation process. However, these results do expand our knowledge about the
     consequences of the introduction of universal childcare in Quebec. Our analysis showing
     varied effects of publicly funded childcare complicates decisions on childcare policy. On the
     other hand, children from families who are most influenced by the Quebec Family Policy
     appear to have poorer performance on a number of outcome measures post policy. These
     results have implications for governmental policy; they suggest that governments should
     modify the design of policies that expand childcare so that even those on the margins of
     childcare use may experience gains. Further, additional research should be conducted to
     expand on the results obtained in the current study. An important limitation of this study
     is that the nature of NLSCY data is such that we had to treat childcare as a homogeneous
     good. Substantial research (e.g. Blau 1999, 2001) demonstrates that there are important
     underlying factors affecting individual outcomes within care that may also shed further light
     on why childcare works for some children and their families.
         In our IV estimation, we used the introduction of the policy in Quebec to instrument
     for childcare attendance. To assess the suitability of our instrument we consider a simple
     OLS regression of the first stage regression and run an F test for the joint significance of
     the instrument. The results are presented in Table 5.32 Coefficients on the instrument and
     exogenous regressors in both columns are reasonable in sign and magnitude. Notice that only
     the education of the mother, not that of the father, is significantly associated with childcare
     attendance in Canada. Not surprising given the high costs, families with multiple siblings
     are much less likely to use day-care. Finally, it is important to note that the instrument is a
     statistically significant predictor of childcare attendance and the F-statistic on its significance
     is well-above current cut-offs (i.e. Staiger and Stock, 1997) for weak instruments.

32
     This equation is identical to the propensity score equation but omits the higher-order terms and interactions
     as well as uses the ordinary least squares estimator in place of the instrumental variables estimator.

                                                          24
         Last, throughout our analyses in an effort to facilitate comparisons, we used the same
     covariates as BGM and did not initially include maternal labour supply as an explanatory
     variable in equation (2). Yet, it is quite plausible that the exclusion restriction property of
     the instrument is violated if one does not control for maternal labour supply. The policy has
     direct impacts on childcare costs which may not only influence childcare attendance but also
     female labour force participation. These effects were reported in Table 3. As such, rather
     than making the heroic and implausible assumption that maternal labour supply can be
     treated as an exogenous explanatory variable,33 we split the sample on the basis of whether
     the mother holds a job and replicated all of the analyses contained in Table 4. These results
     for both subsamples are reported in Table 6 are robust and in most cases do not differ in
     a statistically significant manner. However, the magnitude of the effect of the local average
     treatment effect of childcare on MSD and hyperactivity/inattention scores is larger in the
     sub-sample of mothers who are working. While not reported, the first stage properties of
     the instrument are strong in both subsamples indicating that the policy had a strong and
     statistically significant influence on childcare decisions for mothers who both decided to
     work and those who did not join the labour force. This set of results further reinforces the
     striking heterogeneity in the impacts of attending childcare and confidence in attributing the
     estimated effects to childcare itself.


     4.3     Examining the sensitivity to the assumptions underlying the

             analyses

     The assumption of selection on observables that underlies the inverse propensity weighting
     estimates presented in column 3 of Table 4 is potentially quite strong and concerns as to
     whether the presented results are driven by spurious correlations between unobserved parent

33
     While an argument could be made that this exogeneity is plausible in specifications where we are exploring
     the effect of childcare on child’s own outcome it will clearly be of greater debate when the outcome is
     maternal depression. Since our existing strategy is just identified, then to treat both maternal labour supply
     and childcare attendance as endogenous would require another valid instrument.

the coefficient on Ccare from the instrumental variable methods. The sample is split between
mother’s who are employed and those who are not. The specification includes the covariates

     and or family characteristics and childcare use appear plausible. To explore this possibility,
     we use the methods developed in Altonji, Elder and Taber (2005,2008) to assess what the
     severity of the omitted variable bias must be to nullify the main results. In practice, this
     technique involves estimating a bivariate probit model,34 and first calculating how much
     selection on observables effects the estimated childcare impact. Next we determine how
     large selection on unobservables must be to negate the documented effects.35
        If the ratio of these two elements is greater than one our estimated treatment effect is only
     in danger from omitted variable bias when the unobserved variables have more explanatory
     power in selection than the observed ones. Thus, as this ratio grows larger so too does
     our confidence of the estimates presented. Since this method is designed to use binary
     outcome variables, we discretize the continuous test scores by assigning individuals a 0/1
     score for being below or above the mean. Our results indicate that the effect of selection on
     unobservables must be 5.22 times as large as that from the variables we have observed to
     nullify the positive effect of childcare on motor and social development scores.36
        This strengthens our confidence in the results because it suggests that the cumulative
     effect of missing variables must outweigh the observables by over five times in order to
     negate the discovered effect entirely. It is unlikely that important missing variables (i.e.
     earnings or innate ability) can account, in relative terms, for such a large effect. In summary,
     this exercise suggests that the assumption of selection on observables is plausible and that
     the results reported in Table 4 are not driven by unobserved confounders. However, there

34
     Formally, the bivariate probit model can be linked to equation (2) where Y is restricted to be a binary
     outcome. This model imposes additional assumption on the error terms
                                                              

                                           u            0     ρ 1

   where ρ represents the correlation between the unobserved factors affecting selection of childcare and the
   outcome of interest.
35
   This assumes that there is equality of selection on observables and unobservables. That is, taken at random
   a given variable from either the observables or unobservables will in expectation affect selection similarly.
   This is a plausible assumption since it is much more likely that the chosen covariates account for more of
   selection then those not accounted for. Thus, this method establishes a lower bound for the extent of the
   omitted variable bias.
36
   We also discretize using the median and estimate a ratio of 4.34.

     are three exceptions since the effects of childcare on the health measures did not display
     the same degree of robustness to missing confounders. The estimated ratio of selection
     on unobservables relative to selection on unobservables found for i) whether the child in
     excellent health, ii) child has had a nose/throat infection, and iii) child had an ear infection
     variables were 1.183, 0.414, and 0.773 respectively. Though arguments could be made that
     these ratios are close enough to one to suggest the omitted variable bias would not negate
     the estimated effect, these ratios are not nearly as reassuring and there is a great potential
     that our conclusions for the health outcomes are indeed sensitive to the plausibility of the
     selection on observables assumption.37



     5     Conclusion

     As a popular notion universal care childcare captures the public eye, but its implication, now
     and tomorrow, is far reaching and thus should be approached with evidence at the heart of
     the policy-making process. This paper extends earlier research that evaluates the socio-
     economic consequences of the Quebec family policy in several ways. First, by demonstrating
     that BGM’s findings that access to subsidized childcare has negative impacts on individual
     developmental, behavioural, and health measures are robust to the inclusion of data up to
     ten years after the reform. Second, instrumental variable estimates suggest that children and
     families who choose to attend childcare as a result of the introduction of policy experience
     substantial declines in a variety of developmental and health outcomes. However, estimates
     of the average effect of attending childcare, obtained via inverse propensity score reweight-
     ing, generally show insignificant and positive effects on child development and behavioural
     outcomes.
         Taken together, the results from this study expand our knowledge about the effective-

37
     There is no accepted threshold in the literature to determine when the degree of selection on observables
     is sufficient. In practice, this depends on what one would ex-ante predict is the strength of the covariates
     in the selection equation relative to those factors that are unaccounted for and than gauge whether these
     factors could bias the results.

ness of policies that subsidize childcare in Canada on developmental outcomes and reject
the proposition that introducing a universal childcare program will unambiguously weaken
individual and family outcomes. The large difference between the estimates of the average
effect of childcare from the local average treatment effects suggest that some groups may de-
rive more benefit from childcare than others. Understanding the sources of treatment effect
heterogeneity may help us to develop an understanding of whether it would be advantageous
to target child care to those who would benefit most from its provision.
   An important limitation of this study is that the NLSCY treats all childcare in Canada
as a homogenous good. There is a large literature on the importance of child care quality
and Japel et al (2005) found that in Quebec after the policy was implemented that only
5% of programs were high quality and the majority of arrangements scored below the mid
range with slightly over 10% were classified at below minimal quality. Second, the NLSCY
only collects information on a narrow range of child and family outcomes and there may be
other domains of importance including those measured at the community and societal level.
Despite these caveats there are avenues in which one can examine if there are systematic
patterns of treatment effect heterogeneity.
   In this vein we have conducted two companion studies that explore treatment effect het-
erogeneity in the effects of access to and attending childcare. In Kottelenberg and Lehrer
(2012b) we demonstrate substantial response differences in child outcomes by gender: male
children and their families drive the negative effects in several key outcomes. Kottelenberg
and Lehrer (2012a) move beyond simply estimating the average effect of access to and at-
tending childcare and consider estimating the treatment effects across the full distribution
of each outcome variable. Composed of negative and statistically insignificant effects, the
underlying pattern in the treatment effects highlight substantial heterogeneity. The authors
conclude by presenting suggestive evidence of large reductions in parental investments for
these children once their children begin to attend subsidized childcare. Thus, we postulate
that home inputs are important and that interventions within schools may only reinforce at


                                              30
home preparation for a small fraction of the population. For the remainder, the changes in
school inputs may be offset as parents substitute their investments into their children towards
other activities. However, the extent and pattern of heterogeneity in parental input decisions
has not been fully investigated. These results do not imply poor parenting skills, but may
indicate that parents have limited knowledge of their child’s human capital production func-
tion and make optimization errors when choosing inputs. Overall, as a result of the array
of behavioural responses to the Quebec Family Policy, the continuing changes to childcare
programs in Quebec over time, increases to maternal labour supply and changes in parental
behaviour, the exact workings of universal childcare programs on child development are far
from obvious. In conclusion, we suggest that further investigation using both qualitative and
quantitative data is needed to improve our understanding of the pathways through which
childcare contributes to the production of education, health, family and parenting outcomes.
