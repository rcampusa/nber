     The recent theory of exchange rate dynamics within a target zone holds
that exciiarije rates under a currency bard are less respansive to furdasental
shocks than exchange rates under a free float, provided that the intervention
rules of the Central Bank(s) are catuwn kncMledge. These results are derived
after having assumed a priori that excess volatility due to rational bubbles
does not occur in the foreign exchange market. In this paper we consider
instead a setup in which the existence of speculative behavior is a datum the
Central Bank has to deal with. We show that the defense of the target zone
in the presence of bubbles is viable if the Central Bank accomimxlates
speculative attacks when the latter are consistent with the survival of the
target zone itself and expectations are self-fulfillir. These reBults hold
for a large class of exngenous and fundamental-dependent bubble processes.
We show that the instantaneous volatility of exchange rates within a bard is

not necessarily less than the volatility under free float and analyze the
ixplications for interest rate differential dynamics.

I. Introduction
       The recent literature on exchange rate target zones inspired by Krugman's
seminal article on the subject (Krugman [1990]) represents      a successful marriage of
policy relevance and technical innovation. Formal target zones like the exchange rate

arrangements of the European Monetary System and informal target zones between the
U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and   the D—Mark   since the middle of the last decade were
a prominent feature of the exchange rate system of the Eighties and promise to be so
for the Nineties. The technical modeling innovation consists in the appbcation of the

theory of regulated Brownian motion (see e.g. Malliaris and Brock [1982], Harrison
[1985], Dixit [1988], Karatzas and Shreve [1988], Dumas [1989] and Flood and Garber

[1989]) to the study of the behavior of a floating exchange ratethat is constrained by
appropriate interventions not to stray outside some given rangeor target zone.
       The literature on this subject is growing very fast. Among the many recent
contributions are Krugman [1987], Krugman and Rotemberg[1990], Miller and Weller

[1988a,b; 1989; 1990a,b,c], Miller and Sutherland [1990], Froot and Obstfeld [1989a,b],
Bertola and Caballero [1989, 1990], Klein [1989], Svensson [1989; 1990a,b], Pesenti

[1900], Delgado and Dumas [1990], Lewis [1990], Avesani [1990], Ichikawa, Miller and
Sutherland [1990], and Smith and Spencer   [1990].
       A common element in all of these analyses is that a "fundamentals only"

solution is chosen for the exchange rate: The exchange rate, a non—predetermined state
variable, is expressed as a function of the current and expected future values of the
fundamentals only. The literature in fact concentrates on models with a single
fundamental. This fundamentalis governed by regulated Brownian motion, that is by
unregulated Brownian motion as long as the fundamental stays within the lower and
upper intervention thresholds and by (intermittent) interventions that keep the
fundamental within these thresholds whenever the unregulated Brownian motion
threatens to take the fundamental outside the intervention limits (and thus the
                                             —2—




exchange rate outside its target zone).      This permits the current value   of the spot
exchange   rate to be expressed as a   non—linear function of    the current value of the
fundamental only.
       The first step in this argument, the decision to solve for the current value of the

exchange rate as a function only of     the current   and expected future values of the

fundamental, means that speculative bubbles are ruled out.
       In dynamic linear rational expectations models the arguments for ruling out
speculative bubbles are well—known, if not necessarily wholly convincing. In many of
the most popular models the bubble processes are non—stationary.'                   These

non—stationary bubble processes then lead to non—stationary behavior of state
variables such as asset prices. Unbounded growth or decline in these    state variables for
constant values of the fundamentalsis argued to violate, eventually, certain often only

implicitly stated feasibilityconstraints.2
       Blanchard [1979] has developed an example of a non—stationary (stochastic or
deterministic) linear bubble that has a finite expected lifetime. The probability of the
bubble surviving for a given period of time declines with the length of that period at a
constant exponential rate and approaches zero asymptotically (see also Blanchard and
Fischer [1989, chapter 5]).  Although the bubble remains non-stationary and its
expected value grows exponentially without bound, the finite expected lifetime of this
bubble may make it less vulnerableto the standard critique of non-stationary bubbles.
Miller and Weller [1990a[ and Miller, Weller and Williamson [1989] use the Blanchard

bubble to analyze exchange rate behavior (both with and without a target zone) in a

stochastic version of the Dornbusch overshooting model (Dornbusch [1976]).
       Certain non—linear models also possess non—stationary bubble solutions. For

instance, the deflationary and inflationary bubbles studied by Hahn [1982] and by
Obstfeld and Rogoff [1983], although obtained in non—linear models, are also

non—stationary.   In more general non—linear models     it it   however quite common to
                                              —3—




find stationary bubbles.3
         The exchange rate target zone model potentially provides a particularly happy

non—linear breeding ground for speculative bubbles.            Provided the target zone is

credible, that is provided there is certainty that the interventions required      to   defend

the target zone will take place, the exchange rate can neither rise nor fall without
bound.     There are infinitely many intervention rules that are compatible with the
defense of   a given target   zone.   For a rational speculative bubble to exist, the
intervention rule must of course be consistent, both within the target zone and at the
boundaries, with the behavior of the (regulated) fundamentals. This paper develops a
simple and intuitive intervention rule that encompasses as a special case the solution
without a bubble, yet     is general enough   to permit a wide range      of exogenous and

fundamental—dependent deterministic or stochastic bubbles.           With this intervention
rule the arguments against bubbles lose their bite. A non—stationary bubble does not
now imply non—stationary behavior of the exchange rate. This argument is not new.

As early as 1987 William H. Branson, in conversation and discussion, repeatedly raised

the possibility that target zones might lead to "indeterminacy"of the exchange rate.
This paper can be viewed as an analytical confirmationof his conjecture.
         In the next Sections we exposit   the simplest   version of the credible target zone
model and analyzeits behavior with or without speculative bubbles.




II. A Target Zone Model With or Without Speculative Bubbles.


         (a) The Model.


         Our analysis of the place and role of speculative bubbles in an exchange rate

target zone requires the exchange rate to be      a non—predetermined     (forward—looking)
                                                —4—,




state variable, but does not make further demands on descriptive realism.                 We
therefore feel comfortable in using Occam's razor and following the bulk of the

literature on target zones by casting the analysis in terms of the simplest possible
linear intertemporal substitution equation for the exchange rate and a (continuous

time) random walk with drift for the unregulated fundamental. (Notable departures
from the cult of extreme simplicity are Miller and Weller [1988a,b; 1989; 1990a,b,c]
who analyze stochastic versions of the richer Dornbusch overshooting model.)

         The exchange rate process   is given   in equation (1).


(1)                s(t)dt   = f(t)dt +
                                         a'Etds(t)              a > 0.

         Here s(t) is the natural logarithm of the spot nominal exchange rate and f(t)

the fundamental determinant of the exchange rate.                   Et   is   the mathematical
expectation operator conditional on the information available at time t to the private
sector and the regulator. Both sO) and f(t) are assumed to be observableat time t,

i.e.                                        and the structure of the model is known.
       Ets(t) = sO) and Etf(t) = f(t),
       For the purpose of this paper, the economic interpretation of f(t) is irrelevant
except insofar as it affects the credibility of our assumptionthat, with eertalnty, the

target zone will be successfully defended. A common interpretation of f is in terms of
relative nominal money stocks minus relative real—income—related demands for real
money balances, i.e.


                                                *           *
                                    f=m—m —k(y—y )


where m is the logarithm of the home country nominal money stock, y the logarithm
of home country real output and k is the (common) income elasticity of money

demand.      Starred variables denote foreign quantities, In this case          a denotes the
                                                 —5—




inverse of the (common) interest semi—elasticity of money demand.4
       If the two national real outputs        are governed by exogenous Brownian motion,

intervention means changes in the relative money supplies brought about by monetary
financing of public sector financial deficits, through open market operations                      or by
unsterilized foreign exchange market intervention. As shown in Buiter [1989] such
intervention policies will in general require adjustments to primary (non—interest)
fiscal surpluses    to   be sustainable indefinitely from a technical point         of view    (i.e. in
order to prevent either exhaustion of foreign exchange reservesor unboundedgrowth of
the public debt).        A proof that they are politically feasible and credible is beyond the

scope of this paper.
       In the   absence of intervention, the (unregulated) fundamental f would follow a

Brownian motion process with drift p and instantaneousvariance c.


                    di(t) = pdt + u1dW1(t)             clf> 0.


                   is    a standard                                1   im              where           is

independentlyand normally distributed with zero mean and unit variance).
       We now allow for intervention            at the upper     and lower boundaries of the

exchange rate target zone. The regulated fundamental is governed by

          (b) The Solution

          The general solution of (1)       is given   in equation (3). B(t) is the value of the
speculative bubble      at time t.


(3)                   5(t)   =
                                  i: Etf(v)e(v_t)dv + B(t).
          The bubble B(t)            can be any stochastic or strictly deterministic process

satisfying



(4)                   B(t)dt     = a'EtdB(t).


      Note that since s(t) is part of the information set at t, so is B(t). We restrict
B, where it is stochastic, to follow a diffusion process. Except for the case of the
"Blanchard bubble", all examples will in fact restrict                   it further to   be a twice

continuously differentiable functionof Brownian motions.

          Finally,   it is important to note that the authorities are assumed to be unable to
intervene directly in the bubble process (and indeed in the exchange rate process).
They can only regulate the fundamental£
          In the interior     of the target   zone,    the general   solution for s as a function of
current   f and current B is given by5

                                                                                   .A2(f(t)—C(t))

       Equations (lla,b) characterize a       one—sided    'smooth pasting' condition at the
upper boundary (s    =         only. Equations (llc,d) characterize a one—sided 'smooth
pasting' condition at the lower boundary       (s   =   only. These non—standard boundary
conditions will be interpreted further below.

       We now detail the interventions at the upper and lower boundaries of the

exchange rate target zone. From equation (5), the exchange rate in the target zone can
be written as 5(t)   = g(f(t), B(r)) + B(t).        The bubble    at time t can be a function of
the current unregulated fundamental f(t) and/or of other variables z(t). Note that
z(t) could be a function of nM or exoected                fqe

fundamental. Therefore B(t) b(f(t), z(t)). The exchange rate in the target zone

can therefore be written as 5 = h(f, •), where             a       +            For simplicity we
                                                                       Of   .
restrict the analysis to those bubbles for which, even if B(t) depends on 1(t), the
function h(f,.), retains its familiar s shape with a unique interior minimum and a
unique interior maximum. In                                                is therefore the

                         5u'

bubble, s may reach 5u at values of fundamental different from u• These will be
denoted   f.
           Similarly, s may reach    at values of f different from These will be

denoted   f1.
       We consider the simplest possible example of a target zone. A plausible

interpretatiou of the formal model is that there is a fully credible commitment that the
value of the exchange rate will be contained within an exogenously given bounded

range, that is — z C     ss 5u < z. The interventions in the fundamental process
that keep the exchange rate within this range occur only when the exchange rate is at
the boundaries. Two distinct kinds of interventions are required to defend the target
zone in the presence of a bubble.

       The first is a pair     of infinitesimal reflecting interventions, _dlu < 0 at the
upper boundary if       f= u   and dI1> 0 at the lower boundary of the target zone if
 =      These     negative infinitesimal interventions at the upper boundary s            = s and
positive infinitesimalinterventions at the lower boundary s           =            correspond to   the
                                                                           5,
original scheme analyzed by Krugman [1990]. II interventions in the interior                  of the
target zone ("intramarginal" interventions) were permitted, a pair of reflecting
interventions of exogenously given finite magnitudes,
                                                      _AIu < 0 and Al1 > 0 could
be allowed (see Flood and Garber [1989]).

       The second class of interventions comprises interventions of finite magnitude,
that are functions of the change in the magnitude of the bubble since the previous visit
to the boundaries. They too occur only when the exchange rate is at the boundaries of
the target zone. They always are in the opposite direction from the infinitesimal

(type I) interventionsat the same boundary.
       We interpret these (type II) discrete interventions as the passive
accommodation of rational speculative attacks at the boundaries of the target zone,

that are consistent with the survival of the target zone. We refer to such stock—shift

portfolio reshuffies as "sustaining" or "friendly" speculative attacks.
      The behavior of the regulated fundamental is given in equations (12a) to (12c).
The conditions in (12a), (12b), (12c(a)) and (12c(y)) are the standard ones for

regulated Brownian motion (see e.g. Harrison ]1985, p. 80]).          If       >   u   and if f =

                          s

       The other conditions are non-standard and are required for our analysis of
rational bubbles in      target zone. If         >     they characterize (discrete)

      It will   he apparent that, for any size bubble we can calculate exactly both the

magnitudes of the passive or accommodating discrete interventions required to allow
the target zone to survive and the values of the fundamentalsat which they will occur.
      In     our rudimentary model, there is no possibility of            the   speculative bubble

influencing the behavior of the fundamental. A bubble in this model can only influence
the exchange rate directly. If the process governing the unregulated fundamental
included the exchange rate as an argument then, because the bubble affects the

exchange rate,       it     will indirectly influence the behavior     of the fundamental.      An

interesting analysis of a model in which the bubble affects the exchange rate both
directly and indirectly through the fundamental is analyzed by Miller—Weller [1990a]
and by Miller, Weller and Williamson [1989].

       Finally, the behavior of the authorities at            the edges of the target   zone can be

summarized as follows: "Reflect when this is sufficient; accommodate when this is

necessary.

and   the upper limit of the target zone. The horizontal distance between   and hi
is just equal to the difference between              B1    and B°, i.e.          —        =   B1 —   B°.

       Note that at Il the smooth pasting (or no—arbitrage) conditions (lOa—d) are
not satisfied. At Ill in Figure la the smooth pasting conditions are satisfied and the

expected rate    of change      of the exchange rate is negative      (Ili is to the right of the 45
line through the origin).            Ill is   therefore consistent with credible intervention to

prevent s from rising above            s.d. This   is not the case with the large bubble shown in
Figure lb. Ill is to the left of the 45* line through the origin and therefore represents
a positive expected rate of change of the exchange rate, inconsistent with a credible
defense of the upper limit of the target zone.          In this case the intervention rule leads to
the following scenario. From                                                                      brings

                   ' that is the point [st, su], an arbitrarily small distance to the right
of the intersection of s =      and the 450 line through the origin. Since s is kept

              =
constant at s 8n' there are no arbitrage profits. From           the system, with and
                                                                        1l                      A1
A2 now defined by the one—sided 'smooth pasting' conditions given in (lla,b), can now
again moveinto the interior of the target zone.
          In Figuie lb, the
                        graph of s with A1 and A2 determined by (ha) and (lib)
and   B   = Bu denoted s', coincides with the bubble eater of
                                                              Bu For a slightly larger
value of B,    the graph of
                         s with A1 and
                                           A2 determined by tbe one-sided smooth
pasting conditions (ha) and (lib) is denoted s' '. A largervalue of s yields                       s''
As B goes to infinity          the graph of   s approaches   a vertical line through t1u
                                              —17—




          Note that, by construction, we always have a local maximum at the tangency
point   f2    (for finite values of B). For positive unregulated realizations of f, standard
infinitesimal reflection stops the regulated value of       f   from rising beyond    s.   For
negative realizations of the unregulated f, the system moves (given B) into the interior
of the target zone. As in the case of a small bubble, a variation in the value of the

bubble in the interior of the target zone represents a vertical displacement of the graph

of the exchange rate (with constant values of A1 and A2). With a large bubble, the

shape of the graph changes every time the exchange rate visits the boundaries at a new
value of B.

          Since the bubble grows exponentially (in expectation) we expect more frequent

interventions at the upper (lower) boundary if the current value of tbe bubble is
positive (negative) than with a zero bubble.       We consider these results to be quite
intuitive. One would expect an exchange rate subject to a positive and growing (in

expectation) bubble to spend a lot of time at the upper boundary of the target zone,
with the authorities intervening to counteract not only the unregulated fundamental
but also the bubble.
       It is apparent that when s reaches 5u with a large bubble, the stock—shift
increase in f must take the system to a position strictly to the right of the 450 line

through the origin. On the 450 line the expected rate of depreciation is zero. If we
impose the 'smooth pasting' conditions when f = =  5u'(small) positive realizations of
increments in the unregulated fundamental will be offset with infinitesimal reflecting

interventions. Negative realizations of df would bring the system to the left of the 450
line through the origin, that is to a point with a positive expected rate of change of s.
This is   of course inconsistent with a   credible defense   of the target zone. If private
agents believed   that the authorities were   stabilizing   the exchange rate at 'eu' ub a
friendly speculative attack of infinitesimal size would occur, bringing the system back
to 1u'          This amounts to stabilizing the fundamental at f =                Since
                                                                                 5u

       = a(s — f) the exchange rate would effectively be expected to be fixed. It is
Etds
easily seen that an exchange rate cannot remain fixed for any finite interval of time if
the fundamental is constant and there is a non—zero speculative bubble.                  Consider

equation (3), for the special case in which f is kept constant at forever. The solution
                                                                         s
for the exchange rate is given by s = 5u + B which implies that, unless B = 0, the

exchange rate cannot be constant.
         There is a simple, unifying characterization of the interventionsthat sustain the

target zone.   It is that the government     is credibly committed to infinitesimal reflecting
interventions at the boundaries            and            The value of the fundamental at which
                                      s1
these infinitesimal reflecting interventions at the margins occur are determined by the

appropriate two—sided or       one—sided     "no—arbitrage" (or smooth pasting) boundary
conditions.

         Consider first the case of a small positive bobble shown in Figure la. The value
of the fundamental at which the exchange rate reaches, say, the upper boundary             u' in
Figure   la) is different from the value         of   f   that characterizes the tangency of the
bubble   eater and the upper boundary                                 except in the case of a zero
                                              (4 in Figure la)
bubble. Since          is less than        the discrete (stock-shift) jump in the fundamental
                 u                    u'
that takes the system to the reflection point             Q can be interpreted as a friendly or
sustaining speculative attack which is accommodated by the authorities.

         Since   the expected rate   of change of s   at         in Figure la is (positive and)

higher than the (negative) expected rate of change of s at Il           ,   the shift from    1u
                                                                                                     to
    can he interpreted as an increase in the relative demand for home country money
due to a decrease in the domestic—foreign interest differential.6                     The authorities

obligingly accommodate this friendly or sustaining speculative attack.7 Note that                  if at
time   t the exchange rate reaches        s   at f = fu(B(rfl that is when the current value
of the bubble is the same as the value of B            at the most     recent previous boundary

visit, the size of the friendily speculative attack is obviously zero, and only a reflecting
intervention occurs.
         With a large bubble (see Figure ib) the stock--shift increase in             f from f = f*1
to f =        can also be interpreted as the passive accommodation of a discrete friendly
         s
speculative attack. The bubble eater of the large bubble B1 in Figure                   lb produces a
tangency point with the upper boundary           at        which is   to the    left of the 45 line

through the origin.       It therefore has a positive expected   rate of change of s, which          is

inconsistent with a credible defense of the target zone. At            11u'
                                                                               the exchange rate is
expected to appreciate, which is consistentwith       a credible target       zone.

         The policy rule we use to defend the target zone in the presence of rational
speculative bubbles is not the only one capable of delivering          the survival of the target
zone. We could, for instance, apply the one—sided smooth pasting conditions                  [(lla,b)
when s   =       and   (llc,d) when s =       even when
                                       Bu > B(r) > B1, at any exogenously
given value of f =   >
                   u 5u when s = s and at any exogenously given value of
 = < when s = . We chose the particular rule given in (lOa—d),
                   s                                           (lla,b) and
(llc,d) both because it is quite intuitive and because it is as close as possible to the
original model. In particular it includes the traditional 'smooth pasting" solution as
the special case when there is no bubble.

W. A Surfeit of Bubbles

       Consider again the general solution to eqnation (1) given in (3). The first term
on the R.H.S. of (3) is commonly called the fundamental solution, s1



(14)             5f0)   =a        Etf(v) e(\T_t)dv


       Consider equation (15) below, which is a special case of equation (5).


                         .\f
                          1   If2
(15)             s=f++A1e +A2e
       In the terminology of McCallum [1983] this is the minimal state solution: it
involves only the state variable(s) and the state variables enter in a "minimal" way.
       The first two terms on the R.II.S of (15) are the fundamental solution for the
unregulated fundamental. All of the R.H.S. of (15), for some given (non—zero) values
of A1 and A2, is the fundamental solution for the regulatedfundamental.

       For the unregulated fundamental, non—zero values of
                                                             A1 and/or A2 would
permit  what Froot and Obstfeld [1989c] call intrinsic bubbles, within the class of
functions expressing s(t)    as
                           a function of current fundamentals (f(t)) ppjy.
      For the regulated fundamental, the existence of intrinsic bubbles would require
that f enters the solution for the exchange rate in the interior of the target zone
through terms other than the ones appearing (with A1 and A2 determined by (lOa—d),
(lla,b) or (llc,d)) on the 11.11.5. of equation (14) and with no other variable(s)
included. Such intrinsic bubbles are clearly impossible.

       The literature has generally cast   its discussion of bubbles for our class of models
in terms of the behavior of s as a function only of current    f for different   values of A1
and A2. For example, in the case of a freely floating exchange rate, unless
                                                                            A1

deviation of s from f will become infinite as I grows without bound (since A1 >    and        )
unless A2 = 0, the deviation of s from f will become infinite as f falls without bound

(since A2 < 0). A1 = A2 = 0 rules out only intrinsic bubbles. Many kinds of

exchange rate bubbles are possible under a floating rate even        if    A1
                                                                                =   A2
                                                                                         = 0. With
such bubbles, s can deviate from       f (for any given value   of f) by eventually unbounded

amounts.
        It is recognized    in the literature (Froot and Obstfeld [1989b] are an example),
that the   choice of A1    and A2   only restricts the relationship between s and f, but that
state variables other than I may enter the solution for s through bubbles. In general,
bubbles can introduce one or more additional state variables into the solution for s.

Subject    to the constralnt that these bubbles    obey (4), they can cause s to deviate in
almost any conceivable manner from g(f, .), for any values of A1 and A2.
      What is not, we believe, recognized as clearly is that s can depend on fin ways
other than given by g(f, •) (or the R.H.S. of (15)), provided s also depends (through

B) on   at least one other state variable. We show below that the bubble at time t, B(t)
can be a function of the unregulated fundamental          f(t), provided it also depends on
some other state variable     (or state variables) z(t), with P1.1 = 0, which ensures that
                                                                 01(t)
EtdB
        = csBdt.   This implies   that within the target zone, dB        can be a function     of    df.

z(t) can (but need not) be          a function exclusively of past and/or anticipated future
values of    the unregulated fundamental.        We call this class of generalized intrinsic

bubbles "fundamental-.dependent"bubbles.


          (a) Bubbles that don't burst

          We begin by considering speculative bubbles, both deterministicand stochastic,
that don't   collapse. Examples      of non—collapsingbubble    processes satisfying (4) include
the simple exogenous deterministic process given in (16), where B(0)                     =   B0 is   an

arbitrary initial value for the B process.



(16)              B(t) = B0e4.


        An example     of a   simple exogenous (backward—lookiog) stochastic bubble

satisfying (4) is given in equations (17a,b), with B0 arbitrary.



(17a)                 dB(t)   = nB(t)dt + abdWb


(llb)                 B(t) = j.t   e         abdWb(v)       + e'B0.


        The parameter    cb is the instantaoeous variance         of the bubble process. Note
that 5b      could be a fuoction of s, f,    t    or any other set of variables without this

affecting the fact that equation (17a) satisfies (4). For instance, if UB is a positive
constant, the bubble can "change sign". With geometric Brownian motion
proportional to B), sign reversals of the bubble are ruled out, although B can change
dIrection.

        Important for our analysis, the bubble process can itself be a function of
current, past or anticipated future values of the unregulated fundamental f. One
example is given in equations (18a,b) below. In what follows the variable z(t) is
either strictly deterministicor follows a diffusion process. The z(t) process is a twice

continuously differentiable function of its arguments. The key defining property of
z(t) is that it does not vary with f(t), i.e.      = 0. For the example given below,
                                            Uf(t)
the z   process given in equation (lSb) (a backward—looking deterministic process)

generates, together with equation (18a),     a bubble process that satisfies equation (4).

          More generally, equation (18a) will hold provided z satisfies

                                           = [k(of(t)   - j) + oz(t)]dt.
          The z process given in (19) (and therefore the                 B process      itself) can be
forward—looking, backward—looking (or a linear combination of the forward—looking
and backward—looking solutions), it can be strictly deterministicor stochastic.

          An example of a forward—looking solution                    for z (now treated as         a
non—predetermined variable) which satisfies equations                (isa)   and (19) (and of course

equation (4)) is givenin equation (20).

          Here R(t) is any strictly deterministic or stochastic process which satisfies
           =
BtdR(t)dt csR(t)dt. It can be predetermined or non—predetermined. One possible
choice for R(t) would be the process given on the right—hand side of (iSb). This

would make the bubble      B(t) in (isa) a function of current, past and anticipated
future values of the unregulated fundamental.
          Another interesting bubble process involving          f   is the following:

        If   B   can depend on the regulated value of the fundamental as well as on the

unregulated fundamental, we can generate the very unusual bubble given in equation
(24).



(24)                            B(t) =   - g(f(t), B(r)) + kf(t) + z(t).
This bubble is consistentwith the law of motion (4), provided that (25) holds:

          Equation (26) is an example of a simple stochastic process for z that satisfies

(26)          z(t) =        eQ(t) [{-a[g(f(v),.) - kf(v)]

        While this bubble is consistent with the law of motion (4) within the target
zone, it does not permit the boundary conditions to be satisfied. With this process for

B(t) the exchange rate is given by


(27)                                    s(t) = kf(t)     + z(t).

       Note that in this case s increases or decreases linearly with             f (if k # 0), thus
making "smooth pasting" boundary conditions impossible to apply. When                  k = 0, 5(t)
is independent of f(t), although z(t) of course depends on past values of             f (and of fl


       (b) Bubbles that burst


      Blanchard [1979] provides an interesting example of a rational speculative
bubble whose expected duration (time until the moment a collapse occurs) is finite. It
is most easily motivated in discrete time. Equation (28) is the discrete analog of
equation (1).


(28)                   5t
                            = 0(1 + u)ft + (1 +

        The solution of (28) coo±tion on current and expected future vues of 1t is



(29)                        s = o(i + 0)_i E0 (1 + or' Etft+ + Bt

where        satisfies

        Consider the following process for B

(31)    Bt+i = (1         irr'(i + o)Bt + +i

        Bt+i = 6t+i                                             with probability   r

where 0<     r<   1   and



(32)                                             =            = 0.
                                     Etct+i          Etct+i

        It is easily checked that     (31) and (32) satisfy (30). Equations (31) and (32)
define a bubble (stocbastic if       t      or       is a random variable) for which there is   a
constant probability of collapse,     ir,   each period. If a collapse occurs in period   t+l,
the exchange rate returns to its fundamental value if   = 0. More generally, if
       is random, the expected post—collapse value of the exchange rate is its
fundamental value, but the realized value of the exchange rate can differ from this

expectation by a zero mean forecast error. If the bubble coliapses in period t+1 and
                                                  —27—



         is non—zero,     a new    bubble starts in period   t+1    whicb follows a law of motion
like (31) and (32), but possibly witb a different value of ir and different (although still
zero mean) random disturbanceterms c and c.

         In continuous time the        same idea is captured as follows. ir now is the constant

instantaneous probability of collapse of the bubble.               Conditional on   the bubble not
having collapsed by time t, the probability of the bubble lasting till time t + At is
e_iAt (At 0). We consider the following process for B. As before,
                                                                         Wb and Wb
are standard Wiener processes. Conditional on the bubble having lasted till time t, we
have



(33)               B(t+At) = e(      r)AtB(t) + Cb
                                                     Jle(XWbN)
         with probability



                   B(t+At) = b
                                  Jeb(v)
         with probability 1       — e-irAt




         It follows that the      expected rate of change of B per unit time over the interval

[t,   t+At]   is



               B B(t+At) — B(t)     oAt

         In   the limit as   At
                              0 this becomes EtdB(t) = oB(t)dt, as required. While
the bubble lasts, the instantaneousrate of change of the bubble is givenby

       While the expected rate of change of the bubble is EtdB = aBdt, the expected
rate of variation of B conditional on the bubble surviving the next instant, is given

by (a + ir)Bdt.
       Let tc be the (random) time when the bubble collapses. If the value of B at
                                 tc (a-i-r)(tc—v)
the time of collapse, B(tc) =      e    b        dWb(v) is non—zero, a new bubble
will start   at tc   possibly with a different value of ii, different white noise processes

dWb and dWb and different values for ab and
     A Blanchard bubble is perfectly compatiblewith our target zone model. When

it collapses there will be a discrete        change in the level of the exchange rate, which lies
on the trajectory appropriate to the new (post—coliapse) bubble. Since this change is

unexpected, no arbitrageopportunities arise.


                     zones with fundamental—dependent bubbles



        If the value of the bubble at time t is a function of the contemporaneous            value

of the unregulated fundamental, then within the target zone the                   response of the

exchange rate to the fundamental will be affected relative to the case            of an exogenous

bubble (and, a—fortiori, relative to the          no—bubble case). This is   straightforward, since

in this case         =   1.   As long as          j —1,   the tangency conditions (bc—cl),   (llb)
and   (lld) are the same as in the case of an exogenous bubble.

 V. TheDistribution Function of the ExchangeRate in a Target Zone in the
                               Presence of a Rational SpeculativeBubble

        By Ito's lemma, the exchange rate in the target zone is a           diffusion process with
 stochastic differential


 (35)               ds(t) = [gf(f,.)p + gff(f,.)4]dt     + gf(f,.)cfdWf+ dB.

        Let  Vartx(t') denote the variance of x(t') conditional on the information
 available at time t, that is
                               Vartx(t') z Et[x(t') — Etx(t')]2. The instantaneous
 varianceof the bubble process is given by
                                           o(f, f, s, B, .) Since the only restriction
 on the bubble process is that                   = nBdt, it is certainly
                                       EtdB                              permissible for the
instantaneous variance of the bubble process to depend on               f, f, s, B or othcr
variables.
        As before, recognizing    that B     may depend on    f, we write

                                             -.         ,9z

        Fora bubble process to be consistent with a target zone under the specified
intervention rule, it must be the case that, for any size
                                                             bubble, the              boundary

conditions characterize       tangency points that are local maxima (minima)             if the

tangency is at the upper (lower) boundary. For a bubble that is consistent with the
law of motion in (4) but does not permit smooth pasting according to (load), we refer
to the bubble in (18a,b) with k = —1 or the bubble             given in (24) and (25).

       Note that the instantaneous conditional variance of the change in the exchange

rate no longer in general goes to zero as the boundaries of the target zone are
approached. As the exchange rate approaches the boundary, the variance of the

exogenous component of the bubble need not go to zero nor need gf + bf tend to zero.

      If, in the spirit of Obstfeld—Rogoff and Diba—Grnssman, we accept the
proposition that under free floating bubbles cannot occur, the cnnditional expectation
and variance of the change in the exchange rate with a free float are (letting s denote
the exchange rate under a free float):


                                                       =

       Trivially, since bubbles can exist in a target zone, the instantaneous conditional
variance of changes in the exchange rate may be less under free floating than under a

                                 8(t) e i(t) — i*(t)   = Ft ds(t)/dt.


        It follows that the instantaneousconditional mean and variance of the change in

 the interest differentialin the target zone are given by

        As noted in Svensson      [1989], if
                                                =     0    (and therefore also fz =   0)   equations
(36b) and   (37b) imply that (denoting the conditional standard deviation by           SD)

                                       ds   —   —1          dS
                                 SDt()            SDt() = Cf.

        This finding of a constant trade—off between the instantaneousvariability of the

change in   the exchange rate     and the instantaneous variability of the cbange in the
interest differential is no longer automaticallyvalid when there is a bubble, as can be
verified by inspection of (36b) and (37b).

        The conditional instantaneous mean and variance of the change in the interest

differentialunder a free float, dS, are:



                                            Etdb(t)
                                                      =0
and

                                         Vartds(t)
                                                          = 0.

        With or without a bubble, the free float           therefore always delivers more stability
in changes in the interest differential than does the target zone.
       The relationship between the level of the exchange rate and the interest
differentialin the target zone is found by noting that


            95 =            lB

                                               f < f0, a downward—sloping relation-
ship between the level of the exchange rate and the interest differential. This relation-

ship is qualitativsly unaffected by the bubble if the current value of the bubble is
independentof the current value of the fundamental, if we again restrict the analysis to
the upward—sloping part of the h(f,B(r), B(t)) = g(f) + B(t) function. There are,
however, no good reasons for this restriction when there are bubbles, so the

relationship between the level of the exchange rate and the interest differential can
change sign. This is shown in Figure 2 for an exogenous bubble.
          Harrison [1985, pp.      89—92] shows that             the steady state or unconditional density

which is regulated on the close interval           [f1,              is   given by:

                        =                           if p         0   (truncated exponentialdensity)

                         0 = 2/wf-2



       Without a bubble     it follows that, since s = g(f) is a strictly increasingfunction
of f with continuous first derivative on the open interval
                                                                        f0) and the implicit
(inverse) function f =     g(s)       therefore exists on the target zone (except at the end

points), the steady state density function of s,        cc(s) say, is given   by:


             (5)7r(                                            Sj<5<5u
                      (s))
                 g'(fjs))
       Svensson [1989] shows that the resulting distribution                  of    exchange rates is
U—shaped.
        With a bubble, however, the long—run behavior of the exchange rate is quite
different. First of all, one of the state variables, the bubble, is non—stationary and

unregulated. It therefore does not possess a steady state distribution. The other state
variable,   f, is of course also non—stationary when unregulated, but regulation may
still ensure that it has a steady state distribution. Note, however that bounds set by
the controller are bounds on s, not on        f.    It is   clearly possible for      f to become    a
negative number smaller than the value of f1 associatedwith B =                 U    (for instance if a
positive bubble grows steadily and there is a long sequence of, on average, negative
realizations of df within the target zone). Similarly, f can become a positive number

larger than the value of f0 associated with         B   =0   if a negative bubble steadily grows
in size and there is a long run of, on average, positive realizations of df.8
        While the derivation of the steady-state distribution of s for most interesting
cases (including   the   exogenous stochastic bubble and the stochastic bubble that
depends on f) remains to be done, a few general remarks can be made.
       Consider first   the case of an exogenous, non-stochastic bubble.              The asymptotic
                                                 —34—
                                                                                                       )

distribution of the exchange rate will, if the bubble         is positive,   put all its probability
mass near its upper boundary value          s.     In this very simple case, the target zone

doesn't kill the bubble, but the bubble effectively kills the target zone and turns it,
asymptotically,into a fixed exchange rate regime.
        Now consider the case where       the bubble   isstochastic. If we have the exogenous
geometricbubble dB =          caBdt   + cTBBdWB,   tbe bubble cannot change sign, althoughit
can change direction. Take the case with               B(O)   >   0.   If the bubble ever reaches
B = 0, it dies and we are back henceforth in the case studied by Svenssoo. Clearly we
expect to have a non—degenerate distribution of s in this case, but still with more
mass at su than without a bubble.
      If the exogenous bubble process is given instead by dB = oBdt +
                                                                             CBdWB
with     > 0 but constant, B will, in a representative history, assume both positive
and negative values. The bubble never dies in this case. Relative to the case studied
by Svensson we would expect the long—run density function to have more mass at the
two end points but with no particular bias towards either
                                                          s0 or s. Asymptotically,
the influence of the initial conditions for B on the density function for s should
vanish. We hope to back up these intuitions with solid analysis in the near future.


VT. Bubbles, target zones      and intervention rules: what gives when they are inconsistent?

       Our view of what happens to speculative bubbles under a credible target zone is
rather different from that of Miller, Weller and Williamson[19891 (henceforth MWW).
The formal analysis in their paper is cast in terms of Blanchard bubbles, but would

apply   a—fortiori   to the   non—collapsing bubbles we considered.             MWW put their
argument succinctly:


              If all market participants believe that, when the exchange rate
              hits the edge of the band, the authorities will defend the rate
              bp sudden intervention (designed to produce a jump in the
              rate), this must cause the bubble to burst. But this is
                                                    —35 —



                 inconsistent with the existence      of a   bubble   in the first
                                                                              wish
                 If all know this collapse is certain to occur at time t, allplace:
                 to sell the currency at t—e. But then collapse will occur at t—e.
                 Repeating this argument we find that collapse must occur at
                 time zero that is, all such bubbles are "strangled at birth".

                 (Miller, Weller and Williamson 1g8g]).

         It should be recognizedthat in this paper we have changed the intervention
rules followed by the authorities from what was assumed by MWW and by the other

contributors to this literature. In addition to the standard reflection policies, we allow
the accommodation by the authorities of sustaining speculative attacks. The
intervention policies consideredby MWW and in the rest of this literature, do not have
this feature. It should therefore come as no surprise that from different assumptions
we reach different conclusions.
      Given the assumption that the only form of intervention is regulation at the
boundaries through infinitesimal reflecting operations, the conclusion that this

configuration is inconsistent with rational bubbles follows. One common response to
this inconsistency       is   to treat the bubble as a residuaL The reasoning goes as follows: at
a point like LI*1 in Figure            la there would be a discontinuous anticipated fall in the
value   of   s from 5u to       ;, the value of the exchange rate at f = u' on the bubble
eater for B =      0,    given by s = g(f, B0) + B0, interpreting B° to equal zero. This
violates the no—arbitrage condition.
       What is presented in the previous paragraph as a "real—time" event, the fall of
the exchange rate from 5u to s, can in fact be no more than the designation of s as the
only value of     the exchange rate reached when               = tu , that is consistent with the
intervention rule. Equivalently, B a 0 is the only value of the bubble consistent with
the intervention rule. If the system really were (somehow) at 12*1 , there would be an

inconsistency.     We cannot deduce how the exchange rate would behave starting from
an inconsistent position.

        Note that       it is not just the assumption   of a credible exchange rate target zone
                                               —36 —




that producesthe inconsistency, but the combination of a credible target zone and a

particular intervention rule that can only support the target zone if no bubble exists.
Our alternative intervention rule, which has a discrete (stock—shift) increase in           f at
                       1                                                         *1
Il   from f11*1 to   f11
                           and a corresponding movement of the equilibriumfrom 11 to

fli, consistentlycombines a credible target zone and rational bubbles.
       An obvious question would seem to be: Why would the authorities adopt a rule

that permits the presence    of bubbles rather than   a rule that   precludes their existence?

       Putting the question this way prejudges the auswer, because it assumes that,
given an inconsistency between having       a credible target zone, a rational bubble and a
particular intervention policy, the inconsistency must be resolved by dropping the
bubble, rather than by dropping the target zone or the intervention policy. We prefer
to view the existence of a bubble as a            : A bubble   either exists or it doesn't, and
the authorities must design their intervention policy          accordingly,   if they   wish to

support the target zone.
       A particular intervention rule (e.g. infinitesimal reflecting interventions       at the
boundaries without accommodation of friendly speculative attacks) may              of course   be

inconsistent with having a credible target zone in the presence of bubbles.                 This

implies, in our view, a collapse either of the target zone or of the intervention rule, but
not of the bubble, which      is   not an object of choice at some initial date, not even a
collective one. Given the existence of a bubble,      a credible target zone requires a policy
rule specification that permits the bubble and the target zone to coexist. Of course it
must also be capable of handling the no—bubblecase . Our rule            is an example of   such
a consistentpolicy.9


VII. Conclusions


       The theory of exchange rate behavior within a target zone as developed in the
                                            —37 —




recent literature holds that exchange rates under a currency band regime are less

responsive to fundamental shocks than exchange rates under free float, provided that
the intervention rules of the Central Bank(s) are common knowledge. Moreover, there
always exists a trade—off between the instantaneous volatility             of       in the
                                                                                changes
exchange rates and changes in the interest rate differential,   independentlyof the size of
the band and the degree of credibilityof the target zone. These results are derived after

having assumed a     priori that "rational excess   volatility" (due to so called rational

bubbles) does not occur in the foreign exchange market. Implicitly or explicitly,         it is
assumed   that speculative bubbles are incompatible with the existence and the
persistenceof a credible target zone, so that they never materialize.
         We consider instead a setup in which the existence of speculative behavior is a
datum the Central Bank has     to   deal with. We show   that there   is   no incompatibility
between the existence of a target zone and the presence of rational bubbles. Rather,
there are intervention rules that should be followed by the Central Bank when
speculative bubbles arise, and these same rules include as a special case the traditional

policies for defending an exchange rate band when speculative bubbles do not occur.
         In the standard   model, the defense of a target zone is guaranteed by
intermittent variations in domestic credit (say through open market operations)

and/or non sterilized foreign market interventions that take place when the exchange
rate hits one of the limits of the band. For instance, when the exchange rate reaches
the upper boundary, the stock of foreign reserves (or the stock of domestic credit) is
reduced in order to prevent the exchange rate from ralsing further. Heuristically, these

operations can be characterizedas infinitesimal reflecting interventions. Although the
size of the reflecting operations may     be quantitatively limited, the induced
expectationsstabilizethe exchange rate even before the upper or lower limit is reached.
      We show that in the cum bubble setup reflecting interventions are insufficient.
In fact, when speculative bubbles arise, the companion phenomena of speculative
                                              —   38 —




attacks on     the target   zone must occur as well.         These speculative attacks are

stock—shift reshuffles of private agents' financial portfolios led by rational expectations

of changes in the rate      of exchange rate depreciation.    As an example, if the rate of

appreciation of the exchange rate were suddenly expected to increase, rational private
agents would increase their demand for home country money and/or decrease their
demand for foreign country money due to a decrease in the domestic—foreign interest
rate differential.
       We show that the defense of the target zone in the presence of bubbles is

guaranteed if the Central Bank accommodates speculative attacks wben the latter are
friendly,   that is when they are consistent with the survival of the target zone itself
(gtven the Central Bank's role).          This intuitive policy rule is compatible with

self—fulfillingexpectations: a friendly attack occurs only    if agents know that it will be
accommodated, and exactly because of the passive accommodation the speculative
attack snstain8 the target zone. Hence, the policy rule is summarized by the maxim
"Reflect when this is sufficient; accommodate when this is necessary".

       We show that when the exchange rate hits one of the boundaries with a
non—zero bubble,     an   accommodated friendly speculative attack occurs, followed by

reflecting interventions.

        Many of the conclusions reached in the existing literature do not appear
sufficiently robust when speculative bubbles are considered as well. First, it is not true

anymore that the instantaneous volatility of exchange rates within a target zone is

always less than the instantaneous volatility of exchange rate under free float, provided

that, for familiar reasons, in free float no speculative bubble arises. Second, the finding
of a constant trade—off between the instantaneous variability of the change in the

exchange rate and the instantaneous variability of the change in the interest rate
                                                                                               p
differential is no longer automaticallyvalid when there is a bubble.

       Moreover, the standard theory characterizes a stable relation between      the level
                                               —39 —




of the   exchange rate and the expected rate of depreciation (equal to the interest rate
differential   if uncovered interest parity holds).   According to this model, the higher the

exchange rate, the lower the interest rate differential.         Moreover the interest rate
differential is always negative in the neighborhood         of the upper boundary of the
exchange rate band; the opposite result holds           in the neighborhood of the lower

boundary. We show that this relation is no longer stable when bubbles arise.

        'Consider a dynamic linear rational expectations                model with constant

coefficients    that   has   the usual     saddlepoint configuration (as many predetermined

variables, n1 say, as stable characteristic roots and as many non—predetermined

variables, n2 say, as unstable characteristic roots). Transformthe system to canonical

variables, by diagonalizing it or by using Jordan's canonical form. Group together the

n2    dynamic equations containing the canonical variables whose homogeneous

equations are governed by the unstable roots.                   The general solution for these

non—predetermined canonical variables can contain             an n2—dimensional bubble    process

that must satisfy the         homogeneous equation system of the n2 non—predetermined

canonical      variables.   Bubble processes will therefore be non—stationary (in

expectation).     The state variables of the model, which are linear combinations of the
canonical variables, will,      if there   is   a bubble, be non—stationary. If there are more

non—predetermined state variables than unstable roots, stationary bubbles will of
course be possible even in linear models.



        2Sisnilar arguments
                          can be made for non—stationary bubbles (and the

non—stationary behavior of key endogenous variables frequently associated with

non—stationary bubbles) in certain non—linear models. For instance, in overlapping

generations     (OLG) models       of a         competitive economy with a single perishable

commodity and with non—interest—bearing outside money as the only store                 of value,
rational deflationary bubbles (i.e. non—stationary bubbles with the price level declining
to zero) have been shown to be infeasible. Take for instance the case of a two—period
OLG model with a constant population in which               the nominal money   stock is constant,
                                              —41 —




all money   is held by the old and only   the young receive a constant bounded endowment
stream of the single commodity. If the price level were to fall without bound, real cash
balances would be increasingwithout bound and the demand for the commodityby the

old generation would increase without bound. Since the supply of the good each period
is bounded above by the sum of the endowments of the young, sooner or later the
demand for the commodity must outstrip the supply. A sequence of money prices

falling to zero can therefore not be rational expectations equilibrium (see e.g. Hahn

[1982, p. 10]).
       Unless very strong restrictions are placed on tbe private utility functions,

rational inflationary bubbles (with the price level increasing without bound despite a
constant nominal money stock) can exist in such an economy. The sequence of rising
prices would, in the limit, drive the real value    of money to zero. The steady state to
which such a model converges is that of a non—monetary economy. To rule out
inflationary bubbles as well, Obstfeld and Rogoff [1983], in an infinite—lived
representative agent model, imposed a political—technological restriction on the
terminal value of money: the government fractionally             backs the curren,cy by

guaranteeing a minimal real redemption value for money. Even if private agents are
not completely certain that they can redeem their money in any given period, this
suffices to rule out speculative hyperinflations.    While this assumptionon government
behavior seems quite ad—hoc, it is often cited as the second blade    of the   scissors   that
cut the lifeline of non—stationary rational speculative bubbles, both deflationary and

inflationary. Diba and Grossman [1988] also derive sufficient conditions for ruling out
non—stationary inflationarybubbles.



       3Sargent and Wallace's "Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic" model (Sargent
and Wallace [1981]) can exhibit stationary rational bubbles.          Even a first order

deterministic non—linear difference equation may exhibit various kinds of periodic
                                                         —   42 —




solutions or chaotic behavior (see e.g. Benhabib and Day [1981, 1982] and Grandmont

[1985]).   Stationary bubbles are easily generated by such models (Azariadis [1981],
Azariadis and Guesnerie [1986], Chiappori and Guesnerie [1988], Woodford [1987],
Farmer and Woodford                 [1986]).    Second order deterministic non—linear differential

equations can generate limit cycles and third order non—linear differential equations
can exhibit chaotic behavior.                  Again, such models can support stationary rational
speculative bubbles.


       4Tiiis interpretation of f comes from the two—country mini—model outlined

below. All variables except interest rates are in natural logarithms.                      m is the home

country nominal money stock, p the home country price level, y home country real
GDP, i the home country short nominal interest rate and                        s the   spot price of foreign
exchange. Corresponding foreign country variables are starred.


           —p       = ky — i, k, .1 > 0                                (Home monetary equilibrium)

           *           *
               —
                   p       = ky* — Xi*                                 (Foreign monetary equilibrium)

                   *
       p   =p +                                                        (PurchasingPower Parity)


       Etds(t)
                       = [i(t) — i*(t)]dt                              (Uncovered Interest Parity)


       From this very simple model we obtain the following relation:


                                                    —
                           s(t)dt = ]m(t) — m*(t)       k(y(t) — y*(t))]dt + AEtds(t).


       This corresponds to equation (1) with                  .1   =   o   (the interest semi—elasticity of
                                                 —43—



                       *     *
money demand) andf= m—m —k(y—y ).



        5Equation (5) is of course equivalent to the perhaps more familiar form

                                                 —                 —       A
                                                         Af(t)
                                                          1                21(t)
                  s(t)=fO)+B(t)++A1(t)e                          +A2(t)e


where   A1 and A2
                      are constant as long as s is in the interior of the target zone, but
can change when s is at one of its boundaries.              For many bubbles, including the
exogenous ones, the representation given in (5) is attractive because it can bring nut

clearly the horizontal shift nf the     bubble   eater (defined below) when the magnitude of
the bubble varies.


        6While   the expected rate      of change of s   at the   reflection points on the upper

boundary (points like       or   flu)    is always   less than that at points like 111, the
                             *1
expected rate of change at II can, for very small bubbles, be negatsve.


        7The notion of   a friendly or      sustaining speculative attack is related     to the
"sustaining" money demand by arbitrageurs in one of the solutions to the "gold
standard paradox" proposed by Buiter and Grilli                  [1989]. See also Krugman   and
Rotemberg 119901.

        8The infimumof f is where        the downward—slopingpart        of the bubble eater for

Bu cuts the upper boundary. The supremumof f is where the                      downward—sloping
part of the bubble eater for B1 cuts the lower boundary.

                                            —44—




at its most striking feature: the possibility of very   frequent interventions at the edges
of the zone.

         Consider for simplicity a deterministicbubble that starts from a positive initial
value.   It might be   argued that the interventions in the fundamentalthat are required
to offset such a non—stationary bubble are not sustainablebecause, as the magnitudeof
the bubble grows over time, interventions at the upper boundary can be expected to
become more and more frequent. Finite international reserves (assuming tbese are the

intervention medium) are bound to be exhaustedin due course.
         It should be noted that a very similar argument can be made     even if there is no

bubble, as long as there is positive drift in the fundamental. While the expected value
of the fundamental grows linearly (at a constant rate p) rather than exponentially as
the bubble does, the drift of the unregulated fundamentalwill also in finite time cause

any finite stock of reserves to be exhausted with probability one. Indeed, even without
drift in the fundamental (and without a bubble), a stochastic fundamental process
driven by Brownian motion will bring any finite stock of reserves down to any positive
lower bound in finite time with probability one (see Buiter [1989]).

         The problems   of international reserve exhaustion created by the   bubble are of
course less severeif the bubble is a Blanchard bubble, which has finite expected
duration. Note also that in the most common interpretation of our model, the
fundamental f stands for relative home country money supply minus relative real
income   —   related money demand. Taking relative nominal money stocks as the object

of regulation, there is nothing in the logic of the model that requires international

reserves to be used to regulate the money stocks. Domestic credit expansion (whether

reflecting open market operations or monetary financing of government budget deficits)
can achieve the same monetary objectives.
