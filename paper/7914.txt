1.       Introduction and summary

         The puzzling lack of a tighter association between goods' prices and the exchange rate is one of the

intriguing observations in International Economics. Following Krugman (1987), pricing in domestic currency

and pricing to market (PTM) have provided an interpretation to this puzzle.1 A direct implication of the PTM

hypothesis is the low pass-through from the exchange rate to prices, and the resultant failure of the relative PPP

to hold in the short and intermediate-runs. While the empirical literature confirmed these predictions, it also

detected a systematic heterogeneity of the patterns of PTM across various goods.2 Recent studies also suggest

that the relative PPP holds better in emerging markets.3 An important unresolved question concerns the

conditions under which PTM is endogenously chosen by the producers, and when should we expect the relative

PPP to hold more tightly. Addressing these questions is crucial for a better understanding of issues like the

welfare implications of exchange rate volatility, the incidence of protective policies, and the welfare ranking of

fixed versus flexible exchange rate regimes.

         The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework where the degree of pricing to market is

endogenously determined, as part of the problem of balancing the benefits of pre-set prices with the costs of

managing the delivery system needed to support rigid prices. This paper is motivated by the inherent trade-off

between price and quantity adjustments, where pricing in local currency requires that quantities should be

plentiful to fulfill the demand at the pre-set price. Hence, pricing in local currency

goods' prices and the exchange rate, and Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) for a recent overview of puzzles in
International Economics (including the pricing puzzle), highlighting the relevance of transportation costs. See
Goldberg and Knetter (1997) for a comprehensive review of the empirical literature that followed Krugman's
study.

and pricing to market may involve complex issues of delivery management. In such a system, the degree of

local currency pricing is impacted by the financial costs of timely delivery of goods, as well as by the

transportation costs associated with timely re-supply of inventories.4

        The paper departs from the pervious pricing to market literature by allowing time dependent

transportation costs. The presumption is that the cost of delivering a good ordered ahead of time is lower than

the cost of a last minute delivery, as pre-buying would allow to find the cheapest means of transportation, even if

it would require more time to deliver [see Carlton (1979) for a pioneering analysis on costly delivery lags].5

We model the implications of time dependent transportation costs on the pricing and the delivery of imports in a

2 period, 2 goods model, where the second period terms of trade are random. Allowing time dependent

transportation costs adds a dimension of investment to the pre-buying of imports. With uncertain future terms of

trade, spot market imports resembles an option -- one exercises the option of last minute imports if the realized

terms of trade are favorable enough.

        The above suggests a simple way of modeling endogenously the switch from pricing to market to a

flexible price environment. Assuming that the expected discounted cost of last minute delivery is higher than

pre-buying, it follows that in countries where the terms of trade volatility is small, most imports are pre-bought,

and the spot market for imports is inactive. In these circumstances the prices of importables are delinked from

the realized terms of trade, as is the case in the pricing to market (PTM) regime. Greater volatility induces more

frequent realizations of relatively high and low values of the real exchange rate. For terms of trade volatility high

enough, it would make sense to scale down the pre-buying, in order to exploit the "good tail" of the real


4       These issues were sidestepped by most of the literature by assuming instant delivery of traded goods.
5       An example of these considerations is the pricing of heating oil to consumers, where the "pre-buy
protection plan" allows consumers to purchase forward the desired amount of heating oil at a pre-set price that
is expected to be lower than the future spot market price for last minute delivery. Each spring customers in New
England are advised -- "Before the weather turns colder, protect and insulate your wallet from the inevitable
rising costs of home heating oil. This program (the pre-buy) allows you to lock into fuel oil prices while they are
low, and pay that one low fixed price for your entire year's usage, no matter how high the prices may soar."

exchange distribution, where spot market imports are cheaper. In these circumstances, we will obverse a mixed

regime -- if the realized real exchange rate is favorable enough, imports are purchased in the spot market, the

price of imports is determined by the realized real exchange rate, and a version of relative PPP holds.

Otherwise, the pricing to market will prevail. As is the case with options, the value of the option of spot market

imports increases with the volatility, implying that the frequency of pricing to market tends to be lower in more

volatile economies.

        Another implication of time dependent transportation costs is that financial considerations determine the

frequency of pricing to market, and the deviations from relative PPP. Specifically, higher financing costs would

increase the cost of pre-buying, encouraging spot market imports, reducing the frequency of pricing to market,

increasing the tendency of relative PPP to hold, and increasing the expected price of imports. The net effect is

welfare reducing as the PTM shields consumers from the adverse purchasing power effects of weak terms of

trade. This result is of special relevance for emerging markets, where limited financial depth and costly credit

encourage spot market trade, and discourage pre-buying. It suggests 2 channels explaining why relative PPP

may hold better for emerging markets -- first the volatility, and second the financing costs. Both imply less

frequent pricing to markets, and greater association between the exchange rate, the prices of imports, and the

volume of trade. While the 2 channels reinforce each other in reducing the incidence of PTM, they have

different welfare implications. Our discussion shows that, for a given real interest rate, higher terms of trade

volatility tend to increase welfare. Higher financing costs are always welfare reducing, and are associated with

lower imports.6

        The implications of pricing to market on the desirable exchange rate flexibility have been studied by

comparing the behavior of the nominal exchange rate and prices in regimes with polar pricing rules for imports.

In the first, import prices are set in producer's currency, as has been the traditional assumption in the Mundell-

Fleming open economy macro models. In the second system, import prices are set in consumer currencies, in

line with the pricing to market literature.7 These studies pointed out that the welfare ranking of fix versus

6       These effects are potentially large, and provide an interpretation for the potential use of cutting trade
credit as a means of inducing borrowers to service their debt.
7       See Devereux and Engel (1998) and Betts and Devereux (2000).

flexible exchange rate regimes and the dynamics of output and consumption hinge on the pricing rule. For

example, Devereux and Engel (1998) report that "When prices are set in producer's currency, as in the

traditional framework, we find that there is a trade-off between floating and fixed exchange rates. Exchange rate

adjustment under floating rates allows for a lower variance of consumption, but exchange rate volatility itself

leads to a lower average level of consumption. When prices are set in consumer's currency, floating exchange

rates always dominate fixed exchange rates." Our findings imply that the pre-setting prices in consumer's

currency would not characterize emerging markets, and would be observed more frequently in the OECD

countries. This finding, combined with the Devereux and Engel (1998) results, may provide another explanation

for the "fear to float" by emerging market economies.

          Section 2 describes the model, and characterizes the impact of a higher discount rate and higher terms

of trade volatility for the case of linear intertemporal preferences. Section 3 investigates the welfare

consequences of higher financing costs. Section 4 concludes. The Appendix extends the model to risk averse

agents.

2.      The model

        Assume a small economy producing a domestic traded good, and consuming both domestic and foreign
goods (denoted by x and y , respectively). Imports are associated with transportation costs that depend on the

delivery lag. We focus on the simplest version of the model - a 2 period endowment model, where the supply
of the domestic good in period i is xi (i = 1, 2). The domestic and the foreign markets are geographically

separated. Imports of the foreign goods are subject to time dependent transportation costs, assumed to be

higher for last minute delivery.8 Consider the case where the consumer's utility H is the discounted value of
temporal utilities vt (t = 1, 2) -- 9


                                               v1 = x1         for  t =1

                       1+ρ                      
                                                v = x + θ [Y ]β for t = 2

                                                         β 2



For simplicity of presentation, we assume that imports are consumed only in the second period. We normalize

the first period prices of the domestic good to 1. Consumers can pre-buy imports in the first period for a
scheduled delivery in the second period. The "pre-buying" price of y2 is 1 + t units of x1 ( t stands for the

transportation costs, where the implicit cost of y2 , net of transportation and financing, is normalized to 1).

Consumers may postpone buying y to the second period, relying on the spot market. The spot market price of
y2 is random




8       Pre-buying may be cheaper also if production costs are lower when producers have more lead time
[see Carlton (1979) for further discussion of this possibility]. The logic of our analysis applies also to the case
where production costs are time dependent.
9       With utility (1) the demand for imports is likely to be independent from income, simplifying the analytical
discussion. It can be shown that the main results of the paper are applicable to other utilities, though the
analytical discussion is more involved.

where t˜ is the transportation cost for spot "last minute" deliveries, and ε is a random shock determining the
second period international relative price of the domestic good. We denote by f (ε ) the corresponding p.d.f. of

the "external terms of trade," defined in the interval ε ≤ ε ≤ ε , where − 1 < ε . We denote by y2p the pre-

buying of imports contracted for second period delivery, and by y2s the spot market imports. The opportunity

costs of imports y2p ; y2s in terms of exports sold in period 1 and 2 are denoted by x1p ; x 2s , respectively, where

The consumption of x and y are characterized by


                 x1 = x1 − x1p − s;
        (4)                                            x1p   x s (1 + ε )
                 x2 = x 2 + s(1 + r*) − x2 ;   y2 =        + 2

where s is the first period saving, yielding a real interest rate r * (defined in terms of the domestic good).

        To avoid a corner solution stemming from the linearity of the intertemporal utility we assume first that
ρ = r *. The drawback of using the linear intertemporal utility is that it does not allow us to investigate fully the

effects of changing the financing cost on the optimal patterns of pre-buying. We will address these issues in the

Appendix, where we illustrate how to extend the analysis to allow for risk averse consumers. The consumer
problem is to determine the optimal pair < x 2s ;x1p > . We solve it backwards -- first we find the optimal spot

market trade in the second period. Next, applying this solution we construct the expected utility in the first

period. Finally, we find the pre-buying that maximizes this expected utility.

        The consumer determines the second period consumption plan by finding the spot market imports that

would maximize

The last line in (10) implies that the consumer will exercise the option of spot market imports in the second

period only if the terms of trade were favorable enough -- if ε * < ε . Otherwise (when ε * > ε ), the second

period supply of imports is determined by the pre-buying of y. In these circumstances the prices of imports are

delinked from the realized terms of trade, as is the case in the pricing to market (PTM) regime.

        Equation (6) indicates that the choice of the optimal pre-buying determines also the range where PTM
                                                 ε*

applies, occurring with probability F(ε *) =     ∫ f (ε ) dε .   It implies that increasing the pre-buying of imports
                                                 ε


reduces the range where the option of spot market imports would be exercised, increasing the frequency of

PTM. This suggests that the optimal pre-buying of imports tends to be lower the greater the value of the

flexibility associated with the option of using the spot market is, as will be the case when the terms of trade

volatility go up. Pre-buying implies also implicit saving, hence the opportunity cost of pre-buying increases with

the discount rate. This suggests that a higher discount rate would reduce the pre-buying, thereby increasing the

range where the option of imports via the spot market is exercised.

        We verify these claims by studying the first order condition determining the optimal pre-buying

The expected gain from pre-buying is the discounted expected marginal utility induced by pre-buying minus the

opportunity cost of pre-buying. Optimality requires this gain to be zero at the margin. Applying (6) to (12), we

The term c is the expected relative intertemporal cost of the spot market to forward imports.10 Henceforth we

will assume that c > 1 , as will be the case if last minute delivery is relatively costly (Section 4 reviews the results

for the case when c < 1 ). The equilibrium relative price in the second period is determined by the ratio of the

marginal utilities of the 2 goods --

Hence, if the realized terms of trade are favorable enough ( ε > ε * ), the spot market for imports is active. In
                                                                                             p      1 + ˜t
these circumstances, the price of imports is determined by the realized real exchange rate, y,2 =          , and the

relative PPP holds (adjusted for transportation costs). We refer to this regime as the flexible price regime, and

denote it by FL.

       If the realized terms of trade are weak (ε < ε * ), no spot market trade will take place, and the PTM
                    p       1 + t˜

The relative price in the PTM regime is determined by the first period pre-buying of the imports, x1p , which is

the outcome of maximizing the first period expected utility. Applying (15) to the first order condition, (12), it

follows that

Hence, the relative price of imports in the PTM regime increases with the discount factor ρ . This suggests that

a higher discount factor will reduce the optimal pre-buying, and will increase the frequency of PTM.

Proposition 1 summarizes the resulting pricing system:



Proposition 1

a.       Higher discount rate, higher pre-buying transportation cost, and lower transportation cost of imports

purchased in the spot market reduce the first period pre-buying. This in turn implies that the frequency of PTM

drops and the frequency of flexible prices (FL regime) increase.



b.       Low volatility economies are characterized by PTM. Spot market imports would be observed if the

volatility of the terms of trade exceeds a threshold. Above that threshold, higher volatility will reduce the

frequency of PTM, increasing spot market imports. A low enough probability of PTM may reverse the impact

of volatility.

         This situation is summarized in Figure 1, where the downwards sloping curves depict the marginal

benefit of pre-buying imports [LHS of (12')] for varying values of the ε * (note that (6) implies that higher ε *

corresponds to a higher pre-buying of imports). The optimal threshold ε * (and the corresponding optimal pre-

buying of imports) is determined at L = 0, at point A for curve ZZ. Increasing c shifts the curve upwards,

increasing thereby the optimal pre-buying of imports, and the frequency of PTM. For a high enough c we

converge to a pure PTM pricing system, where spot market imports would be too expensive for all possible

future terms of trade realizations. A lower c shifts this curve downwards, reducing thereby the optimal threshold

ε *.

        The intuition for result 1b is that in the absence of any volatility, c > 1 implies that pre-buying is cheaper,

hence the PTM regime will prevail. Greater volatility induces more frequent realizations of relatively high and

low real exchange rates. For volatility high enough, it would make sense to scale down the pre-buying, in order

to exploit the "good tail" of the real exchange distribution, where spot market imports are cheaper.

         We illustrate the impact of higher volatility by considering a uniform distribution of the terms of trade
shock, where ε = −ε .11 In these circumstances the first order condition determining the frequency of PTM,

(12'), can be reduced to

This condition implies that the spot market imports will be exercised (and hence F < 1) only if the volatility is

high enough, so that ε > c − 1 .12 Applying (18) we infer that

When the probability of PTM is low enough, further increase in volatility may reverse the association between

volatility and the probability of PTM.13

         Figure 2 depicts the dependency of the frequency of PTM on the terms of trade volatility, for different

levels of c . Above the threshold c − 1 , a higher term of trade volatility reduces the frequency of the PTM

regime. Lower c shifts the curve leftwards and downwards. For a small enough c and for volatility high enough,

the association between volatility and pricing to market may be reversed -- higher volatility increases F. 14

the foreign markets are separated by time independent transportation costs. It is shown there that even in that
simpler world, the association between volatility and deviations from PPP may be reversed for a high enough
volatility.

3.        Financing costs, volatility and welfare

          The empirical literature suggests that import prices are more responsive to the exchange rate in emerging

markets. Our discussion in the previous section suggests two independent channels explaining this finding –

volatility and financing costs. The purpose of this section is to investigate the welfare cost of these channels, and

to identify which of the two has a greater impact on the overall welfare of a country. One way to address these

issues with linear, risk neutral preferences is to assume that the interest rate exceeds the discount factor, and all
pre-buying is financed by credit, as would be the case if x1 = 0 , and r* > ρ . This is a special example of the

model studied in Section 1, corresponding to s = − x1p ; v1 = 0 . The first order condition determining the

optimal level of pre-buying in these circumstances is15

We assume that the interest rate and the terms of trade volatility are not too high, resulting in an internal

equilibrium where some pre-buying takes place, and 0 < F < 1. Proposition 2 summarizes the resulting pricing

system:



Proposition 2

a.        Higher financing costs increase the expected price of imports, reducing the expected deviations from

relative PPP, and reducing welfare.

b.        For a given real interest rate, higher terms of trade volatility tend to increases welfare.

Hence, higher financing costs increase the expected relative price of imports by the transportation cost of spot

market imports.

Hence, the expected deviations from PPP is proportional to the expected gap between the PTM relative price

and the flexible price terms of trade, evaluated along the "bad tail" of the terms of trade distribution. Higher

Recalling that higher financing costs reduce the pre-buying, it follows that it also reduces the expected deviations

from PPP.

Equation (28) implies that the net effect is proportional to the difference between the average utility at the tail

points (A and C, equal to the height of point H) and the expected utility across the entire support. The

convexity of curve ABC implies that this difference is positive. Consequently, a greater terms of trade volatility

increases the expected utility.17

        We illustrate the quantitative nature of these results with the help of a simulation. The bold curve in

figure 4A traces the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on the interest rate. The bold curve in

Figure 4B traces the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on volatility. The contours in both

panels trace the welfare relative to the benchmark at points Q and Q', respectively, where F = 1. Note that

increasing the interest rate from zero to about 0.3 eliminates the pre-buying, and induces a welfare drop of

about 6.5%. This welfare drop is due to the elimination of gains from the pre-buying -- gains attributed to the

ability to protect the purchasing power against weak future terms of trade. It can be shown that the welfare

drop is associated with a large drop in average imports [from 0.44 at point Q, to 0.29 at point M]. Volatility by

itself, however, enhances welfare, as is shown in Figure 4B.




17      Figure 3 assumes a uniform distribution. Similar logic implies that if the demand for imports is elastic
(i.e., if 0.5 < β ), a mean preserving increase in the terms of trade volatility would increase welfare for all
probability distribution functions.

4.      Concluding remarks

        Our discussion provides two possible explanations for why relative PPP holds better for emerging

markets. Higher volatility of terms of trade and higher financial costs in emerging markets should induce tighter

association between the exchange rate and imports prices. While we treated the interest rate and the volatility

as independent, the two are likely to be positively correlated. First, if the domestic capital market in emerging

markets is segmented from the global market, one expects credit to be financed by risk averse agents who

would demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the higher volatility. Second, the literature on costly state

verification pointed out that volatility tends to be associated with higher financial costs [see Townsend (1979)].

Hence, one expects that higher terms of trade volatility will increase the cost of credit. Applying this association,

one may combine Figures 4A and 4B together, tracing the combined effects of the volatility and the interest rate

channels. In these circumstances, one expects that the net welfare effect of volatility will be negative -- the

higher cost of credit will terminate PTM, eliminating any welfare gains from higher volatility. We illustrate this in

Figure 5, which assumes a linear association between terms of trade volatility and financing costs. The bold line

outlines the dependency of the probability of the PTM regime on the volatility. The contours trace the welfare,

relative to the benchmark at point L, where F = 1.

        A key assumption of our paper is that pre-buying is cheaper -- the discounted expected cost of spot

market imports exceeds the expected cost of pre-buying imports. One expects this assumption to hold better

for goods and commodities with high freight/value ratio (oil, cars, etc.). Our methodology is applicable even if

this assumption is violated.18 To simplify, we assumed competitive pricing. The analysis can be readily




18      The discounted expected cost of spot market imports is below the expected cost of pre-buying if the
interest rate is high enough, or if the transportation cost of last minute delivery is not significantly higher than the
transportation cost of pre-buying. In these circumstances, if the volatility of the terms of trade is low, no imports
are pre-bought [hence F = 0]. For high enough volatility, some imports are pre-bought, at a level that is
determined by (12), and F > 0. Even in these circumstances, proposition 2 continues to apply -- a higher
interest rate would reduce the probability of PTM, would increase the expected price of importables, and would
reduce the expected deviations from relative PPP.

extended to allow for monopolistic competitive pricing, where the market power would impact on the pricing

rule.

          Our paper suggests that in the circumstances facing emerging markets, pricing to market would be

observed less frequently than in the OECD countries. Hence, in evaluating the choice of exchange rate regimes

for emerging markets, assuming relative PPP is likely to describe better the economic environment. This in turn

suggests a bias towards lower flexibility of the exchange rate in emerging markets. First, lower flexibility of the

exchange rate may reduce the real interest rate in segmented capital markets (see Aizenman and Hausmann

(2000), where this channel is modeled). Second, as Devereux and Engel (1998) showed, pricing to market

biases the choice in favor of a flexible exchange rate by the resultant delinking of domestic prices from the

exchange rate, a bias that would not hold for emerging markets where the pricing to market is not a viable

option.

        The paper assumed risk neutral agents, with intertemporal linear preferences. While these assumptions

simplified the analysis, the linear model has a limited ability to account for the impact of a higher interest rate.

that with the exception of preferences, all the assumptions of the paper hold. The consumers maximize the

The consumer's problem is to determine the optimal triplet < x 2s ; x1p ; s > . We solve it backwards -- first we

find the optimal spot market trade in the second period ( x2s ). Next, applying this solution we construct the

expected utility in the first period. Finally, we find the pre-buying and the saving ( x1p ;s ) that maximizes this
                                                                          s
expected utility. Note that the first part of the solution (optimal ( x2 )) is identical to the one in Section 2,

because it deals with the patterns of consumption in the second period, after the uncertainty of the terms of trade

has been resolved. Hence, equation (5) - (9) continue to hold. Applying these conditions to (A2), we infer that

the first order conditions determining the optimal saving and the optimal pre-buying are

where U' = ∂ U / ∂x is the marginal utility of x (the domestic good). There are two ways to transfer purchasing

power from the first to the second period -- saving and pre-buying. The first order conditions in (A3) imply that

intertemporal arbitrage exhausts the utility gain from intertemporal trade. Optimal saving is reached when the

first period marginal utility of x equals the interest rate times the expected marginal utility of the second period

consumption, discounted by the subjective rate of time preference (see (A3a)). Similarly, optimal pre-buying

equates the marginal utility of the first period consumption of x (= the opportunity cost of x in the first period) to

the discounted expected marginal utility induced by pre-buying 1/(1+t) units of second period y (see (A3b)).

        The impact of higher financing costs are summarized in the following proposition:

Proposition A1

        Higher interest rate reduces the first period pre-buying for small savings. This in turn implies that the

frequency of PTM goes down.



Proof

        A higher interest rate would increase the relative price of pre-buying. This would lead to a substitution

away from pre-buying to spot market delivery, reducing the incidence of pricing to market. The assumption that

the net saving is small implies that the induced income effect due to the interest rate change is small, and hence

the substitution effect would dominate.
        We illustrate it for the case where φ = 1 (hence U(v) = ln v ). Similar methodology applies for the case

where φ ≠ 1 . The first order conditions can be rewritten as
