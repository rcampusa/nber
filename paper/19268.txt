Evidence for Significant Compression of Morbidity In the Elderly U.S. Population

                                            ABSTRACT

The question of whether morbidity is being compressed into the period just before death has been
at the center of health debates in the United States for some time. Compression of morbidity would
lead to longer life but less rapid medical spending increases than if life extension were accompanied
by expanding morbidity. Using nearly 20 years of data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey,
we examine how health is changing by time period until death. We show that functional measures
of health are improving, and more so the farther away from death the person is surveyed. Disease
rates are relatively constant at all times until death. On net, there is strong evidence for compression
of morbidity based on measured disability, but less clear evidence based on disease-free survival.

       Older Americans are living longer. Life expectancy at age 65 has increased about 2 years

in the past two decades. But are we living healthier? This issue is vital for health policy and

economic reasons. Longer life is valuable to people, but it is even more valuable if the

additional years lived are in good health. For the public sector as well, the consequences of

longer lives depend on their quality. Medical spending for healthy seniors is modest; spending

for the severely disabled is much greater. Thus, if morbidity is being compressed into the period

just before death, the impacts of population aging are not as severe as if additional life involves

many years of expensive care.

       This question of whether morbidity is being compressed into the period just before death

has been at the center of health debates in the United States for some time. Fries (1980) first put

forward the argument that the United States was undergoing a compression of morbidity. His

work was provocative, and others took different views. Gruenberg (1977) argued that reduced

disease mortality would extend unhealthy life, while Manton (1982) posited a dynamic

equilibrium where both morbidity and mortality are falling, leading to indeterminate impacts on

disability-free and disabled life expectancy.

       Empirical evidence on trends in morbidity is also unclear. Some authors argue that

morbidity is being compressed into the period just before death (Cai and Lubitz, 2007; Manton et

al., 2008), while others believe that the period of disabled life is expanding (Crimmins and

Beltrán-Sánchez, 2010) or that the evidence is more mixed (Crimmins et al., 2009).

       There are three reasons for this disagreement. First, there is not a single definition of

morbidity. Some studies look at whether people report specific chronic conditions, which have




                                                  1
increased over time, while other studies look at functioning. As a result, studies differ in the

morbidity trends they incorporate.

           Second, it is often difficult to link health to the stage of life of the individual. If people

are reporting more chronic disease, is that in the period just before the end of life, in which case

the additional disease does not encompass many years? Or is the disease occurring in periods of

time far from the end of life, in which case it represents many years of poor health? To answer

this question, one needs data on quality of life matched to time until death. Most cross-section

data sources do not have such a link, however, and thus they need to make assumptions about the

disease process to generate lifetime disease-prevalence estimates. These assumptions can have

large impacts on the results.

           Third, the data samples that tend to be used often focus on a particular subset of the

population, for example the non-institutionalized. Since there are changes in the residential

location of the elderly population over time, focusing on population subsets can give biased

results.

           In this paper, we examine the issue of compression of morbidity, addressing these three

concerns. Our primary data source is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, or MCBS. We

have MCBS data for a representative sample of the entire elderly population between 1991 and

2009. The sample sizes are large, over 10,000 individuals annually. Further, the MCBS data

have been linked to death records through 2008, and hence all deaths can be matched.

Importantly, this includes deaths that occur after the person has left the survey. Thus, we can

form morbidity measures by time until death for a large, representative share of the elderly

population.




                                                      2
       We use these data in two ways. First, we examine trends in various measures of

morbidity by time until death. We consider a number of different metrics: the presence of

disease; whether the person reports ADL or IADL disability; and various summary measure of

functioning that draw together 19 different dimensions of health (Cutler and Landrum, 2011).

We show trends overall and by time until death.

       As is well known, the MCBS data from the 1990s and 2000s show a reduction in the

share of elderly people who report ADL or IADL limitations (Freedman et al., 2004, 2013). Our

first result is that this reduction in disability is most marked among those with many years until

death. Health status in the year or two just prior to death has been relatively constant over time;

in contrast, health measured three or more years before death has improved measurably.

       We then translate these changes into disability-free life expectancy and disabled life

expectancy. We show that disability-free life expectancy is increasing over time, while disabled

life expectancy is falling. For a typical person aged 65, life expectancy increased by 0.7 years

between 1992 and 2005. Disability-free life expectancy increased by 1.6 years; disabled life

expectancy fell by 0.9 years. The reduction in disabled life expectancy and increase in

disability-free life expectancy is true for both genders and for non-whites as well as whites.

Hence, morbidity is being compressed into the period just before death.

       The paper is structured as follows. We begin in the next section by defining the

compression of morbidity and showing how disability and mortality changes jointly affect

disability-free and disabled life expectancy. The second section describes the data we use. The

third section presents simple trends in health status by time until death. The fourth section

calculates disabled and disability-free life expectancy. The last section concludes.




                                                  3
I.       The Compression of Morbidity

         The question we wish to examine is whether morbidity has been compressed into the

period just before death, or whether it is accounting for a greater part of the life of elderly

individuals. While this goal is clear, the empirical implementation needs a more precise

definition. We consider two definitions of a compression of morbidity. One definition, dating

back to Fries (1980), is whether the life table is ‘rectangularizing’ – that is, whether disabled life

expectancy is falling over time. A second definition is more modest: the share of remaining life

that is non-disabled is increasing over time. Note that in this latter formulation, disabled life

expectancy may be increasing as well, just not as rapidly as non-disabled life expectancy.

         In situations where only morbidity or mortality is changing, these two measures will

always move together. In situations where both mortality and morbidity are changing, however,

trends in the two measures of compression of morbidity may be different.

         To see this, consider a simple example presented in Table 1. The first column depicts a

person who lives for five years, the first three of which are without disability, and the fourth and

fifth are with a disability. To be concrete, suppose that the person has heart disease in the fourth

year and develops chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the fifth, which results in death six

months later. The specific diseases do not matter, but as is typical in the data, we reflect

disability as occurring progressively over life and generally do not consider recovery.

         In forming life tables, people who die during a year are assumed to die halfway through

the year. Thus, the baseline life expectancy1 is 4.5 years, of which the first 3.0 years is

disability-free and the latter 1.5 years is disabled.




1
 We refer to life expectancy even though this is a life table for a single person. It is easier to show the point this
way than to consider a population distribution.

                                                            4
        Now imagine that morbidity declines (column 2). To be specific, suppose that because of

improved medical treatment of cardiac risk factors, the person does not suffer a coronary event in

the fourth year and thus is not disabled in that year. In year 5, however, the person still suffers

lung disease and dies. As the last rows show, overall life expectancy is unchanged, but

disability-free life expectancy has increased to 4.0 years and disabled life expectancy has fallen

to 0.5 years. By either definition above, disability has been compressed into the period before

the end of life.

        The third column shows the impact of a reduction in mortality. We imagine that the

medical system gets better at treating the combination of heart disease and lung disease, and thus

the person survives an additional year with both conditions, albeit they are still disabled. Total

life expectancy has increased by one year in this example, all of which is associated with

disability. Further, the share of life that is disabled has increased. Thus, there is an expansion of

disability by either measure. Note that in this example, the person is still better off; it is just that

the disabled part of life has increased.

        The final column shows a combination of disability reductions (the person does not suffer

the coronary event) and mortality reductions (the person survives an additional year with lung

disease). Life expectancy has increased by 1 year, relative to the baseline. The increase is

entirely in disability-free life; disabled life starts one year later but ends one year later. In this

scenario, whether morbidity has been compressed depends on the definition employed: disabled

life expectancy has not declined, but a greater share of life is spent in the non-disabled state.

        In general, the impact of combined morbidity and mortality changes on disability-free

and disabled life expectancy depends on how rapid each change is and when in the course of life

it occurs. All of this we need to evaluate empirically.



                                                    5
II.      Medicare Current Beneficiary Data

         Our primary data source is the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). The

MCBS, sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), is a nationally

representative survey of aged, disabled, and institutionalized Medicare beneficiaries that over-

samples the very old (aged 85 or older) and disabled Medicare beneficiaries. Since we are

interested in health among the elderly, we restrict our sample to the population aged 65 and

older.

         A number of surveys have measures of disability in the elderly population (Freedman et

al., 2004), including the National Health Interview Study and the Health and Retirement Study.

Still, the MCBS has a number of advantages relative to these other surveys. First, the sample

size is large, about 10,000 to 18,000 people annually. In addition, the MCBS samples people

regardless of whether they live in a household or a long-term care facility, or switch between the

two during the course of the survey period. Third, the set of health questions is very broad,

encompassing health in many domains. Fourth, and most importantly, individuals in the MCBS

have been matched to death records. As a result, we can measure death for over 200,000 people,

even after they have left the survey window. Death data are available through 2008.

         The MCBS started as a longitudinal survey in 1991. In 1992 and 1993, the only

supplemental individuals added were to replace people lost to attrition and to account for newly

enrolled beneficiaries. Beginning in 1994, the MCBS began a transition to a rotating panel

design, with a four year sample inclusion. About one-third of the sample was rotated out in

1994, and new members were included in the sample. The remainder of the original sample was

rotated out in subsequent years. We use all interviews that are available for each person from the

start of the survey in 1991 through 2009. We ignore the panel structure of the MCBS interviews



                                                 6
and treat each survey year as a repeated cross-section that has been linked to mortality

information.

       The MCBS has two samples: a set of people who were enrolled for the entire year (the

Access to Care sample) and a set of ever-enrolled beneficiaries (the Cost and Use sample). The

latter differs from the former in including people who die during the year and new additions to

the Medicare population. The primary data that we use are from the health status questionnaire

administered in the fall survey, which defines the Access to Care sample. We thus use the

Access to Care data. We compute time until death from the exact date at which the Access to

Care survey was administered to the person.

       The MCBS population becomes older and less white over time, as the elderly population

changes demographically. We do not want to show trends that are influenced by these

demographic changes. We thus adjust survey weights so that the MCBS population in each year

matches the population in the year 2000 by age, gender, and race. All of our tabulations are

weighted by these adjusted weights.

       Recall that our death dates are available through 2008. For each individual interviewed

in 1991-2007, therefore, we can determine if they died in the next 12 months or survived that

period. Similarly, we can categorize individuals through 2006 as dying between 12-24 months

or not, and individuals through 2005 as dying between 24 and 36 months or not. Death at 36

months or beyond is also known for the population through 2005.

       Trends in the distribution of time until death are shown in Figure 1. The share of the

population that is within one year of death is about 5 percent on average. Reflecting the overall

reduction in mortality, this share is declining over time (this will be true of the population 1-2

years from death and 2-3 years from death as well). Between 1991 and 2007, the decline is 1



                                                  7
percentage point, or 18 percent. Correspondingly, the share of the population that is 3 or more

years from death increased by about 3 percentage points, also shown in figure 1.

           The MCBS asks extensive health questions. The first set of health questions are about

medical events the person has experienced. These include cardiovascular conditions (heart

disease, stroke), diseases of the central nervous system (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s

disease), musculoskeletal problems (arthritis, broken hip), pulmonary disease, and cancer. For

purposes of disability assessment, we divide these diseases into four groups, based on their likely

association with death and disability (Lunney et al., 2003). The first disease is cancer. Once

past the acute phase of cancer treatment, people with cancer tend to have reasonably high quality

of life until the last few months of life, when health deteriorates markedly. The second group is

permanently disabling conditions that get progressively worse. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s

disease, and pulmonary disease fall into this category.2 The third group is acute conditions for

which recovery is possible but not assured. This includes heart disease, strokes, and hip

fractures. Finally, we group diabetes and arthritis as common disabling but generally non-fatal

conditions.

           Table 2 shows the prevalence of these conditions across all years of the survey, the

annual percentage point change in the prevalence over time, and the disability rate conditional on

having the disease (defined as whether the person reports an ADL or IADL limitation; see

below). Non-fatal conditions are the most common. Over half of the elderly population reports

a prior diagnosis of arthritis, the prevalence of which is increasing by 0.3 percentage points

annually. Nearly one in five elderly people has diabetes. Acute conditions for which recovery is

possible are next most common, ranging in prevalence from 4 percent of the population (hip

fracture) to 26 percent (ischemic heart disease). Perhaps owing to better prevention, the
2
    Congestive heart failure is natural to add to this list but is only asked about from 2003 on.

                                                              8
prevalence of both heart disease and heart attacks is declining over time. About 18 percent of the

elderly population has a history of cancer, which is increasing over time. Degenerative diseases

are relatively less common, though pulmonary disease affects about one-seventh of the elderly

population. People with these conditions are extremely likely to report having an ADL or IADL

impairment.

       The MCBS also asks a number of questions about the impact of morbidity on a

respondent’s ability to function and perform basic tasks, shown in Table 3. The first category of

questions is about physical functioning, such as difficulty walking a reasonable distance (1/4

mile or 2-3 blocks) or carrying moderate-weight objects. Difficulty in these areas ranges from

one-quarter to three-quarters of the elderly population.

       The second and third categories are impairments in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs,

such as bathing or dressing) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs, such as doing

light housework or managing money). Six questions are asked about each of ADL and IADL

limitations. Because limitations in these areas reflects more severe impairment, the share of the

elderly population reporting difficulty in these areas is lower than the share reporting difficulty

with functional limitations.

       The final category is sensory impairments, including trouble seeing and hearing. In the

case of vision, the difficulty refers to even with correction such as glasses or contact lenses, and

for hearing it is with hearing aid. The possible responses to the vision and hearing questions

changed in 2002. Prior to 2002, the responses for each question were: no trouble, a little trouble,

and a lot of trouble. Starting in 2002, a more severe category was added to each: no usable

vision and Deaf. After this change, more people reported less severe vision and hearing

impairments – most likely, they judged themselves less severely disabled relative to the more



                                                  9
severe categories now being offered as a response. The share of people reporting difficulty with

vision and hearing each fell by 4 percentage points in 2002, far larger than in any other year.

         To adjust for this, we create a counterfactual time series for difficulty with vision and

hearing assuming that the trend in each variable in the year the survey changed was the same as

the trend in the prior three years. We then extend this aggregate estimate back to 1991. At the

individual level, we randomly choose individuals who reported that they had a little trouble

seeing or hearing and recategorize their responses to having no trouble, to match the adjusted

aggregate totals. With these adjustments, about one-third of the elderly population reports vision

and hearing impairments on average.

         The health status questions are generally the same for the community population and the

institutional population, with the exception that the institutionalized are not asked about three

IADLs limitations – light housework, preparing meals, and heavy lifting. On average, 5 percent

of people are in a nursing home. In order to utilize these questions, we assume that everyone in a

nursing home has difficulty with these activities.3



         Summary Health Status Measures

         The most common single measure of disability in the literature is any difficulty with

ADL or IADLs. We follow this in our analysis and define “disability” as an ADL or IADL

impairment.

         While simple to implement, this measure lacks a rigorous theoretical foundation.

Moreover, a binary measure does not capture heterogeneity in the population. For many

purposes, we care about finer gradations in the distribution of health. There is a literature (e.g.

3
 With regard to the other IADLs, 61 percent of people living in institutions report difficulty using the telephone and
85 percent report difficulty shopping for personal items and managing money. Over 90 percent report difficulty
with basic activities such as stooping, crouching or kneeling, or carrying a 10 lb. object (Cutler and Landrum, 2011).

                                                         10
Verbrugge and Jette, 1994) arguing for a distinction between functional status (measures of

specific physical functioning) and disability (the ability to engage in the activities typically

expected of a person). Within this latter spirit, we examine the different dimensions of health

among the elderly. In particular, we estimate a factor analytic model of the different domains of

functioning and choose the number of domains that best summarize the data.

       Formally, denote yij as the response to question j for individual i. Suppose there are J

questions total (J=19 in our setting). We imagine that these health states are a linear function of

K different unobserved factors, denoted Fik. We fit a factor analytic model of the form (e.g.,

Bartholomew, 1987; and Knol and Berger, 1991):



       yij = γ0j + γ1jFi1 + γ2jFi2 + γ3jFi3 + … + γKjFiK,                              (1)



where yij is a 0 or 1 outcome variable, γ0j is a threshold parameter that accounts for varying

prevalence of limitations in the population (for example, limitations climbing stairs are more

common that limitations in bathing) and the γkj’s are factor loadings that describe the relationship

between unobserved factor k and question j. Unobserved factors are assumed to follow a

multivariate normal distribution. The latent variable model described by (1) is similar to the

factor analyses and Grade of Membership models that have been previously used to describe

dimensions of disability (Lamb, 1996; Manton et al., 1994, 1998; Woodbury et al., 1978).

       We can fit this model provided K<J. Empirically, because the data tend to be highly

correlated and we have 19 dimensions of health, a small number of factors is associated with a

wide range of variation in the data.




                                                  11
       Table 4 shows the results of the factor analysis over the 1991-2009 time period. By the

usual criterion of eigenvalues greater than 1, there are three significant factors. Together, these

three account for 57 percent of the cumulative variation in the data. These three also have

natural economic and demographic interpretations. We thus work with those three.

       The predicted factor scores are positively correlated. Prior to rotation, the correlation

between factors 1 and 2 is .501, between 1 and 3 is .246, and between 2 and 3 is .265. To aid in

interpretation, we consider rotations of the factors that reduce the correlation between them.

Specifically, we use an oblique rotation of the three factor scores (promax=3).

       Figure 2 shows a radar plot of the (rotated) factor scores. The first factor loads heavily

on ADL and IADL limitations, including bathing, dressing, eating, managing money, and

preparing meals. This is a very severely impaired population. The second factor is largely

associated with functional limitations and related IADLs, including difficulty walking, lifting,

stooping, reading, and doing heavy housework. This group is generally somewhat less impaired.

The third factor is concentrated in sensory impairments, including both vision and hearing.



III.   Trends in Health

       Our goal is to examine health trends by time until death. We start with overall health

trends in the population as a whole and then proceed to trends for the different subgroups by time

until death.



       Disease prevalence

       Disease prevalence is a first measure of health that we consider. Figure 3 shows the

share of the elderly with the four categories of conditions over time: cancer, chronic degenerative



                                                 12
diseases, recoverable acute conditions; and generally non-fatal conditions; individual trends are

reported in table 2. There has been an increased prevalence of non-fatal disease over time, as

more people report arthritis and diabetes. Major severe diseases as a whole have been relatively

constant in prevalence. This constancy masks some differentiation by type of condition,

however. Recoverable acute conditions have declined in prevalence over time, from about 40

percent of the population in 1993 to about 30 percent in 2009. Chronic disabling conditions have

increased (Alzheimer’s and pulmonary disease), and cancer has been relatively constant.

       We consider the major diseases as a group, since they are likely to have the biggest

impact on health. Figure 4 shows the prevalence of any major disease by time until death. Since

this figure is used repeatedly in the paper, we describe it here in some detail. The second-to-the-

lowest line of the figure is the overall prevalence of major conditions, analogous to the line in

Figure 3. Since this line is not conditioned on time until death, we can form this series through

2009. The upper line in the figure is the share of people within 12 months of death who have a

major condition. That line extends through 2007, since we know 12 month mortality for that

group. The prevalence of major diseases is significantly greater in the population near death than

in the overall population. About 80 percent of seniors near death have at least one major

condition, and that share is relatively constant over time. The most common major disease in

this group is heart disease (38 percent of the population, on average). Cancer affects about 25

percent of this population, as does Alzheimer’s disease and pulmonary disease (chronic

degenerative diseases) and heart attacks and stroke (recoverable acute conditions). Parkinson’s

disease has lower prevalence (4%), as does hip fracture (9%).

       The lines just below the top line are the prevalence rate for people 12-24 months from

death and 24-36 months from death. For each line, we are restricted to data ending one year



                                                 13
earlier, reflecting the fact that the mortality information is only available through 2008. The

prevalence of major disease is slightly lower for these groups, but still high. In each case, the

prevalence is 70-80 percent. As with the population within 12 months of death, major disease

prevalence is not changing in the population 1-2 years and 2-3 years from death. The lowest line

in the figure is the prevalence of major disease in people 36 or more months from death. This

share is about 50 percent, and is flat after a rise and fall in the early to mid-1990s.

        Figure 4 shows clearly that not only is major disease prevalence overall unchanged, but

major disease prevalence is unchanged in each window of time until death. We return to lifetime

disease-free years below.

        The prevalence of minor diseases by time until death is shown in figure 5. There are five

lines in the figure, but they are virtually indistinguishable. About 60-70 percent of elderly

people have arthritis or diabetes, and that is independent of how close or far they are from death.

Similarly, the prevalence of minor diseases increases over the 2000s for all groups.



        Functional Limitations and Disability

        We now proceed to functional limitations and ADL/IADL limitations, the latter of which

is the most common metric of disability in the literature. Figure 6 shows the time series for any

functional limitation, any ADL or IADL impairment, any ADL impairment, and any IADL

impairment. The prevalence of functional limitations is high; about 60 percent of the elderly

population reports some difficulty with the functional measures. ADL or IADL impairment is

lower but still high. Nearly half of the elderly population reports one or more ADL or IADL

problems. Effectively, this means that about half of the life expectancy of the elderly is years

lived with a disability.



                                                  14
       Overall functional limitations are relatively constant over time, declining by 2.7 percent

between 1991 and 2009. The prevalence of people with ADL or IADL impairments declined

more dramatically, however. The overall reduction between 1991 and 2009 is 22 percent, with

somewhat greater declines for ADL disability than IADL disability, but impressive declines in

both. Most of the disability decline was in the 1991-97 time period. Between 1997 and 2002,

disability increased modestly, before declining again in the last half of the 2000s.

       Changes in disability may be influenced by demographic or disease factors. Although

not the primary focus of our analysis, we consider this a little in understanding the change in

disability over time. We start by relating disability in the early time periods of the sample (1991-

93) and the later time periods (2004-06) to demographic and medical factors:



       Disabilityit = Demogit βDt + Clinicalit βCt + εit.                     (2)



where i denotes individuals and t denotes the time period (1991-93 or 2004-06). Demographics

include five year age-sex dummy variables, a dummy variable for non-whites, a dummy variable

for being married, and a dummy variable for having a high school degree or more. The clinical

covariates include dummy variables for the conditions in table 2. Both the demographic and

clinical covariates are strongly associated with disability (Table 5). Older age is associated with

higher disability, as being non-white, being single, and having less education. All of the clinical

covariates are associated with higher disability rates, as we would expect.

       We then perform an Oaxaca decomposition to understand how much of the reduction in

disability can be explained by changes in the X’s (for example, the population becoming better




                                                 15
educated or less likely to have heart disease) versus changes in the impact of each demographic

and clinical factor on disability. We do this in as in equation (3):



        ΔDisability ≈ {ΔDemog βDto + ΔClinical βCto} + {Demogto ΔβD + Clinicalto ΔβC} (3)



where to denotes the initial time period and Δ indicates the changes over time. The first term on

the right hand side of equation (3) is the impact of changing demographics and clinical condition

prevalence, holding constant their health impact, and the second term is the impact of changes in

the relationship between clinical and demographic factors and disability, holding constant their

prevalence. There is no i subscript because we use averages of each explanatory variable in the

relevant time period.

        Table 6 shows this decomposition. The first column uses disability as the health

outcome measure. As the first row shows, the overall reduction in disability was 7.4 percentage

points. The next two rows show the impact of changes in demographics and condition

prevalence between 1991-93 and 2004-06 on disability. Demographic changes imply a modestly

healthier population over time,4 while the clinical conditions have become somewhat more

prevalent. Overall, the contribution of changes in the explanatory factors is modest.

        The next rows show that the bulk of the impact comes from changes in the severity of

demographic and clinical risk factors. Conditions have become less disabling over time (see

Table 5) –especially heart disease and arthritis – and this lowers disability by 2.9 percentage

points. Older age is a less disabling than formerly, even given the clinical conditions we

measure. This accounts for another 2.1 percentage points. Finally, the constant term, reflecting


4
 Recall that age, gender, and race changes have already been factored out, by reweighting the data to the population
distribution in 2000. Thus, the demographic change is only marital status and education.

                                                        16
other factors not captured, shows a large decline in disability. The finding that conditions are

less severely disabling than they were formerly motivates our focus on their relation to time until

death, not on the incidence of conditions themselves.

        Figure 7 shows the share of the population with an ADL or IADL limitation by time until

death. Since disability defined in this way is the most common health metric in the literature,

and it has fallen so much, this figure is in many ways the most crucial to understand population

changes in health. Also for this reason, we decompose the change in disability by more periods

of time: <12 months until death, 12-24 months until death, 25-48 months until death, 49-72

months until death, 73-96 months until death, and 97+ months until death.

        Figure 7 shows clearly that the vast bulk of the reduction in disability is among people a

few years away from death. Disability is high and has remained so for people within one year of

death; about 80 percent of this population is disabled, and that has not changed over time.

Indeed, more detailed analysis shows just how sick this population is. The average person in the

last 12 months of life has 2.7 ADL limitations and 3.1 IADL limitations. Disability has declined

marginally for those 12-24 months from death (2.8 percentage points over the period). Rather,

the larger decline is for the population 25 or more months from death. Starting in the group 3 to

4 years from death, disability declines by 6 to 7 percentage points in each group.5 Figure 8

shows this pattern graphically. The reduction in disability is greater the farther out from death

one goes.

        We can show the implications of these trends using a more formal analysis. Note that the

average disability in the population can be expressed as the average of disability for people with

different times until death, weighted by the share of people in that time-until-death category:


5
  Each group is observed over a different time-frame. However, since most of the disability decline occurred prior
to the mid-90s the differing observation windows has minimal effect.

                                                        17
Disabilityt = Σk Sharekt * Disabilitykt, where k references the buckets of time until death. Then,

the change in the disability rate is approximately equal to the change in the mortality rates,

weighted by initial disability rates, and the change in disability rates, weighted by the population

share with that time to live:



       ΔDisability ≈ Σk ΔSharek Disabilitykto + Σk Sharekto ΔDisabilityk                     (4)



       Table 7 shows the results of this decomposition. As the first row of the second column

shows, disability declined by 6.3 percentage points. The next row shows the impact of mortality

changes on the prevalence of disability. Because people are living longer, disability would have

declined by 0.7 percentage points, even if all groups were just as disabled as in the early time

period. The far bigger impact is of changes in disability for a given time until death. Disability

declines particularly greatly for those 2 or more years from death. The decline is roughly similar

in groups that far from death or longer. The largest share of disability decline occurred in the

population 8 or more years from death (almost 50%), though this group is about 60 percent of the

population.

       Given the importance of health trends by population subgroup, Figure 9 shows the

relationship between disability and time until death for different demographic groups, divided by

gender (a and b), race (c and d) and education (e and f). The pattern in all cases is very similar.

Disability declined only slightly near death, and much more the farther away from death one

gets. Indeed, even the magnitudes are similar. The decline in disability for those 8 or more

years from death is 20-25 percent in all cases. Thus, the results we find are quite robust across

demographic groups.



                                                 18
         Although functional status did not decline greatly in our data, we show the trend in

functional limitations by time until death in figure 10. Almost everyone is functionally limited

before death; in the last year of life, 95 percent of people have a functional limitation. This did

not change greatly over time, however. Nor did it change meaningfully in any other population

group.



         Summary Measures of Health

         We finally turn to our three summary measures of health, the factor scores from the factor

analysis. We denote them F1, F2, and F3, corresponding to the three largest eigenvalues in

Table 3. We also identify them by the health measures that load on them most strongly: ADL

and IADL limitations for F1, functional limitations for F2, and sensory impairments for F3. As

is customary, we normalize each factor score to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

A higher score indicates more ‘yes’ answers to the impairments, and thus a greater level of

sickness.

         Figure 11 shows the trend in the three factor scores. All three decline over time. The

greatest decline is for F3, the factor reflecting sensory impairments. The overall decline is

approximately one-sixth of a standard deviation. F1, corresponding to ADL and IADL

limitations declines the second largest, and F2, corresponding to functional limitations and

related ADL and IADL limitations, declines the least.

         Figures 12a, b, and c show the changes for each factor score by time until death. Not

surprisingly, there is enormous spread in the data. For those within 12 months of death, the

average F1 score is about 1.5, the average F2 score is about 0.8, and the average F3 score is




                                                 19
about 0.5. These decline somewhat as death moves away in time, but they remain high even for

people 24-36 months from death. For that group, F1 and F2 are about 0.5.

       Mirroring our results in the binary disability measure, the improvement in these health

measures is particularly marked for those farther from death. Except for F3, these summary

measures do not improve greatly for those in the 3 years prior to death. Rather, the vast bulk of

the decline is in those with three of more years to live until dying. Sensory impairments,

however, are declining in all groups, even those very close to death.



       Summary

       There are many measures of health, not all of which move in the same direction. As a

result, there is no single conclusion we can draw. But there are some common trends which are

important. Our major conclusion is that time spent in poor physical functioning is being

increasingly compressed into the period just before death. Limitations in very severe

impairments such as ADLs or IADLs are falling for those not near the end of life, as are more

severe functional limitations. Less severe functional limitations are constant, and overall disease

prevalence is rising. People have more diseases than they used to, but the severe disablement

that disease used to imply has been reduced.

       The compression of morbidity into the period just before death means that disability-free

life expectancy will be increasing. We explore changes in disability-free and disabled life

expectancy quantitatively in the next section.




                                                 20
IV.    Disability-Adjusted Life Expectancy

       Understanding the compression of morbidity is best done in the context of disability-

adjusted survival. In this section, we turn our estimates of health changes into changes in

disabled and disability-free lifeyears. The starting point for our analysis is the standard measure

of life expectancy:



       LE(a) = Σs {Pr[Survive a+s | Alive a] + .5*Pr[Die at a+s | Alive a]}                   (5)



Starting at age a, every (probabilistic) year that the average person survives adds one year to life

expectancy. A person who dies in a year is assumed to live half the year, and thus adds half that

amount to life expectancy.

       Mortality is calculated by the National Center for Health Statistics and routinely

published in the National Vital Statistics Reports. We use their data for mortality.

       To account for disability, we modify equation (5). For those in the last year of life, we

weight the half-year they expect to live by the share of the people in that half year who are not

disabled. As Figure 8 shows, this is on average 20 percent. Similarly, we weight the years lived

by those one year away from death, two years away from death, three years away from death,

and more than three years away from death by the share of population in those intervals who are

not disabled. Adding this up over all future ages yields disability-free life expectancy. Disabled

life expectancy is the difference between total life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy.

       We can form disability-free life expectancy and disabled life expectancy for any year in

which we have mortality and disability data. To match our results above, we estimate these

values in two time periods: 1992 and 2005. The mortality data are from those exact years. The



                                                 21
disability data are from 1991-93 and 2003-05. We present all of our calculations for a person

aged 65 in those years.

       Relative to our earlier calculations, we make one additional refinement. Where earlier

we showed disability rates on an age-adjusted basis, here we need to disaggregate disability by

age. For example, about 45 percent of people who are 36 or more months from death in 1991-93

have an ADL or IADL impairment. But that share is about 30 percent for the youngest elderly

and 80 percent for the oldest elderly. To account for this, we form an estimate of disability rates

that is age-specific. Rather than calculating means across single-year age by time-until-death

cells, which would involve many small cells, we instead use regression analysis to smooth

disability rates by age, and other demographic characteristics.

       Specifically, we estimate a logistic regression model relating disability to age and its

square, a dummy for females, and a dummy for non-white. We estimate this regression

separately for 1991-93 and 2003-05 and for each category of time until death: <12 months, 12-

24 months, 24-36 months, and 36 months or more. We then predict the disability rates for each

person and average the predictions across the relevant groups (e.g., single year of age). We

match these to life tables in 1992 and 2005.



        Results

       We start with basic life expectancy calculations. Figure 13 shows the trend in life

expectancy at age 65, separately for men and women. Life expectancy is rising for both groups,

but the increase is much greater for men than women. Between 1992 and 2005, life expectancy

for a 65 year-old male increased by 1.5 years, while life expectancy for a 65 year-old woman

increased by 0.4 years. Our life expectancy data differs from these calculations slightly, since



                                                22
the NCHS does not publish mortality tables beyond age 100. We thus assume everyone dies at

that age. Effectively, this reduces our life expectancy increase by 0.2 years.

        Figure 14 shows the trend in total life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and

disabled life expectancy for the overall population at age 65. Table 8 shows specific numerical

results. Life expectancy at age 65 was 17.5 years in 1992. Reflecting the fact that about half the

elderly population is disabled, about half of those years were disabled.

        Life expectancy increased by 0.7 years between 1992 and 2005. Because the fall in

disability was so large, however, the increase in disability-free life expectancy was greater than

the total increase in life expectancy – 1.6 years in total. The residual was a reduction in disabled

life expectancy of 0.9 years. Thus, both the metric of the change in disabled life expectancy as

well as the share of life that is spent disability-free, morbidity is being compressed into the time

period just before death.

        Figure 15 shows life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and disabled life

expectancy by gender and race. In all four cases, the results are similar: overall life expectancy

increased, and disability-free life expectancy increased by even more. As a result, disabled life

expectancy fell in all cases. The decline in disabled life expectancy was greater for women than

for men, but was similar by race.

        In principle, we can estimate changes in life expectancy and disability-free life

expectancy by education as well. In practice, while data on mortality by education are collected

(since 1989), they are not routinely published.6 In future work, we will construct relevant life

tables from the micro data and calculate life expectancy by education.




6
 Some authors have calculated life expectancy by education for particular years (e.g., Meara, Richards-Shubik, and
Cutler, 2008), but they do not match the years we analyze for the other demographic groups.

                                                        23
       Since so much of the literature has focused on disease-free survival, we have estimated

disease-free survival trends as well. We focus on the major diseases in Table 2, since they are

the most consequential for health. Figure 16 shows the results. Disease-free survival increased

over time, but so did life expectancy with disease. Of the total increase in life expectancy of 0.7

years, 0.6 years was associated with disease-free survival and 0.1 years was associated with

additional life with major disease. The conclusion about the compression of morbidity thus

depends on the definition used: the share of life that is disease-free rose, but the length of life

with major disease increased as well.



V.     Conclusion

       Our results show clearly that over the 1991-2009 period, disability has been compressed

into the period just before death. Disability-free life expectancy rose, and disabled life

expectancy declined. Thus, by either measure of compression of morbidity, morbidity is being

compressed into the period just before death. Disease-free survival increased as well, although so

did survival with a major disease.

       The major question raised by our results is why this has occurred. How much of this

trend is a result of medical care versus other social and environmental factors? Our results do

not speak to this issue, but they give us a metric for analyzing the impact of changes that have

occurred. We and others could usefully pursue the question about causality in subsequent

research.

Note: The table is a decomposition of changes in the measure of health indicated in the
columns. For each health measure, we estimate equations of the form: Hit = Xitβt + εit, for two
time periods: 1991-93 and 2004-06. The first row, total change, shows the percentage point
change in Hit over time. The remaining rows show the predicted percentage point change in
Hit resulting from changes in the X variables, decomposed into demographics and condition
prevalence, and changes in the β’s, decomposed into those for conditions, those for
demographics, and the constant term.

Note: The first column shows the percent change in disability rate
for people in each category of time until death. The change is
taken from 1991-93 to the latest 3 years available. The second
column decomposes the total change in disability. The first row,
total change, shows the percentage point change in disability over
time from 1991-93 to 1998-00. The second row shows the change
in disability resulting from changes in the share of people with
different periods of time until death. The remaining shows show
the change in disability resulting from changes in the disability rate
in each time-until-death category.
