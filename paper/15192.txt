A Theory of Firm Decline

                                               ABSTRACT

We study the problem of an investor who buys an equity stake in an entrepreneurial venture, under
the assumption that the former cannot monitor the latter’s operations. The dynamics implied by the
optimal incentive scheme is rich and quite different from that induced by other models of repeated
moral hazard. In particular, our framework generates a rationale for firm decline. As young firms accumulate
capital, the claims of both investor (outside equity) and entrepreneur (inside equity) increase. At some
juncture, however, even as the latter keeps on growing, invested capital and firm value start declining
and so does the value of outside equity. The reason is that incentive provision is costlier the wealthier
the entrepreneur (the greater is inside equity). In turn, this leads to a decline in the constrained–efficient
level of effort and therefore to a drop in the return to investment.

1        Introduction

Think of an investor who provides seed financing to an entrepreneurial firm. The
success of her investment will depend crucially on the effort that the entrepreneur
puts in. Yet, the incentives of the two individuals are not perfectly aligned, as the
entrepreneur bears the whole cost of such effort while sharing the pecuniary returns
with the investor. Since monitoring the entrepreneur’s conduct is prohibitively ex-
pensive, the investor will find it optimal to implement an incentive scheme that links
rewards to observables. We are interested in characterizing the implications of such
scheme for the dynamics of firm size and value, as well as the latter’s split between
the two agents.
        The problem just described can be conveniently cast as a model of repeated bilat-
eral exchange with hidden action, along the lines of Spear and Srivastava (1987) and
Wang (1997). The only caveat is that in their models there is no notion of important
features of firm dynamics such as production and capital accumulation. The purpose
of this paper is to explicitly model both of them. We do so by assuming that the
entrepreneur is equipped with a production function that exhibits decreasing returns
and is hit by multiplicative shocks whose probability distribution depends in a natural
way on managerial effort.
        The incentive scheme chosen by the investor belongs to the set of constrained–
efficient allocations, which in turn consist of sequences of effort provision, payouts,
and investment, that maximize the value of the investor’s claim (outside equity) for
given rewards to the entrepreneur.
        The main insight generated by our analysis is a rationale for firm decline, which
follows from the negative relation between the marginal value of investment and the
value of the entrepreneur’s claim (inside equity). Since the entrepreneur’s utility is
additively separable in consumption and effort and displays constant relative risk
aversion to consumption bets, incentive provision is costlier, the greater the value
of the entrepreneur’s claim to the venture’s cash flows.1 Everything else equal, this
means that the higher the entrepreneur’s wealth, the lower the constrained–efficient
level of effort provision. By reducing the likelihood of a high productivity shock, this
results in a lower marginal value of investment.
        A lending contract assigns to the entrepreneur a level of capital and a claim to
    1
    This is a well–known property, exploited by Spear and Wang (2005) and Wang (2006) to model
the optimal termination of employment contracts and by Newman (2007) to study the relationship
between wealth and occupational choice.



                                              1
future cash flows. For consistency with the empirical evidence on the relative size of
entrant firms, assume that the initial capital is small (in a sense to be made precise
later). Then, the typical firm dynamics predicted by our model is as follows. Given
decreasing returns, early on the marginal product of capital is high. Since further
infusions of capital from the investor are ruled out by assumption, firm size gradually
increases over time, thanks to the investment of retained earnings. Optimal incentive
provision dictates that on average inside equity increases as well. These forces have
countervailing effects on the marginal value of managerial effort, positive for capital
and negative for entrepreneurial wealth. Eventually, the latter dominates. Capital
and effort start declining, and so does firm value.
   When the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is greater than one and agents
discount future utility at the same rate, in the limit all cash flows accrue to the
entrepreneur. Firm size, effort, and inside equity converge to a constant. When the
entrepreneur is either relatively more impatient or her EIS coefficient is smaller than
1, the model allows for a non–degenerate stationary distribution of firm size, firm
value, and its split between the two agents.
   We find that the qualitative features of firm dynamics we have just described
survive the generalization to the scenario in which productivity shocks are persistent.
   This paper contributes to a small but growing literature that explores the im-
plications of moral hazard for firm dynamics. Albuquerque and Hopenhayn (2004)
and Cooley, Marimon, and Quadrini (2004) consider scenarios where the entrepreneur
has limited commitment, while Clementi and Hopenhayn (2006), Brusco and Ropero
(2007), Quadrini (2003) and DeMarzo, Fishman, He, and Wang (2008) study the case
of hidden information. All of these models, as well as other theories of firm dynamics
such as Jovanovic (1982) and Hopenhayn (1992), are able to rationalize the negative
correlation between age and the exit hazard rate that was documented for relatively
young firms. None of them, however, is consistent with the evidence, provided by
Aggarwal and Gort (1996, 2002), that for older firms the exit hazard rate increases
with age, irrespective of the industry life–cycle phase.
   This caveat does not apply to our theory. For every cohort of firms whose dynamics
are described by our contract, there is a point in time after which average firm size
and value decline with age. Assuming a a constant outside value for firms’ assets, this
would result in a positive association between age and exit hazard rate.

   Our paper also belongs to a large literature, started by Holmstrom (1979), that an-
alyzes constrained–efficient allocations in principal–agent models with hidden action.

                                           2
Our work is part of the more recent tradition which began with Rogerson (1985b),
that explicitly considers repeated relationships. A number of papers in this line of
work, among which Wang (1997) and Clementi, Cooley, and Wang (2006), have inter-
preted the principal–agent relationship as one between shareholders and executives.
This alternative interpretation is also valid for our model.
    Finally, our framework also has close ties to equilibrium models that allow for
capital accumulation in environments where market incompleteness is caused by
moral hazard. Among these, the closest work is by Bohacek (2005), who provides
conditions under which an economy à la Atkeson and Lucas (1995) admits a sta-
tionary and ergodic distribution of consumption. Other papers in this class include
Marcet and Marimon (1992), Khan and Ravikumar (2001), and Espino (2005).
    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model is introduced in
Section 2. In Section 3 we characterize the constrained–efficient allocations that arise
in two special cases of our environment, namely one with no dynamics and one with
dynamics but no capital accumulation. That analysis helps building intuition for the
results illustrated in Section 4, where the general model is considered. In Section 5 we
discuss the empirical relevance of our theory. Section 6 is dedicated to comparative
statics exercises. Section 7 considers the scenario in which shocks are autocorrelated.
Finally, Section 8 concludes.


2    Model
Time is discrete and is indexed by t = 1, 2, ... There are two agents, who we will refer
to as investor and entrepreneur, respectively. The latter is endowed with a production
technology, that produces a homogeneous good with capital as the only input. Output
(yt ) is given by
                                     yt = θt f (kt ),

where kt ∈ [k, k] ∈ #+ and θt ∈ Θ ⊆ #+ is a random variable distributed according to
the time–invariant distribution function G(θt |at ). The variable at ∈ A ≡ [a, a] ∈ #+
denotes managerial effort. We assume that G has a density denoted by g, which is
twice continuously differentiable with respect to a, and that Θ is compact.
    While the output of the production process is public knowledge, the effort exerted
by the entrepreneur is her private information.
    At the outset, the investor provides the entrepreneur with capital k1 . We do not
model the bargaining process by which the two agents agree on such level of capital


                                            3
and on a particular split of the surplus. We also assume that any further investment
must be financed with resources produced internally. It follows that, at all t,

                                        ct + xt ≤ θt f (kt ),                                    (1)

where ct ≥ 0 is the entrepreneur’s consumption and xt denotes investment. Since
condition (1) requires the payoffs to the investor to be non–negative, we will refer to
it as the limited liability constraint. The law of motion for capital is the usual one:

                                     kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + xt ,

where δ ∈ (0, 1) denotes the depreciation rate. The last two conditions imply the
following resource constraint:

                                ct ≤ θt f (kt ) + (1 − δ)kt − kt+1 .

       We assume that the investor is risk–neutral, while the entrepreneur is risk–averse.
The latter’s static preferences are represented by the utility function u(ct ) − a. We
                                                                      c1−χ
posit that u(·) belongs to the CRRA class, i.e. u(c) =                1−χ ,   χ > 0, χ )= 1. Agents
                                                                1
discount future utility streams at the common rate              β   − 1, where β ∈ (0, 1).2
       We allow for employ history–dependent pure strategies.                  If we let h0 denote
the empty history, then the history at time t ≥ 1 is given by the sequence ht =
h0 ∪ {(θs , ks )}ts=1 . The investor’s task is to offer the entrepreneur an incentive scheme
(contract) σ = {at (ht−1 , kt ), ct (ht ), kt+1 (ht−1 , kt )}∞
                                                             t=1 . This notation reflects the as-
sumption, typical in neoclassical macroeconomics, that investment is chosen at the
beginning of every period, before the realization of the shock.3 The timing is sum-
marized in Figure 1.
       Given ht and kt+1 , the continuation profile of a contract σ from date t + 1 on
is denoted as σ|ht , kt+1 . Conditional on the entrepreneur following the actions rec-
ommended by such profile, her continuation value and the investor’s are denoted by
ω(σ|ht , kt+1 ) and v(σ|ht , kt+1 ), respectively.
       A contract σ is said to be feasible if, at all times and after any history, effort
recommendations belong to the set A and the resource constraint is satisfied. More
formally,
   2
     In Section 6 we will relax this restriction by considering the case in which the entrepreneur is
relatively more impatient.
   3
     In Section 3 we comment briefly on how the constrained–efficient allocation would change, if we
assumed that investment was chosen after the realization of the shock.

      The temporary incentive compatibility constraint rules out one–shot deviations at
all dates and after all histories and can be formally stated as follows:

Given our assumptions, the unimprovability principle guarantees that condition (4)
also rules out any arbitrary sequence of deviations from the investor’s effort recom-
mendation plan.4
      The fact that the set A is a connected subset of #+ suggests that rewriting (4) as a
first–order condition may be handy. In the literature, this is known as the first–order
approach, which is not universally valid. To ensure its validity, we follow Rogerson
(1985a) and Spear and Srivastava (1987) in assuming that the Monotone Likelihood
Ratio Property and the Convexity of the Conditional Distribution Condition hold.

Proposition 1 Φ(k, w) is compact ∀(k,ω ) ∈ Ω.5

patible contract σ that attains the maximum element in Φ(k,ω ). Denote such element
as v ∗ (k,ω ).

the space of bounded and continuous functions v : Ω → # into itself, with the sup

Proposition 2 v ∗ (k,ω ) = T (v ∗ )(k,ω ) for all (k,ω ) ∈ Ω.

       Since T satisfies Blackwell’s sufficient conditions for a contraction, the contraction
mapping theorem ensures that the fixed point is unique. Solving for it also yields
policy functions for recommended effort a(k,ω ), entrepreneur’s cash flows c(k, ω,θ ),
and continuation utility ω $ (k, ω,θ ), which can be used to recover the constrained–
efficient contract in a straightforward manner.

constrained Pareto–optimal contract is not possible, this result will be useful in the
numerical approximation of the allocation that results from it.
         In the next section, we make assumptions about functional forms and parameters
that we will maintain for the remainder of the paper. The algorithms that were
designed to approximate the set Ω and the function v(k,ω ) are described in Appendix
B.

2.1         Numerical Implementation

We assume that the production function is f (k) = kα , α ∈ (0, 1). Furthermore, we
posit that A = [0, ā] and Θ= {θl , θh }, with θh > θl and G(θl |a) = e−a .6 While this
choice of conditional distribution is mostly dictated by tractability, it has appealing
features. The probability of a good outcome is zero if no effort is exerted, and goes
to 1 as effort grows unboundedly large. Furthermore, the marginal effect of effort on
the probability of success is decreasing in the effort itself. From now on, all variables
that are contingent on the shock realization will be denoted with the subscripts l or
h.
         Under the assumptions listed above, the Bellman equation is
                                                      ∗                                  ∗
v(k,ω ) =               max                  (1 − e−a )[θh kα − ch + βv(k$ , ωh )] + e−a [θl kα − cl + βv(k$ , ωl )]

         The upper bound ā will be chosen so as to ensure it never binds.

        For all (k,ω ) ∈ Ω, v(k,ω ) yields the expected discounted value of the cash flows
that will accrue to the investor when the current capital stock is k and promised utility
is ω. For this reason, it can be thought of as outside equity. We denote as C(k,ω )
the expected discounted cost to the investor of delivering ω to the entrepreneur, when
the current capital stock is k. The function C(k,ω ) solves the following functional
equation:
                                         ∗                                 ∗
                C(k,ω ) = (1 − e−a )[c∗h + βC(k$∗ , ωh∗ )] + e−a [c∗l + βC(k$∗ , ωl∗ )],

where the asterisks designate the optimal choices generated by problem (P1). Since
C(k,ω ) is also the expected discounted value of the cash flows that will accrue to the
entrepreneur, we will often refer to it as the value of inside equity.
        Unless stated otherwise, the parameter values used to compute the examples in the
remainder of the paper are those reported in Table 1. Even though we set β, χ, α, and
δ to values that are standard in the macroeconomics literature, we wish to emphasize
that by no means should this be considered a calibration exercise.
        The analysis that follows will show that the choice of χ is particularly relevant. In
our benchmark, we set χ = 0.5 because of the rapidly amassing experimental evidence
in favor this value.7 Section 4.2 discusses how the constrained–efficient allocation
changes when χ > 1.

The purpose of this section is to illustrate the properties of the optimal incentive
schemes that obtain in two scenarios that are special cases of the environment de-

scribed above. The intuition gained here will be helpful in Section 4, where we will
tackle the general case.
      We start by considering the scenario where the relationship between investor and
entrepreneur lasts only one period. In Section 3.2 we will study the case of infinitely
repeated interaction without capital accumulation.

3.1      The Static Case

The inverse of the utility function yields the cost to the investor of delivering a certain
level of utility. Denote it as c(u). Obviously, c(u) is strictly increasing and strictly
convex. For χ )= 1, we have that c(u) = [(1 − χ)u]1/(1−χ) . For χ = 1, c(u) = eu .8
      We find it convenient to reformulate the problem to let the investor choose utilities
rather than consumption allocations. With some abuse of notation, let ui ≡ u(ci ) de-
fine the utility the entrepreneur derives from consuming ci , for i = h, l. For notational
simplicity, let also ūi = u(θi kα − δk). Finally, denote as ω̄(k) and ω(k) the supremum
and infimum elements of the set of utilities that can be awarded to the entrepreneur
by a feasible and incentive compatible contract, when the installed capital is k. The
two points are characterized by Lemma 3.
      When capital in place is k, the value to the investor of delivering to the en-
trepreneur a utility ω, ω(k) ≤ ω ≤ ω̄(k), is
                                  ∗                           ∗
                  max (1 − e−a ) [θh kα − c(uh )] + e−a [θl kα − c(ul )] − δk,
                  uh ,ul
                                              ∗           ∗
                               s.t. (1 − e−a )uh + e−a ul − a∗ = ω,                          (13)
                                      a∗ = arg max (1 − e−a )uh + e−a ul − a,
                                                  a∈A
                                      u ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kα − δk), ∀ i = h, l,

where u = 0 if χ < 1 and u = −∞ otherwise. The constrained–efficient allocations
are characterized formally in Proposition 5. Here we describe their main features with
the help of Figure 2.
      From the incentive compatibility constraint it follows immediately that the recom-
mended effort is a∗ = log(uh −ul ). A higher effort is implementable only by increasing
s ≡ uh − ul , the gap between contingent rewards.
      Combining (13) with the expression for the effort recommendation, the optimiza-

Necessary and sufficient condition for an interior solution is

                        s2                   s2                       s2
Notice that the term 1/s2 is the marginal increase in the probability of success induced
by an increase in s ≡ uh − ul . The left–hand side of (14) is the expected marginal
revenue gain resulting from the increase in s. The right–hand side is the marginal
increase in the cost of compensating the entrepreneur. The first term reflects the
increased probability of awarding uh rather than ul . The second term reflects the
marginal impact on the expected cost arising from an increase in the risk imposed on
the entrepreneur. By strict concavity of the utility function, this term is positive as
well.
           As long as the solution is interior (i.e. u < ul < ū), Figure 2 shows that the
recommended level of effort decreases with ω. As promised utility increases, incentive
provision becomes costlier. In turn, this implies that it is constrained–efficient to
require the entrepreneur to exert a lower effort. Proposition 5 establishes that χ ≥ 1/2
is a sufficient condition (although not necessary) for this property to hold.

                                                                    10
   Figure 2 also shows that ul is constant for relatively high ω, signaling that the
limited liability constraint binds in the low state. Proposition 5 shows that when
ūh − ūl > 1, as it is the case in our example, effort grows with ω over this range.
When ūh − ūl ≤ 1, effort is identically zero in the same region.
   Finally, notice that, since utility is bounded below for χ < 1, efficient effort
provision must be increasing with ω for low expected utility. In other words, since
the constraint ul ≥ 0 binds in this region, larger values of ω can only be implemented
by increasing uh and therefore the effort recommendation.

3.2   The Dynamic Case

We now consider the case in which the time horizon is infinite, but there is no capital
accumulation. This scenario is very close to those analyzed by Spear and Srivastava
(1987) and Wang (1997). It differs from the former in that we impose limited liability,
i.e. the entrepreneur’s cash–flow must be non–negative. It differs from the latter, since
Wang assumes that the effort choice is binary and u(c) belongs to the CARA class.
   With slight abuse of notation, let v(ω) denote the value accruing to the investor
when delivering utility ω to the entrepreneur and let s ≡ uh + βωh − (ul + βωl ).
   We begin by considering the scenario for χ < 1, without the limited liability
constraint. Without an upper bound to entrepreneur’s consumption, all levels of
promised utility ω ≥ 0 could be implemented by a feasible and incentive compatible
contract. It would suffice to require zero effort and award consumption c[ω/(1 − β)]
at all future dates. Therefore, we impose an arbitrary upper bound ω̄ > 0.
   From the incentive compatibility constraint, it follows that recommended effort is
a∗ = log(s), for s ≥ 1. Then, for all ω such that 0 ≤ ω ≤ ω̄, the value of outside
equity v(ω) is the fixed point of the following operator:
                   &      '                             & '
                        1        α                       1
v(ω) = max           1−     [θh k − c(uh ) + βv(ωh )] +     [θl kα − c(ul ) + βv(ωl )] − δk,
        s≥1,ωh ,ωl      s                                s
                                                                                       (P2)
            s.t. uh = ω + 1 + log(s) − βωh ,                                           (15)
                ul = ω + 1 + log(s) − s − βωl ,                                        (16)
                ui ≥ 0 ∀ i = h, l,
                0 ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄ ∀ i = h, l.

Proposition 4 Assume there is no limited liability constraint and χ < 1. Then, the
value function v(ω) is strictly concave. Furthermore, for all ω such that the optimal


                                            11
choices ωl and ωh are interior:
(a) ωl < ω <ω h ;
(b) payments to the entrepreneur follow a sub–martingale.



   Along with (15)–(16), the following conditions are necessary and sufficient for an
interior solution to Problem (P2):

                                     c$ (ui ) = −v $ (ωi ), i = h, l                             (17)

and

   [θh − θl ]kα + β[v(ωh ) − v(ωl )] = [c(uh ) − c(ul )] + (s − 1) c$ (uh ) − c$ (ul ) .
                                                                  (                   )
                                                                                                 (18)

   Condition (17) requires that the investor distributes contingent utility awards
efficiently over time. Equation (18) is the analogue of condition (14). It indicates
that the forces that shape the optimal spread of utilities across states are essentially
the same as in the static case. The only difference is that the marginal benefit
of increasing effort also depends on the difference between the investor’s contingent
continuation values.
   When the solution is interior, the envelope condition is
                                &        '           & '
                     $                 1    $         1
                    v (ω) = − 1 −          c (uh ) −     c$ (ul ).                               (19)
                                      si              si

The latter, along with (17), implies that
                               &        '           & '
                         $            1    $         1
                       v (ω) = 1 −        v (ωh ) +     v $ (ωl ).                               (20)
                                      s              s
In turn, strict concavity of the value function implies that ωl < ω <ω h .
   Combining (19) and (17) yields a further condition, which is common to many
repeated hidden action models and was first illustrated by Rogerson (1985b). Letting
si , uih , and uil denote next period’s choices contingent on the current state of nature
being i, we have that
                                &           '                &        '
                     $                 1         $               1
                    c (ui ) =       1−          c (uih ) +                c$ (uil ), i = h, l.   (21)
                                       si                        si

By proposition 3 of Rogerson (1985b), claim (b) in Proposition 4 follows immediately
from (21).
   Effort is not monotone in ω. Here is why. It is obvious that ω = 0 is an absorbing
state. For that level of promised utility, a∗ = 0 and ul = uh = 0 at all times. For low

                                                     12
but strictly positive values of ω, the probability of ending up in such state is relatively
high. In order to lower such probability, an increase in recommended effort should be
implemented by lowering current utility at the benefit of the future. Unfortunately
such strategy is compromised by the lower bound on utility. For ul = 0, the promise–
keeping constraint reads ω = uh + βωh − 1 − log[uh + β(ωh − ωl )]. Lowering ωl towards
its lower bound increases the probability of success and allows for higher utility in the
high state. However, these gains are balanced by the fact that a bad shock will bring
promised utility closer to 0. As ω grows, the ability to provide incentives improves.
For ω large enough, the effort choice becomes unconstrained. When this is the case,
all of our numerical examples indicate that effort decreases with promised utility.

    We now turn to the effects of introducing the limited liability constraint. Lemma
1 establishes that limited liability implies an upper bound for promised utility and
that such upper bound is an absorbing state of the dynamical system.

Lemma 1 For ūh − ūl > 1, the maximal element of the set Ω is ω̄ =                      1−β [ūh   −1−
log(ūh − ūl )]. The constrained–efficient contract is such that ui (ω̄) = ūi and ωi (ω̄) = ω̄
                                             ūl
for i = h, l. For ūh − ūl ≤ 1, ω̄ =       1−β ,   with a∗ (ω̄) = 0, ul (ω̄) = ūl and ωl (ω̄) = ω̄. In
either case, v(ω̄) = 0.

Proof. The maximal element ω̄ is the fixed point of the APS operator B(ω):

                                            1 − e−a [uh + βωh ] + e−a [ul + βωl ] − a
                                           $       %
            B(ω) ≡           max
                      a∈A,{ui ,ωi }i=h,l

                                   s.t. 0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kα − δk), ∀ i = h, l,
                                           ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω ∀ i = h, l.

In turn, this means that as long as effort is strictly positive, ω̄ satisfies

                     ω̄ =     max        uh + βωh − 1 − log(s),
                            s≥1,uh ,ωh

                                  s.t. 0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kα − δk), ∀ i = h, l,
                                         ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄ ∀ i = h, l.

The solution of the optimization problem requires that current and continuation util-
ities are set equal to their upper bounds. That is, ωi (ω̄) = ω̄ and ui (ω̄) = ūi for
                                  1
i = h, l. Furthermore, ω̄ =      1−β [ūh   − 1 − log(ūh − ūl )] and v(ω̄) = 0.


    Unfortunately, standard sufficient conditions for concavity of the value function
do not hold in this scenario, as the feasible set is not convex. However, in all our

numerical examples, the value function turned out to be strictly concave. Figure 3
refers to one such example, for χ = 1/2 and ūh − ūl > 1.
           Consistent with the above discussion, effort is increasing for low ω. This is why
the value function is increasing in this range, implying that the contract is not
renegotiation–proof. Once ω is such that current utility is greater than its lower
bound, recommended effort and the spread between current utility awards decline
with ω. Finally, for relatively high levels of the state variable, the limited liability
constraint binds in the bad state of nature. Given the upper bound on continuation
utility ω, implementing higher ω necessarily requires increasing the spread between
current utilities.
           The dynamical system has two absorbing points, for ω = 0 and ω = ω̄. However,
all of our simulations indicate that the latter is the only attractor. For all strictly
positive initial conditions, the sequence {ωt } converges to ω̄ almost surely. On average,



                                                            14
the entrepreneur’s consumption increases over time, converging to its rest point from
below. Effort increases on average when the promised utility is relatively low and
decreases when it is high.
    When the contract is renegotiation–proof, consumption and leisure are comple-
mentary ways of rewarding the entrepreneur. High effort is elicited at the cost of
low insurance. In such condition, delivering utility via consumption is particularly
expensive for the investor. High average levels of compensation are more efficiently
delivered when recommended effort is low and the entrepreneur bears relatively less
risk.
    This simple mechanism also characterizes the scenario with χ > 1. Numerical
simulations show that effort increases when consumption drops, and vice–versa. The
limiting behavior, however, is different.
    For χ > 1, utility is unbounded below. In turn, this means that all values
ω ≤ ω̄ < 0 are implementable. When the RRA coefficient is greater than 1, con-
dition (21) implies that payments to the entrepreneur follow a super–martingale, and
therefore decrease on average. These considerations suggest that the contract should
be front–loaded. High payments and low effort early on, followed by a declining pat-
tern for consumption and a rise in effort. Our inability to characterize analytically the
comparative statics of effort also prevents us from formally establishing this result.
Not even a numerical verification of this conjecture is not possible, because in order
to compute the constrained–efficient allocation, it is necessary to impose an arbitrary
lower bound on promised utility ω. Under such condition, the limiting distributions
for all relevant variables are non–degenerate.
    By lowering the elasticity of substitution, a higher level of χ diminishes the en-
trepreneur’s tolerance for postponing consumption. This simple mechanism is likely at
the origin of the differences between the scenarios with χ < 1 and χ > 1, respectively.


4       The Full–fledged Model with Capital Accumulation
We now turn to the general case with capital accumulation. Once again, we focus on
the scenario where χ < 1. The case of χ > 1 will be considered in Section 4.2.
    The left panel of Figure 4 depicts Ω, the set of promised utilities that can be
delivered by a feasible and incentive–compatible contract. The lower–contour of ω,
denoted as ω, was chosen arbitrarily, making sure that the contract is renegotiation–
proof. The upper contour ω̄(k) is the fixed point of the APS operator B, defined

                         As expected, ω̄(k) is increasing in k. The solution to (P3) implies that, for every
pair (k,ω ) such that ω = ω̄(k), the optimal contract dictates ui (k,ω ) = u[θi kα + (1 −
δ)k − k$ ], ωi (k,ω ) = ω̄(k$ ) for i = h, l, and v(k,ω ) = 0.
                         The right panel shows that the value function is strictly increasing in the level of
capital and strictly decreasing in the entrepreneur’s promised utility ω. In all of our
numerical examples, v(k,ω ) is also globally strictly concave. However, since standard
sufficient conditions for concavity are not satisfied, we cannot assert this as a general
property.
                         Figure 5 depicts the policy functions for current and promised utility. In the left
panel, we have plotted ui (k,ω ), i = h, l. In the right panel, we have pictured the
contingent variation in promised utility ωi (k,ω ) − ω, i = h, l.
                         For given capital stock, the entrepreneur’s contingent compensation schedules dis-
play the same qualitative features as in the case with no accumulation. The spread
between continuation utilities appears to be decreasing in ω, while the spread between
current utilities is decreasing in ω for low values and increasing for high values. Once
again, this is due to the fact that the limited liability constraint binds in the bad state
of nature.

       The necessary condition for optimality of the effort choice is the analogue of equa-
tions (18). Refer to the left panel of Figure 6. Consistent with the intuition developed
in Section 3, recommended effort is increasing in the capital stock and decreasing in
the level of promised utility ω.

                                Figure 6: Policy Functions for Effort and Net Investment.

       The novelty with respect to the simpler models analyzed above is capital accu-
mulation. The policy function for net investment is rendered in the right panel of
Figure 6, where we plotted max[0, k$ (k,ω ) − k]. The most interesting feature is that,
for given capital, net investment is declining in ω. The optimality conditions tell us
why this is the case.
       Consider first the scenario in which the limited liability constraint is slack. When



                                                                                                                17
the value function is differentiable, the first–order condition for the capital choice is

From the envelope theorem, it follows that

                 ∂v(k,ω )           1       1

                    ∂k              s       s
Differentiating the latter with respect to ω yields
                            ∂ 2 v(k,ω )   1                 ∂s
                                        = 2 (θh − θl )αkα−1    .                        (23)
                               ∂k∂ω      s                  ∂ω
Since ∂s/∂ω< 0, (23) says that the marginal effect on future net cash–flows deriving
from an increase in capital is decreasing in ω. The higher ω, the lower the optimal
utility spread s and the probability of success. In turn, this leads to a lower marginal
value of investment.
   Now fix k and consider the effect of increasing ω on the optimal choice of k$ . As
long as the value function is concave, such effect will have the same sign as that of
                                                             ,                         -

the derivative of (22) with respect to ω. The first term, s2     ∂k #     − ∂k#          ∂ω ,
is positive. A higher value of ω today leads to a lower utility spread s, which in turn
increases the probability of a bad outcome. Since ωh > ωl , this means that the effect
on the marginal gain is positive. On the other hand, as long as ωh and ωl are strictly

our simulations, the latter effect dominates. Investment decreases with ω.
   When the limited liability constraint binds in the bad state of nature, the opti-
mality condition for capital reads as follows:
               ∂v(k$ , ωh )            ∂v(k$ , ωl )             ∂v(k$ , ωl )

                                                                        ,ωl )
                                                                              is the marginal
effect of increasing ωl . Since the limited liability constraint binds, it must be negative.
An increase in k$ distorts compensation in the bad state of nature, leading to a drop in
ul to the advantage of ωl . In other words, an increase in k$ lowers the investor’s payoff
by reducing the insurance the contract provides to the entrepreneur. Unfortunately
the comparative statics of k$ is now considerably more involved. The role of the
limited liability constraint in shaping firm dynamics will be re–examined in Section
4.1.
   Figure 7 illustrates one simulation of the system, starting from arbitrary initial
conditions. The state space is partitioned in four subsets. The policy for capital is

such that k$ (k,ω ) > k in regions A and B, and k$ (k,ω ) < k otherwise. The dynamics of
promised utility is such that in regions B and C, ωh (k,ω ) > ω >ω l (k,ω ). Irrespective
of the realization of the shock, promised utility increases in region A and decreases in
region D, respectively. In light of the above discussion, it is not surprising that the
locus separating regions B and C, along which net investment is identically zero, is
downward sloping for most values of k.
       The scatter plot illustrates the dynamics of the state variables. The paths followed
by the other relevant variables are shown in Figure 8. When k and ω are relatively
low, the marginal product of capital is high and providing incentives is relatively
inexpensive. Therefore the returns to investment are high. Capital grows in both
states of nature. During the transition towards the locus separating the partitions B
an C, all other variables also increase on average. However, increases in both ω and k
lead to a progressive reduction in the marginal gain from capital accumulation. Once
reached the locus, incentive provision becomes so expensive to discourage investment.
From that moment onwards, positive shocks lead to contemporaneous increases in
current and future payouts to the entrepreneur, and to a decrease in the continuation
value of the investor’s claim. The next period, the capital and effort choice will be
lower. The opposite will be true, conditional on negative shocks.9
   9
     Changing the timing in such a way that capital is chosen after the realization of the shock
would definitely enhance efficiency, but it would not have a sizeable impact on dynamics. The main
difference would be that capital reacts to shock realizations with one period delay, rather than two
periods, as is the case under our assumptions.

   On average, ω increases over time. This calls for lower effort, lower capital, and
lower outside equity. Eventually the system converges to a steady state where outside
equity is zero and the entrepreneur’s promised utility lies on the upper contour of
the set Ω. The constrained–efficient arrangement prescribes that in the limit the
entrepreneur controls all cash–flow rights.
   Notice further that, even at the steady state, the contract does not yield full
insurance and requires strictly positve effort. This result does not hold with generality.
When the difference between θh and θl is small enough, the entrepreneur will end up
receiving full insurance and exerting no effort.
   Staring at Figure 9 confirms what we have learned so far. We have initialized
the system by assigning to the state variables the same initial conditions used to
construct Figures 7 and 8. Then we have conducted a large number of 80–period
long simulations and plotted their simple averages. Early on all variables tend to
increase. Eventually, however, effort, capital, and the value of the investor’s claim
start declining.
   We have assumed throughout that no other agent is able to operate the technology.
Or, alternatively, that the investor is fully committed to the contract. It would be
interesting to understand under what conditions the investor would be better off
by rescinding the contract, honor his promises by means of a constant sequence of

and Wang (2006) address this issue in simpler environments, without production or
capital accumulation.

4.1    The Role of the Limited Liability Constraint

The purpose of this section is to clarify how the constrained–efficient allocation is
affected by the limited liability constraint. We’ll accomplish this task by discussing
the allocation that obtains when the constraint is not imposed and χ < 1.
    Without upper bounds to entrepreneur’s consumption, all non–negative levels of
utility could be delivered by a feasible and incentive compatible contract. For the
purpose of computations, we simply impose an exogenous upper bound.10
    A first and somewhat obvious finding is that, given ω and no matter the initial
capital k1 , it is optimal for the investor to invest (or disinvest) instantaneously until
the firm lies on the locus separating the partitions B and C in the state space (see
Figure 7).
    Our numerical experiments also show that, as it was the case in our benchmark
  10
     The simulation of which in Figure 10 was obtained by imposing ωi (k,ω ) ≤ 50 for i = h, l and
for all (k,ω ). However, the qualitative features illustrated below are the same, no matter the upper
bound.

scenario, positive shocks are followed by an increase in promised utility in the same
period and by lower capital and lower effort in the following period. However, the
limiting behavior is different. The dynamical system admits stationary distributions
for all relevant variables, illustrated in Figure 10.11
       As long as ventures start out with a relatively low level of inside equity (i.e. low
ω), firm value, outside equity, size, and effort will decrease over time. Inside equity
will increase. The fact that firm value and size are maximal at the beginning of
the life–cycle is at odds with the empirical evidence. Requiring that investment is
financed by retained earnings, the limited liability constraint avoids this unappealing
feature. The reader that feels uncomfortable with such assumption should consider
that convex capital adjustment costs of the type commonly assumed in the macroe-
conomic literature would lead to a dynamics which is qualitatively the same as in our
benchmark case. In particular, for a low enough initial capital stock, net investment
would be positive early on and would decrease (on average) later on.

     The figure was obtained initializing the system with arbitrary levels of the state variables and
letting the system run for 50,000 period. We subtracted the first 500 and reported the frequency
distributions.

4.2   The case of χ > 1

The basic theme of this Section also applies to this scenario: positive shocks are asso-
ciated to an increase in promised utility in the same period and by lower capital and
lower effort in the following period. However, differently from the case of χ < 1, the
dynamical system admits stationary limiting distributions for all relevant variables.
Figure 11 illustrates such distributions when χ = 2 and the lower bound on promised
utility is ω = −100.

   When the system is initialized with relatively low levels for capital and promised
utilities, average dynamics is qualitatively similar to that implied by our benchmark.
In particular, capital, outside equity, and firm value increase early on, and then de-
crease. On average, inside equity and payments to the entrepreneur are monotonically
increasing.
   In light of the fact that for χ > 1, condition (21) implies that consumption is a
super–martingale, the result just illustrated may sound surprising. Notice however
that (21) holds only when the solution is interior. In fact, inspection reveals that
when the limited liability constraint binds, expected consumption growth following a
bad shock is positive.

Much of the empirical literature on firm dynamics has focused on growth and sur-
vival of relatively young firms.12 Among its most robust findings are that both exit
hazard rates and survivors’ growth rates decline with age, both unconditionally and
conditional on size. Models based on learning or financing constraints have proven
successful in rationalizing both phenomena.13
         As put by Caves (1998), however, “organizational geriatrics has received little
attention.” That is, little attention has been devoted to the dynamics of relatively
older firms. Notable exceptions are the studies conducted by Aggarwal and Gort
(1996, 2002) (AG hereafter) and Loderer, Neusser, and Waelchli (2009). Consistent
with most of the literature, they find that hazard rates decrease with age early in life.
However, they also find that firms eventually reach a senility point, after which exit
hazard rates increase with age. In this Section we argue that, differently from other
theories of firm dynamics, our own is able to rationalize this evidence.
         Exit hazard rates are likely to be the result of both firm–specific and industry–
specific attributes. In order to discriminate among the two, AG document firm sur-
vival in five different phases of the industry life–cycle.14 Aggarwal and Gort (1996)
shows that the senility point exists no matter the phase in which firms are born.
Aggarwal and Gort (2002) argues that it exists no matter the phase in which firms
live. This evidence leads us to conclude that for every cohort there exists a time after
which, conditional on industry–wide factors, the value of the average survivor declines
with age.
         None of the models of firm dynamics we referred to above are consistent with this
behavior. All of them predict that survivors’ size and value converge from below to a
stationary distribution. Exit hazard rates are monotonically decreasing and converge
to a constant.
         AG posit that the observed firm dynamics depends in part on the evolution of
firms’ “initial endowments,” among which Aggarwal and Gort (1996) include “ob-
served variables, such as an initial organization with a record of successful operation
in a related industry,” and “unobserved variables such as managerial talent.” In every

financing constraints.
   14
      The five phases are supposed to track the industry in its path from infancy to maturity. AG
identify them operationally by means of Bahk and Gort (1993)’s criterion, based on the rate of net
entry.

cohort the average endowment level changes over time because of attrition of low en-
dowment firms and because of survivors’ net investment. As firms age, obsolescence
rises with respect to new investment. Eventually, net investment will turn negative
and lead firms to decline. According to AG, this is the mechanism responsible for the
fact that, for relatively old firms, hazard rates increase with age.
   AG’s argument has the flavor of the simple technological theory of industry dy-
namics presented in Hopenhayn (1992). In that paper, a firm’s endowment is a
stationary and serially correlated random variable determining productivity. The av-
erage entrant has a lower endowment than the average incumbent, and is therefore
closer to the exit threshold. This assumption is responsible for the selection effect
that drives the negative correlation between age and hazard rate. Because of the
stationarity of productivity, every cohort’s size distribution converges to an ergodic
distribution (also stationary, when re–scaled by its mass), characterized by a constant
exit rate. In turn, this means that the hazard exit rate also converges to a constant
from above. Differently from what advocated by AG, on average obsolescence of the
endowment is always smaller than new investment.
   In our model, AG’s endowment is managerial effort, which in turn is responsible
for the productivity of the capital invested. The analysis conducted in Section 4
suggests that almost surely there exists a point in time after which the endowment
is expected to decline. Think of a cohort of firms whose dynamics are generated
by our contract. Optimal incentive provision prescribes that, on average, promised
utility increases over time. In turn, this calls for lower effort and lower capital, which
imply lower value. While we do not explicitly model exit, it is clear that assuming a
constant outside value for the assets would yield a positive relation between age and
exit hazard rate.
   We conclude this section by speculating on our framework’s predictions for the
cross–sectional relationship between personal wealth and entrepreneurship. Newman
(2007) shows that a static version of our model has a patently counterfactual impli-
cation. When individuals in a population are given the choice between working for a
wage (at zero risk) and becoming entrepreneurs, relatively rich people turn out to be
workers, and poor people become entrepreneurs. As long as the value assigned to the
agent by the contract is monotone in the agent’s wealth, it is easy to see why this is
the case. Everything else equal, the poorer the entrepreneur the cheaper is incentive
provision, and the larger is the payoff to investors. Our analysis shows that in general
Newman (2007)’s conclusion is not warranted in a dynamic setting. While it is still


                                           25
true that poorer people are more likely to try entrepreneurship, it is also true that
those among them that succeed become progressively wealthier.


6     Comparative Statics

In this section, we document how the optimal contract and the implied dynamics
change when we select alternative values for either the entrepreneur’s discount factor
or the support of the conditional distribution Θ.

6.1   An Impatient Entrepreneur

Throughout Sections 3 and 4 it was assumed that the two agents discount future
utility flows at the same rate. Here we consider the case in which the entrepreneur
                                                   1
discounts future utility at the rate               ρ   − 1, with ρ <β .
    Figure 12 compares the policy functions that obtain for ρ = 0.495 with those
relative to the benchmark case. Given the entrepreneur’s preference for early con-
sumption, the optimal contract calls for a change in the time profile of her cash flows
in favor of the current period. The right panel on the bottom row shows that, every-
thing else equal, the entrepreneur receives higher payments in both states of nature.

    When the limited liability constraint binds, i.e. when ul = u[θl kα + (1 − δ)k −
k$ ], a higher payment to the entrepreneur necessarily translates into fewer resources
available for investment. This is why, as illustrated on the right panel on the top
row, net investment is lower than in the benchmark. The left panel on the bottom
row shows that recommended effort drops. This is consistent with our discussions
in Sections 3 and 4: a rise in current utility awards also raises the marginal cost of
eliciting effort.
    Our simulations show that, as in the case of χ > 1, capital, promised utility, as well
as the other relevant variables converge to non–degenerate stationary distributions.

6.2    A Narrower Gap between θh and θl .

Since the probability of good outcome is endogenous in our model, so is the distribu-
tion of cash–flows. Therefore, the closer we can get to analyzing the role of cash–flow
risk, is to consider the impact of reducing the gap between the two realizations of the
productivity shock.
    Figure 13 plots the policy functions that obtain by simultaneously lowering θh
from 1.5 to 1.45 and raising θl from 0.4 to 0.45. Everything else equal, a lower gap

reduces the marginal benefit of effort. This is why the latter drops. In turn, lower

effort means more insurance for the entrepreneur.
         The right panel on the top row shows that investment is higher. Most likely, this
result depends on the fact that a higher θl relaxes the limited liability constraint in
the bad state of nature. As usual, investment is chosen to equate the marginal effect
on future revenues to the opportunity cost. In Section 4 we have argued that when
the constraint binds, this cost also depends on the intertemporal distortion that is
caused by lower consumption in the low state. This is why efficiency dictates that
the larger revenues in the low state are allocated in part to increase compensation, as
argued above, and in part to increase investment.


7         Auto–Correlated Shocks

So far we have assumed that a successful performance of the entrepreneur only affects
the probability distribution of the shock θ in the same period. Although it is shared
by most of the literature on dynamic hidden action models,15 one may find this
assumption to be particularly removed from reality. In this section we address this
concern by assuming that a successful outcome also alters the probability distribution
in the future. We posit that next period’s distribution conditional on success in the
current period, G(θ $ |a$ , θh ), stochastically dominates the distribution conditional on
failure, i.e. G(θ $ |a$ , θl ), for all a$ ∈ A. In the numerical implementation, we assume
that prob(θ $ = θh |θ = θi ) = 1 − e−ψi a , with ψh > ψl > 0.
         Notice that our modeling choice is different from that of Fernandes and Phelan
(2000). In their case, next period’s distribution depends on current effort (which is
private information), rather than on the current realization (public information).
         Figure 14 illustrates value and policy functions along the ω dimension, for given
capital stock. Solid lines refer to ψh = 1.4, while dashed line refer to ψl = 0.8.
All the other parameters are as described in Table 1. For ψ = ψh , a given level of
effort leads to a higher probability of success. With respect to the case of ψ = ψl ,
the promised utility ω is delivered by requiring more effort and awarding greater
average consumption and expected continuation utility. Given the higher probability
of success, this plan can be implemented by lowering the state–contingent payoffs to
the entrepreneur, both in the present and in the future. This is why ci (k, ω,ψ l ) >
ci (k, ω,ψ h ) and ωi (k, ω,ψ l ) > ωi (k, ω,ψ h ) for all ω and for i = h, l.
         In spite of the fact that average continuation utility is higher, net investment is

                                                   28
higher for ψ = ψh . The reason is simple. The persistence in the distribution of
the shock and the difference between θh and θl are such that the marginal value of
investment is higher in that case.

   Figure 15 illustrates the effects of persistence on the dynamics of all relevant vari-
ables. A good shock is associated with higher consumption and higher continuation
utility. However, differently from the benchmark scenario, firm value as well as next
period’s investment and recommended effort are also higher following a good shock.
Why is this the case?
   For simplicity, consider the case of a good realization when the distribution is
parameterized by ψl . On the one hand, the rise in continuation utility triggered by
the shock still calls for lower effort in the future and therefore implies a lower marginal
value of investment. On the other hand, the improvement in the shock distribution, by
calling for greater effort, raises the marginal value of investment. For our parameter
values, the latter effect dominates.
   Similarly to the benchmark scenario described in Section 4, the value of outside
equity converges to zero and the entrepreneur ends up controlling all cash–flow rights.
However, the ergodic set for the state variables is now a non–degenerate subset of Ω’s
upper contour. As the investor’s payoff settles down to its long–run value, the other

8    Conclusion
In this paper we have characterized the firm dynamics implied by constrained–efficient
contracts between a risk–neutral investor and a risk–averse entrepreneur under the
assumption that the latter’s effort is not publicly observable.
    A robust feature of the model is the sub–modularity of the value function. The
marginal gain from investing declines with the level of promised utility. This happens
because the cost of incentive provision is increasing in ω. In turn, this means that
the higher ω, the lower are recommended effort and the probability of success, and
therefore the lower is the return to capital accumulation.
    When the entrepreneur’s relative risk aversion coefficient is less than 1 and the two
agents are equally impatient, ω and the value of inside equity follow sub–martingale
processes. Firms that, consistent with the empirical evidence, start out small, have a
relatively high marginal product of capital, and therefore grow over time. The grad-
ualness of the growth process depends on the limited liability assumption, which can
be interpreted as a financing constraint or an extreme form of investment adjustment
costs. Because of the sub–modularity property, the rise in the value of promised util-


                                            30
ity implies a drop in the return to investment, which eventually leads to a decline
in the capital stock. In this sense, our theory provides a rationale for firm’s decline.
This feature distinguishes our model from other theories of firm dynamics. According
to those, average firm size and value of survivors increase monotonically over time.
   Interestingly, the constrained–efficient contract prescribes that in the long run the
entrepreneur becomes the only claimant to the firm’s cash flows.
   When the RRA coefficient is larger than 1 or the entrepreneur is relatively more
impatient, the dynamics of observables has the same qualitative features, as long
as the initial values of capital and promised utility are relatively low. What distin-
guishes these scenarios from our benchmark is that the model admits non–degenerate
stationary distributions for firm size and the other relevant variables.
   A key mechanism in our theory is that providing incentives to exert effort becomes
costlier as the manager increases her stake in the firm. We believe that it would be
interesting to extend our framework by allowing for the possibility of termination.
That is, by empowering the investor to liquidate the entrepreneur and hire someone
else to run operations. The insights provided by Spear and Wang (2005) and Wang
(2006) may prove useful in carrying out this task.
   We also believe that it would be of interest to study the dynamics implied by our
model under different assumptions on preferences. The results by Rampini (2004)
hint that under certain conditions the results could be quite different. In his study of
the relationship between entrepreneurial activity and the business cycle, he finds that
when preferences are of the type u(c − a), risk tolerance is increasing with wealth,
and therefore incentive provision is cheaper. Exactly the contrary of what happens
in this paper.

A       Proofs and Lemmas

Proof of Proposition 1.
Fix the pair (k,ω ). We already know that Φ(k, w) is bounded. It is left to prove that
it is also closed. Let {Vn } ⊆ Φ(k, w), where Vn → V∞ when n → ∞. We need to show
that V∞ ∈ Φ(k, w). In words, we need to demonstrate that there exists a contract σ∞
that satisfies (2), (3), (4), ω(σ∞ |h0 ) = w, and v(σ∞ |h0 ) = V∞ . Now we will construct
such an optimal contract σ∞ . By the definition of Φ(k, w), there exists a sequence of
contracts {σn } = {ant (ht−1 ), cnt (ht )} and capital {kt+1
                                                         n (ht−1 )}, where the constraints

(2), (3), and (4), ω(σn |h0 ) = w are satisfied for every n. Therefore
              .∞        !
                    t−1
  V∞ = lim        β       [θt f (kt ) − cnt (ht ) − kt+1
                                                     n
                                                         (ht−1 ) + (1 − δ)kt ]g(θt |ant (ht−1 ))dht
          n→∞
                t=1

For t = 1, notice that {an1 (h0 ), cn1 (h1 )} and {k2n (h0 )} are finite collections of bounded
                                                                             n         n
sequences. Therefore, there exist collections of subsequences {a1 q (h0 ), c1 q (h1 )} and
  n
{k2 q (h0 )} such that
            n                             n                                 n
       lim a q (h0 )   = a∞   0         q  1     ∞ 1               q  0     ∞ 0
                          1 (h ), lim c1 (h ) = c1 (h ), and lim k2 (h ) = k2 (h ).
      nq →∞ 1                     nq →∞                             nq →∞

We now consider t = 2. Notice that {an2 (h1 ), cn2 (h2 )} and {k3n (h1 )} are finite col-
lections of bounded sequences, and we can define {a∞   1    ∞ 2           ∞ 1
                                                   2 (h ), c2 (h )} and {k3 (h }
similarly as we did for t = 1. If we iterate this procedure for t = 3, 4, ..., and let
σ∞ = {a∞
       t (h
           t−1 ), c∞ (ht )} along with k = {k ∞ (ht−1 )}, then it is easy to verify that
                   t                         t+1
the constructed contract σ∞ is what we desired for.

Proof of Proposition 2.
Fix ω, the lifetime discounted utility ensured by the optimal contract to the agent, and
k, the optimal capital level of the firm. First, we show that T (v ∗ )(k,ω ) ≤ v ∗ (k,ω ).
This inequality is true if there exists a feasible and incentive compatible contract
σ such that ω(σ|h0 ) = ω and v(σ|h0 ) = T (v ∗ )(k,ω ). The desired contract σ can
be constructed in the following way. Let a(k,ω ), c(θ, k,ω ), k$ (k,ω ), and ω $ (θ, k,ω )
denote the solution of the maximization problem associated with the definition of
T (v ∗ )(k,ω ). Now, let a1 (h0 ) = a(k,ω ), c1 (h1 ) = c(θ1 , k,ω ), and k2 (h0 ) = k$ (k,ω ),
∀h1 for k = k1 given. For the realization of θ in t = 1, denoted θ1 for the purpose of this
proof, there exists a feasible and incentive compatible contract σθ1 that ensures a level
of expected discounted utility ω $ (θ1 , k,ω ) to the agent, and v ∗ (k$ (k,ω ), ω $ (θ1 , k,ω ))
to the principal. Thus, we can say that σ|h1 = σθ1 , ∀h1 . It is obvious that the
constructed contract σ is what is desired.

                                                 32
      We now need to show that v ∗ (k,ω ) ≤ T (v ∗ )(k,ω ). Let σ ∗ be an optimal contract
that ensures a level of expected discounted utility of ω to the agent, given k. In
consequence, we can say that

                                         v ∗ (k,ω ) = v(σ ∗ |h0 ),

or
               !

                    θ1 f (k1 ) − c∗1 (θ1 ) − k2∗ (h0 ) + (1 − δ)k1 + βv ∗ (k2∗ (h0 ), σ ∗ |h1 ) g(θ|a∗1 (h0 ))dθ,
                   "                                                                           #
v (k,ω ) =
               Θ

or, finally,
                                       v ∗ (k,ω ) ≤ T (v ∗ )(k,ω ),

where the last inequality is obtained by letting a(k,ω ) = a∗ (h0 , k1 ), c(θ, k,ω ) =
c∗1 (θ1 , k1 ), ω $ (θ, k,ω ) = ω $ (σ ∗ |h0 ) along with k$ (k,ω ) = k2∗ (h0 , k1 ), for given k = k1 .
This solution satisfies the constraints (5), (6), (7), and (8).

      Notice that the operator B is monotone, i.e.Σ           1   ⊆ Σ2 implies that B(Σ1 ) ⊆ B(Σ2 ).
Following Abreu, Pierce, and Stacchetti (1990), we say that Σ is self–generating if
Σ ⊆ B(Σ).

Lemma 2 (a) Ω is self–generating. (b) If Σ is self–generating, then B(Σ) ⊆ Ω.

Proof. To prove (a), let (k,ω ) ∈ Ω. There exists a contract σ = {at (ht−1 ), ct (ht )} and
a sequence {kt+1 (ht−1 )} which satisfy the constraints (2), (3), (4), and ω(σ|h0 ) = ω.
We now say that

a(k,ω ) = a1 (h0 ); k$ (k,ω ) = k2 (h0 ); c(θ, k,ω ) = c1 ({θ}), ∀θ; ω $ (θ, k,ω ) = ω2 (σ|{θ}), ∀θ.

      It is obvious that {a(k,ω ), c(θ, k,ω ), k$ (k,ω ), ω $ (θ, k,ω )}, defined above, satisfies
the constraints (5), (6),(7), and (8). Therefore, (k,ω ) ∈ B(Ω), which demonstrates
that (a).
      To prove (b), let Σ be self–generating, and let (k,ω )h0 ∈ B(Σ). We have to
construct a contract σ = {at (ht−1 ), ct (ht )} and a sequence kt+1 (ht−1 ) = kh0 that
satisfy the constraints (2), (3), (4), and ω(σ|h0 ) = ωh0 . We construct such a contract
recursively. First, there exist {a(kh0 , ωh0 ), c(θ, kh0 , ωh0 ), k$ (kh0 , ω h0 ), ω $ (θ, kh0 , ωh0 )}
that satisfies (6), (8), and
!
     u(c(θ, kh0 , ωh0 ), m(a(kh0 , ωh0 ))l(k)) + βω $ (θ, kh0 , ωh0 ) g(θ|a(kh0 , wωh0 ))dθ = ωh0 ,
   "                                                                 #
  Θ
0 ≤ c(θ, kh0 , ωh0 ) ≤ θf (k) − kh0 + (1 − δ)k.

                                                    33
      For t = 1, let a1 (h0 ) = a(kh0 , ωh0 ) and c1(h1 ) = c(θ1 , kh0 , ωh0 ), ∀h1 . Also, let
kh$ 0 = kh1 = k$ (kh0 , ωh0 ) and ωh1 = ω $ (θ, kh0 , ωh0 ), ∀h1 . Notice that (kh1 , ωh1 ) ∈ Σ ∈
B(Σ) implies the existence of {a(kh1 , ωh1 ), c(θ, kh1 , ωh1 ), k$ (kh1 , ωh1 ), ω $ (θ, kh1 , ωh1 )}
that satisfies (6), (8), and
 !
      u(c(θ, kh1 , ωh1 ), m(a(kh1 , ωh1 ))l(k)) + βω $ (θ, kh1 , ωh1 ) g(θ|a(kh1 , ωh1 ))dθ = ωh1 ,
    "                                                                 #
  Θ
0 ≤ c(θ, kh1 , ωh1 ) ≤ θf (k) − kh1 + (1 − δ)k.

We can iterate for t = 2, 3, 4, ... to construct the complete profile σ. We can then
observe that, by construction, for any arbitrary t ≥ 0 and ht ,
                              !
             ω(σ|ht ) − ωht =    β[ω(σ|ht∗1 ) − ωht∗1 ]g(θ|a(kht , ωht ))dθt∗1
                                       Θ

Since 0 < β< 1 and the utilities are bounded, the above equation implies that

                              ω(σ|ht ) = ωht ∀ t ≥ 0 and ∀ ht .

Hence, the contract that we have constructed is what is desired.

Proof of Proposition 3.
Part (a) is obvious. To show part (b), we will first show that the sequence {Xn } is con-
vergent. Obviously, B(X0 ) ⊆ X0 . Next, we operate B on both sides of this expression
and obtain Xn+1 = B(Xn ) ⊆ Xn , ∀n, because B is monotone increasing. Hence, {Xn }
                                                                                             ∞
is a bounded and monotone decreasing set sequence with X∞ = lim Xn = ∩ Xn .
                                                                               n→∞          n=0
Now, we show thatΩ ⊆ X∞ . Given thatΩ ⊆ X0 , the monotonicity property of B
ensures that B(Ω) ⊆ B(X0 ). However, it must be true that Ω= B(Ω), by part (a),
and B(X0 ) = X1 , by construction. Then,Ω ⊆ X1 . By iteration we obtainΩ ⊆ Xn ,
∀n ≥ 0, and consequently,Ω ⊆ X∞ . Now, we demonstrate that X∞ ⊆ Ω. Given
the properties of the sequence {Xn }, we have that B(X∞ ) = X∞ . Hence, X∞ is
self–generating, and X∞ = B(X∞ ) ⊆ Ω.


Lemma 3 Let k ≥ (θl /δ)1/(1−α) . If ūh − ūl < 1, then ω̄(k) = ūl . If ūh − ūl > 1, then
ω̄(k) = ūh − 1 − log(ūh − ūl ). For χ < 1, ω(k) = 0. For χ ≥ 1, ω(k) = −∞.

Proof. The value ω̄(k) is given by
                                             ∗           ∗
                  ω̄(k) = max (1 − e−a )uh + e−a ul − a∗ ,
                           uh ,ul

                                    s.t. a∗ = arg max (1 − e−a )uh + e−a ul − a,
                                                   a
                                    u ≤ ui ≤ ūi i = h, l.


                                                   34
Conditional on the optimal level of effort being zero, the solution calls for ul = ūl .
When effort is strictly positive, then problem rewrites as

                            ω̄(k) = max uh − 1 − log(uh − ul )
                                     uh ,ul

and the solution calls for ui = ūi , i = h, l. Since uh − ul > 1 implies uh − 1 − log(uh −
ul ) > ul it follows that ω̄(k) = ūl for ūh − ūl < 1 and ω̄(k) = ūh − 1 − log(ūh − ūl )
otherwise.
     Now turn to ω(k). For χ > 1, any level of utility ω < ūl can be awarded by setting
a∗   = 0 and cl = c(ω). Such allocation is feasible and incentive compatible. For χ < 1,
any ω such that 0 ≤ ω ≤ ūl can be delivered in exactly the same way. Therefore,
ω(k) ≤ 0. By contradiction, assume that ω(k) < 0. Obviously, this must happen for
                                                                 ∗
a∗ > 0. However, in this case promised utility is ul + ea − 1 − a∗ , which is always
non negative for a∗ > 0.

     For any k > 0, let ωb (k) be equal to the infimum of the set of values ω such
that the constraint ui ≥ u does not bind. It is easy to see that such set is always
non–empty.

Proposition 5 When recommended effort is positive, a∗ = log(uh − ul ) ≥ 0. Fur-
thermore:
(a) if χ ≥ 1/2, a∗ is strictly decreasing in ω and uh and ul are strictly increasing in
ω for all ω such that the solution is interior;
(b) assume ul ≤ ūl binds; if ūh − ūl < 1, then a∗ = 0, otherwise a∗ = log(u∗h − ūl ),
where u∗h satisfies u∗h − 1 − log(u∗h − ūl ) − ω;
(c) let χ < 1; if [θh − θl ]kα > c(1), there exists ωr > 0 such that ul = 0 and
uh − 1 − log(uh ) = ω for all ω ∈ [0, ωr ]. If [θh − θl ]kα ≤ c(1), then a∗ = 0 and ul = ω
for all ω.

Proof. To prove (a), consider the necessary condition for an interior solution:

               [θh − θl ]kα − [c(uh ) − c(ul )] − (s − 1) c$ (uh ) − c$ (ul ) = 0.
                                                         (                   )
                                                                                        (24)

This condition is also sufficient if
 *                  &       '+                        *                  &     '+
    $    1    $       1          ( $     $
                                               )        $$    1   $$       1
− c (uh ) − c (ul )     − 1 − c (uh ) − c (ul ) −(s−1) c (uh ) − c (ul )     −1   < 0.
         s            s                                       s            s

When c$ (·) is convex, sufficiency follows from the convexity of the cost function. This
happens for χ ≥ 1/2. When c$ (·) is concave (χ < 1/2), it follows from the fact that


                                               35
              χ c# (u)
c$$ (u) =    1−χ u .     Applying the implicit function theorem to (24) reveals that χ ≥ 1/2
                                                        ds
is sufficient, although not necessary condition for     dω   < 0. In turn, this directly implies
dul                           duh
dω    > 0. To see that        dω    > 0 must hold, start from a pair (k,ω ) and consider an
                                                                                           ds
infinitesimal increase in ω. The left–hand side of (24) does not change. Since             dω   <0
       dul                                                                           duh
and    dω    > 0, for the right–hand side to remain unchanged it must be that        dω    > 0.
      When ūh − ūl < 1 and ω is such that ul = ūl , a positive effort recommendation
is not incentive compatible. This is not the case when ūh − ūl > 1. In such scenario,
any increase in ω must be accommodated by raising uh . This shows (b).
      Now let χ < 1. For ω = 0, it is obvious that a∗ = 0 and uh = ul = 0. In fact,
if it were the case that a∗ > 0, (24) would have to hold for s > 1, which in turn
would imply ul < 0. Now consider an infinitesimal increase in ω. The constraint
s − log(s) ≤ 1 + ω relaxes. By continuity, however, it will still be the case that the
left–hand side of (24) is still strictly positive over the admissible range of s. Since
the left–hand side of (24) is decreasing in ω, when [θh − θl ]kα > c(1) there will be a
positive value of ω such that (24) holds true for s such that s − log(s) ≤ 1 + ω. On
the other hand, if [θh − θl ]kα ≤ c(1), this will never be the case.


Proof of Proposition 4. Claims (a) and (b) are proven in the main body of the
paper. Strict concavity follows from Theorem 4.8 in Stokey and Lucas (1989). To
see why this is the case, rewrite the optimization program in (P2) as the operator
T , which maps the set of bounded and continuous functions defined over [0, ω̄] into

First, notice that since a∗ ∈ [0, ā] and a = max[0, log(s)], s is bounded. This implies
that the choices of uh and ul are also bounded. Furthermore, the constraint set
is convex, in the following sense. Let Γ(ω) denote the set of feasible triplets κ =
(s,ω h , ωl ) when the state is ω. For all pairs ωa , ωb ∈ [0, ω̄] and all {κa , κb } such that
κa ∈ Γ(ωa ) and κb ∈ Γ(ωb ), ηκa + (1 − η)κb ∈ Γ[ηωa + (1 − η)ωb ] for all η ∈ [0, 1].
      Finally, strict convexity of the function c guarantees that for all concave, bounded

and continuous functions v defined over [0, ω̄], (T )(v)(ηωa +(1−η)ωb ) > η(T )(v)(ωa )+
(1 − η)(T )(v)(ωb ), for all ωa , ωb ∈ [0, ω̄] and all η ∈ [0, 1].


B      Algorithm

In this section we provide a brief description of the algorithm that was used to compute
a numerical approximation to the value function v(k,ω ). Given that the set Ω is not
square, it is not efficient to approximate the value function by means of bi–dimensional
splines. For this reason, we will restrict the choice of capital to a finite number of
levels and approximate the value function on the ω dimension by means of cubic
splines.
    We start by defining a fine grid for the capital stock. Denote it as K ≡{ kj }nj=1
                                                                                    k


and let the related set of indexes be J ≡{ j}nj=1
                                               k
                                                  . The upper bound of K must be
chosen in such a way that the corresponding net investment will be negative for all ω.
For this to be the case, it is sufficient to set it equal to the efficient capital stock when
                                                                        /    0 1
θ = θh with probability 1 in all periods. That is, we let knk = αθδ h
                                                                               1−α
                                                                                   . The next
task consists in approximating the equilibrium value set of the transformed problem.

B.1      Approximation of the Set Ω

From the analysis conducted in Section 2, it follows that for every j ∈ J , the set
of feasible and incentive compatible values will be given by an interval [ω, ω̄j ] ∈ #+ .
This means that our task reduces to approximate the mapping Ω : K → #+ which is
given by the sequence {ω̄j }j∈J . The mapping Ω can be shown to be increasing and
strictly concave.
    Following Abreu, Pierce, and Stacchetti (1990), we start by defining an initial
guess Ω0 = {ω̄0j }j∈J . We impose that Ω0 is weakly increasing, weakly concave,
and such that ω̄0j ≥ ω̄j for all j. These requirements are satisfied by letting ω̄0j =
      α −δk
u(θh kn     nk )
       k
      1−β        .   Then, for every j, q ∈ J such that θl kjα +kj (1−δ)−kq ≥ 0, we compute

                                                    1 − e−a [uh + βωh ] + e−a [ul + βωl ] − a
                                                $          %
                     bjq ≡       max                                                            (25)
                             a,{ui ,ωi }i=h,l

                                      s.t. 0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ),
                                                ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄nq

and
                                                    ω̄n+1,j ≡ max {bjq } .                      (26)
                                                                j




                                                             37
The operator defined by (25)–(26) generates a sequence {Ωn } that converges to Ω.
Our approximation will be Ωm such that ||Ωm − Ωm−1 ||∞ < 10.0−8 .
   Notice that, conditional on effort being zero, the above optimization problem
simplifies to

                                     max ul + βωl
                                      ul ,ωl

                                       s.t. 0 ≤ ul ≤ u(θl kα + k(1 − δ) − kj ),
                                                 ω ≤ ωl ≤ ω̄nj .

Obviously the solution calls for ul = u(θl kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ) and ωl = ω̄nq . Alterna-
tively, when effort is strictly positive, a = log(s), where s ≡ (uh + βωh − ul − βωl ).
The optimization problem then becomes

                                   max uh + βωh − 1 − log(s)
                                  s,uh ,ωh

                                             s.t. 0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ),
                                             ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄nq .

In this case the solution calls for ui = u(θi kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ) and ωi = ω̄nq .

B.2      Approximation of the Value Function

For every j ∈ J , we define a coarse grid Zj = {ωjz }nz=1
                                                       ω
                                                          over the interval [ω, ω̄j ].
We also define an initial guess for the value function: v0j : Zj → #+ . For all other
ω ∈ [ω, ω̄j ], the guess is approximated by a cubic spline which we denote as v0j (ω).
We impose that v0j (ω) is decreasing and concave in ω for all j ∈ J and that the
function is increasing and concave in capital. Then, for all z and every j, q ∈ J such
that θl kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ≥ 0, we compute
                                                 ∗                                   ∗
djzq ≡        max                 (1 − e−a )[θh kα − c(uh ) + βvnq (ωh )] + e−a [θl kα − c(ul ) + βvnq (ωl )]
         a∗ ,{u   i ,ωi ,}i=h,l

                                  + kj (1 − δ) − kq ,                                                 (27)

                                             ∗                      ∗
                     s.t. (1 − e−a )[uh + βωh ] + e−a [ul + βωl ] − a∗ = ωjz ,
                            a∗ = arg max (1 − e−a )[uh + βωh ] + e−a [ul + βωl ] − a,
                            0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ) ∀ i = h, l,
                            a∗ ≥ 0,
                            ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄q ∀ i = h, l,


                                                               38
and
                                   vn+1,jz ≡ max {djzq } .                                  (28)
                                                q

    The operator defined by (27)–(28) generates a sequence Vn ≡ {vnj }j∈J . Our
approximation of the value function on the grid will be Vm such that ||Vm −Vm−1 ||∞ <
10.0−8 . Notice that when recommended effort is positive, the above optimization
problem simplifies to
                   &      '
                        1                                  1
         max         1−     [θh kα − c(uh ) + βvnq (ωh )] + [θl kα − c(ul ) + βvnq (ωl )]
      s,{ui }i=h,l      s                                  s
                 + kj (1 − δ) − kq ,


                    s.t. ωh = [ωjz + 1 + log(s) − uh ]/β,
                         ωl = [ωjz + 1 + log(s) − s − ul ]/β,
                         0 ≤ ui ≤ u(θi kjα + kj (1 − δ) − kq ) ∀ i = h, l,
                         ω ≤ ωi ≤ ω̄q ∀ i = h, l.
