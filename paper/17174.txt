                                               ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes determinants of ex-manufacturer prices for originator and generic drugs across
a large sample of countries. We focus on drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in middle and low
income countries (MLICs), with robustness checks to other therapeutic categories and other countries.
We examine effects of per capita income, income dispersion, number and type of therapeutic and generic
competitors, and whether the drugs are sold to retail pharmacies vs. tendered procurement by NGOs.

The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0.4 across high and low income countries, but is only
0.15 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income
countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Number
of therapeutic and generic competitors only weakly affects prices to retail pharmacies, plausibly because
uncertain quality leads to competition on brand rather than price. Tendered procurement attracts multi-national
generic suppliers and significantly reduces prices for originators and generics, compared to prices
to retail pharmacies.

I.     Introduction

       Pharmaceutical pricing in middle and low income countries (MLICs) is an important

and contentious issue. Since most patients lack insurance coverage and pay out‐of‐pocket

for drugs, pricing commensurate with income is critical to affordability. The requirement

that all countries adopt the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s patent regime as a

condition of membership prompted concerns that patents would make drugs unaffordable

in MLICs. However, patents need not imply high prices if originator firms price

discriminate across countries based on per capita income (for example, Malueg and

Schwarz, 1994; Danzon and Towse, 2003). Moreover, generic copies are available for most

originator drugs. Thus whether drug prices are affordable in MLICs is an empirical

question.

       This paper examines determinants of ex‐manufacturer prices for originator and

generic drugs across countries at all income levels, with more detailed evidence on MLICs,

focusing on effects of mean per capita income (PCI), income dispersion, and number of

competitor products. For drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, we also compare ex‐

manufacturer prices charged to the retail pharmacy channel vs. to large NGO purchasers,

such as the Global Fund and the Clinton Foundation, which purchase only from qualified

suppliers and use tendering to stimulate price competition. The retail channel data from

IMS Health include a broad range of therapeutic categories and countries. The procurement

channel data from the WHO’s Global Price Reporting Mechanism (GPRM) are just for

HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria drugs.

       For drugs sold to the retail channel, we estimate the price elasticity with respect to

PCI across the full range of countries at 0.4 for originators and 0.6 for generics, but



                                                                                                3
insignificantly different from zero across MLICs (Appendix Table II). Income dispersion

further contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Although generics are priced on

average 47 percent below originators in the retail channel, the generic/originator price

ratios are widely dispersed and some exceed one. The estimated price reduction due to an

additional retail generic competitor is significant but small. Additional originator

competitors have no effect on prices. The procurement channel lowers originator and

generic prices by 44 percent and 28 percent, respectively, compared to their retail channel

prices. Overall, the evidence suggests that retail customers in MLICs face high originator

and generic prices, relative to their PCIs, and that price discrimination by originators and

price competition by generics are relatively weak. Compared to the retail channel, the

tendering process reduces quality uncertainty; focuses competition on price, not brand;

and attracts multinational generic suppliers that have scale and other advantages relative

to the local branded generics that dominate the retail channel.

       In the remainder of this paper, section II reviews relevant theory and previous

literature; section III describes data and empirical methods; section IV reports results of

the multivariate regression analysis; and section V concludes.

II.    Theory and Previous Literature

       Price Discrimination and Income             Previous theoretical analysis of cross‐

national pharmaceutical pricing has examined welfare effects of price discrimination vs.

uniform prices, assuming that on‐patent producers are monopolists. For example, Malueg

and Schwartz (1994) conclude that price discrimination is both profit‐maximizing and

welfare‐superior to uniform pricing, if demand dispersion across countries is significant,

discrimination increases aggregate consumption and all markets continue to be served,



                                                                                               4
which is plausible for pharmaceuticals. Szymanski and Valetti (2005) and Valetti and

Szymanski (2006) show that price discrimination also leads to more R&D and higher

quality products than does uniform pricing. Applying Ramsey pricing principles to paying

for pharmaceutical R&D implies that varying prices inversely with demand elasticities is

the second‐best optimal way to pay for the global joint costs of R&D (Danzon, 1997;

Danzon and Towse, 2003; Jack and Lanjouw, 2005). These theoretical results suggest that

manufacturers’ profit‐maximizing strategies may lead to prices that vary across countries

roughly with PCI and that this would be welfare superior to uniform prices, assuming that

price elasticities vary inversely with PCI and that differential pricing leads to higher

utilization. An inverse relation between income and uncompensated price elasticities is

plausible if health is a normal good, although strict proportionality of price elasticities and

income is not necessarily predicted (Danzon et al. 2011). Increased utilization under

differential pricing is also plausible and supported by the limited data (for example,

Danzon and Furukawa, 2008).

           In practice, however, several factors may undermine the potential relationship

between prices and PCI. First, all high income countries (HICs) have comprehensive health

insurance that pays for drugs. Insurance reduces consumer price elasticities and hence

would lead to higher prices if payers were passive. But payers in most countries must

manage pharmaceutical prices and access within constrained budgets that reflect their

citizens’ willingness‐to‐pay for health. If these insurance mechanisms reflect consumer

preferences, the resulting price levels may still vary with income, if average consumer price

elasticities vary inversely with income.1


1   Baros and Martinez‐Giralt (2006) discusses the effects of insurance on Ramsey pricing.


                                                                                                  5
        Second, parallel trade and regulation based on external referencing undermine

manufacturers’ ability to price discriminate across countries (Danzon, Wang and Wang,

2005; Kyle, 2006, 2007; Danzon and Epstein, 2009). In particular, within the EU parallel

trade is legal and external referencing is common. Such policies create incentives for firms

to seek higher prices in low income countries than would occur under perfect

segmentation. Moreover, some regulators may seek to pay only their incremental cost, free

riding on other countries’ contributions to R&D. However, since external referencing and

parallel trade occur mostly between HICs, it is unlikely that these policies could explain

high prices in MLICs.

        Third, Flynn et al. (2009) show that in theory the highly skewed income

distributions in MLICs create incentives for a single price monopolist to set higher prices,

relative to PCI, than would occur with more equal income distribution. No empirical

evidence is presented. Moreover, this effect might be mitigated if manufacturers could

price discriminate within countries, offering lower prices to outlets that serve low income

populations. Within‐country price discrimination is feasible in countries with pluralistic

payers or insurers, such that manufacturers can pay different rebates to different payers, as

occurs in the US and Brazil.2 However, in MLICs most consumers pay cash for drugs in

retail outlets served by common distribution networks. If manufacturers were to offer

discounts to distributors who serve poor populations, these distributors could simply

divert the drugs to higher income outlets with larger mark‐ups. Thus if price discrimination




2In the US, firms give voluntary rebates to private health plans for preferred formulary placement and are
mandated to give discounts to public payers. Brazil regulates prices to the private sector and mandates a
rebate to the public sector.


                                                                                                             6
within cash‐paying MLIC markets is infeasible, firms may rationally set higher prices in

countries with a highly skewed income distribution, conditional on mean PCI.

       Previous empirical evidence on cross‐national price differences focuses mainly on

originator prices and high income countries (for example, Danzon and Chao 2000, 2004).

Danzon and Furukawa (2003, 2008) found that average drug prices vary roughly in

proportion to income across HICs, but for Brazil, Mexico and Chile drug prices are 2‐3 fold

higher relative to PCI. Empirical evidence on drug prices in MLICs is limited. Maskus’

(2001) analysis of 20 drugs in 14 countries in 1998 found a correlation between average

list price and PCI of roughly 0.5. Scherer and Watal (2001) found that for 15 antiretroviral

drugs in 18 countries for the period 1995‐9 the average price was 85% of the US list price,

and a fifth of prices were above the US level. Per capita income weakly contributed to price

differences, and the relationship declined over time as companies began offering discounts

that were unrelated to PCI.

       Competition Most previous literature assumes that originators are monopolists,

due to patents, and that competition forces generics to price at marginal cost. In fact

originators compete with other originators in the same class (“therapeutic substitutes”)

and with generic producers of the same molecule (“generic substitutes”). Most generics in

MLICs are branded generics that claim equivalence to the originator but have not passed

regulatory tests of bioequivalence, as required in HICs. Generic quality is thus uncertain,

but most consumers (or their physician/pharmacy agents) know that originator brands

have met strict safety and efficacy requirements of the US FDA or European EMA. In such

imperfectly competitive markets with uncertain quality, originator and generic copies may

rationally use brand marketing and pricing to signal quality. Originators may optimally



                                                                                               7
follow a segmentation strategy, optimizing price for the most quality‐inelastic, price‐

inelastic segment, while more quality and price‐elastic consumers shift to generics.3 This

strategy predicts that originators would charge higher prices if faced with branded generic

competitors than would occur with no generic competitors.

        Procurement of Drugs for HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria                    Prior to 2000, most

HIV/AIDS drugs were originator brands purchased through standard distribution channels.

Annual treatment cost for the standard 3‐drug cocktail cost up to $10,000, or 10 times

average PCI in the poorest countries (Kapstein and Busby, 2009). In 2001 the WTO Doha

round elaborated the rights of poor countries to issue compulsory licenses for either

domestic production or imported generics in the event of public health emergencies.

Around the same time, donors increased resources for purchasing through NGOs such as

the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria in 2002 and the Clinton Foundation’s

HIV/AIDS Initiative (CHAI). These NGOs purchase only from WHO‐qualified suppliers and

use tendering to stimulate price competition. Expanded demand in turn enabled Indian

generics and other suppliers to achieve greater scale economies. Originator firms may also

have incentives to offer discounts to NGOs, if their demand is more elastic than retail

channel purchasers and/or their procurement channels reduce the risk of parallel export

and external referencing. Waning et al. (2009) examined prices for 24 generic anti‐

retroviral drugs (ARVs) procured July 2002‐October 2007, as reported to the World Health

Organization (WHO) Global Price Reporting Mechanism (GPRM). They found CHAI




3 Frank and Salkever (1996) present a similar rationale for originator price increases following generic entry
in the US. Szymanski and Valetti (2005) consider the option for the originator company of introducing a
“fighting brand” when facing a generic competitor of uncertain quality but find it unlikely to be profitable.


                                                                                                             8
eligibility significantly lowered price, but volume had no consistent effect.4 They did not

analyze originator prices to CHAI, GPRM purchasers other than CHAI or any retail channel

prices.

          Our analysis extends existing literature by estimating price elasticities with respect

to both mean PCI and a GINI measure of income skewness for a large range of countries

and for both originator and generic products; we estimate effects of competition,

distinguishing number of originators, local generic firms and large multinational generic

suppliers; and for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria drugs we compare these determinants of

prices in the retail channel vs. the procurement channel.



III.      Data and Methods

Data

          Retail Pharmacy Channel (IMS): Our IMS MIDAS database reports sales for all drugs

in the J (anti‐infectives) class and the C (cardiovascular) class for most major industrialized

countries and a subset of MLIC countries. IMS reports quarterly ex‐manufacturer sales and

volume data for each product, in current US dollars, converted from local currencies at

quarterly exchange rates.5 We include year indicators to control for inflation, exchange rate

changes and other unmeasured year‐specific effects. 6 We converted the IMS price per




4 The reported magnitudes may be biased because the log price regression coefficients were apparently

exponentiated without variance adjustment.
5 For most MLICs IMS reports a single aggregate channel. When IMS reports separate data for retail and

hospital channels we aggregate to a single channel.
6 Producer price indexes (PPIs) were available for some but not all countries. We estimated equations for

countries with PPIs available, and results were similar to those reported here.


                                                                                                            9
standard unit to annual treatment cost using the WHO defined daily dose (DDD) for each

drug presentation.7

        GPRM: We use prices for all drugs procured by NGOs such as UNICEF, the Global

Fund, Mission Pharma, the IDA Foundation etc. as reported in the WHO’s GPRM database.

Each GPRM contract records the purchaser, recipient country, purchase date,

manufacturer, total contract cost in current US dollars, and quantity of units and packs.8

The GPRM data include about 23,000 contracts for 115 countries. The majority of these

contracts are for ARVs (21,344 for ARVs vs. 2,066 others).9

        Dataset structure and country groups              For our comparison of IMS vs. GPRM

prices, our IMS sample is limited to those HIV/AIDS, TB, or malaria drugs that are also sold

through GPRM in at least one country. We use January 2004‐June 2008 IMS and GPRM

data, aggregating over multiple contracts in GPRM and multiple packs in IMS. Thus our unit

of analysis is average annual treatment price for the molecule‐country‐year, with separate

observations for generic and originator and by IMS (retail) vs. GPRM (tendered) channel

where available.10 Combination drugs are treated as unique products.11

        Ten countries (Algeria, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Morocco, the

Philippines, South Africa, and Thailand) are in both IMS and the GPRM datasets. A group of

ten Sub‐Saharan Africa countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire,



7 When WHO DDDs were unavailable, we used recommended daily doses published in the medical literature.
8 We calculate annual treatment cost by dividing the GPRM contract price and quantity after adjusting
quantity by the WHO defined daily dose (DDD) to arrive at the number of annual treatment courses per
contract. Our calculated annual treatment cost data closely match an estimate provided in the GPRM data for
oral solid formulations. For other formulations GPRM does not provide annual treatment cost.
9 Appendix Table I shows countries in the GPRM and IMS databases.
10 A few molecules have two observations, due to a non‐oral solid form in addition to the oral solid form.
11 Most combination drugs are ARVs which include component ARVs of the same or different classes. These

combinations were generally produced only by generic manufacturers selling to GPRM and are not available
in the IMS data.


                                                                                                        10
Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Senegal, and Togo) are reported aggregated in IMS as “French West

Africa.” We therefore created a comparable, GPRM French West Africa aggregate, defined

as the population‐weighted average of the country‐specific data in GPRM for these

individual countries.

         We report regression estimates for three country groups: (a) all countries for which

we have data; (b) the eleven matched MLIC countries in both IMS and GPRM; and (c) all

MLICs in the same income range as the matched country sample. This matched income

sample includes GRPM data for more low income countries and has very similar summary

statistics (see Table 1). We therefore base most conclusions on this sample, which provides

more robust evidence on GPRM prices.

Methodology

         We estimate a quasi difference‐in‐differences model of log prices, using the pooled

sample with indicator variables to test for differential effects for each license‐channel

category (IMS generics, GPRM originators and GPRM generics, designated by the vector Z

below) compared to the referent IMS originator category:



    ln                  IMS*GEN       GPRM*ORIG          GPRM*GEN                     *
                                       *


In this pooled equation, a1, a2, and a3 measure the mean price differential of IMS generics,

GPRM originators and GPRM generics, respectively, relative to IMS originators; b0 is the

income elasticity for IMS originators in the retail channel and b1 is the vector of differential

income effects for generics and the GPRM channel; c0 and c1 are the coefficients on the

vector of competition variables COMP; d1 and d2, respectively, measure effects of income


                                                                                              11
dispersion and HIV prevalence; ui and ut are molecule and year fixed effects and vijt is a

random disturbance term. We also estimate separate equations for each of the four

license‐channel categories (originator brands and generics in the retail pharmacy and the

procurement channels), to permit all coefficients to differ across categories. The GPRM

regressions include purchaser indicators, to test for variation in prices paid by different

GPRM purchasers, due to scale, bargaining power or other factors.

       Per capita income, income dispersion and HIV Prevalence Per capita income is

measured by (log) per capita gross national income (GNI) in international dollars.

Originator drug prices are expected to be positively related to PCI under the joint

hypothesis that originators can price discriminate between countries and face price

elasticities that vary directly with mean PCI. By contrast, if generic markets are

competitive, generic firms would lack the market power necessary to price discriminate

across countries and generic prices should be invariant with PCI, reflecting marginal

production cost which is largely uniform across countries.

       The GINI measure of income equality ranges from 0 (perfectly equal distribution) to

100. The coefficient is expected to be positive if greater income inequality leads to higher

prices due to demand convexity (Flynn et al. 2009). This effect is expected to be greater for

originators than for generics, and only operative in the retail sector.

       Some countries argue that disease burden should justify a lower price, and some

originator companies list disease burden as a factor in their corporate responsibility and

pricing strategies. If these considerations are significant, HIV prevalence is expected to be

inversely related to drug prices.




                                                                                              12
         Competition Therapeutic competition is measured as the number of originator

products in the same therapeutic class‐country‐year (Originator class count). We

separately count Tendering Generic and Retail Generic competitors in the class‐country‐

year. These measure the number of generic producers in the same therapeutic class and

country that, respectively, did and did not sell to the tendering process during our time

period. Tendering Generics have demonstrated ability to meet quality standards and

compete on price, whereas the Retail Generics have not. Both counts are at the class‐

country rather than the molecule level, to provide a rough measure of potential entrants as

well as actual competitors. Coefficients are expected to be negative under standard price

competition models. These effects are expected to be more negative for Tendering Generics

than Retail Generics, and more negative in the GPRM channel than the retail channel if

uncertain quality undermines price competition in the retail channel.12

         We include an Originator Present indicator equal to one if the molecule originator is

present in a country‐year. The coefficient is expected to be positive if generics shadow‐

price the originator. Similarly, we include a Generic Present indicator in the originator

price regressions; the coefficient is expected to be positive if originators follow

segmentation strategies when faced with generic competition, raising price to the quality

loyal customers while the price‐sensitive customers switch to generics (Frank and Salkever

1996).




12To test for effects of potential competitors we also estimated regressions with these competition variables
measured at the region rather than the country level. Results were generally similar but sometimes less
significant than the country‐level measures reported here.


                                                                                                           13
        Product Characteristics          An indicator variable is included for non‐oral solids

such as liquids and creams, which may have higher production costs and/or fewer

competitors than the tablets and capsules which are the bulk of the observations.

        Purchaser Characteristics         In separate GPRM regressions we include indicators for

the four individual purchasers with the largest number of contracts: UNICEF, the Global

Fund, IDA and Mission Pharma.13 If their purchasing volume gives these purchasers a size

advantage over other smaller purchasers, their coefficients should be negative.



Descriptive Statistics

        Table I reports descriptive statistics. The all‐country sample includes 37 countries

with IMS data, with mean PCI of $24,318, and 112 countries in GPRM with mean PCI of

$3,467. The matching country sample has 11 countries, with mean PCI of roughly $4,360‐

$4,610. The matched PCI range sample increases the number of observations five‐fold,

primarily adding countries with GPRM data, with no material differences in demographic

characteristics. Our discussion therefore focuses mainly on results for the matched PCI

range countries, which have PCI of $1,000‐$10,000.

        For these countries, the pharmacy channel (IMS) has relatively more molecules with

both an originator and at least one generic available than the procurement channel

(GPRM). The pharmacy channel also has more originator and generic competitors per class

(means 2.97 and 25.77, respectively) than the procurement channel (means 1.23 and 1.13,


13 The Clinton Foundation (CHAI) has played a major role in negotiating upper limits on supplier prices for

countries that it deems eligible. However, CHAI itself accounts for only 4% of the GPRM contracts. It has
contracted with IDA for purchase of its pediatric medicines and presumably contracts with other purchasers
for adult medicines. Since the CHAI prices are a ceiling price and actual purchasers may negotiate lower

procurement channels, very few generic manufacturers serve both the pharmacy and

procurement channels. Of the 370 retail generic firms and 100 tendering generic firms,

only 24 sell in both, with even less overlap within each region. Why many large,

multinational tendering generic firms do not sell through the retail channel is an important

question for future research.



IV.      Multivariate Regression Estimates

Pooled License­Channel Estimates

        Table II reports pooled license‐channel multivariate regression estimates for log

annual treatment price for our three country groups defined above. Estimates from

analogous equations with interaction terms between log PCI and the three channel/brand

indicators are reported in Appendix Table II. All equations include molecule fixed effects

to control for unobserved drug heterogeneity, as well as year fixed effects to control for

price inflation and other unmeasured time effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at

the country‐level. Exponentiated coefficients (including a variance correction as in

Kennedy (1981)) appear in a third row for indicator variables. Table III reports separate

regressions by channel and generic status for the PCI range countries only. These estimates

permit all coefficients to differ by channel and generic status, and show effects of individual




14 The 25.7 mean for Retail generic competitors in the pharmacy channel reflects high numbers in India and

China. As an alternative proxy for potential competitors, we tried measuring competitors at the region‐class,
rather than country‐class level. This increased competitor counts for procurement (1.56 for originators and
4.57 for generics), with little change for pharmacy (3.18 for originators and 23.24 for generics). Regression
results were similar but generally less significant than with the country‐class measures reported here.


                                                                                                           15
GPRM purchasers. Our discussion here is based mainly on the pooled regressions in Table

II, with reference to the channel‐specific regressions where relevant.

       License­Channel effects               For the all‐countries sample, the average price

differential, compared to retail originators, is ‐40.4 percent for retail generics, ‐68.3

percent for tendered originators, and ‐83.2 percent for tendered generics For the matched

PCI range countries, the differentials relative to retail originators are: ‐47.5 for generics, ‐

42.0 for GPRM originators, and ‐73.2 for GPRM generics. Thus generics do charge

significantly less than originators in the retail channel in MLICs, presumably due to quality

perceptions and other factors; however, these retail generic prices are still comparable to

originator prices to the procurement process, while procured generic prices are an

additional 25.7 percentage points lower than retail generics. This 25.7 percentage point

procurement‐pharmacy channel differential for generics plausibly reflects competitive

tendering and standardization of quality to focus competition on price, and participation of

large, multinational generic suppliers in international tenders, whereas the retail channel is

served primarily by local branded generics of uncertain quality. The 42.0 percent

procurement‐pharmacy differential for originators in MLICs plausibly reflects originator

willingness to offer lower prices for greater volume and that the procurement process

offers a separate distribution channel that targets the discounted prices to mainly low

income consumers, with reduced risk of price‐spillover to higher income consumers within

the same country or other countries.

       Income                 The income elasticity of drug prices with respect to PCI is

0.269 for the full range of countries and drugs, or less than one third what would be

required to maintain prices proportional to PCI. Within the MLICs, the income elasticity of



                                                                                               16
prices is only 0.15. For the full range of countries the GINI effect is small and negative (‐

0.015), contrary to the predicted positive effect if income dispersion contributes to high

prices. However, for the MLIC matched countries, the GINI effect is significantly positive

(0.040), consistent with the hypothesis that income inequality contributes to high prices in

MLICs.15

        Estimated coefficients for equations including interaction terms to test for

differences in the income elasticity by channel and generic status are reported in Appendix

Table II. Including these interactions changes the channel and generic fixed effects, so

results should be interpreted with caution. Taken at face value, the all‐country regressions

suggest that the overall average PCI elasticity of 0.269 masks higher elasticities in the

pharmacy channel of 0.40 for originators and 0.60 for generics, but no significant income

elasticity in the GPRM channel. The high income elasticity of generic prices in the retail

channel provides further evidence that these generics are not forced by competition to

price at marginal cost, which would presumably vary little across countries.16

        The channel‐specific regressions confirm that PCI effects are small or perverse, and

skewness effects are weakly positive. For the full range of countries (results not reported),

income elasticities are positive and significant in all four channels, with a larger elasticity

for generics (0.54) than originators (0.26) in the retail channel that is reversed in the

procurement channel (0.26 for originators vs. 0.04 for generics), and the GINI coefficient is

insignificant.17 However, when we restrict the analysis to the matching PCI range countries

(Table III), the retail generic income elasticity is significantly negative and the originator

15 Estimated effects of skewness may be imprecise due to missing GINI data for several low income countries.

generics in higher income countries.

                                                                                                         17
elasticity is positive only for procurement channel (0.325).18 The GINI coefficient is

significantly positive for retail originators (0.047) and retail generics (0.075), but

insignificant for GPRM originators and generics.19 Thus procurement contracting not only

reduces drug prices overall but appears to eliminate perverse PCI‐based price differentials

for generics and permits modestly income‐related pricing for originator products.

Procurement also eliminates income skewness effects found in pricing to the retail channel.

        Originator prices are inversely related to HIV prevalence in MLICs, but the effect is

small, with larger effects in the pharmacy channel than the GPRM channel.

        Competition Tendering generics consistently reduce prices more than do Retail

generics. In the all‐countries sample, the marginal effect of an additional Tendering generic

on drug prices is ‐7.2 percent, compared to only ‐1.1 percent for an additional Retail

generic. For the MLIC countries, the marginal Tendering generic reduces prices by 3.1

percent, compared to only 0.8 percent for the marginal Retail generic. Interactions to test

for differential effects of competitors on originator vs. generic prices were generally not

significant. The separate channel regressions (Table III) confirm that the marginal effect of

a Tendering generic on originator prices is ‐12.6 percent in the pharmacy channel, whereas

the marginal effect of a Retail generic is only ‐0.12 percent.

        In MLIC countries, having at least one generic competitor raises prices by 27

percent, consistent with segmentation pricing by originators when faced with lower quality

competitors. Prices are 29 percent higher if the originator is present in the market,

18 Diagnostics to identify influential observations (e.g., dffits) did flag a small fraction of observations beyond
a threshold of 2 / where p is the number of estimated parameters and n is the number of observations.
Regressions omitting these observations resulted in very similar coefficients to those reported in Table 3.
19 The correlation between log PCI and the Gini for the MLIC countries is 0.51 for IMS countries, 0.27 for

GPRM countries and 0.31 for all countries combined. Tests for restricted models do not support excluding the
Gini and Gini missing flag for retail generic and originator regressions.


                                                                                                                18
consistent with shadow pricing by generics. The MLIC separate channel regressions (Table

III) show that the presence of the originator product is associated with 16.6 percent higher

generic prices in the pharmacy channel; this effect is smaller but still positive (9.5 percent)

in the GPRM channel.20 Thus taken overall, this evidence suggests that in MLICs having

multiple generic competitors in the pharmacy channel has at most a small negative effect,

and possibly a positive effect on originator and other generic prices, consistent with

models of uncertain quality in which generics compete on brand rather than price.

           The channel‐specific regressions for MLICs indicate that originator prices are

positively related to number of originator substitutes in the pharmacy sector channel.

These effects may reflect unmeasured factors, such as higher promotional spending and

other forms of non‐price competition in retail channels for more crowded therapeutic

classes. These estimates may also be upward biased, if entry is endogenous and responds

positively to price. Such endogeneity bias should not be significant for originators, because

originators usually face one or two years of regulatory delay in getting approval of a new

molecule. Generic entry also faces regulatory delay, but usually less than originators. Given

the potential for upward biased estimates if entry is endogenous, a safe conclusion is that

in MLICs additional originators in a class do not reduce prices, retail generics have at most

minimal effects, but tendering generics have significant negative effects.

           Tendering purchaser effects The channel‐specific regressions (Table III) show

significant differences in prices obtained by different procuring NGOs. Contrary to the

common assertion that purchaser volume increases leverage, our results indicate that 2 of

the 4 large purchasers (Global Fund and IDA) pay 22 and 19 percent higher prices for


20   These are the exponentiated and variance‐corrected values from the coefficients in Table 3.


                                                                                                   19
generic drugs, respectively , than do the smaller purchasers (the omitted category). UNICEF

pays 24 percent more for originator products than small do purchasers, but 6 percent less

for generics (not statistically significant). These equations include drug fixed effects, to

control for differences in drugs purchased by different purchasers. It is possible that these

positive size differentials reflect intentional policies of large purchaser to pay prices

sufficiently high to assure that multiple suppliers, including multinational originators,

continue to bid in this market. These conclusions are tentative, because it is also possible

that our controls (form indicators, DDD‐corrected prices and molecule fixed effects) do not

adequately control the relatively high share of pediatric formulations purchased by both

IDA and UNICEF.21



Comprehensive anti­infective and cardiovascular class results

        Table IV reports regression results for the entire ATC J class (anti‐infectives) and C

class (cardiovascular), for retail originators and generics, respectively, in the matched PCI

range countries only. There is no procurement process for these categories, and hence no

GPRM data are available. The dependent variable is log price per standard unit rather than

log DDD‐adjusted annual treatment price as we lacked DDD data for many drugs. We

include formulation indicators to control for non‐oral formulations. We exclude

combination products from the full J‐class and C‐class analysis.

        Income                   Income elasticities in both classes are significantly negative for

originator drugs, whereas GINI coefficients are significantly positive. The significant

correlation between log PCI and GINI coefficients for countries in this income range may

remained.


                                                                                                      20
make separate effects difficult to identify. In similar regressions for originators and

generics combined for the entire range of countries rather than only the matched PCI range

countries the income elasticity for J and C class pharmacy drugs is around 0.3 and the GINI

is insignificant.22

           Each additional generic competitor reduces generic prices by 0.4% and originator

prices by 0.2% in both the J and C classes. Competition from other originator therapeutic

substitutes reduces originator prices only for cardiovascular drugs. Thus overall the

conclusions appear to be robust across classes, that the (at best) weak relation between

drug prices and PCI implies that prices are least affordable, relative to income, in low

income countries. In these countries, despite multiple competitors, price competition does

not appear to be strong in retail channels.



Conclusions

           This evidence on prices for both originator and generic drugs suggests that income

effects and competition alone are unlikely to achieve affordable prices in low income

countries, given traditional distribution and institutional environments. Drug price

elasticities with respect to mean PCI are positive but small – around 0.2 – 0.4 for

originators across all countries but insignificant or negative in MLICs, implying that the

poorest countries face the highest prices relative to their PCI. Generics appear to pursue

similar pricing strategies. Skewed income distributions appear to exacerbate high drug

prices relative to PCI in MLICs. Competition from other originator drugs is not effective at

reducing prices in retail channels in MLICs. Although generic prices are roughly 40 percent

                                                                                              21
below originator prices in MLICs, the fact that the marginal effect of an additional Retail

generic competitor is only 0.8 percent or less suggests that this average generic price

differential primarily reflects the lower and/or less certain quality of generics, not price

competitiveness. The tendency for branded generic to compete on brand rather than price

is found in high income countries with branded generics (Danzon and Furukawa, 2011). By

contrast, an additional Tendering generic (a multinational generic supplier that has met

quality standards and demonstrated ability to compete on price) reduces prices by 3.21

percent, or almost fourfold greater than an additional Retail generic.

       The evidence from HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria drugs shows that procurement

mechanisms lower originator and generic prices by 42 percent and 28 percent,

respectively, compared to their retail pharmacy prices. These large procurement effects

may reflect not only price‐competitive tendering but also greater willingness of originators

to grant discounts to a separate distribution channel that targets lower income customers

and is less prone to price spillovers to other countries. Procurement also appears to reduce

price because it attracts multinational generic suppliers that meet quality standards, have

lower costs and are more price competitive than the local branded generics that sell only in

retail channels.

       Obviously the HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria drugs are a unique category of drugs, as

reflected in their special donor funding and procurement arrangements. However, our

analysis of pharmacy channel prices for the entire anti‐infective and cardiovascular classes

shows similar modest or even negative effects of income and competition.

       This evidence suggests that although price‐discrimination between MLICs countries

could in theory be a welfare enhancing and profit‐maximizing strategy for companies, this



                                                                                               22
incentive is undermined if income distributions are skewed and/or competition focuses on

brand, rather than price, due to quality uncertainty of generics. Price discrimination within

MLICs is unlikely to be feasible when drugs are sold to largely self‐pay patients in retail

pharmacy channels served by common distribution networks. Encouraging generics of

uncertain quality has limited benefit in retail channels. A protected procurement channel,

with informed buyers who require minimum quality standards, encourage generic price

competition and target drugs to low income subgroups, can in theory achieve within‐

country differential pricing and thereby provide drugs at lower prices to targeted poor

populations than is possible in the retail sector. Whether public hospitals, targeted

insurance programs or other mechanisms might serve as such a protected channel for a

broad range of drugs in at least some MLICs is an important question for future research.

More generally, finding better mechanisms to enable differential pricing between and

within low and middle income countries is an important challenge for firms and

policymakers.
