            ALTRUSIM, RIVALRY AND CROWDING-OUT IN THE NONPROFIT FIRM'S
                SUPPLY OF CHARITY SERVICES: THE CASE OF HOSPITALS

                                     ABSTRACT




This paper extends previous research on Individuals' supply of charitable

donations to the behavior of nonprofit firms.      Specifically, we study

provision   of charity care by private, nonprofit hospitals. We demonstrate

that In the absence of large positive income effects on charity care supply,

convex preferences for the nonprofit hospital imply crowding out by other

                                                           to include patient
private or government hospitals. Extending our model

heterogeneity   and impure altruism (rivalry) provides a possible explanation

for the previously reported empirical   result that Q.th crowding out and

income effects on indigent care supply are often weak or insignificant.

Empirical   analysis of data for hospitals    in Mary1and provides strong

evidence of rivalry on the supply of outpatient plus inpatient charity care,

but not when the analysis is confined to inpatient care.

I.   Introduction

     The extent to which government      expenditure on human services      "crowds

out" private charitable activity has received considerable          attention    in the

theoretical    and empirical   literatures   (Roberts 1984, Steinberg    1987, Warr

1982, Abrams and Schmitz 1984, 1986, Arcelus and Levine 1986, Weisbrod

1988).   The point of departure for most theoretical work          is the household's


decision to make a donation to a privately owned producer of a public good

(Steinberg 1987 and Rose-Ackerman      1987).   A typical specification of the

household's    preferences assumes "altruistic" motives.      That is, the

household   is assumed   to only derive utility from the total amount of the

public good provided regardless of the source.         Empirical    studies of

crowding out have tended to obtain results that show weaker effects of

governmental   activity on the level of private production of the public good

than is predicted by models based on purely altruistic motivations.              Recent

efforts to model the crowding-out      phenomenon have therefore      focused on what

has been referred to as "impure altruism" as a characterization           of household

preferences.     Impure altruism is viewed in terms of the private benefits

obtained from donations or "the warm glow of giving"        (Andreoni 1988).       It


has also been proposed that heterogeneity        in the recipient    population may

influence the impact of public expenditures on private provision of public

                                                                the weak
goods (Weisbrod 1988, p. 106), and thereby may serve to explain
                                                            This possibility has

yet to receive formal treatment in the literature.
     Since much of the work on charitable donations has focused on

households- and the impact of government      expenditures   on household donation


decisions,    little has been written regarding the relationship between

private donors.     If,   however, one is concerned with donations     of services by

privately    owned nonprofit    firms, the possible influence of one firm's

donations    on another becomes a relevant concern.       Charitable   activities may

either be motivated by pure altruism of the firms' managers and trustees or

by the perceived advantages to be gained from doing more good than one's

competitors.     Pure altruism implies private crowding out, while competitive

concerns, referred to below as rivalry, may produce results more analogous

to impure altruism.

     In the research presented here, we model the supply of charity services

by a nonprofit firm and examine altruistic, rivairous, and crowding-out
influences    on this supply.    The specific focus for our study      is the   supply

of services by nonprofit hospitals to the poor and uninsured.            By almost any

economic measure, nonprofit hospitals are the most important type of

nonprofit    firm in our economy.     Figures presented by Weisbrod     (1988, pp.

                                       account for more than 40 per cent of
179-181) indicate that these hospitals

all employees    and more than 45 per cent of all expenses among tax-exempt

service firms     in 1977.   Moreover,   several important characteristics      of

nonprofit hospitals,      such as the importance of sales as a revenue source and

the modest role played by grants and donations,          are also shared by other


major groups of nonprofit firms such as educational institutions and nursing

and personal care facilities       (Weisbrod, 1988, p. 76).     One can hope,


therefore,     that studies of nonprofit hospital behavior generate insights of

some significance for nonprofit       firms generally.                   -

     We study the provision of charity services within several related

theoretical contexts.      First, we consider the case of pure altruism where

crowding-out    can result from charity-care      provision either by publicly-owned

hospitals or by other nonprofit       facilities.     Second, we examine the rivalry

case in which a nonprofit     hospital cares whether other nonprofits      are

providing charity services that may increase their public goodwill.1             In this

case, while crowding out can occur from government activity, the nonprofit

hospital's own charity care supply may be increased when other nonprofits

provide more charity care.        The third case we consider involves purely

altruistic motives and a heterogeneous       population    of indigent patients along

with the constraint that public hospitals predominantly serve the least

desirable    indigents.   This case formalizes      the suggested connection   (noted

above) between heterogeneity      in the populations served by nonprofit vs.

public providers    and the weak empirical    estimates of crowding out effects.

     Following    our analyses of these theoretical models, the paper reviews

evidence on the key hypotheses      reported in the literature.      We then present

an empirical    application of the model using data on hospitals from the State

of Maryland.     The concluding   section comments on directions     for future

research and implications     of our findings for policy.

II. Comoarative Statics Analysis of a Model of Provision of Indigent Care

     A.     The Basic Model

     Our point of departure       is a price-taking private nonprofit hospital

operating    in a market with other private as well as public hospitals.

Hospitals may be viewed as price-takers       if their rates are regulated (as



     1This is analogous to Andreoni's (1988) view of impure altruism.  The
hospital pursues self interest in making donations to alleviate the public bad.

they are in several states), if prices are set by one or two dominant

insurers,2 or if the local market in which they function is competitive.                     We

also allow for the possibility that the hospital receives a subsidy payment

from the government for providing care to the indigent based on the volume

of such care provided; we assume the per unit amount of this subsidy is

below both marginal cost and the price paid by nonindigent patients so that

the provision         of this care represents a "charitable contribution' on the

part of the hospital.

        The hospital is assumed to maximize an objective function

        (1)   U = U    (R,   N)

whose two arguments are net revenue           (R)    and the amount of need of the

indigent that is unmet (N), and where UR >0 and UN <0.                  The disutility

associated      with N indicates that nonprofit hospitals           are concerned   with a

"public bad", unmet need for hospital care.              We refer to this formulation of

the objective         function as purely altruistic      in N because the hospital       cares


only about the amount of unmet need in the community regardless of which

hospital gets          credit' for serving the indigents and thereby reducing unmet

need.

                                                   of endowment              income (E) plus

is the subsidy per indigent patient (where 0                r     P).   The hospital's    cost




     2The degree of market power possessed by apparently dominant private
insurers has been questioned in the recent literature on the ground that

       (2)   R=PQ÷rD+E      -
                                C(Q+D).
       The inclusion of net revenue as an argument in the nonprofit firm's

objective    function may seem odd in view of the non-distribution constraint

under which these firms operate.       A number of recent studies, however, point

out that "profits    earned in one activity can be spent by nonprofit firms to

pursue other objectives of the management and/or trustees (Hansmann, 1980;

James, 1983; Danzon, 1982; Clark, 1980; Pauly, 1987).          These other

objectives might include personal gain from management perks" (e.g., higher

salaries,    thicker carpets), assuring the future survival of the firm by

accumulating assets, or doing      good works" in the community.         Further

support for inclusion of R as an argument of the objective function comes

from empirical studies of nonprofit hospitals which generally report at most

only modest differences    in behavior between for-profit       and nonprofit

facilities    (Pauly, 1987; Sloan, 1988).    The foregoing suggests that as an

argument of U, R may be viewed as a composite "commodity             representing

"profits"    spent on all "goods" (as perceived by the firm's managers and/or

trustees) other than reduction of      indigent   care need   (N).   While acquiring

these other "goods" may entail expenses on the part of the firm, such

expenses are not included in C(Q+0).3

       The level of unmet need   (N)   is equal to the total    community   indigent
care   need (T) minus the levels of indigent care provided by various types of

hospitals.     Letting D, H and C respectively denote the number of indigent

persons served by the hospital in question, other private hospitals and


     3The reader should note that some models of nonprofit behavior do not
include R in the objective function. A re-forumlation of our analysis to
incorporate this view is presented in Section II.E below.

We assume that the hospital can sell                       as   much Q as it chooses at the fixed

        P.    We further assume excess demand for                        D, and     we employ the Cournot

assumption that the hospital ignores any impact of its own supply of
                                            other nonprofit

The hospital is assumed to choose the levels of Q and U so as to maximize

its objective function.                  Substituting equations             (3)   and (2) into (1) allows

us to rewrite the objective                   function as:

                                                   -

     The hospital's choice problem can also be depicted as a constrained

maximization involving the choice of R and N.                              The equilibrium solution for

this problem is illustrated in Figure 1.                              One hospital indifference curve is

this maximum is P                                        which may be solved for the optimal             level

      Returning to the previous formulation of choosing Q and D, we note

Inequality     (6)     follows from the convexity of the indifference curves of

U(R,N) and first order condition           (4)   above.   It would also be implied by the

more restrictive assumptions that U(R,N) is strongly separable (i.e., UNR =

0)   and that URR and UNN<O.

      The hospital's optimum tangency point, in Figure 1, will depend on the

value of the exogenous         variables   P, r, E, T, H and G;     as the values of these

variables     change, the position of 00 will shift.             (This would also be the

case for exogenous changes in input prices that would appear in a fully-

specified cost function).           Our main interest is in the effects of changes in

the exogenous variables on the optimal level of 0, the supply of care to the

indigent by the hospital.           Expressions for these effects derived by

differentiation         of the first order conditions      (4)   and (5) are shown    in

Table   1.


        Equation (7) shows the pure income effect while equations             (8)    and (9)

are directly analogous to Slutsky consumer demand equations.                 In each case

the first term on the right hand side is an income effect, while the second

is a substitution         effect.   The latter is positive in equation       (8)    and

                                                                        of

substitution effects are the same, note that the income effect is presumably

                                        much larger than 0.                 Hence, if the

      Equation (10) allows us to-examine the conditions               under which


government    care 'crowds-out             private indigent care.   Assuming strong

separability (IJRN=O) and UNN<O will guarantee crowding-out (i.e.:, dO/dG<0).

In the absence of these restrictions on U, we can still use inequality                 (6)


to derive the following relationship between the crowding out and income

effects:

depend upon the level of         H.        This can be incorporated in our model by

                                                          which measures the
introducing a third argument into the utility function 1,

hospital's performance         in supplying charity care relative to its rivals.


Formally,     we expand the utility function in (1') to                                 -

The     numerator of the first fraction is the numerator            for dD/dG (and dD/dH)

in (10) above.       The second fraction cannot be signed in the general case;

however,     assuming UZZ<O and non-negative        cross-partials    of U implies that

the second term is positive provided that (ZH+ZD)O and                Z00.    This would

be so for the simple case where Z=(D-H).                This case, at least, provides an

example of how adding a          rivalry motivation       can increase dD/dH and thus

diminish the extent of private crowding-out.

        C.   Crowding-Out     and Heterogeneous     Patients

        We now relax the assumption of indigent patient homogeneity by allowing

for two types of patients that differ in the cost of treatment.                We redefine

the population of medically indigent as:

        (12) 1     T1 + 12

where T1 are the more desirable (less costly) indigent patients, and T2 are

the less desirable (more costly) indigent patients.                It is further assumed

that public hospitals         serve only the least desirable       indigents but that not

all such patients are served by the public hospitals               (i.e., G<T2).   We can

therefore define the probability that an indigent patient seeking care from

a nonprofit hospital will be from the undesirable (T2) group as


                                                    9
       (13) d         (T2
                             -
                                 G)/[T1       + T2 -         G].
This probability depends upon the quantity of medically indigent services

provided by public providers (G).

      This formulation is consistent with the observed role of public

hospitals      as a provider of last resort to the most disadvantaged                           population

groups.       It suggests that one way in which public hospitals                           affect

nonprofits' willingness             to supply indigent care is by reducing the latter's

cost for serving indigents.                       We represent this formally by rewriting the

cost function as:

       (14)     C = C[Q, D, d(G)].

Using this cost function to obtain CQ and CD in the first order conditions

(4)   and (5), we derive the following expression for the displacement of the

equilibrium       value of D as G changes:

       (15) dD*/dG = URCQQURN[CD

      To examine the impact on crowding out of introducing patient

heterogeneity,        we rewrite (15)               as:


       (15') dD*/dG — dD/dG                   CG(dD/dE) + UR2(CQGCQD-CQQCDG)/!JI.
                                          -



Equation      (15')   states that dD*/dG consists of the original expression for

dD/dG in equation (10) minus the product of CG and the income effect (dD/dE)

plus the expression UR2(CQGCQD
                               -                                          We know that dD/dG<O (unless

                                                                     10
will be negative since equation      (13)   shows that d decreases when G

increases.    Thus the second term in (15') will be positive.             The third term

will be positive if the following condition          holds:


     (16) (CQG/CDG) > (CQQ/CDQ).

This states that the impact of a change in G on the ratio of the marginal

costs of Q and D has to be greater than that resulting from a change in Q.

This is certainly plausible     since an increase in G is assumed to have          a



direct and negative    impact on the costliness       of indigent patients which

should increase CQ relative to CD.          If inequality     (16) is assumed to hold

then both the second and third terms of (15') will be positive; in this

case, we can say unambiguously     that introducing indigent patient

heterogeneity    diminishes   crowding out.

0. Alternative Assumptions      ReQardinQ Determination       of 0

     Thus far we have assumed that P is exogenous to the hospital and that

the hospital may choose a utility-maximizing          level of Q.      These assumptions

are consistent with competitive market conditions             or with the situation of a

regulated    firm facing excess demand.       Since the number of firms in many

local hospital markets is very small, and since the rate of capacity

utilization     of nonprofit hospitals has dropped markedly in the last several

                              of our model to apply to circumstances          other than
years, the reformulation

                                                                     We have examined the
perfect competition or excess demand is of interest.4

properties of our model (maintaining         the assumption     of exogenous P) under

two alternative assumptions about demand conditions:             (1) that Q is


     4The equivalent of an excess demand situation would also arise if the
hospital (and its medical staff) could "create demand" costlessly by
                                                that they be admitted for
recommending to additional prospective patients
treatment.  We do not regard such an extreme assumption about malleability
of consumer demands as plausible.

                                                11
determined   exogenously and (2) that the hospital influences the demand for

its services by non-price competition.     Exogenous determination      of Q (as

well as P) corresponds to the situation of a regulated utility that provides

service to all who request it.     Models with exogenous    P and endogenous

determination of Q based on non-price competition have previously been

applied to regulated    industries with multiple sellers such as airlines

(White, 1972; Douglas and Miller,    1974) and hospitals (Allen and Gertler

1987).

     With exogenous Q, the hospital's only remaining choice variable is D

and the only relevant first-order condition       is equation   (4).   Inequalities

(6), (11) and equation (10) are unchanged, however, so our previous analysis

of crowding out and rivalry still applies.        The analysis of indigent patient

heterogeneity   is modified slightly;   in equation (15') the third term on the

                                                                       and
right side becomes URCDG/UDD, which is clearly positive since both CDG

UDD are negative.    Thus, the dilution of crowding out caused by indigent

patient heterogeneity    is also unambiguous    in this model.5

     Non-price competition    can be introduced    into the model by letting Q be

a function of service "quality'    (q), rewriting    the cost function as


C(Q+D,q),    and assuming that the hospital maximizes U(R,N) by choosing

optimal values of q and 0.     In this case, concavity of the 00 locus requires

that Mq<O (where M is defined as the marginal net revenue of q, that is,

                             statics results with respect to crowding out
[PQq.CQQqCq]). Comparative
and rivalry in inequality (11) and equation (10') still hold as stated.

Again the analysis of indigent patient heterogeneity       changes slightly; the


     5Another comparative statics result which changes when Q is exogenous
is equation (9).  With no substitution possible, dD/dP becomes a pure income
effect.

numerator    of the third term on the right side of equation (15') becomes

                                            so inequality   (16) becomes
UR2[(CQGQq+CqG) (CQDQq+CqD) MqCDGI

(16') [(CQGQq+CqG)/CDG]>[Mq/(CQDQq#CqD)1.

This holds when the impact of a change in G on the ratio of marginal costs

of q and D is greater than the impact of a change in q on the ratio of the

marginal    revenue of q to the marginal cost of D.6

E.   Behavior with A Break-Even Constraint

      An alternative approach to modelling the behavior of nonprofit firms

which is    comon     in the literature     is   to assume utility maximization subject

to a maximum loss, maximum profit, or break-even constraint (e.g., Rose-

Ackerman,    1987).     In the literature on nonprofit       hospitals,    this concept was

articulated    by several writers in the mid-1960's          (Klarman, 1965, p.121; Long

and Feldstein,       1967; Reder, 1965) and a formal model was first presented         by

Rice (1966).        Proposed arguments of the hospital's       utility function have

included output (Long, 1964; Rice, 1966; Clark, 1980), weighted output

(Reder, 1965) and both output and quality (Newhouse, 1970; Feldstein,

1971) .'

       To examine     the   applicability   of our own results to this type of model,

we replaced U(R,N) with U(Q,N) and imposed the constraint that R0.

Comparative     statics analysis yielded conclusions with respect to crowding

out and rivalry that again were identical to those stated in (11) and (10')

above.      In the case of patient heterogeneity,         the numerator of the third


     6Note that Slutsky expressions for dD/dP and dD/dr are obtained in this
case; unlike equations (8) and (9), however, the two substitution effects
are not exactly equal in magnitude.

     7An excellent recent review of the literature on hospital behavioral
models is given in Rosko and Broyles (1988, Chapter 4).


                                                    13
term on the right side of (15') will be positive when (r-CD)/(P-CQ)

<
    C/Cq.      The left side of the inequality       is the ratio of the (negative)

net revenues    for an additional    indigent patient versus an additional         paying

patient.     This will presumably    exceed 1.0 since r<P; it may, however, still

be less than the ratio on the right side if an increase in G has only avery

small    (negative) effect on the marginal cost of paying patients.         Moreover,

since the second term on the right side of (15') will be positive as long as

dD/dE is positive, the possibility that patient heterogeneity will dilute an

otherwise    negative crowding out effect is still present in the break-even

model 8

III.     Evidence to Date on Key Hyootheses

        While no previous empirical    studies have directly tested the model set

forth above, two recent studies present results which are related to the

propositions    put forth in our theoretical discussion.        Thorpe and Phelps

(1988) use data from private nonprofit hospitals          in the State of New York to

estimate the impact of a program to subsidize provision of indigent care by

hospitals.     Using audited financial statements of hospitals         for the years

1981 to 1984 as well as county population          characteristics   and county

hospital    market structure   information, they estimate the subsidy price

impact on the volume of uncompensated       care supplied    (dD/dr above) and the

income effect (dD/dE above)      .   The results show a positive and significant

subsidy price elasticity of 0.17 while their estimated          income effect was not


significantly    different   from zero.   Coefficient estimates      for several

additional    variables   used by Thorpe and Phelps may be related to crowding




        8With this model, the substitution term in dO/dr is equal to
    -(P-CQ)/(r-CO) times the substitution term in dD/dP.

                                              14
out phenomena.     The share of total hospital discharges in the county that

are accounted    for by public hospitals yielded a negative coefficient

(suggesting crowding out by public hospitals)         but its significance   level

varied somewhat with the estimation technique         employed.   A market stucture

variable    (the county-level   Herfindahl   index based on numbers of hospital

discharges) yielded a positive coefficient with significance           levels again

varying by estimation method.       This result could be interpreted as providing

indirect support for private crowding out since it is not based on a measure

of the actual levels of charity care.

     Sloan, Morrissey    and Valvona (1988) analyzed the volume of "self-pay'

patients served by hospitals in selected years between 1980 and 1985.

Explanatory variables    in their regression models included hospital

characteristics    (e.g. ownership and teaching status) and county

characteristics    (employment, Medicaid enrollment, and hospital market

structure).     The models that were estimated,      using the hospital as the unit

of analysis, provide some evidence relating to public and private crowding-

out effects    (dD/dG and dD/dH).    The authors reported a significantly

negative coefficient    for a binary variable indicating the presence of an

"other public hospital"    in the county.       In contrast,   a binary variable

indicating that a hospital was the "only hospital         in a county" showed no


significant    effect on the percentage      of self-pay discharges, although its

estimated    coefficient was positive.       These results provide some support for

the existence of public hospital crowding-out         but not for the existence      of

either private crowding out or rivalry.

IV.   Emøirical   Application

      A. Methods

      To illustrate the empirical application of our model, we present an

analysis of annual data for 40 voluntary general acute care hospitals           in

Maryland spanning the years 1980     -   1984.     Regression   analyses were carried

out with two different dependent     variables:     the number of equivalent

admissions   accounted   for by uncompensated     care in the hospital   (UCEQUA) and

the number of discharges of inpatients classified         at admission as either

self-pay or charity cases (SPCDIS).       The first of these variables was

calculated   by dividing the dollar amount of uncompensated care by the

hospital's   gross inpatient revenue per admission.        Note that it includes

both inpatient and outpatient services.          Recent data from New York (Thorpe,

1987) and New Jersey (State of New Jersey, 1988) show that outpatient

services account for about one-third      of all uncompensated care dollars.°


     91n the hospital field, private nonprofit institutions are referred to
as 'voluntary.'  The classification of hospitals as voluntary was based on
information published by the American Hospital Association in its annual
Guide to the Health Care Field. Some general acute care hospitals
classified as voluntary during at least one year of the study period were
excluded from our study sample because they were major teaching hospitals
(Johns Hopkins, Francis Scott Key, and University of Maryland) or because
they were newly opened or changed ownership status to voluntary during the
period (Shady Grove Adventist, Memorial of Cumberland, Wyman Park, Greater
Laurel, Prince Georges).

      10
         Uncompensated care expenses include both bad debts and charity care
expenses.   Distinctions between bad debts and charity care, however, are
difficult to draw.    In deciding to provide services to uninsured
individuals, hospitals presumably realize there is a high probability these
individuals will not be able to pay their bills. Once the services are
rendered, hospitals vary in the extent to which they seek payment from these
persons.   Thus, hospital billing policies may tend to determine the shares
of bad debt and charity care in total uncompensated care, while their
policies about rendering care are more important determinants of the total
amount of uncompensated care. Since our model focuses on decisions to
render care rather than billing policies, the distinction between bad debt
and charity care is not used.

                                             16
The second dependent    variable only pertains to inpatients.           It probably

overstates somewhat the number of inpatients who are uninsured            since some of

these patients will qualify for Medicaid eligibility after they have been

admitted.

     To measure crowding out and rivalry effects, we constructed explanatory

variables, analogous    to our dependent variables, which measured the

provision    of uncompensated    care in the same county by (1) other voluntary

hospitals    (OVUCEQUA, OVSPCDIS),     (2) for-profit   hospitals   (FPUCEQUA,

FPSPCDIS),    and (3) public hospitals     (PUBUCEQUA, PUBSPCDIS).11      We

differentiatedby ownership to allow for the possibility that voluntary

hospitals    react differently    to charity-care-supply    decisions   of their

voluntary vs. for-profit vs. public competitors.           Our ability to detect such

differences    in reactions     is limited by our data however.     Only three of the

21 counties    in which hospitals were located in fact had any public hospital




     111n computing values for these variables, note that the county totals
included equivalent admissions and discharges for the excluded hospitals
listed in footnote 9 above. Also note that the Baltimore City voluntary
hospital totals included data for the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, the
Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services, the University of
Maryland Cancer Center, and three other specialty hospitals (Children's,
Kernan, and Mount Washington).    Figures for Prince Georges General and
Greater Laurel were included in the public hospital totals for Prince
Georges County for all years, even though these hospitals were classified by
the American Hospital Association as voluntary in 1983 and 1984, because the
county government directly controlled the boards of these facilities.
     One might argue that OVUCEQUA and OVSPCDIS are not exogenous since the
influence of random disturbances on UCEQUA and SPCDIS will induce reactions
in other hospitals and thereby influence OVUCEQUA and OVSPCDIS.    The
frequency distribution of hospitals by county, however, leads us to expect
that the extent of any resulting simultaneity bias is fairly small. More
                                                                         in
specifically, note that sixteen hospitals had no other study hospital
their counties, only four hospitals had one other study hospital in their
                                                                       other
county, and the remaining twenty study hospitals had at least three
study hospitals  in their county.


                                               27
beds and only two counties had any for-profit hospital beds.'2           Since the

precision   of the coefficient estimates for the public and for-profit

charity-care-supply      variables   was expected to be low, we also estimated

regressions    in which a single set of charity-care-supply       variables

(aggregated across ownership categories) was included (ALLUCEQUA and

ALLSPCDIS).     In addition, some regressions were run with a dummy variab]e

indicating that a hospital was the only one in its county (ONLYHOS).

     Three variables were included as proxies for the level of need (T):

the estimated number of persons with no public or private health insurance

coverage (NOINS),13 the number of births to residents of the county

(RBIRTHS), and the number of deaths in the county due to external causes

(accidents, homicide, etc.)      (EXDEAD).    The rationale for including RBIRTHS

and EXDEAD is that obstetrical deliveries          and accident cases account for a

very large fraction of inpatient admissions of self-pay and charity cases;

one recent estimate puts this fraction at about one half (Sloan, Valvona,

and Muliner,    1986).    The applicability   of this fact to Maryland may be

questioned,    however, on several grounds.        First, Maryland law mandates


     12The counties with public beds were Prince Georges, Allegany (in 1980
and 1981), and Baltimore City. Harford and Prince Georges were the only
counties with for-profit hospital beds.

     13To compute NOINS, we first subtracted the number of persons over 65
and the number of under-65 SSI, AFDC, and general assistance recipients in
the county from the total population on the assumption that these persons
were virtually all covered by Medicare or Medicaid.    For Baltimore City, we
then used data from the 1980, 1982, and 1984 Health Interview Surveys to
estimate the number of persons under 65 with private health insurance
coverage.   (Interpolation was used for 1981 and 1983.)   Subtracting this
figure from the result of our first step yielded the value of NOINS in each
study year.   For other counties, the number of persons under 65 with private
insurance was estimated based on insurance coverage regressions run on the
Health Interview Survey data.    (Details of these regression calculations are
available from the authors.)

used: median household     income in the county (HHINC) and net non-operating

income of the hospital     (NNINC).    The price paid by paying patients (P) was

measured by gross patient revenue per equivalent admission (GPREQUA); note

that this slightly overstates     the average price figure since some patients

(such as those covered by Blue Cross insurance)         receive discounts.    The

the Maryland rate-setting system, full rate reviews were conducted during

the latter half of the 1970's and hospitals' actual bad debt and charity

costs were included in the resulting rate computations.           Once the rates were

                                                                    further
set, however, they were simply trended forward for inflation and no

recomputation    based on hospitals'    actual charity and bad debt experience

took place in most instances.         In the latter part of our study period,       a
small number of hospitals     petitioned   for special rate increases     as their bad

                                                                       these
debt and charity costs grew but there was no formal policy of granting

requests.     Thus, as a first approximation       for our study period, it seems

reasonable to view the hospitals as bearing the full costs of any indigent

care which they rendered.      In general, these costs could not be passed

           in the form of higher rates allowed by the rate-setting        commission

(Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission, 1984).

     To control for variations       in cost conditions     among hospitals, we

include the hospital's       average wage plus fringe benefit cost per hour for

general duty nurses (RNCOST).        For several reasons, we also included the

number of beds (BEDS) in the hospital as an explanatory variable.            First,

the size of the hospital presumably affects the shape of C( ); at any given

level of output, the rate of increase of marginal           cost is presumably    lower

for hospitals with a larger capital stock (as proxied by the number of

beds).   Second, one might argue that bed size affects the hospital's

preferences;    for example,    larger hospitals may be more visible     in the

community    and therefore    may feel more of a responsibility     to concern

themselves with reducing N.        To allow for differences in preferences of

teaching and non-teaching       hospitals, we included a teaching dummy (TEACH) to

denote the hospitals that operated one or more residency programs approved

by the American Medical Association.        Finally, to allow for other changes

over time not captured by our explanatory variables (e.g., increases in the

deductible    and coinsurance liabilities of insured persons), we included

either a time trend (TIME) or separate intercepts for each of the study

years.

    Regression models were estimated with the Fuller-Battese           (1974) variance

components    procedure   and with ordinary least-squares      (OLS) including

individual    hospital intercepts.     The latter   is   less efficient (in that no

information from cross-sectional       variation is used in estimating slope

coefficients)    but it is also less subject to omitted-variables        bias.    All

continuous dependent and most explanatory variables were included in the

regressions    in logarithmic form. Since the charity-care-supply        variables      and


                                             20
NNINC take on zero values in some cases, they were entered in linear form.

     B. Results

     Regression results for uncompensated care equivalent admissions are
                                            -
shown in Table 2.       Regressions     1       4, 6, and 7 include TIME while Regression

8 includes individual year dummies.               Regressions 3 and 7 are OLS variants of

Regressions    2 and 6 respectively.

     Several features of these results are quite stable across a variety of

specifications    and our two different           estimation methods.     First, the

coefficient    of the variable describing uncorupensated care volume at other

voluntary   hospitals     (OVUCEQUA)    is strongly positive,        suggesting   that rivalry

effects dominate crowding-out          effects.      Evaluated    at the mean value for

OVLJCEQUA of 3,850, the coefficient values imply an increase of about 0.25

equivalent admissions       for every additional admission           in another voluntary

hospital.     Coefficients    for the for-profit and public hospitals do not

support either crowding-out       or rivalry effects.            Aggregation across

ownership   types (in Regressions 6 and 7) yields a somewhat smaller but still

highly significant positive coefficient for ALLUCEQIJA. On the other hand,

the coefficient       of the dummy for the only hospital in the county (ONLYHOS)

does provide weak support for the crowding out notion.                  The coefficient   (in

Regression 4)    is   positive and implies that uricompensated care equivalent

admissions are roughly 30 per cent higher when no other hospitals                   are

located in the county, but this effect is not significant                 at conventional

levels.

     Results for the price variable              (GPREQUA) are consistent with the

existence   of a strong substitution effect and a relatively weak income

effect; as noted above, Thorpe and Phelps (1988) reported similar results.


                                                    21
On the other hand, more direct evidence on the income effect is

contradictory.     While NNINC is clearly not significant, the results for

HHINC suggest a fairly strong positive income effect; but this would also

imply a significantly    negative coefficient for the wage variable (RNCOST)

when, in fact, this variable's     coefficient   is insignificantly   positive.    The

variables   intended to proxy for the level of total indigent care need

(RBIRTHS, EXDEAD, and NOINS) would be expected to have positive coefficients

based on our theoretical model.      In fact, only the EXDEAD coefficient     is

occasionally (and weakly) positive; the reasons for the significantly

negative coefficients for RBIRTHS are not clear but the mandated benefits

and Medicaid eligibility     rules noted above may be relevant to this finding.

     Coefficients     for BEDS (particularly in the variance-components

regressions)     imply that a hospital's supply of indigent care increases

roughly in proportion to its bed size.      On the other hand, the presence of a

teaching program tends to reduce the hospital's       indigent care supply.       (Bear

in mind though that three major teaching hospitals were excluded from the

study sample.)

     Results obtained when our measure of indigent care supply includes only

inpatient services     (SPCDIS) are shown in Table 3. These results do not show

that rivalry effects outweigh crowding-out.14        The supply of indigent care

by other voluntary hospitals tends to reduce the individual hospital's

supply though the magnitude of the effect is small and its significance



     14Values of SPCDIS were missing for four data points (Provident
Hospital in 1980, Church Hospital in 1983, and Suburban Hospital in 1982 and
1983). The effects of these missing values on our coefficient estimates
were eliminated by including dummies for each of these four data points.
Estimated values of SPCDIS were also computed for these data points in order
to compute the corresponding values of OVSPCDIS.

and public hospital variables are again insignificant,        though this may be

                                          above.                        across

out effects.     Deletion of the TIME trend and use of OLS with individual

again suggest a strong substitution       effect and a weak income effect.

significant at conventional     levels.

     To examine further the implications of our results, we used them to

simulate the effects of changes in hospital market structure on the total

was a county with two 300-bed voluntary hospitals.          Each hospital provided

                                                                                   and
1000 equivalent admissions of charity care and reported 750 uninsured
                                                                           of the
charity discharges per year.       (These values are roughly in the middle


                                              23
range of observed values for our study hospitals.)         We then simulated the

change in total equivalent charity admissions and uninsured and charity

discharges    for the county when the 300 bed hospitals were subdivided       first

into four identical    150-bed hospitals and then into six identical 100-bed

hospitals.    We simulated Cournot equilibrium outcomes using (for simplicity)

a BEDS elasticity of charity care supply equal to 1.0.         The UCEQUA

simulations    used the coefficient   in Table   2 for OVUCEQUA from Regression      1


and the SPCDIS simulations    used the analogous coefficient     from Table   315
     Results of the simulation    are shown in Table 4.      For equivalent charity

care admissions, the change from two to four hospitals results in a 4.2 per

cent increase in total community supply while the change from four to six

yields an additional 1.3 per cent increase.        For inpatient discharges, where

the sign of the SPCDIS coefficient     implies crowding out, going from two to

four hospitals reduces community supply by only 2.1 per cent while going

from four to six implies a further reduction of 1.1 per cent.

     C.   Discussion

     Results for the only hospital dummy suggest some crowding-out          as new

hospitals enter a county but at the margin results of the UCEQUA regressions

suggest that rivalry dominates    crowding out effects.     On the other hand,

when our dependent variable includes only inpatient indigent care supply



     '5me following computational method wa used in the simulations.
Using the OVUCEQUA coefficient of 7.3307x10 from Regression 1 of Table 2,
along with an assumed coefficient for the log of beds of 1.0 and the assumed
initial values of 1000, 1000 and 300 for UCEQUA, OVUCEQUA and BEDS
respectively, we solved for the value of Z from the Cournot equilibrium
equation in UCEQUA Z + in(600/n) + (n-1)UCEQUAx7.3307x105,where n (the
number of hospitals in the county) had an initial value of two. Then, using
this value of Z and the Cournot equilibrium equation, we solved for UCEQUA
when n took on values of four and six. The identical method was used for
the SPCDIS simulation.

(SPCDIS), small crowding-out    effects are obtained which are somewhat

sensitive   to estimation method.    We speculate that hospitals may behave

differently   in supplying   inpatient versus outpatient   indigent care since the

latter may be more visible to the community at large and thus more likely to

generate a rivairous response.       Of course, this is merely speculation and

further empirical   investigations   are clearly in order.

     Because of its potential     policy importance in assessing crowding out

and rivalry effects, as well as changes in hospital market structure,          and

because of its relevance     for understanding   nonprofit hospital behavior,     a


more detailed examination of the only-hospital effect is clearly in order.

This sort of discontinuity     in behavior does not flow from the

straightforward   models of altruism and rivalry-we have explored thus far.

One could conjecture that charity care supplied by only hospitals        is highly

visible and reflects a response to clear public pressures while        'shirking'

of the hospital's "duty" becomes feasible with more than one hospital

Verification of this conjecture will require additional empirical probing.

V. Summary and Concluding Remarks

     This paper has extended previous research on the individual's supply of

charitable donations   to the case of nonprofit firms.       The specific case we


study is the provision   of care by hospitals to the medically indigent.

Using several different formulations      of our theoretical model, we

demonstrate   that in the absence of very large and positive income effects on

                                         for the nonprofit
indigent care supply, convex preferences                          hospital    imply

crowding out by government hospitals.       Extending our model to include

patient heterogeneity and impure altruism (rivalry) provides a possible

explanation for the previously reported empirical result that        gfl     crowding

                                                                                      -

                                            25
out and income effects on indigent care supply are often weak or

insignificant.

     Our own empirical    analysis of indigent care supply (including both

inpatient and outpatient    services) provides direct support for the rivalry

hypothesis    based on our finding of a significantly       positive effect, on the

nonprofit hospital's    supply, of the supply of such care by other nonprofit

hospitals    in the local area.    One important policy implication of this

result concerns the assessment of varying market structures.           In the

presence of rivalry,    increased numbers of suppliers       leads to a larger total

community    supply of indigent care services; conversely, mergers of nonprofit

hospitals    imply reductions    in indigent care supply.     On the other hand, when

our indigent care supply measure pertains only to inpatient services,           the

rivalryhypothesis is not supported.         Further investigation is needed to

verify and understand    this apparent difference in hospital behavior with

regard to supplying    inpatient versus outpatient    indigent care.     Furthermore,

our results for hospitals       that are the sole provider in a county also point

to a possible predominance of crowding out over rivalry effects

(particularly    in supplying    inpatient care to indigents) when an additional

hospital enters the market.       From a theoretical perspective, and in the

context of policy assessment      of changing market structures, further

exploration    of this possibility seems warranted.16

     Finally,    our finding of a strong substitution effect on indigent care




     16The reader should also bear in mind that the rivalry and crowding out
results discussed here pertain to other Drivate hospitals.  Because of the
limited number of public hospitals in Maryland, our estimates of private
hospital responses to public indigent care supply very imprecise.  Further
research that is better able to distinguish between public and private
crowding out and rivalry is clearly needed.

                                             26
supply is also of policy interest.      It suggests that reductions     in the

prices paid to hospitals     on behalf of paying patients would increase the

supply of indigent care.      Several states (Florida and South Carolina)        have

implemented    indigent care subsidy programs that are financed by taxes on

hospital    revenues.   Our results suggest that this policy will have a large

impact on indigent care supply both by increasing the subsidy payment (r)

and by reducing the after-tax price received by the hospitals        from paying

patients.     Thus, financing of additional    subsidies via taxes   (and reductions

in after-tax prices) may increase the supply of indigent care without

greatly increasing total funds flowing into the hospital sector.

     Data for calculating values of the variables UCEQUA, OVUCEQUA,

FPUCEQUA,    PUBUCEQUA, ALLUCEQUA,   GPREQUA, and NNINC were taken primarily from

the annual reports entitled Disclosure of Hosøital Financial and Statistical

Qj.j published by the Maryland Health Services Cost Review Commission

(HSCRC).     In several instances where data on numbers of equivalent

admissions   were missing (for either study hospitals or other hospitals

located in the same county as a study hospital),          estimates were developed

from data published      by the American Hospital Association     (AHA) and by the

Maryland Hospital Association.       Data for computing values of SPCDIS,

OVSPCDIS,    FPSPCDIS,   PUBSPCDIS, and ALLSPCDIS were extracted     from the

hospital discharge abstract tapes submitted to the HSCRC by each hospital.

Note that these data pertain to calendar years whereas the financial

disclosure data are based on each hospital's fiscal year.          Values of HHINC

were taken from Sales and Marketing Management.           RNCOST is reported in

annual wage surveys conducted by the HSCRC.         RBIRTHS and EXDEAD were

extracted    from the Area Resources File distributed by the U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services.       NOINS values were synthetic estimates based on

insurance coverage regressions developed from Health Interview Survey data

for 1980, 1982 and 1984.       (Estimates for Baltimore City were taken directly

from the survey data.)       Data on BEDS and TEACH were taken from the Guide to

the Health Care Field published      annually by the AHA.
