New Evidence on Sex Segregation and Sex Differences

                                            ABSTRACT

     We assemble a new matched employer-employee data set covering essentially all industries and
occupations across all regions of the U.S. We use this data set to re-examine the question of the
relative contributions to the overall sex gap in wages of sex segregation vs. wage differences by sex
within occupation, industry, establishment, and occupation-establishment cells. This new data set is
especially useful because earlier research on this topic relied on data sets that covered only a narrow
range of industries, occupations, or regions. Our results indicate that a sizable fraction of the sex gap
in wages is accounted for by the segregation of women into lower-paying occupations, industries,
establishments, and occupations within establishments. Nonetheless, a substantial part of the sex gap
in wages remains attributable to the individual's sex. This latter finding contrasts sharply with the
conclusions of previous research (especially Groshen, 1991), which indicated that sex segregation
accounted for essentially all of the sex wage gap. Further research into the sources of within-
establishment within-occupation sex wage differences is therefore much more important than
previously thought.

I. Introduction

       Women have consistently earned lower wages than men in U.S. labor markets, although

this gap has narrowed in recent decades (Blau, 1998). Understanding the sources of sex

differences in wages is vital to determining why the wage gap between men and women persists.

Previous research has focused on the effect of the occupational segregation of men and women on

the wage gap (e.g. Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995), the effect of industry segregation (e.g. Fields

and Wolff, 1995), and to a lesser extent on the segregation of men and women into different

employers (Blau, 1977; Bielby and Baron, 1984; Carrington and Troske, 1998).' These studies all

find evidence that the wage gap falls considerably once one accounts for segregation.

       Evidence on the contribution to the wage gap of within-establishment within-occupation

segregation is far harder to find. Indeed, we are not aware of any empirical work on this issue that

uses large data sets representative of a wide array of industries. The reason for this is the paucity

of data sets containing detailed demographic information for multiple workers in the same

establishment. As a result, studies of the effects of establishment and occupation-establishment

segregation have used unusual, somewhat narrow data sets. The most complete study of which we

are aware is Groshen (1991). She uses various Industry Wage Surveys (IWS) conducted between

1974 and 1983 to estimate the proportions of the sex difference in wages attributable to the percent

female in the occupation, the establishment, and the job-cell (i.e., within occupations within

establishments), in five specific industries (Miscellaneous Plastic Products, Nonelectrical

Machinery, Life Insurance, Banking, and Computer and Data Processing).2 She finds that the


        'Blau also documents the role of segregation by industry.

        2The IWS originally covered 70 industries, but Groshen reports results only for these five. These
surveys have been discontinued. Her work builds on Blau's (1977), but provides a more complete
decomposition of the sex gap in wages, including evidence on the importance of an individual's sex
segregation of women into lower-paying occupations within employers also contributes to the

wage gap. Groshen finds little remaining wage gap between men and women once she accounts

for the relationship between wages and the percent female within establishments, occupations, and

establishment-occupation cells.3 Groshen concludes, then, that pay differences between men and

women cannot be a result of wage discrimination by employers of the type that violates the Equal

Pay Act.

       Groshen's results suggest that understanding the persistence of the sex wage gap amounts

to understanding the forces that lead to sex segregation in the workforce. Such forces could range

from employer discrimination in hiring and promotion to different preferences across the sexes for

the non-pecuniary benefits ofdifferentjobs. Groshen is well aware of the possible limited

representativeness of her data, however, noting that, "although theoretically ideal, study of a full

national cross-section of industries is impossible because of the lack of appropriate data" (p. 460).

        In this paper we construct and use an extended version of the Worker-Establishment

Characteristics Database (WECD) to decompose the source of male/female wage differentials.4

Like the WECD, this data set matches workers who responded to the long form of the 1990

Decennial Census to the establishments where they work, using the U.S. Census Bureau's Standard

Statistical Establishment List (SSEL). However, whereas the WECD is limited to manufacturing

plants, this new data set (the New Worker-Establishment Characteristics Database, or NWECD)



within occupation, establishment, and job cell. Blau studies BLS Area Wage Surveys conducted in 1970,
which covered clerical, professional, and technical occupations; she focuses on a subset of these
occupations in three large northeastern cities.

        3This mirrors to some extent Blau's (1977) earlier finding that "intraoccupational pay
differentials by sex are primarily the result of differences in wage-rates among firms rather than within
firms" (p. 73).

        4For a description of the original WECD, see Troske (forthcoming).

                                                      2
includes workers and establishments from all sectors of the economy. Thus, we provide new

estimates of the role of various dimensions of sex segregation in generating sex differences in

wages, based on a large data set with workers in nearly all regions, industries, and occupations.5

       Our results indicate that a sizable fraction of the sex gap in wages is accounted for by the

segregation of women into lower-paying occupations, industries, establishments, and occupations

within establishments. We also find, however, that a very substantial part of the sex gap in wages

remains attributable to the individual's sex. These findings contrast sharply with the conclusions

of previous research (especially Groshen, 1991) indicating that sex segregation accounted for

essentially all of the sex wage gap. We explore a number of possible reasons for the differences in

results. We ultimately conclude that the data we use yield different answers from the data

Groshen used, even for the same occupations and industries that she studied.

II. The Data

       The data used in this study come from a match between worker records from the 1990

Sample Detail File (SDF) to establishment records in the 1990 Standard Statistical Establishment

List (SSEL).6 The 1990 SDF consists of all household responses to the 1990 Decennial Census

long form. As part of the Decennial Census, five-sixths of all households receive a "short-form,"

which asks seven basic demographic questions about household members ("person questions") and

seven questions about the housing unit ("housing questions"). The remaining one-sixth receive a

more extensive "long-form" survey, which contains 26 additional person and 19 additional

housing questions. These questionnaires ask households to supply distinct information for each


        5Because of the matching described below, and other sample restrictions, the data set is not
nationally representative.
        6Both the SDF and the SSEL are confidential Census Bureau products, as is the NWECD that we
describe in this paper.

                                                     3
household member. Those receiving the long-form are asked to identify each employed household

member's (1) occupation, (2) employer location, and (3) employer's industry in the previous week.

The Census Bureau then assigns occupational, industrial, and geographic codes to long-form

responses. Thus, the SDF contains the standard demographic information for workers collected on

the long form of the Decennial Census, along with detailed location information and a three-digit

census industry code for each respondent's place of work.

       The SSEL is an annual list of business establishments maintained by the U.S. Census

Bureau. The SSEL contains detailed location information and a four-digit SIC code for each

establishment, along with a unique establishment identifier that is common to other Census Bureau

economic surveys and censuses. It also includes information on total payroll expenses,

employment, and whether or not the establishment is part of a multi-establishment firm.

       We matched workers and establishments using the detailed location and industry

information available in both data sets. Briefly, the first step in the matching process was to keep

only establishments unique to an industry-location cell.7 Next, all workers indicating that they

work in the same industry-location cell as a retained establishment were linked to the

establishment. The matched data set is the NWECD. Because the SDF contains only a sample of

workers, and because not all workers are matched, the matched data set includes a sample of

workers at each establishment.

       The Census Bureau organizes the United States into different geographic areas, assigning

codes to each. For the NWECD, there are five areas of interest: state, county, place, tract, and




       7We do this because we do not actually have the employer name available on both establishment
and worker records.

                                                  4
block.8 The geographic coding process works primarily as a hierarchy. The Census Bureau

assigns unique codes to every state in the country. Within states, each county is also assigned a

unique code. In addition, in areas or townships with a population of 2,500 or more, the Census

Bureau assigns a place code. Because an area or town can cross county boundaries, we can

distinguish between areas in the same place but different counties. Tract codes are unique within

counties and block codes are unique within tracts. The Census Bureau uses the same geographic

codes in both the SSEL and the Decennial Census.

       Two shortcomings of the geographic codes in the SSEL are (1) the absence of tract and

block codes before 1992, and (2) the incomplete assignment of these codes to all establishments.

To assign tract and block codes to the 1990 SSEL, we extracted each establishment's block and

tract code (when available) from the 1992 SSEL, and then matched these codes back to the 1990

SSEL. Some establishments that ceased operation between 1990 and 1992 do not appear in the

1992 SSEL, making it impossible to identify block and tract codes for these establishments. Not

all establishments had tract and block codes assigned as of 1992 due to address problems. In the

1992 SSEL, Census had assigned tract and block codes to 45% of all establishments.

        In addition to geographic codes, the Census Bureau assigns industry codes to the SDF and

the SSEL. The Census Bureau asks long-form respondents to identify their employer's industry,

which the Census Bureau codes into one of 244 Census Industry Classification (CIC) codes. Each

CIC corresponds roughly to a three-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code.9 In the




         81n some geographic areas, the Census Bureau uses Block Numbering Areas (BNAs) instead of
tracts. For our purposes, a BNA is equivalent to a tract. The Census Bureau assigns tracts and blocks in
tandem, so whenever an establishment is assigned a tract code, it is also always assigned a block code.

        9An exception is Construction. There is one CIC for Construction and this corresponds to the
equivalent of three two-digit SIC codes.

                                                    5
SSEL, the Census Bureau assigns each establishment a six-digit SIC code based on the plant's

primary economic activity. '° Since the CIC codes are more aggregated than SIC codes, we use a

concordance table to assign a CIC to each SIC in the SSEL."

          The first step in the matching process is to assign industry-location cells to all plants in the

SSEL. We divide the SSEL into plants that are unique in a state-county-place-industry (SCPI) cell

and those that are not, and retain all unique SCPI plants. In cases where there are multiple plants

in an SCPI cell, we first retain the cell only if all plants in the cell have tract and block codes. We

then keep only those plants that are unique within a state-county-place-tract-block-industry cell.

          Next, we assign workers in the SDF to industry-location cells based on information

provided in the SDF. Unlike the SSEL, the Census Bureau assigns detailed geography codes to all

observations in the SDF.'2 Once we have workers assigned to industry-location cells and have

establishments that are unique within a cell, we can match the workers to the particular

establishments where they work.

          We take a number of additional steps to improve the quality of the match. First, to ensure

that workers are matched properly to employers in the WECD, we discard all workers and

establishments from the matched sample where Census imputed either the worker's or the

establishment's industry.13 We also discard all workers from the matched sample if the worker's




        '°The last two digits of the SIC code are product codes for goods-producing industries, or type of
business codes for service establishments.

          'tA few SICs correspond to more than one CIC. We omitted establishments in these industries.

          12When long-form respondents omit geographic information, the Census Bureau imputes missing
values.

          '3This imputation occurs for plants when an incomplete SIC code (only the first two or three
digits) is provided. For such cases, the Census Bureau randomly assigns the remaining digits.

                                                      6
place-of-work code is imputed and if this imputed code is the source of the match.14

       Second, some matches lead to apparent inconsistencies, prompting us to discard matches

when the number of workers matched to an establishment exceeds the number of employed

workers as reported by the establishment in the SSEL. There are several reasons why the number

of matched workers might exceed total employment. First, there may be errors in the industry or

geographic codes for some workers or establishments in the SDF or SSEL. Second, there is a time

lag between when the Census Bureau surveys workers and employers. Census asks workers where

they worked on April 1 and employers how many workers they employed as of March 12; total

employment on April 1 may exceed total employment on March 12. A third problem is that

workers may be incorrectly assigned to locations because of imprecise SDF questions. Because

the SDF asks workers only where they worked in the past week, workers who were working at a

site other than their employer's primary location may be improperly assigned to an establishment.

Fourth, in the SSEL total employment includes only a plant's employees, not its owners. In the

SDF, however, both owners and employees are assigned to a particular establishment. Thus,

although there may be legitimate reasons for the number of matched workers to exceed reported

establishment employment, to avoid potentially incorrect matches we discard cases where this

occurs.

          In our matched sample, we also imposed some restrictions on both individuals and

establishments. We include only individuals who report usually working between 30 and 65 hours




         '4To understand the exclusion based on imputed geographic data, consider the following
example. When a worker is matched to an establishment unique in an SCPI cell, the match is based on
the state, county, place, and industry of the worker and the establishment. If the worker's block code is
imputed, then this imputed code has no bearing on the match, and we retain the match in the data.
However, if the match relies on tract and block-level information, and the worker's place-of-work block
code is imputed, then we discard the worker from the matched data set.

                                                     7
per week, and 30 or more weeks in the last year (1989). These restrictions on hours and weeks are

intended to pick out full-time, full-year workers who are less likely to have changed jobs in the

past year, as well as those whose hours are so high that they may have held multiple jobs. We

make these restrictions for three reasons. First, because the Decennial Census collects data on

earnings from all jobs, rather than wages on the current job, we need to try to eliminate variation in

wages that stems from multiple job-holding at a point in time or during the previous calendar

year.'5 Second, because the 1990 Decennial Census asks workers to report the address of the

establishment where they worked in the previous week, while the earnings data are for the

previous calendar year, job changing may lead to inaccurate measurement of earnings in the

matched data. Finally, Groshen's IWS data, with which we are trying to draw some comparisons,

cover only full-time workers. We also restrict the sample to workers aged 18 to 65, with a

constructed hourly wage ((annual earnings/weeks worked)/usual hours worked per week) in the

range $2.50 to $500, and those working in establishments in public administration (in order to

restrict our focus to the private sector).

        We also require that establishments have total employment of at least 25, for two reasons:

first, when we compared average establishment-level worker earnings in the matched observations

in the SDF with average payroll expenses in the SSEL, these corresponded much more closely for

establishments with 25 or more workers; second, the IWS industry samples included mainly

establishments with 25 or more workers, and we are interested in a comparison of our results to

Groshen's results using the IWS. In addition, to ensure that we have a reasonable basis for

estimating the characteristics of an establishment's workforce, we required that the number of


         15Multiple job holding rates are virtually identical among men and women. 1996 CPS data
 indicate rates of 6.2% for men and 6.1% for women (Stinson, 1997). Thus, although multiple job
 holding could affect our data, it is unlikely to influence the sex differences we estimate.

                                                   8
matched workers be least five percent of employment as reported in the SSEL. Finally, we

eliminated the less than .1% of establishments that reported earnings exceeding more than

$600,000 per worker.

       Table 1 documents the effects of these various matching rules and exclusion restrictions on

the sample size, the number of matched workers, and average earnings and employment calculated

from both the SSEL and SDF data. We define measures of establishment earnings per worker

from data in both the SSEL and the SDF. For the SSEL, earnings per worker is constructed as

Total Annual Payroll/Total Employment. For the SDF, establishment earnings per worker is

created by averaging the annual wages and salaries of all workers matched to the establishment.

The table shows that seven percent of establishments can be assigned to unique industry-location

cells. These establishments are nearly twice as large as those in the overall sample (with an

average of 41.17 workers, vs. 21.10 for the full SSEL sample), but have average earnings that are

lower by about $2200. This does not contrast with standard size-wage effects (Brown and Medoff,

1989), since there are no controls for industry, etc., and the ability to assign establishments to

unique industry-location cells is not random with respect to these characteristics.

        The next three rows (c-e) provide information on the observations on workers in the SDF.

Out of a total of 17,311,211 workers, we match 1.1 million, or 6.5%, to establishments, once we

discard unreliable matches or workers without earnings data. There are, of course, numerous

establishments to which no workers are matched, reflected in the decline in the number of matched

establishments from 388,787 to 201,944 based on the simple match, and 156,332 once other

restrictions are imposed. Naturally, the establishments to which workers in the SDF are matched

tend to be larger, with average employment of 83.24. The last three columns compare earnings

data. Average establishment earnings per worker reported in the SSEL are about $1200 lower than

                                                   9
the corresponding figure estimated from the SDF ($18,218 vs. $19,416); this is presumably

attributable to the fact that in the SDF individuals can report earnings from more than one job. We

also find, comparing columns (6) and (7) of row e, that average earnings per worker in the SDF

data are about $3,170 higher than average establishment earnings estimated from the same

(matched) data. These numbers can differ because the earnings per establishment figures are not

weighted by the number of matched workers in estimating average establishment earnings per

worker; thus, this result likely stems from the concentration of higher-earning workers in larger

establishments. Row f drops workers based on the restrictions on hours, weeks, age, wages, etc.,

with little impact except to drop those with lower earnings.

       The final sample is described in row g, which we obtain after dropping establishments with

fewer than 25 employees, with an insufficiently small percentage of matched employees, and with

earnings outliers. We end up with a sample of 637,718 workers matched to 32,931 establishments.

These establishments are of course much larger than those represented in the previous rows, and

have an average of 16.14 workers matched to them. We also find that among this subset of larger

establishments, average establishment earnings estimated from the SSEL and the SDF are

considerably closer ($20,983 vs. $23,328).

        Descriptive statistics for the matched sample are reported in column (1) of Table 2. The

sample is approximately 47% female and seven percent black, with an average age of 40. The

percentage ever married is 86. Because in estimating wage equations we want to account for the

possible effects of children on women's wages, in particular, we extracted from the SDF the

number of children ever born, which is only available for women, and therefore defined to be zero




                                                  10
for men.16 On average, women in the NWECD have had 1.84 children. With respect to education,

21.1% have a bachelor's degree or higher, and 50% report no college education. Column (3)

reports descriptive statistics for the entire SDF file, with the weeks and hours restrictions imposed.

Most of the demographic characteristics are quite close in the matched and full sample, with the

exception of the cumulative fertility rate (for women) in the matched sample. Geographically,

individuals living in MSA's are less likely to be in the matched sample, presumably because in

urban areas individuals are less likely to work in unique industry-location cells. Turning to

occupation, laborers are over-represented in the matched sample, and support occupations under-

represented. Similarly, the industry composition of the sample is heavily weighted toward

manufacturing, with 52% of workers in this industry, vs. 24% in the full sample, while retail is

grossly under-represented, presumably because most retail establishments are in locations in which

similar establishments are located (such as malls). In the empirical analysis, we address the

potential consequences of the over-representation of manufacturing establishments.

        The fact that the NWECD does not comprise a representative sample of U.S. workers is not

surprising given the requirements for a match, and given the size restrictions imposed on matched

establishments. For our purposes, however, the important question is whether the NWECD is not

representative in ways that will bias the wage regressions we estimate. To partially answer this

question, we report in Table 3 estimates from basic wage regressions with and without industry

and occupation controls. Columns (1) and (2) provide benchmark estimates from wage

regressions with and without industry and occupation controls, respectively, using workers from




        '61n the regression analysis that follows, this implies that we simply restrict the effect of children
ever born on men's wages to be zero.

                                                       11
the SDF.17 Not surprisingly, the results from the SDF are very similar to those from other large,

nationally representative data sets (such as the CPS). The male-female wage gap in column (1) is

23.1%, but falls to 17.4% in column (2) when we control for broad occupation and industry

categories. Similarly, the black-white wage gap is significant in both regressions, but it is smaller

in column (2). Both columns show evidence of quadratic age profiles and positive returns to

education, although the returns to education are smaller in column (2). Columns (3) and (4) of

Table 3 replicate the specifications of columns (1) and (2), respectively, but use the NWECD data.

The male-female wage gap in column (3) is 28.2%, which is slightly larger than that in the SDF

(23.1%), but the difference in the male-female wage gap between the two data sets is virtually

eliminated once we control broadly for industry and occupation (17.4% in the SDF vs. 16.6% in

the NWECD). There are some other minor differences looking across the columns of Table 3

between the two data sets, but for the most part the wage regression results from the NWECD

come close to replicating those from the SDF, particularly once controls for industry and

occupation are added. Note that in the empirical work below, we always include some sort of

controls for industry and occupation since one of our interests is in the effects of industry and

occupation segregation on male-female wage differences.

       Therefore, while the NWECD data are not representative of the underlying population of

U.S. workers, the NWECD represents a clear improvement over existing data sources used to

study the role of sex segregation along a number of dimensions in the workplace. The NWECD

covers essentially the entire array of industries, occupations, locations, etc., in the U.S. economy.

Moreover, wage regression estimates from the NWECD do not differ substantively from those


        '7Actually, because of computing constraints and the very large sample size of the SDF (1.7
million workers), the data used to construct columns (1) and (2) of Table 3 come from a random ten
percent sample of the SDF.

III. Methods

       In our initial empirical work, we assume that the wage gap between men and women is a

function of individual human capital characteristics and characteristics of the "femaleness" of

where a worker works, as represented by the percent female in a worker's occupation, industry,

establishment, and occupation within an establishment (job cell). That is, we estimate wage

regressions of the following form:

(1)    ln(wpojej)
                     = a + I3F + yOCC%F0 + ÔIND%FJ + XEST%Fe + OJOB%FJ + Xpoiej + Eijkmn,

where w is the log hourly wage, F is a dummy variable equal to one if individual p is female,

OCC%F is the percent female in occupation o, IND%F the percent female in industry i, EST%F

the percent female in establishment e, and JOB%F the percent female in job cell j. A vector of

control variables is represented by X.

       With the estimated coefficients of equation (1) in hand, we can construct standard wage

decompositions that decompose the difference in average log wages between women and men

(denoted w and wm') as follows:

(2) w -        Wm'
                     =   13' +   (' (OCC%Ff - OCC%Fm) + ô'(IND%Ff - IND%Fm) + ).'(EST%Ff - EST%F,,)

                     + O'(JOB%Ff - JOB%Fm) + (Xf - Xm)1'

where primes on the coefficients indicate estimates, and 'f and 'm' subscripts on the variables

indicate means for women and men, respectively. This decomposition gives us the proportion of

the wage gap due to individual sex differences in wages for workers in the same job cell (3'), and

due to segregation of women into lower-wage occupations (y'[OCC%Ff - OCC%Fm]), industries

(ô'[IIND%Ff IND%Fm]), establishments (A'[EST%Ff- EST%Fm]), and job cells (O'[JOB%Ff -

JOB%Fm]), and differences in other observable characteristics. These decompositions can


                                                         13
therefore be thought of as traditional Oaxaca (1973) decompositions, imposing the restriction that

the coefficients are the same for men and women. We present most of our results imposing this

restriction,18 but also report key results below using the unrestricted decomposition.

        While establishments are well-defined, industry and occupation can be defined at a variety

of levels of disaggregation. Since the question of primary concern is within- vs. across-job wage

differences, we are interested in trying to narrow occupational classifications. If, however, we use

highly disaggregated occupations, we can end up with very small job cells (establishment-

occupation cells), particularly since we only have a sample of workers in each plant. This may

cause measurement error problems, which we discuss below. Consequently, we report evidence

from specifications using a variety of levels of occupational disaggregation, beginning with 13

broad Census occupations, and then using successive levels of disaggregation of occupations used

by the Census Bureau, down to the finest level of disaggregation into 505 occupations (of which

491 are represented in our data). The Census coding of occupations corresponds to some extent to

3-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes.'9 To preview the results, we find that

while using different levels of occupational disaggregation does change the quantitative results,

the qualitative results are not strongly affected by the level of occupational detail that we use.

        The percent-female variables in equation (1) are all estimated directly from the data. The

percentages female in the occupation and industry are estimated from the full SDF sample, so

 measurement error is likely to be minimal. However, the percentages female in the plant and job




         18This specification follows Groshen (1991).

         '9We combined a small number of Census occupations. Because we do not look at
 establishment-industry cells (since all workers in an establishment are presumably in the same industry,
 and are so by construction in our data set), we face no constraint in disaggregating industries finely, and
 hence we always use the detailed Census industry codes.

                                                        14
cell are estimated by necessity from the matched data in the NWECD. On average 16.14 workers

are matched to a plant, so job-cell estimates, in particular, are often based on a small number of

observations. Measurement error in these estimates therefore could be sizable, biasing the

estimates of X and 0 towards zero (and presumably biasing the other coefficient estimates as well,

although a priori the direction of bias is unclear). Since our research focuses on the relative

importance of sex differences in wages within vs. across occupation, industry, establishment, and

job cell (i.e., the relative magnitudes of 3 vs. y, ô, ), and 0), this measurement error is of

substantive importance. To assess the influence of measurement error on the estimates, we first

estimate the regressions and decompositions for the full sample, and then for restricted samples of

individuals who work in job cells with a minimum of 10 observations per cell.

        We also report results in which we estimate 3 controlling for fixed occupation, industry,

establishment, and job-cell effects, rather than controlling for the percent female in each of these

categories; this amounts, of course, to putting in job-cell dummy variables since these absorb

occupation, industry, and establishment effects. In the absence of measurement error, we would

not expect estimates of 1 obtained using these fixed effects to differ much from estimates using

the percent-female variables if the percent-female variables do a reasonable job of characterizing

how wages are affected by the sorting of workers into different industries, occupations,

establishments, and job cells. Using job-cell dummies, however, avoids the measurement error

inherent in the percent-female variables, and therefore should provide more reliable estimates of

the within-job-cell sex difference in wages (n). Nonetheless, most of the results we report use the

percent-female variables, both to follow some of the earlier literature (e.g., Groshen, 1991), and

because the estimated effects of the percent-female variables are of interest in their own right--for

example, in inferring the potential effects of a policy of comparable worth (Johnson and Solon,

                                                   15
1986).

         The next section presents the empirical analysis of the NWECD data. We first present our

basic estimates, and then numerous analyses that address measurement error bias and other

estimation issues. Our estimates turn out to differ sharply from Groshen's (1991) earlier estimates

of the roles of sex segregation and within-job sex differences in wages, so in the following section

we explore in detail the differences between these alternative estimates.

IV. Results Using the NWECD

Basic Analysis

         Table 4 begins by reporting results of wage regression estimations using 13 broad

occupation categories.20 To estimate the raw wage gap, column (1) simply reports estimates from

a regression of log hourly wages on the female dummy variable; the raw gap in these data is

37521 Column (2) then reports wage regression estimates introducing the four percent-female

variables, but no other controls. Controlling for segregation by industry, occupation,

establishment, and job cell, the sex gap in wages falls by about one-third, to -.244. Wages are

lower in establishments with a higher percent female, and within establishments, in occupations

with a higher percent female (the job-cell effect).22 In this specification without other controls


        20These 13 occupation categories are: (1) managerial and professional specialty--executive,
administrative and managerial ; (2) managerial and professional specialty--professional specialty; (3)
technical sales and administrative support--technicians and related support; (4) technical sales and
administrative support--sales; (5) technical and administrative support--administrative support; (6)
service--private household; (7) service--protective; (8) service--except private household and protective;
(9) farming, forestry and fishing; (10) precision production, craft, and repair; (11) operators, fabricators,
and laborers--machine operators; (12) operators, fabricators, and laborers--transportation and material
moving; (13) operators, fabricators, and laborers--handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers.

        21AIl of our coefficient estimates are highly significant, so while standard errors are reported, we
do not continually refer to statistical significance.

        22Macpherson and Hirsch (1995) caution that the percent female in the worker's occupation may
be a proxy for other job-related characteristics, so that the estimated effect on wages partially reflects

                                                       16
(notably education), occupational and industry segregation have the opposite of the usual effects,

with wages higher in occupations and industries with a higher percent female. As discussed

below, this result is generally reversed when individual-level controls are added. At the same

time, it should be noted that most studies of sex segregation do not control for establishment and

job cell (e.g., Macpherson and Hirsch, 1995; Johnson and Solon, 1986, Fields and Wolff, 1995);

thus, these studies no doubt overstate the role of occupational and/or industry segregation per se.

The decomposition also requires the calculation of mean differences between women and men in

the right-hand-side variables, which are reported in column (3). As we would expect, women are

in occupations, industries, establishments, and job cells with a higher percent female.

        Columns (4) and (5) present the first decomposition, for the wage regression specification

in column (2). Column (4) reports the absolute contribution of each variable to the wage gap, and

column (5) the relative contribution. The estimates in column (5) indicate that over half (65.1%)

of the wage gap is attributable to sex differences in wages that remain after accounting for

segregation by occupation, industry, establishment, and job cell. Just over one-third (34.7%) is

due to segregation into lower-paying occupations within establishments.

        Columns (6) and (7) report wage regression estimates and the "relative contribution"

decomposition once we add human capital controls. Note that the Decennial Census does not have

any direct information on experience or tenure; instead, we include age and its square. Because

for women past childbearing is negatively associated with wages, especially in the absence of


compensating differentials based on workers' preferences, and perhaps also different skill requirements.
Their evidence is consistent with this, as the longitudinal estimate of the effect of percent female in the
occupation is much weaker than the cross-sectional estimate. Sorensen (1989) presents similar evidence
for women only, based on a comparison of OLS estimates with estimates that account for selectivity into
employment and into female-dominated occupations (although one can raise questions regarding
identification of this model). In both papers, despite the evidence of bias, occupational segregation
continues to lower wages.

                                                     17
experience or tenure controls (Korenman and Neumark, 1992), we include a variable measuring

the number of children ever born to women, which is set to zero for men. Given that this may also

affect the rate of growth of wages over the life cycle, we also include an interaction of this variable

with age (Polachek, 1975). The estimated effect of each additional child born is a two percent

reduction in women's wages, while each child is associated with .5 percentage point lower wage

growth over ten-year intervals. Thus, these variables display the qualitative effects of bearing and

rearing children that we would expect.

        Upon including these controls, along with those for education, marital status, race, and

location, the estimated coefficient of the female dummy variable declines in absolute value (from

-.244 to -.132), while the estimated coefficient of the percent female in the job cell declines by

more (from - .243 to -.097). In this specification, the estimated effects of occupation and industry

segregation become negative. In terms of the decomposition, after accounting for the effects of

sex segregation by occupation, industry, establishment, and job cell, the sex difference in wages

remains large, contributing over one-third of the sex gap (.351). The contribution of establishment

segregation remains about the same, while the contribution of segregation within jobs within

establishments falls by over half (to .138).

The Effects of the Degree of Occupational Disaggregation

        The results in Table 4 are based on 13 highly-aggregated occupations. Because sex

segregation (reflected in the mean difference in the proportion female in women's vs. men's

occupations) is likely to be more severe at a more-detailed occupational level, the decomposition

results may be sensitive to the level of occupational aggregation used. To explore this question, in

Table 5 we report results for increasing degrees of occupational disaggregation. Column (1)

replicates the key results (for the specification including controls) from Table 4. Tn the second

                                                   18
column, we increase the number of occupational classifications to 72, which amounts to

disaggregating each of the 13 original occupations into anywhere from two to 14 distinct

occupations. In the last column, we disaggregate as much as our data allow and use 491 of the

most-detailed Census occupation codes. Each detailed Census occupation code corresponds

generally to a mix of three-digit and four-digit Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) codes,

often combining two or three four-digit occupations into a Census occupation.23 The first two

rows of the table show, as we would expect, that given the greater degree of sex segregation in

more detailed occupations, the mean sex difference in the percent female by occupation and job

cell is larger in each successive column. (The figures for industry and establishment are

unchanged, of course.)

       Turning to the wage regression estimates, the estimated coefficient of the female dummy

variable, or the individual sex effect, declines as more detailed occupations are used, from -.132 in

column (1) to -.09 1 in column (3), with the corresponding relative contribution to the wage gap

falling from .351 to .243. Nonetheless, a sizable sex wage gap persists. Of all the segregation

measures, the contribution ofjob-cell segregation is most affected by the level of occupational

disaggregation. The proportion of the sex gap accounted for by job-cell segregation rises from

13.8 to 23.6%.




        23For an example of what this occupational disaggregation really means, consider one of our 13
Census occupation codes, Technicians and Related Support Occupations. At the level of 72 total
occupations, this category constitutes three separate occupations: (1) Health Technologists and
Technicians; (2) Technologists and Technicians, Except Health Engineering and Related Technologists
and Technicians; Science Technicians; and (3) Technicians, Except Health, Engineering, and Science.
At the level of 491 total occupations, these three categories are further disaggregated into 22 distinct
occupations, including such occupations as dental hygienists, survey and mapping technicians, and legal
assistants.

                                                    19
Including Establishment-Level Controls

       To assess the robustness of our basic results and those using different levels of

occupational disaggregation, we also estimated these same specifications including controls for

establishment size and whether the establishment belongs to a multi-unit firm. To the extent that

these reflect establishment-level characteristics, they may "over-control" for establishment-level

differences, because they may capture dimensions of sex segregation. On the other hand, these

variables may be related to unobserved human capital, calling for their inclusion along with the

other human capital controls. Table 6 reports the results. They are very similar to those in Table

5, except that, as we might expect from controlling for some establishment characteristics that are

correlated within an industry, the contribution of sex segregation by industry and establishment to

the overall sex gap in wages falls slightly.

Manufacturing vs. Non-Manufacturing

        Earlier, we noted that the sample of establishments in the NWECD is heavily weighted

towards manufacturing. If the effects of sex segregation are different in manufacturing and non-

manufacturing industries, then in order to obtain unbiased estimates of population parameters, one

might want to weight the data to make them more representative. Of course, many other factors

influence selection into the NWECD sample, some of which may be related to unobservable

characteristics, making it unclear how the weights might be constructed. In this subsection,

therefore, we address the most salient non-representativeness--the preponderance of manufacturing

plants--by reporting separate estimates for the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors.

        Table 7 reports results of the relative contribution of sex itself and of each dimension of

segregation to the sex wage gap, exactly paralleling the estimates reported in Table 5, although

now disaggregated by sector. (The coefficient estimates are not shown.) There are some

                                                  20
differences between the two sectors. In general, there is more segregation in the non-

manufacturing sector except at the job-cell level; this may reflect the greater variety of industries

comprising this sector. In addition, there are some differences in the relative contributions to the

wage gap of occupation, industry, and job-cell segregation. However, the key finding that the

individual's sex accounts for a large share of the wage gap persists in both the manufacturing and

non-manufacturing sectors. For example, in column (3), using the most disaggregated

occupations, sex alone accounts for 24.8% of sex wage gap in manufacturing, and 23.3% in non-

manufacturing. Thus, although this evidence does not address all sources of non-

representativeness in the NWECD, it indicates that the most pronounced source of non-

representativeness has little influence on the results.

Cohort Effects

        Although our human capital measures include controls for how many children a woman

has had, and an interaction between children and age, these are only proxies for the labor market

interruptions of women. To the extent that they do not fully capture the differential labor market

experience of similarly aged women and men, our regression results, especially the coefficient on

the female dummy, may be biased. To the extent that younger cohorts of women have had fewer

labor market interruptions than older cohorts, this bias should be less severe for younger workers.

 Table 8 therefore replicates the specifications in Table 5, but uses only the sample of workers who

 are below the median age.24 The raw wage gap between young men and women is smaller than

 that for the full sample (-.26 versus -.3 8), and the coefficient estimates on the female dummy

 variable are smaller (ranging from -.05 to -.08 versus -.09 to -.13). Because the extent of



          24The segregation measures for percent female in the industry, occupation, establishment, and job
 cell are calculated from the full sample.

                                                     21
segregation between men and women is very similar for young workers relative to the full sample,

however, and because the regression coefficients on the segregation variables are also very similar,

the relative contribution of the female dummy to the wage gap for younger workers is not very

different than for the full sample. An individual's sex still accounts for anywhere between 20 and

31% of the wage gap. The results from the full sample are therefore not being driven by

unmeasured differential labor market experiences of men and women.

The Effects of Measurement Error on the Estimates

       As discussed above, sampling error in the estimates of the percent female in the

establishment and job cell may be quite severe. We do a number of things to assess the role of

measurement error that this may induce. First, in Table 9 we report results from reestimating the

specifications in Table 5 using data only on job cells with at least 10 workers. By restricting

attention to larger job cells, we should reduce measurement error in the percent female in the job

cell. Of course, this restriction also entails a cost in terms of the number of observations,

particularly when more-detailed occupations are used. As the sample sizes towards the bottom of

Table 9 show, this restriction results in excluding about 30% of the sample when we use the most

aggregated occupations, rising to about 68% when we use the most-detailed occupational

classification. Our estimates may also change because the restriction we impose tends to exclude

smaller establishments.25

        The bottom rows of Table 9 summarize the evidence on the contributions of each

component of segregation and the individual's sex to the overall sex wage gap with and without

the job-cell-size restriction. We generally obtain higher estimated effects ofjob-cell segregation,


         25Although the observed characteristics of workers in this restricted sample are not vastly
different from those in the full sample, workers in the restricted sample are slightly higher-paid and
slightly more likely to be married.

                                                     22
with the estimates nearly doubling and job-cell segregation contributing 46% of the sex wage gap

for the most-detailed occupational breakdown. The estimated effects of establishment segregation

change somewhat, while the estimated effects of industry segregation rise for the more

disaggregated occupation breakdowns. Finally, the contribution of occupational segregation

varies significantly across the columns; even the sign changes across the columns, so that in the

last two columns, occupational segregation actually narrows the wage gap between men and

women by 16 to 30%. The change in the estimated effects of the female dummy variable does

vary across columns, decreasing 2.0 percentage points in column (1) but increasing 0.4 and 3.4

percentage points in columns (2) and (3). In every model, however, there is a large role for

individual sex even after accounting for the percent female within occupation, industry,

establishment, and job cell. The female dummy variable accounts for at least 28% of the wage

gap.

Eliminating Measurement Error

       An approach that eliminates any role of measurement error in the percent female variables

is to include a full set ofj oh-cell dummy variables, which capture occupation, industry,

establishment, and of course job-cell fixed effects. In addition to eliminating measurement error,

this specification has the benefit that, unlike standard wage decompositions, it does not impose a

particular parametric structure on the way segregation affects sex wage differences. The cost of

this procedure is that we sacrifice estimates of the effects of sex segregation along each of these

dimensions. These estimates are reported in Table 10. Because job-cell dummy variables are

included, the estimated effects of the individual's sex in these specifications can be thought of as

within-job-cell sex differences in wages. Up to this point, we have been reluctant to use this label

in describing the effect of an individual's sex; however, because the results from this less


                                                  23
parametric specification turn out to be quite similar to those using the percent-female variables,

from this point on we use this more transparent expression to describe the sex difference in wages

attributable to an individual's sex.

        In the first two panels, estimates are first reported for wage equation specifications

including no controls, and then including the human capital controls. Compared with the

corresponding estimates in Table 5, the estimated effect of the individual's sex is actually larger in

Table 10 whatever the level of occupational detail.26 For example, in Table 5 using the most-

aggregated occupations, the estimated coefficient of the female dummy variable is -.132; the

comparable estimate in Table 10 is -.170. Interestingly, however, the decline in this estimated

coefficient as more-detailed occupations are used is similar in Table 10 (from -.170 to -.130 using

the most-detailed occupations) to the decline in Table 5 (from -.132 to -.09 1). As the last row of

the table reports, the ratio of the estimated within-job-cell sex difference using the fixed effects vs.

the percent-female variables is lower when we use job cells with at least 10 workers relative to the

full sample, which is consistent with some decrease in measurement error bias as we restrict the

sample to larger job cells.27 Regardless, no matter what specification one looks at it in Table 10,


        26While it is impossible to sign a priori the effect of measurement error on the female dummy
variable, one's intuition might be to expect the coefficient on the female dummy variable to be go down
in Table 10 relative to the earlier tables since, in those tables, the female dummy is positively correlated
with the mismeasured percent female in establishment and job-cell variables. Exactly the opposite
occurs.

         27We also used this specification to verify that the relationship we estimate between wages and
sex is actually driven by the rate of pay. Recall that our wage variable is a constructed wage, with hours
and weeks in the denominator. In principle, it is possible that it is not rates of pay on a weekly, bi-
weekly, monthly, etc., basis that differ by sex within job cells, but rather that it is weeks or hours that
differ. For women to have lower constructed wages within job cells, however, it would have to be the
case that their weeks or hours were higher within job cells, which seems unlikely. To check this, we
estimated specifications for log weeks and for log hours with a dummy variable for female and job-cell
fixed effects as control variables. For the different levels of occupational disaggregation, the estimated
coefficient on the female dummy variable in the weeks regression ranged from -.005 to -.007, while in
the hours regression it ranged from -.030 to -.044. These negative coefficients imply that dividing

                                                      24
there is no evidence that measurement error in the earlier tables is biasing the estimated within-

job-cell sex difference in wages away from zero, leading to a spurious negative estimate.28

Moreover, the results in Table 10 make it clear that the estimated within-job-cell sex difference in

Table 5 is not attributable to the functional form used to estimate the impact of segregation on

wages.

The Effects of Using Separate Regressions Estimated by Sex

         To this point, we have followed Groshen (1991) in using a single wage regression for men

and women, with a dummy variable for women. A more flexible decomposition procedure is to

use separate wage regressions for men and women, following Oaxaca (1973). In this case, using f

and 'm' subscripts to indicate coefficients corresponding to women and men, we can decompose

the difference in average log wages between women and men as follows (dropping the variable F

used in equation (1)):

(3)      wf - wm' = {' (OCC%Ff - OCC%Fm) + ôf'(IND%Ff - IND%Fm) + Af'(EST%Ff - EST%Fm)

                   + O(JOB%F - JOB%F) + (Xf - Xm)f'}

                   + {(af'—am') +   (y- ym1)O°"01m + (ôôm')IND%Fm + ()m)EST%Fm
                   + (OOm')JQB%Fm + Xm(I;-tm') }

         In this decomposition, the first term in curly brackets gives the component of the wage gap

attributable to differences in characteristics of individuals and jobs, while the second gives the

component attributable to differences in coefficients. In the usual application of this


through by weeks and hours would tend to make constructed wages look, if anything, more equal by sex
within job cell than the reported rates of pay.

         28 is also the case that the standard errors hardly increase when we use fixed job-cell effects. In
the specifications with the percent-female variables, the standard errors were potentially understated
because there were multiple observations on the same establishment, job cell, etc. However, the fact that
the standard errors are scarcely larger with fixed job-cell effects indicates that this understatement was
trivial.

                                                     25
decomposition, the second term is interpreted as capturing discrimination, although once one starts

to include job characteristics (such as the percent female in the occupation), one could argue that

this interpretation breaks down because sex segregation may reflect discrimination.29 As

explained in Neumark (1988), the decomposition in equation (3) uses the female wage structure as

the "no-discrimination" wage structure, which is why mean differences in characteristics are

evaluated at the female coefficients. Alternatively, one can use the male (or some other) wage

structure, in which case the coefficients at which the mean differences are evaluated would have

'rn subscripts, and the means at which the differences in coefficients are evaluated would in turn

have 'f subscripts.

       In terms of the decompositions used in this paper, each of the first four terms in equation

(3) gives the component of the wage differential attributable to the corresponding dimension of sex

segregation. For example, y (OCC%Ff - OCC%Fm) measures the component attributable to

occupational segregation. In contrast, the entire second term involving the differences in

intercepts and coefficients measures the component attributable to the individual's sex.

       Table 11 reports results using this less-restrictive decomposition. We restrict attention to

the two most-detailed occupational classifications in the Decennial Census. The first thing to

notice is that the estimated coefficients on the percent-female variables differ sharply by sex. The

percent female in the occupation has a negative and significant effect on men's wages but a small

positive and significant effect on women's wages. The percent female in an industry has a much

larger negative impact on men's wages than on women's wages, while, conversely, the percent

female in the establishment and job cell have much stronger negative influences on women's


        291n fact, there are also many reasons why differences in coefficients may not reflect
discrimination, such as the apparent productivity-enhancing effects of marriage for men (Korenman and
Neumark, 1992).

wages. Not surprisingly, then, the decompositions will be markedly different depending on the

choice of the no-discrimination wage structure, as reported further down in the table.

       The best comparison is between the results reported in columns (2) and (3) of Table 5, and

those reported in the lower panel of Table 11. This comparison indicates that, using the female

wage structure (reported following the slash), the shares of the wage gap attributable to each

dimension of segregation and to within-job-cell sex differences are roughly similar; the only

notable difference is that in Table 11 segregation by job cell has a larger effect. Using the male

wage structure (reported before the slash), a considerably larger share (about 50%) of the wage gap

arises within job cells, reflecting the weaker estimated effects of establishment and job-cell

segregation for men. Although the apparent differences in the effects of segregation for men and

women are of independent interest and bear further exploration, for the purposes of this paper the

important point is that using separate wage equations for men and women certainly does not

eliminate the significant role of within-job-cell sex differences in wages. Compared with single-

equation estimates, these differences are as large using the female wage structure, and much larger

using the male wage structure.

V. Comparison with Groshen1s Estimates

       To this point, we have presented numerous analyses of the NWECD data set. The findings

indicate that within-job-cell sex differences in wages as well as job-cell segregation account for

large shares of the sex wage gap, and that occupational segregation is relatively unimportant. The

findings regarding the within-job-cell sex differences and occupational segregation contrast

sharply with the findings reported by Groshen (199 l).° She studies five specific industries in both


        30The result on occupational segregation may appear to contradict a rather extensive literature
documenting the negative relationship between wages and the percent female (e.g., Macpherson and
Hirsch, 1995; Sorensen, 1990). However, most of this work does not include information on other

                                                    27
manufacturing and non-manufacturing, using data from the 1 970s and 1 980s drawn from Bureau

of Labor Statistics IWS. Groshen finds that within-job-cell sex differences account for only -1.0

to 6.6% of the wage gap. In contrast, the effect ofjob-cell segregation ranges from -2.7 to 32.5%

of the wage gap, with the percentage above 20 for three of the five industries. The percent female
in the occupation accounts for the largest share, ranging from 40.6 to 74.8%. The estimated

contributions ofjob-cell segregation are not very different from ours, but Groshen's estimated

contributions of occupational segregation and within-job-cell sex differences contrast strongly

with our results.31 In this section, we discuss a number of possible explanations of these

differences.

Derences in Control Variables

        Because of data limitations in the IWS, Groshen does not have any human capital or other

controls in her equations. The estimates in Tables 4-6, excluding and including controls, indicate

that this does not explain the differences between the two sets of results. In particular, the

inclusion of human capital and other controls in the NWECD data results in a remaining within-

job-cell sex difference in wages that is smaller than the difference in the absence of controls. If we


components of segregation. When we estimate the models in Table 5 omitting the percent female in
industry, establishment, and job cell, we find strong negative effects of the percent female by occupation,
which accounts for 6 to 21% of the sex wage gap, with the upper end of the range corresponding to the
more-detailed occupational classification.

         310ur finding that sex segregation within occupation accounts for a relatively small proportion of
the male/female wage gap is consistent with the results reported by Macpherson and Hirsch (1995).
These authors, using matched longitudinal data on workers from the Current Population Survey, find that
once they control for unobserved worker characteristics the estimated effect of percent female within
occupation declines substantially. In fact our estimated coefficient of -.038 (in column (3) of Table 5) is
in the range of estimates they report in their Table 9. Since Macpherson and Hirsch only have data on
workers, part of what is captured by controlling for unmeasured worker characteristics is the effect of
percent female in a worker's establishment and job cell, which we find to be considerably more important
than occupational segregation, yet which are of course positively correlated with percent female in the
occupation. Although we cannot compare our results on the role of these other factors with Macpherson
and Hirsch, their results do provide some support for the accuracy of our findings.

                                                     28
compare Groshen's results with estimates using the NWECD without these other controls (as in

columns (2)-(5) of Table 4), the contrast of our results with hers is even sharper. To ensure more

direct comparability of the results from the two data sets, in this section we report results

excluding these other controls.

The Effects of the Particular Industries Studied

       The most obvious difference between our NWECD data set and the IWS data that Groshen

studies is the scope of industries studied. The results we have presented using the NWECD are

based on a large sample consisting of a broad (nearly complete) array of industries, while

Groshen's work is restricted to five specific industries: Miscellaneous Plastics Products,

Nonelectrical Machinery, Banking, Life Insurance, and Computer and Data Processing. To

examine whether her results are specific to the industries she studied, we attempted to draw

subsamples in our data set for these specific industries. We were able to obtain samples large

enough to study for the first three of these industries.32 In addition to restricting the analysis of the

NWECD data to these industries, we also restrict attention to the classes of occupations covered by

the IWS. For Plastics and Machinery, these include production and maintenance occupations,

while for Banking these include nonsupervisory occupations.

       A direct comparison of the results for similar workers in Miscellaneous Plastics Products,

Nonelectrical Machinery, and Banking is provided in Table 12. We present results using the

NWECD with each level of occupational disaggregation in columns (1)-(3), and Groshen's results

using the IWS in column (4)•33 Turning first to the segregation estimates, as in the full sample,


        321n contrast, we had data on only 464 workers in 70 establishments in Computer and Data
Processing, and fewer than 75 workers and fewer than 10 establishments in Life Insurance.

      33The unadjusted sex wage gaps are roughly comparable in the two data sources for the two
manufacturing industries, but not banking, although always smaller in the IWS. In the NWECD the

                                                   29
job-cell segregation plays a fairly important role in the NWECD data. In each industry, the

estimated contribution ofjob-cell segregation to the sex wage gap is similar to Groshen's

estimates, especially with the more-detailed occupational classification. For example, using the

most-detailed classification in the NWECD data, in column (3), the estimated share for Plastics is

.342 in the NWECD data, vs. .325 in the IWS. In Nonelectrical Machinery the corresponding

estimates are .254 vs. .124, and in Banking .208 vs. .2 18. Similarly, the estimated contributions of

establishment segregation are similar for the two data sources, with estimates in the NWECD and

the IWS (again, comparing columns (3) and (4)) of .170 vs. .121 in Plastics, .322 vs. .480 in

Nonelectrical Machinery, and .038 vs. .048 in Banking.

       The differences between the two data sets remain sharp, however, regarding the roles of

occupational segregation and the individual's sex (or within-job-cell sex differences in wages). In

all three industries the IWS data indicate a much more prominent role for occupational

segregation. In the two manufacturing industries, Groshen's estimates attribute 41 to 49% of the

wage gap to occupational segregation, compared with nine to 22% in the NWECD data. In

Banking, Groshen's estimates indicate an even larger role for occupational segregation,

contributing 71% of the sex gap in wages, compared with 29% in the NWECD data. Most

importantly, in each of the three industries we obtain the same result as in the full sample that the

sex gap within job cells accounts for a large share of the wage gap; using the most-detailed

occupational classification, the individual's sex accounts for 26 to 47% of the sex wage gap,

compared with one to seven percent in the IWS data. Thus, even looking at the industries (and

occupations) Groshen studies, our data assign a less prominent role to occupational segregation,


estimated coefficients of the sex dummy variable when it is the only included variable are -.32 for
Plastics, - .40 for Nonelectrical Machinery, and -.56 for Banking. The corresponding numbers for the
IWS reported in Table I of Groshen's paper are -.24, -.30, and -.37.

                                                   30
and--in sharpest contrast to her estimates--a prominent role to sex wage gaps within establishments

and occupations.34

Dfferences in Sample Periods

        One possible explanation is that our data are from a later period than the IWS, and it is

conceivable that sex differences in wages that remain after accounting for each dimension of sex

segregation widened over the 1 980s. While we have no way to evaluate this possibility, we are

skeptical that relative contributions of different components of the wage gap changed so much in

such a short period. We know, of course, that wage differences between and within skill groups

did widen over this period. However, given that the overall sex gap in wages did not widen over

this period (Blau, 1998), we see no reason to believe that it widened within job cells. We also

know that occupational segregation declined over this period (Blau, 1998), so it is possible that the

contribution of occupational segregation fell, but there is no obvious reason why the wage gap

previously attributable to occupational segregation would now all "load" on to the individual's sex.

Finally, the differences between our results and Groshen's are as sharp or sharper for the

Nonelectrical Machinery and Banking industries compared with Miscellaneous Plastics, despite

the fact that the data from the first two industries come from the 1980s, while the data for the third

come from the 1970s. Overall, then, we are very doubtful that differences in the periods studied

explain the differences in results.




         34Because her occupation definitions are industry-specific, Groshen computed percent female in
the occupation separately for each industry studied, which contrasts with the procedure in more-standard
data sets of using economy-wide estimates to study the role of occupational segregation. In contrast, we
use the full SDF to compute the percent female. However, we reestimated the models in Table 12 using
a definition of the percent female based only on the specific industry. This had little or no impact on the
contribution of the individual's sex, although it did slightly raise the contribution of occupational
segregation, and slightly lower the contribution ofjob-cell segregation.

                                                     31
Differences in Occupational Classflcation and Coverage

       Although in Table 12 we restrict attention to the same broad occupations that Groshen

studies, there remain differences in the occupational classification. In particular, the occupational

classifications available in the IWS are highly detailed, and specific to the five narrow industries

Groshen studies.35 This raises the possibility that if we could somehow use occupational

classifications in the NWECD that are closer to those used by Groshen in the IWS, our results

would coincide with hers.36 However, the results in Table 5 show that going from 13 to 491

occupations in the NWECD makes little substantive difference, which makes us skeptical that the

level of occupational detail explains the differences in results. Furthermore, although the IWS

occupational classification may differ from ours, it is not clear that the IWS uses a greater degree

of occupational disaggregation within each industry. In the top row of each panel in Table 12 we

report the number of occupations represented in the data set when we use each level of

occupational disaggregation; in columns (l)-(3) this is the number following the slash, whereas the

number preceding the slash is the total number of occupations on which the classification is based.

These numbers reveal that using the most-detailed Census occupations (in column (3)), we

actually have more occupations represented in each of the three industries than the IWS.

        On the other hand, it may be that features of the occupational classification other than the

level of disaggregation are relevant. Presumably the most relevant one is the extent to which the

occupational classification is based on sex-segregated occupations. For example, if the Census

occupations are less sex segregated, and hence combine occupations or jobs based on the IWS


        35As an example, in the Miscellaneous Plastics Products industry, Groshen cites three different
jobs on blow-molding machines as "operate," "set-up," and "set-up and operate."

       36Blau's (1977) occupational classifications are also somewhat narrower than ours, primarily
because she has some distinctions based on job levels within occupations.

                                                    32
classifications that are segregated by sex, then in the NWECD we may find more evidence of a

within-job-cell sex gap in wages after accounting for segregation.

       It appears, however, that the degree of sex segregation in the detailed Census occupations

is no lower than in Groshen's data. In particular, Table 13 compares the mean difference in the

percent female in job cells in the two data sets, again for the NWECD using the most-detailed

occupational classifications. As the table shows, once we use relatively detailed Census

occupational classifications, sex segregation in the NWECD is about the same as in the IWS in the

two manufacturing industries, and higher in Banking.37

       Another possibility is that the results are simply sensitive to the precise occupations

covered within each industry. It turns out that the IWS often covers a narrow set of occupations

within each industry, among the production and maintenance workers (in Plastics and

Nonelectrical Machinery) and nonsupervisory workers (in Banking). To address this question, we

also constructed subsamples for each of these industries in which we restrict attention to the subset

of Census occupations that can be matched reasonably well with the main occupational categories

surveyed by the IWS. We can do this because the occupational descriptions provided in the IWS

documentation correspond closely to those in the SOC, and we can then map the SOC codes into

Census codes.38 Note that this alternative approach does not yield greater occupational

disaggregation in the NWECD. All it yields is an analysis similar to the one we have done, but for

the specific occupations covered in the IWS.




       37The results of this comparison were similar if we restricted attention to the occupations that
match more explicitly those covered by the IWS, discussed below.

         38This refers to the main occupational categories surveyed in the IWS. The Census occupations
are too aggregated to be matched to the occupation sub-categories in the IWS (which distinguish, for
example, by job level).

                                                     33
       The results using these subsets of occupations are reported in Table 14. The results for the

IWS occupations are reported in column (1). As shown in the first row of each panel, there are

now, of course, fewer occupations covered. A comparison of the estimates in column (1) with

those in column (2), which are for all of the occupations within the broad categories of production

and maintenance or nonsupervisory workers, indicates that the estimates are not very sensitive to

restricting the sample to the subset of occupations covered in the IWS. The estimated effects of

each type of segregation are similar in the two samples. Furthermore, the estimated effect of the

individual's sex remains large for each industry in the subset of IWS occupations, with its

estimated contribution to the wage gap similar in this subset and the broader set of occupations.

Thus, differences in occupational coverage do not explain the differences between our results and

Groshen's.

       The only possibility is that within the particular occupations considered in column (1) of

Table 14, the degree of occupational disaggregation matters; this is the same question we

considered earlier with respect to the broader set of occupations in the NWECD. Although it is

true that for these particular occupations Groshen's occupational classification is more

disaggregated, as indicated by the greater number of occupations in column (3) than in column (1)

of Table 14, the essential question is whether the aggregation in the NWECD masks sex

segregation. To examine this question, we computed the measure of sex segregation based on the

sex difference in the mean percent female in the job cell, for the specific occupations

corresponding to those covered by the IWS (as we did for the broader set of NWECD occupations

in Table 13). As in Table 13, the data again indicate that the aggregation in the NWECD does not

mask sex segregation relative to Groshen's classification. The degree of sex segregation is now

greater in the NWECD for both Plastics (.775 vs. .76 1) and Banking (.68 1 vs. .505), and is only a


                                                 34
bit smaller in Nonelectrical Machinery (.596 vs. .646). Thus, we conclude that neither differences

in occupational classification nor in occupational coverage appear to explain the differences

between our results and Groshen's.

Measurement Error

       As discussed earlier, measurement error may influence some of our results relative to

Groshen's. In particular, sampling error in the estimates of the percent female in the establishment

and job cell may be quite severe. Of course, Groshen also does not have data on all workers in

each establishment, but rather just those in a subset of occupations; specifically, the IWS excluded

executive, professional, and supervisory workers. Thus, her estimates of the percent female in the

establishment are also prone to sampling error, and may also be influenced by the non-random

selection of which occupations were surveyed. Similarly, her estimates of percent female in the

occupation are based on a small subset of establishments, also non-random, and hence are prone to

error, whereas our estimates of occupational segregation are based on the full SDF, so that

measurement error bias is likely minimal.39 In addition to these considerations, the analysis

restricting attention to large job cells (Table 9) and using fixed effects for occupation, industry,

establishment, and job cell (Table 10), suggested that measurement error in the percent female

variables was not responsible for finding a significant negative sex gap in wages within job cells.

       Finally, the direct comparison of estimates on an industry-by-industry basis also permits us

to make some more definitive statements about the possible explanations of the differences

between our results and those of Groshen. The variables in the NWECD for which measurement

error is potentially serious are the percent female in the establishment and the percent female in the


        391n fact, in the discussion of the IWS, the BLS Handbook of Methods states that "estimates of
the number of workers in a given occupation are subject to considerable sampling error, due to the wide
variation among establishments in the proportion of workers found in individual occupations."

                                                   35
job cell. To address questions of measurement error, it is more useful to look at coefficient

estimates than the decomposition results, as the latter are also multiplied by the mean differences

in the segregation measure. These results are reported in Table 15. We focus on the comparison

between the two most-detailed occupational classifications in the NWECD, and Groshen's

estimates.

       The variable that is most prone to measurement error in the NWECD is the percent female

in the job cell. However, the estimates in Table 15 indicate that the estimated coefficients of this

variable are larger in the NWECD than in the IWS for all three industries. This indicates that

measurement error in the NWECD, which should bias the estimated coefficient of percent female

in the job cell downward (toward zero), is not responsible for the differences in results.

Reinforcing this conclusion, the percent female in the establishment is also prone to measurement

error in the NWECD, yet the estimated coefficient of this variable is higher in our sample than in

the IWS data for the two manufacturing industries, although not for Banking. Based on this

evidence, we conclude that although measurement error may bias some of the estimates we obtain

using the NWECD data, it does not explain the differences between our results and Groshen's.

Data Collection

        To this point, we have found that issues regarding measurement, occupational

classification, industries studied, etc., do not appear to explain the differences between our results

and Groshen's. We next turn to some issues regarding the role that data collection may play.

        In the IWS, within each industry establishments were chosen using a random probability

sample with over-weighting of large establishments. Selected establishments reported information

on the number of workers of each sex working in nonsupervisory production jobs and




                                                  36
nonsupervisory nonproduction jobs (office work).4° No data on the sex composition of

supervisory workers were collected. Payroll records ideally were then used to collect data on the

number of workers of each sex working in a specific (non-supervisory) occupation at each

earnings level. Data were only reported for a selection of occupations that were chosen on an

industry-by-industry basis partially to reflect the types of activities performed by workers in an

industry, but also to reflect their 'prevalence in the industry, definiteness and clarity of duties, and

importance as reference points in collective bargaining." (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1976).

       The IWS data have a number of strengths and weaknesses. Because the data on the sex

composition of workers in each job cell ideally were generated using payroll data, there should be

no sampling error. In contrast, our NWECD data do contain this kind of sampling error. On the

other hand, as noted earlier, the IWS likely has some measurement error in the percent female in

the establishment and the occupation.

        Perhaps the biggest drawback to the IWS relative to the NWECD, however, is that all the

data in the IWS come from surveyed establishments. While it is hard to gauge how accurately

establishments were able to or required to provide detailed occupational and earnings data by sex,

it is clear that it is not in any establishment's best interest to provide data suggesting that within

narrowly-defined occupations there was a pay gap between men and women.4' It might therefore

not be surprising to find that there is little evidence of a within-job-cell sex wage gap in the IWS.

In contrast, the wage and sex data in the NWECD come from data reported by the worker in the

SDF, where the worker has no incentive to misreport earnings or occupation in a way that is


         40The survey, BLS 275 1A, asks the establishment to report the "approximate total employment"
in the establishment.

       4tThe Equal Pay Act places the burden of proof on the employer to show that unequal pay for
equal work is based on a factor other than sex, such as seniority.

                                                   37
systematically correlated with sex. While this is only a possible explanation for the differences

between the results from the two data sets, we have not been able to verify that the data collection

effort accessed employers' payroll records in such a way as to ensure that employers did not

misreport individuals' wages to mask within-job-cell sex differences. For more details on how the

IWS data on earnings and sex-mix within occupations were collected, see the Appendix.

       Finally, to this point we have only offered a conjecture that the IWS data lead to masking

of within-job-cell sex wage gaps. Within-job-cell sex wage gaps could be masked either by

misreporting of wages, or by misreporting of the sex composition of occupations. Given that we

do not find more segregation in the IWS data than in the NWECD data, we doubt that

misreporting of the sex composition of occupations in the IWS--specifically, the reporting of more

segregation than is actually the case--is occurring. However, we do note that in each of the three

industries that we can compare, the raw sex wage gap is smaller in Groshen's data than in our data

(see footnote 33). As noted earlier, in Groshen's data, the gap is -.24 in Plastics, -.30 in

Nonelectrical Machinery, and -.37 in Banking; in contrast, the corresponding gaps are -.32, -.39,

and -.56 in our data. Thus, despite that fact that Groshen's data come from an earlier period when

the sex wage gaps would have been expected to be larger, they are smaller by .08 to .19 in her

data. This is consistent, at least, with underreporting of sex wage gaps in the IWS.42

        We do not have direct and compelling evidence to suggest that the IWS be disregarded for

the purpose of decomposing the sex wage gap. However, given the distinctly different findings

produced using the NWECD, and the potential problems with the IWS, our findings should, at a

minimum, call into question the previously-held belief based on the IWS data that occupation,

establishment, and job-cell segregation can account for essentially all of the male/female wage gap


        42We thank Bob Lalonde for suggesting this comparison.

                                                   38
that is not explained by other individual-level characteristics.

VI. Policy Implications

        The policy implications of our findings are very different than those drawn from the earlier

research. Our results suggest that identifying and eliminating the sources of within-occupation,

within-establishment wage differences between men and women can play a large role in reducing

wage differences between men and women. In particular, if within the narrowly-defined

occupations that we study the jobs performed by men and women require substantially equal skill,

effort, responsibility, and working conditions, yet wages differ by sex, then enforcement of the

Equal Pay Act can play a fundamental role in closing the wage gap between men and women. In

contrast, if segregation along various dimensions accounted for most of the sex wage gap, then

policies along the lines of comparable worth, equal opportunities in employment and promotion,

and affirmative action would be central to any further closing of this gap, and stronger equal pay

provisions would not be effective.43

        There is currently substantial interest in equal pay issues in the federal government.

President Clinton recently announced in a radio address a $14 million equal pay initiative in his

budget proposal to address pay disparities between men and women.44 He also called on Congress

to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill introduced recently in the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of

Representatives that calls for strengthening of the Equal Pay Act to allow for, among other things,




        43For example, referring to the role of equal pay provisions in eliminating within job cell sex
differences in wages, Groshen concludes from her results that "either the provisions have succeeded, or
this component was never the main source of the gap" (p. 470).

compensatory and punitive damages against employers violating the Act.45'46 While not addressed

to the specifics of these proposals, our findings suggest that stronger enforcement of equal pay

legislation could further reduce the wage gap between men and women.

VII. Conclusions

        We assembled a large matched employer-employee data set covering essentially all

industries and occupations across all regions of the U.S. We use this data set to re-examine the

question of the relative contributions to the overall sex gap in wages of sex segregation vs. wage

differences by sex within occupation, industry, establishment, and occupation-establishment cells.

This is especially important given that earlier research on this topic relied on data sets that covered

only a narrow range of industries, occupations, or regions.

        Our results indicate that, although a sizable fraction of the sex gap in wages is accounted

for by the segregation of women into lower-paying occupations, industries, establishments, and

occupations within establishments, a substantial part of this gap remains attributable to the

individuaPs sex. Overall, our estimates indicate that from about one-quarter to one-half of the sex

wage gap takes the form of wage differences between men and women within narrowly-defined

occupations within establishments. These findings contrast sharply with the conclusions of

previous research (especially Groshen, 1991) indicating that sex segregation accounted for

House Bill is H.R. 2023, introduced by Rep. Rosa DeLauro on June 24, 1997. The Senate version of the
bill additionally instructs the Secretary of Labor to "develop guidelines to enable employers to evaluate
job categories based on objective criteria such as educational requirements, skill requirements,
independence, working conditions and responsibility" which employers can use to help ensure that they
are in compliance with the law. The House version instructs the Secretary of Labor to issue "voluntary
pay guidelines for the relative pay ranges of a selection of male- and female-dominated widely held
occupations." Finally, the House version of the bill requires employers with 100 or more employees to
submit reports to the EEOC containing information from payroll records on wages by race, sex, and
national original of employees.

essentially all of the sex wage gap. We explore numerous possible explanations for these different

findings, but we find that even restricting attention to the narrow industries studied in the earlier

research, our data still show important differences in wages paid to men and women within

occupations and establishments.

        We do not attempt in this paper to determine the underlying forces that cause men and

women to have different wages within narrowly-defined occupations in the same establishments.

Our results simply suggest that there is still research to be done in order to identify these forces.

In particular, our results leave open the possibility that within narrowly-defined occupations and

establishments, men and women are performing essentially the same job but are not being paid

equally--a violation of the Equal Pay Act. Further research into the sources of within-

establishment within-occupation sex wage differences is therefore much more important than

previously thought.

   Appendix: Issues in the Collection of Earnings and Sex-Mix Data by Occupation in the IWS

       Ideally, BLS field representatives collected data for the IWS on earnings and the sex-mix

within occupations using the payroll records of surveyed establishments. Data were only reported

for a selection of occupations that were chosen on an industry-by-industry basis partially to reflect

the types of activities performed by workers in an industry, but also to reflect their "prevalence in

the industry, definiteness, and clarity of duties, and importance as reference points in collective

bargaining."

       When payroll records were utilized for data collection, it is not entirely clear how field

economists verified or coded wages. The form used to record the data (BLS 2753G, reproduced in

the BLS Handbook of Methods) has the following headings: (I) occupation and grade, (ii)

occupational code, (iii) sex, (iv) method of pay, (v) number of workers, (vi) hours, and (vii) salary,

rate, or earnings. There is some ambiguity regarding how the field economist would record data

on individual men and women. It does not seem likely that a record was filled out for each

worker, both because the number of records could be prohibitively large, and because the entry for

"number of workers" would not make sense. Yet the Handbook indicates that this form was used

"in recording occupation, sex, ..., and pay rate or earnings for each worker studied" (p. 138).

Alternatively, it is possible that the field economist filled out a separate line for workers of each

sex within an occupation,47 but it also appears possible that she would record a single wage for the

occupation, indicating the percent female. Unfortunately, however, we have been unable to track

down instructions that may have been issued to field economists to better understand how the IWS



           seems somewhat implausible to us to think that in years subsequent to the passage of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 companies worked with government field economists to
prepare reports indicating different wage rates for men and women doing the same job, despite a pledge
of confidentiality from the BLS.

                                                   42
data were meant to be collected, or original copies of the filled-out surveys to determine how the

data were actually collected.

       The BLS documentation for the IWS also suggests that in at least some cases companies

generated the reports for the surveys (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1976). The Handbook (p.

138) reads:

       "Bureau field economists collect data by personal visit to each of the sample establishments. Job
       functions and factors in the establishment are carefully compared with those included in the
       Bureau job definitions. The job matching may involve review of records such as pay structure
       plans and organization charts, company position descriptions, interviews with appropriate
       officials, and, on occasion, observation of jobs within plants. A satisfactory completion ofjob
       matching permits acceptance of company-prepared reports where this procedure is preferred by
       the respondent. Generally, however, the field economist secures wages or salary rates ... from
       payroll or other records ..."

It is hard to imagine that self-generated reports by companies would contain obvious evidence of

violation of the Equal Pay Act. We were able to find no information on how many companies

generated their own reports for the BLS.

All controls included in early tables are excluded here, to maintain comparability with Groshens results; she does not have data on any of these
controls. The results with the NWECD data were qualitatively similar including the human capital controls. Column (4) is from Groshen (1991),
Tables I and 2. In the rows labeled 'numbers of occupations" we first report the number of occupations used in the occupational classification
(corresponding to the earlier tables), and then the number of occupations represented in the data for the specific industry and occupations considered.
