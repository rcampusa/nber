Economic and Non-Economic Factors in Violence: Evidence from Organized Crime, Suicides

                                           ABSTRACT

Organized intergroup violence is almost universally modeled as a calculated act motivated by
economic factors. In contrast, it is generally assumed that non-economic factors, such as an
individual's emotional state, play a role in many types of interpersonal violence, such as "crimes
of passion." We ask whether economic or non-economic factors better explain the well-
established relationship between temperature and violence in a unique context where intergroup
killings by drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) and "normal" interpersonal homicides are
separately documented. A constellation of evidence, including the limited influence of a cash
transfer program as well as comparison with both non-violent DTO crime and suicides, indicate
that economic factors only partially explain the observed relationship between temperature and
violence. We argue that non-economic psychological and physiological factors that are affected
by temperature, modeled here as a "taste for violence," likely play an important role in causing
both interpersonal and intergroup violence.

1   Introduction

To date, economic models of violence treat interpersonal and intergroup violence as very
different phenomena. Instances of interpersonal violence, such as assault and murder, are
generally thought of as “crimes” that may have either an economic or emotional motivation—
assaulting an individual in order to expropriate their assets is clearly economic, whereas
“crimes of passion” are a commonsense notion reflecting emotional factors. In contrast,
violence between groups of individuals is almost always modeled as a strategic calculation
where the economic costs of conflict are weighed against potential gains. In many cases, this
decision to focus on economic factors is well-motivated and generates sharp predictions that
often agree with data (Collier and Hoeffler, 1998, Miguel et al., 2004, Angrist and Kugler,
2008, Berman et al., 2011, Besley and Persson, 2011, Dube and Vargas, 2013). Here we
propose that noneconomic factors could also play an important role in causing intergroup
violence, alongside known economic factors. This idea narrows the gap between models
of interpersonal violence and intergroup violence, and accordingly we augment a standard
model of strategic conflict by including noneconomic factors already accounted for in models
of interpersonal violence. We then demonstrate that this richer model is better able to
account for observed patterns of violence in Mexico, a unique context where we are able to
study both interpersonal and intergroup homicide in a common setting and where levels of
violence are high.

    In an ideal experiment designed to test whether noneconomic factors influence intergroup
violence, one might manipulate the psychological state of all the individuals within a group
and observe whether the overall level of violence between that group and nearby groups
changed. That experiment is clearly neither feasible nor desirable, so instead we leverage
an emerging “stylized fact” in the environment-economy literature: the frequently observed
positive relationship between changes in temperature and human conflict (Hsiang et al.,
2013). This temperature-conflict relationship has now been documented across diverse ge-
ographic settings and for many types of human conflict, ranging from institutional collapse
to civil war, riots, and crime, and estimate effect sizes in these studies are often large. For
instance, recent meta-analyses report average effect sizes of a roughly 10% increase in in-
tergroup violence per 1σ increase in temperature (Burke et al., 2015). This implies a large
historical role for temperature variation in shaping conflict risk, and an even larger potential
role for future climate change in shaping these outcomes, given the anticipated >4σ increase
in temperature expected across much of the tropics over the next century.

   Why might changes in temperature induce violence and conflict, and what can this tell us
about the broader economic and noneconomic underpinnings of violence? Economists often


                                               2
interpret the temperature-conflict relationship as an income effect: hotter temperatures and
lower rainfall are known to lower incomes, particularly in agricultural areas, and this in turn
could temporarily lower the opportunity cost of participation in violence. In an early study,
Miguel et al. (2004) provide empirical evidence that rainfall shocks that lower economic
growth also increase the likelihood of civil war in Sub-Saharan Africa. Chassang and Padró-
i-Miquel (2010) explain this result by developing a bargaining model in which violence occurs
when a shock to economic productivity temporarily lowers the opportunity cost to violence,
but does not affect the future value of winning the contest.

    This economic hypothesis about group-level violence, however, seems incomplete in that
it does not account for the observed response of individual-level violence to daily or even
hourly variations in temperature, as income is unlikely to change over these short periods
(Jacob et al., 2007, Card and Dahl, 2009, Larrick and et al, 2011, Ranson, 2014). Vrij
et al. (1994) offer perhaps the clearest case, where police officers were observed utilizing
more violence during a training exercise when temperature in the room was manipulated
to be hotter, which clearly was unrelated to economic incentives. In another laboratory
experiment, which is unfortunately poorly documented, Rohles (1967) reports,

     “When [participants] were subjected to high temperatures in groups of 48, there
     was continual arguing needling, agitating, jibing, fist-fighting, threatening, and
     even an attempted knifing. At lower temperatures or in small groups, this be-
     havior diminished.”

Thus, while inter-personal violence is often conceived in economics as an action with private
costs and benefits that also imposes costs on others (Becker, 1968), and which agents may
apply rationally to affect the allocation of resources (Donohue and Levitt 1998, Chimeli and
Soares 2011, Castillo et al. 2014), it is also understood that noneconomic factors may play
a role and are likely partially responsible for generating the temperature-violence link.

    Given that most instances of group-level violence are, at the most basic level, implemented
by individuals, this then suggests a potential additional role for noneconomic factors in
intergroup violence. Consider the group member on the front lines of a conflict who is
personally implementing violence on behalf of a group’s strategic objectives. There are
many decision points where non-economic psychological factors likely play an important role
in this individual’s decision making, with the individual having some discretion in exactly
how much violence to employ when contact with the opponent actually occurs. If the agent
enjoys violence they may employ more of it, and if the agent dislikes violence they may
employ less. Should there be many ways for these types of noneconomic factors to influence
the overall level of violence employed by individuals in the group, then these noneconomic

                                              3
factors must be considered important elements in intergroup conflict.

    We propose a unified framework in which both interpersonal and intergroup violence
are influenced by economic and noneconomic factors, although their relative influence may
differ (making it ultimately an empirical question). We expand a standard economic model
of violence to include a pure consumption value of violence to the aggressor, which we
model as a positive or negative input into utility depending on an individual’s “taste for
violence.”1 Introducing this single noneconomic factor and allowing it to respond positively
to temperature, as indicated by prior analyses, substantially improves the ability of the
model to account for observed patterns of intergroup violence.

    We then test multiple hypotheses generated by this unified model in Mexico, a context
where exceptional levels of violence by drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs) motivated law
enforcement to gather separate data on intergroup homicides. This allows us to observe vari-
ation in comparable group-level and individual-level acts of violence, i.e. homicides in both
cases, in a single context where geographical, political, and institutional factors can be “held
fixed.” This provides a unique opportunity to sharply compare the effect of temperature
on both interpersonal and intergroup violence without this comparison being confounded by
these contextual differences that usually differ between studies.2 Such comparisons allow us
to more precisely consider whether these two types of violence share a common noneconomic
mechanism.

    Consistent with earlier meta-analyses, we show that higher monthly temperatures have
a positive and significant effect on both killings by drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs)
and “normal” homicides in Mexico. Effects in both cases are contemporaneous, large in
magnitude, and generalizable across regions in Mexico. We find that a one standard deviation
increase in temperature is associated with a 28% increase in drug-related killings and 5%
increase in regular homicides.
   1
    In a similar vein, Tauchen et al. (1991), Farmer and Tiefenthaler (1997), Bowlus and Seitz (2006), and
Aizer (2010) explain domestic violence as expressive behavior that provides positive utility to some men.
Their partners tolerate it in return for higher transfers. Card and Dahl (2009) adopt this interpretation of
family violence as motivation to consider the role for emotional cues (or “visceral factors”) in precipitating
violence. They use unexpected losses in football games as the trigger for emotional cues. A key contribution
here is to extend this framework beyond domestic violence and to introduce these psychological factors into
the rapidly growing literature on intergroup conflict. Blattman et al. (2017) provide experimental evidence
on the role noncognitive skills and preferences play in shaping violence.
   2
    Hsiang et al. (2013) compare results from 60 studies and find that the average effect of temperature on
interpersonal violence differs substantially from the effect on intergroup violence. However, each study only
examined one form of violence and none were from comparable contexts (e.g. civil war in African countries
vs. cases of domestic abuse in a town in Australia), so it is difficult to draw strong inferences from any
cross-study differences.



                                                      4
    We next use a variety of approaches to look directly for evidence of an economic mech-
anism that might explain these results. We find that such a mechanism can only partially
explain patterns in DTO killings, and it has almost no explanatory power in the case of
general homicides. For instance, changes in temperature have no comparable effect on non-
violent and clearly economic crimes committed by DTOs, such as extortion and car theft,
which we would expect to respond similarly to temperature if both were caused by a single
mechanism. Similarly, random variation in the level of government social assistance through
the large scale Progresa/Oportunidades program has limited effect in dampening the effect
of high temperatures on group conflict, growing season temperatures matter little for har-
vest season violence, and other measures of economic conditions and inequality have limited
predictive power in explaining the temperature-violence relationship.

    We then ask whether psychological factors better explain the link between temperature
and violence. Because inducing experimental variation in these factors is not possible, our
approach is to ask whether patterns in the temperature response of intergroup violence mir-
rors the response of an outcome known to be heavily influenced by psychological factors:
suicide. By introducing data on suicides in Mexico, we layer a third form of violence (intrap-
ersonal violence) onto our two parallel data sets on interpersonal and intergroup violence in
this single context. We show that suicides also respond strongly to variation in temperature,
and that the pattern of this response closely matches what is observed for group-level vio-
lence across numerous dimensions: the response is linear, contemporaneous, common across
regions, not mediated by observable economic factors or Progresa/Opportunidades, and only
barely affected by growing season temperatures. Because suicide is strongly linked to mental
illness and depression in the medical literature, and because evidence (including laboratory
studies) link high temperatures to psychological responses that govern aggressive and vio-
lent behavior, we consider it a “benchmark” phenomena and interpret this pattern-matching
exercise as evidence that psychological factors likely play an important role in temperature’s
effect on group violence.

    In addition to our primary contribution on the potential role of psychology in intergroup
violence, our work also contributes to the rapidly growing literature linking climate and
conflict (Burke et al., 2015). We do this by adding two novel outcomes to the “spectrum
of violence” known to be affected by climatic events (Figure 1): gang killings and suicides.
Gangs are smaller and less organized than armed militias but larger and more organized than
spontaneous groups, such as mobs, both of which have been previously linked to the climate.
Suicides have been largely unexplored in relation to climate in the economics literature. By
further expanding and filling in this spectrum of social phenomena affected by climate, this
work further strengthens our confidence and understanding that climatic conditions play


                                              5
a fundamental role in shaping the peacefulness of modern societies (Hsiang et al., 2013).
Furthermore, by providing evidence on the factors mediating the temperature-conflict link,
our work contributes to a broader understanding of how we might manage the potential
societal impacts of a warming planet. Unfortunately for this particular setting, our results
suggest that economic interventions might have little success in mitigating the impacts of
future warming on violence.

    The next section discusses some background and non-economic factors in violence. Sec-
tion 3 offers a simple theoretical framework that builds on previous research to highlight and
operationalize the role of non-economic factors. Section 4 presents our data and discusses
our empirical strategy. In Sections 5, 6, and 7 we present and discuss our main set of results.
Finally, Section 8 offers some conclusions.


2       Understanding Violence

2.1     Drug trafficking in Mexico

Mexico has experienced a large increase in violence in recent years, in large part due to the
activities of drug trafficking organizations and the government’s response to these activities.
Sophisticated organizations trafficking illegal drugs from Mexico to the U.S. first appeared
in the 1990s (Grillo, 2012) but have since grown in size and sophistication, and DTOs now
constitute a powerful industry that earns between 14 and 48 billion USD annually (U.S. State
Department, 2009). These organizations also carry out other criminal activities including
extortion and kidnapping, especially in recent years (Rios, 2014). The exact number of
DTOs operating varies by year, but it is generally agreed that they rose from 6 in 2007 to
approximately 16 in 2010 (Guerrero, 2012a). Many of these new organizations are factions
of older groups, an event that tends to occur after leaders are arrested or killed as a result
of conflicts within and between organizations.3

    Accompanying the large increase in DTOs was a large escalation of violence beginning in
2007, which has since claimed over 50,000 lives (Dell, 2015) and which has been the focus of
much media and academic attention. Following the presidential election of 2006, president
Felipe Calderón declared war on the drug trafficking organizations. Shortly after this event,
    3
    In 2008, for example, the Sinaloa’s leader was captured and, as a consequence, this organization split.
Right after this event, a war between Sinaloa cartel and La Famila Michoacana began. The state of Guerrero,
where both cartels operated in previous years, was the site for most of the violence associated with this fight
(Guerrero 2012b and Rios 2013). Guerrero (2011a) discusses the issue of DTO fractionalisation in greater
detail. See Table A.1 for characteristics of DTOs.


                                                      6
crackdowns spread through the country, and violence escalated to unprecedented levels (see
Merino 2011, Guerrero 2011b, and Escalante 2011). Several factors have been offered as
causes of this escalation: (1) Felipe Calderón’s strategy against organized crime, i.e. direct
crackdowns and captures of DTO leaders (Guerrero 2010, Calderón et al. 2013, Chaidez
2014, Dell 2015), (2) U.S.–Colombia efforts to reduce drug flows between both countries, a
supply shock that affects drug markets in Mexico (Castillo et al., 2014), and (3) exogenous
movements in the international price of corn, which is the main staple crop in Mexico and
whose price affects the opportunity cost of joining the drug industry (Dube et al., 2014).
The relative contribution of each of these factors is, however, a matter of ongoing debate
among scholars. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to link DTO violence to climate
shocks.


2.2      Non-economic factors in violence

A large body of economics research has dissected the economic logic for violence and docu-
mented the role that economic factors can play in violence in many settings (Miguel et al.,
2004, Angrist and Kugler, 2008, Berman et al., 2011, Besley and Persson, 2011, Dube and
Vargas, 2013).4 This work would also seem to provide a prima facie explanation for the now
well-documented role that changes in temperature appear to play in instigating violence and
human conflict (Hsiang et al., 2013, Burke et al., 2015), given that changes in temperature
are also known to induce variation in both agricultural and non-agricultural incomes (Dell
et al., 2012, Hsiang, 2010).

    Accumulating scientific evidence, however, also points toward an important role for phys-
iological and psychological factors in explaining certain types of human violence, and im-
portantly (for our purposes) also the potential for temperature to shape these non-economic
factors. For instance, the psychological roots of intrapersonal violence – i.e. suicide – have
been well documented, and the role of temperature in this particular type of violence as well
as in interpersonal human aggression have been explored since at least the 1930s.5 While sci-
entific understanding of temperature regulation in the human body remains imperfect (e.g.,
Hammel 1974, Werner 1980, Cooper 2002, and Mekjavic and Eiken 2006)), there is growing
evidence that neural structures are directly involved in this process (Benzinger, 1970, Morri-
son et al., 2008, Ray et al., 2011). This is important because particular nerotransmitters that
have been shown to participate in body temperature regulation – in particular, serotonin
   4
       See Appendix A.1 for a brief review of the literature estimating the negative consequences of violence.
   5
     See Appendix A.2 for a review of the literature estimating the relationship between temperature and
suicide and the seasonality of suicides. For example, Baron and Bell (1976) show that individuals were more
likely to behave aggressively towards others when ambient temperature was higher.

                                                        7
– have also been linked to mood, emotion, and range of important human behaviors (Na-
tional Institutes of Health, 2011, Lovheim, 2012). For serotonin specifically, there is growing
consensus that decreased serotonergic neurotransmission in the brain may be an important
neurobiological deficit that leads to aggressive behavior (Edwards and Kravitz, 1997, Seo
et al., 2008).

    Thus there appears to be support in the medical literature for a physiological link be-
tween temperature and violent behavior: when ambient temperature increases, serotonin
levels decrease, with attendant effects on impulsive and aggressive behavior. This link has
been implicated in intrapersonal violence (suicide) and there are a couple of recent studies
providing strong evidence that psychological channels can explain the effect of temperature
on interpersonal violence and criminal activity (Garg et al., 2018, Cohen and Gonzalez, 2018).
Garg et al. (2018) use daily weather and homicide data to estimate contemporaneous effects
and do not find any evidence of harvesting behavior. They estimate the effects separately
for weekdays and weekends, when alcohol consumption is likely to be higher, and compare
the effect of temperature on domestic versus non-domestic violence. Overall, their results
substantiate the importance of psychological factors in explaining the effect of temperature
on violence. They find that the effects are partially mitigated by Progresa cash transfers
and are stronger where air conditioning penetration is lower. Cohen and Gonzalez (2018)
also exploit daily weather and criminal activity data from Mexico and implement a similar
estimation strategy as Garg et al. (2018). They find a positive and linear contemporaneous
relationship between temperature and criminal activity. They find strong effects on violent
crimes, small effects on property damage and thefts and drug related crimes, and long-lasting
effects on accusations of rape and sexual aggression. To disentangle mechanisms they look
into the circumstances of weather-induced crimes; they find that 90% are intentional, nearly
10% are due to the increased consumption of alcohol, 17% are due to changes in time allo-
cation during weekends, and 28% are committed at night. The results of these two studies
complement ours in pointing to the role of non-economic factors in explaining the impact of
temperature on measures of violence.6 In comparison to these studies, our goal is to under-
stand whether non-economic factors are important enough to also play a role in group-level
violence in general, and more specifically to compare the extent to which they mediate the
observed responsiveness of both interpersonal and group violence to changes in temperature.
   6
    It should be noted that this study and the studies by Garg et al. (2018) and Cohen and Gonzalez (2018)
are contemporaneous.




                                                    8
3    Theoretical Framework

To understand how these non-economic physiological and psychological factors might com-
plement the standard way in which economists have understood the logic of violence, we
develop a simple model of violence that builds on the framework in Chassang and Padró-i-
Miquel (2010) but incorporates a new potential mechanism affecting how high temperature
can lead to violence. In the model, two sides, i ∈ I = {1, 2}, decide whether or not to engage
in costly violence and redistribution when bargaining fails. The players cannot commit to
not engage in conflict for an infinite number of periods, where time is indexed by t. Each
player combines l units of labor, which we normalize to l = 1, with productivity θt .

    The sides can engage in two possible actions, namely being violent or peaceful, a ∈ A =
{V, P }, which they choose simultaneously. Both groups want to maximize their economic
output at the end of the game. If one player attacks first, then it has a first strike advantage
and captures all of the opponent’s output with probability p > 0.5. An attack costs both
the aggressor and defender a fraction c ∈ (0, 1] of output. If both agents choose to attack
simultaneously, they each win with probability 0.5. Additionally, we assume there is common
knowledge of a non-rival psychological consumption value for violence, which is a function
of temperature τ , i.e. γt = γt (τ ) with ∂γ∂τ
                                            t (τ )
                                                   > 0, and γt (τ ) ∈ R. If γt (τ ) > 0 then the player
gains positive utility from violence. We omit the argument, τ , in setting up the model, but
return to it when discussing its role in explaining violence through different channels.

    We consider a dynamic model where the two groups interact in every period t. There
is at most one round of fighting and the winning group reaps the benefits of its prize into
the future. If there is no attack in the current period, then each agent expects a peaceful
continuation value V P , which is the discounted (δ) per capita utility of expected future
consumption from the player’s initial assets and which captures expectations of future values
of all parameters. Similarly, if one side wins, then they have a continuation value of winning
V V which is the per capita expected utility from consumption of both their initial assets and
the assets that they capture from their opponent.

    We can write the condition for peace, incorporating the psychological consumption value
for violence, γt , as:

                             θt + δV P       > p(2θt (1 − c) + δV V ) + γt                         (1)
                             | {z }            |           {z            }
                            value of peace              value of violence


In interpreting the above, a player finds it privately beneficial to choose peace if the per
capita value of consuming all output with initial assets plus discounted expected utility


                                                    9
under peace δV P (left hand side) exceeds the expected utility of consumption from both
the player’s original assets and captured assets, less expenditures on the conflict, plus the
expected continuation value pδV V and the psychological consumption value of violence (right
hand side).

        We then rearrange (1) so that the condition for peace becomes:

                               θt (1 − 2p(1 − c)) − γt > δ[pV V − V P ]                                     (2)

where the left side of the inequality is the marginal value of peace in the current period
weighed against the discounted marginal expected utility from attacking on the right side.

   In considering the mechanism, the economics literature on conflict has focused on the
impact of temperature on θt in explaining violence. The left hand side of (2) shows that if
economic conditions are sufficiently bad (i.e., θt is sufficiently close to zero), and ignoring
psychological factors for the moment, conflict will occur. For example, a drought has a con-
temporaneous effect on productivity, which reduces the current opportunity cost of conflict
more than it alters the continuation value of peace (note that θt does not feature in the right
hand side).

    In the model above, we highlighted the importance of the non-rival psychological con-
sumption value for violence, γt . If climatic conditions influence γt by increasing the utility
(or decreasing the psychological cost) of acting violently, i.e., ∂γ∂τ
                                                                    t (τ )
                                                                           > 0, then these changes
may increase the likelihood that (2) does not hold and violence occurs.7 That said if the
sides have a general dislike of violence (γt (τ ) < 0), then there will be less conflict than that
predicted by economic factors alone.


4        Empirical Framework

4.1       Data and descriptive statistics

We collected monthly information on reported homicides and suicides at the municipality
level from Mexico’s Bureau of Statistics (INEGI) for the period between January 1990 and

    7
     An alternative is to introduce a physiological mechanism discussed in the literature on cognition. A
number of studies have reported the importance of environmental factors, such as heat, on cognitive perfor-
mance (Mackworth 1946, Fine and Kobrick 1978). Fine and Kobrick (1978) found that heat has significant
effects on the ability of individuals to perform complex cognitive tasks involved in artillery fire and in which
they were trained. In the above model, we can think of this effect as an additive error term, , whose variance
increases with temperature, in which the players simply err in making their decision to fight, a decision they
might not male at lower temperatures.

                                                      10
December 2010.8 This data corresponds to the universe of homicides and suicides officially
reported. To avoid confounding with the Mexican Drug War, we split this time frame in
a “pre-war” period between January of 1990 and December of 2006, and a “war” period
between January of 2007 and December of 2010. Our empirical analysis focuses on the pre-
war period when analyzing homicides and suicides, and on the war period when studying
drug-related killings (henceforth DTO killings). In the pre-war period there were a total of
218,970 homicides and 55,206 suicides, with a monthly per municipality average (standard
deviation) of 0.44 (2.49) and 0.11 (0.77), respectively.

    The empirical analysis uses the total number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants as the
dependent variable, as is standard in the literature (see Hsiang et al. 2013). Figure 2 shows
the time series and cross sectional variation for DTO killings and homicides for all munic-
ipalities. Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for these variables in the two periods of
interest. We observe an average of 0.98 homicides and 0.21 suicides per 100,000 inhabitants
per municipality-month in the pre-war period, and an average of 0.83 homicides and 0.26
suicides between years 2007 and 2010. The variation in these variables is substantial, as
shown by the within standard deviations of 5.23 and 1.93 for homicides and suicides respec-
tively. At the state level, some have as many as 6.2 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants – an
extremely high homicide rate.9

    Monthly data on DTO killings was compiled by a committee with representatives from all
ministries that are members of the National Council of Public Security in Mexico. This data
is available for the period starting in December 2006 to December 2010 at the municipality
level. The characteristics of each killing occurring in this period were analyzed by the
committee to determine whether it corresponded to a killing that was linked to some drug
trafficking organization in Mexico. There were a total of 34,436 DTO killings between 2007
and 2010, with an average (standard deviation) of 0.29 (3.94) killings per municipality-
month. The variation in this variable is striking, with roughly 20% of state-months having
zero killings and some having as many as 452.10 Panel B in Table 1 presents descriptive
   8
    In this section we discuss the main variables to be used in the empirical analysis. Additional data, and
the corresponding descriptive statistics, can be found in Appendix B.
    9
      Monthly rate of 6.2 homicides in our dataset implies a rate of 74.4 homicides per 100,000 per year. This
is an extremely high homicide rate. To put this in perspective, the most violent country in the world in 2012
(Honduras) had a rate of 90.4 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, and the second most violent (Venezuela)
had a rate of 53.7. Figure A.1 also compare rates of these types of violence to the US. Homicide rates in
Mexico were twice as high in Mexico compared to the US in 2006 and have been rising every since. Suicide
rates, however, are substantially higher in the US. Finally, and not surprisingly, organized crime killings are
far higher in Mexico, a difference that has again been increasing since 2006.
  10
   Our results are robust to excluding states with a large upward trend in DTO killings, i.e. Baja California,
Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. Results are also robust to including state specific



                                                      11
statistics for this variable. DTO killings rates are roughly half the size of homicides rate
during this period, and the distribution is more skewed.

   Figure 2 shows time averages (weighted by population) for DTO killings (2007-2010)
and homicides (1990-2006) in all municipalities in Mexico. Homicides seem to be decreasing
during this time period, something analyzed in more detail by Escalante (2011).11

    Finally, we construct monthly temperature and precipitation for each municipality-month
using data from Willmott and Matsuura (2014). This is a gridded dataset with monthly in-
formation for cells of size 0.5 degrees.12 In order to transform this gridded dataset into a
municipality-level dataset, we take the average of temperature and the sum of precipitation
for all pixels inside the polygons that represent Mexican municipalities. Municipalities dur-
ing our sample period have an average temperature of 20 degrees celsius, with a standard
deviation of 5.0 degrees celsius. However, after removing municipality, year, and month
fixed effects, following our econometric specification (below), the standard deviation of this
variable at the municipality-month level is approximately 2.8 degrees celsius. Figure A.4
presents the distribution of temperature by period.


4.2    Econometric strategy

To estimate a causal link between temperature and our dependent variables of interest, we
follow Deschenes and Greenstone (2007), and the preferred method employed by Hsiang
et al. (2013) (see Dell et al. 2014 for a review). Accordingly, we control for unobservable
time-invariant factors at the municipality level that could be correlated with both average
temperatures and violence, unobserved shocks common to all municipalities within in a state
in a given year, and average seasonal patterns in both temperature and violence. Specifically,
in our preferred specification we estimate the following regression:

                   ynsmt = βTempnsmt + δPrecipnsmt + ξm + λt + ζn + εnsmt                                 (3)

trends, as discussed below.
  11
    Dube and Ponce (2012) study violence in Mexico before 2006. These authors find that an expiration that
relaxed the permissiveness of gun sales caused an increase of roughly 239 deaths annually in municipalities
close to the relevant state borders.
  12
    “Gridded weather datasets use interpolation across space and time to combine available weather station
data into a balanced panel of observations on a fixed spatial scale or grid. This approach deals with the
problem of missing observations at a given station or missing data because a station does/did not exist at a
particular location. (...) Each “grid” approximates a weather measure for the spatial unit by interpolating
the daily station data while accounting for elevation, wind direction, rain shadows, and many other factors.”,
(Auffhammer et al., 2013).



                                                     12
where ynsmt is the number of DTO killings, homicides, or suicides per 100,000 inhabitants
in municipality n, state s, month m, and year t; α is a constant term; ξm and λt are full
sets of month and year fixed effects; ζn is a full set of municipality fixed effects, respectively;
Tempnsmt is average temperature, measured in degrees celsius; Precipnsmt is total precipi-
tation, measured in thousands of millimeters; and εnsmt is an error term clustered at the
state level. In robustness tests, we also estimate equation (3) adding state-specific linear
time trends (to account for differential state-level trends in, for instance, policies to fight
violence), or replacing the month-of-year fixed effects ξm with state-by-month-of-year fixed
effects ξsm —to account for state specific seasonality in violence and temperature; there is
some evidence, for instance, in seasonality in suicides in particular (Ajdacic-Gross et al.,
2010). Our main coefficients of interest are β and δ, which are identified through natural
exogenous fluctuations in weather conditions, conditional on location and time effects. After
demonstrating that our results are robust across specifications, we report results from (3)
for most of the analyses.

    We also present temperature response functions using the number of days in a set of bins
and estimates of the effect of leads and lags of temperature on violence. The latter exercise
is important for a number of reasons. First, there may be temporal displacement: it may be
the case that an event that would have occurred in the future anyway is triggered earlier by
extreme climatic conditions. With full displacement, the contemporaneous and lagged effects
would be of similar magnitude but opposite in sign, and there would be no overall effect
of climate on violence. Even with partial displacement, a sole focus on contemporaneous
impacts could overstate the total effect of a change in temperature.

    Lags can also be useful in identifying delayed or persistent effects. For example, a negative
temperature shock during the growing season in an agricultural based economy may increase
violence during the harvest season when income for the farming season is realized (a delayed
effect), or a weather shock could trigger a conflict that persists for multiple periods.

   Finally, the temporal pattern of response to temperature shocks could also shed light on
the mechanism underpinning the response. Given that we are using monthly data, certain
income effects (such as the agricultural income story just told) might be expected to show
up with a few-month lag. Physiological responses, on the other hand, would be expected to
show up contemporaneously, given the immediacy with which the body’s thermoregulatory
function is employed.




                                                13
    To explore these temporal dynamics, we estimate the following regression:

                     k=t+6
                      X                      k=t+6
                                              X
          ynsmt =            βk Tempnsmk +           δk Precipnsmk + ξm + λt + ζn + εnsmt     (4)
                     k=t−6                   k=t−6


where all variables are defined as before, and we include six monthly leads and six lags
of temperature. Our interest lies in the parameters βk and δk . In particular, a violation
of our identification assumption would be reflected in any of the coefficients (βt+1 , ..., βt+6 )
being statistically different from zero, i.e., future climate variation should not be correlated
with past violence. Persistent effects or displacement would translate into the coefficients
(βt−6 , ..., βt−1 ) being statistically different from zero.


5    Climate and Violence

Figure 3 displays non-parametrically the relationship between temperature and our mea-
sures of group and interpersonal violence (DTO killings and homicides, respectively), with
municipality-, year-, and month-fixed effects partialled out of both the dependent variables
and temperature. The x-axis is interpreted as deviations (in degrees celsius) from the average
temperature in a given municipality-month, and the y-axis is interpreted as percentage de-
viation from the municipality-month average. A one standard deviation in the temperature
variable corresponds to 2.8 degrees celsius. The thick line corresponds to the non-parametric
conditional mean, while lighter colors depict the 95 percent confidence interval. These tem-
perature response functions are clearly upward sloping for both variables, and appear roughly
linear through most of the temperature support.

    Table 2 presents regression results from estimating equation (3) under various sets of
fixed effects. To facilitate the interpretation of these coefficients, and comparison across
outcomes and studies, standardized effects are presented in square brackets, which we express
as percentage change in the dependent variable per one standard deviation change in the
climate variable of interest. The first three columns show results using DTO killings per
100,000 inhabitants as dependent variable, and the last three show corresponding results for
homicides in the pre-2007 period.

    Several interesting patterns emerge. First, we observe a positive and significant effect of
temperature on both intergroup and interpersonal violence, a result that is robust across all
specifications. The magnitude of these estimates varies across columns, but is particularly
large for DTO killings: in our base specification (Column 1), we find that a 1σ increase in
temperature in a given month is associated with a 28% increase in the rate of DTO killings.

                                                14
This result is robust to inclusion of either state-specific time trends or state-month FE. Given
the large level of killings during this period – over 34,000 DTO killings over the 2007-2010
period – a 22% increase is large in both percentage and absolute terms. The roughly 5% effect
for homicides is smaller in magnitude, but is also substantial given again the high homicide
rate in the country over the period (285,000 total homicides during the 1990-2010 period).
We find no statistically significant effect of precipitation on either intergroup or interpersonal
violence, and in all specifications we can confidently reject large effects of precipitation. The
effects of climate on violence in Mexico appear to occur through temperature.

    Anticipating our more formal treatment of treatment-effect heterogeneity below, in Figure
A.2 we explore whether there are apparent spatial patterns in the responsiveness of DTO
killings or homicides to temperature. We estimate state-specific responses of violence to
temperature, and display these in the figure as the ratio of the state-specific estimate to the
pooled country-wide estimate reported in Columns 1 or 4 of Table 2 – i.e. ββbs,y . Although
                                                                                 b
                                                                                   y
there is some apparent variation in estimated effects across states, results are remarkably
homogenous: point estimates are positive in all states for DTO killings and positive in
all but one state for homicides, the ratio of state-specific estimates to pooled estimates is
near unity for most states, and in the case of DTO killings, in only 4 out of 32 states do
confidence intervals on state-specific estimates not contain the pooled estimate (equivalent
to 13% of states, only slightly higher than what sampling variability alone would predict).
For homicide, there does appear to be somewhat more variation in effect sizes across states,
with 38% of state-specific confidence intervals not containing the country-wide estimate (8
estimates are significantly larger than the pooled estimate, 4 are smaller). Below we explore
more extensively whether economic factors can explain this heterogeneity.

    Finally, as shown in Figure 4, our benchmark estimates of how intergroup and inter-
personal violence respond to temperature in Mexico are remarkably consistent with other
reported temperature-conflict estimates from the literature (none of which were from Mex-
ico). Figure 4 plots the distribution of standardized coefficients from an earlier meta-analysis
(Hsiang et al., 2013), showing in the bottom two panels either the 24 studies from Hsiang
et al. (2013) that examined intergroup conflict or the 12 studies that examined interpersonal
conflict. The estimated effects for DTO killings and homicides from Mexico lie within the
expected distributions for intergroup and interpersonal conflict, respectively.




                                               15
6     Economic Factors

6.1   Less-violent DTO criminal activities

Can economic factors explain the strong and robust relationship between temperature and
violence in Mexico? In the absence of a way to experimentally manipulate the income of drug-
trafficking organizations, we approach the problem indirectly from a number of angles. Our
first approach is to observe whether other less violent but plausibly economically-motivated
DTO criminal activities also respond similarly to temperature. Besides killings, drug traffick-
ing organizations are also known for other criminal activities such as kidnappings, extortion,
and car thefts. These crimes appear to have a clear economic motivation, and so if economic
factors such as income are what is mediating how DTO violence responds to temperature,
a similar temperature response might be evident in these similarly economically-motivated
activities.

    We assembled administrative data on the monthly occurrence of kidnappings, extortion,
and car thefts during the period between January of 2007 and December of 2010. Unfor-
tunately these data is not available at the municipality level but at the state level instead.
Table 3 present the estimates of interest, and include our main results on DTO killings and
homicides for comparison. Strikingly, we do not observe any significant relationship between
temperature and these other criminal activities. In fact, estimated coefficients have a nega-
tive sign in the case extortions and kidnappings, although not statistically significant, and
the effect on car thefts is fairly small and not statistically significant. Temperatures ap-
pear to increase violent crime but not these less-violent but economically-motivated criminal
activities.


6.2   Income, unemployment, and inequality

Our second approach is to look directly at whether municipality-level income variables medi-
ate the temperature-violence relationship. To do this, we augment equation (3) and include
an interaction term between temperature and various measures of income or income inequal-
ity at the municipality level. In particular, we examine interactions with municipality-level
income and with the municipality-level Gini coefficient.

    Results are shown in Table 4. We find little evidence that these municipality-level mea-
sures of income mediate the temperature-violence relationship. For the per-capita income
measure, the interaction has the expected sign for DTO killings, but is statistically insignif-
icant and the coefficient is small: a one standard deviation increase in log GDP per capita,

                                              16
which we think of as being a fairly large increase in income, attenuates the effect of tempera-
ture on DTO killings by 13 percent (−0.008/0.063 ≈ 0.13). The interaction in the homicide
regression is also statistically insignificant, and is of the opposite sign than expected.

    Another economic measures is economic inequality, measured here with time-invariant
municipality-level Gini coefficients (constructed by Jensen and Rosas (2007)). Income in-
equality has been argued in the literature to be an important driver of violence and conflict
in different settings. But as shown in the table, it does not appear to substantially affect how
either intergroup or interpersonal violence respond to temperature in Mexico. In the case of
DTO killings, a one standard deviation in inequality decreases the effect of temperature on
violence by roughly 12 percent, but it is not statistically significant.

    Finally, we explore the mediating influence of two other variables that are typically
correlated with income: the adoption of air conditioning (typically positively correlated
with income), and municipality-level average temperature (negatively correlated with income
across countries as well as across Mexican states). Air conditioning could be viewed as an
income-related adaptation, and as such could represent an alternative pathway through which
higher incomes could break the link between temperature and violence. The “mediating”
effect of higher average temperatures on the response of violence to temperature deviations
is perhaps more subtle. One the one hand, states with higher average temperatures might
be more adapted to hot temperatures, and thus less effected by additional increases in
temperature. On the other hand, if the underlying temperature response is non-linear (as
in agricultural productivity), then additional heat exposure on top of an already high mean
should induce a more negative response.

    Results of including air conditioning penetration or average temperature as interaction
variables are show in rows 3 and 4 of Table 4. Neither variable appears to explain how violence
responds to temperature: coefficients in both cases are small in magnitude and statistically
insignificant. Thus we find little additional evidence of income-induced adaptation (at least
through the AC channel), nor strong evidence that hotter average temperatures reduce
impacts (through adaptation) or worsen them (through non-linearities).


6.3   Quasi-experimental variation in monetary transfers

Our third approach to studying the role of economic factors is to exploit the roll-out of a
large-scale cash transfer program, Progresa, which induced quasi-experimental variation
in income across much of Mexico during our study period. Progresa is a very large
program, with a budget of approximately 133 million USD in 1997 (roughly 0.03% of GDP),
which has since expanded to almost 5 billion USD in 2010 (roughly 0.5% of GDP). We

                                              17
observe bimonthly transfers to every municipality during the period between January 1998
and December of 2009 from administrative sources. Importantly, cash transfers in this
program targeted women with children, and so we cannot be certain the extent of income
variation that the program induced among the population likely to participate in DTO
related activities (young men).13 Nevertheless, we augment our main regression equation by
including the logarithm of Progresa transfers as an additional independent variable, and
an interaction term between this variable and temperature.

    Results from this exercise are presented in Table 5. First, transfers alone seem to de-
crease the rate of DTO killings, although the effect is relatively modest and not statistically
significant: an increase of 10 percent in transfers decreases killings by 0.1 percent. The
effect is smaller in the case of homicides and not statistically significant. Regarding the in-
teraction term, the coefficient is also negative and marginally significant in the case of DTO
killings, which suggests transfers also modestly decrease the local sensitivity of violence to
temperature, but it is again a fairly precise estimated zero in the case of homicides.

   In Figure A.5 we also incorporated an interaction term between leads and lags of Pro-
gresa transfers and temperature and we reach the same conclusion: transfers modestly
decrease DTO killings, but only contemporaneously, these have no effect on homicides, and
the interaction term is marginally significant and negative only for the case of DTO killings.
Overall, it seems that even large monetary transfers to poor households in a very high-profile
anti-poverty social assistance program can only slightly reduce levels of intergroup violence
and have no effect in the case of interpersonal violence – again subject to the caveat that
we cannot be sure how much of this income reached those individuals likely to participate
in DTO activities.


6.4    Harvest and growing season effects

Our final approach to exploring the role of economic factors is to study whether temperature
shocks during economically critical periods have a greater impact on violence compared to
shocks at other times in the year. In particular, as a substantial portion of the Mexican
labor force continues to earn their living in agriculture (roughly 15%), and as agricultural
income has been one of the most salient variables emphasized in the literature as a potential
mediating factor between climate and conflict, we examine the effect of temperature during
the growing and harvest seasons relative to during non-agricultural seasons. More precisely,
  13
     This is one reason our results likely diverge from Fetzer (2014), who shows that the relationship between
monsoon shocks and insurgent conflict is largely eliminated in India after the introduction of a public
employment program (NREGA) that guaranteed wage labor to everyone.


                                                     18
we construct an indicator variable that takes the value of one for the months of April to
September, which is considered the rainy season for the majority of Mexico and includes
both the canicula and pre-canicula period.14 The harvest season indicator variable, on the
other hand, takes on a value of one during the months of October to December.

    We perform two different analyses. In the first one, we simply augment our main re-
gression equation with an interaction between temperature and the indicator variable for
the growing season. Our expectation is that this interaction will be positive if agricultural
income is a mediating factor and if agricultural incomes (e.g. wages) respond rapidly to
changes in temperature. Given that these income shocks might occur with some lag, with
hot temperatures during the growing season only showing up as negative incomes shocks af-
ter crops have been harvested a few months later, our second approach studies how violence
in the harvest season reacts to temperature shocks during the growing season.

    Results are shown in Table 6. We find that temperature shocks during the growing season
appear to reduce DTO killings somewhat, the opposite of what the agricultural income story
would suggest, with the coefficient on the interaction not significant at conventional levels.
For the test on whether growing season shocks affect harvest season violence, point estimates
for both DTO killings and homicides are positive, but standard errors are too large to be
able to rule out either zero effect or large positive or negative effects. Finally, we also include
interaction terms with the percentage of households living in rural areas and the percentage
of workers in the agricultural sector, and find similar results. Taken as a whole, these results
provide little evidence that agricultural income is the critical mediating factor.


7        The role of non-economic factors in violence

Overall, results from section 6 suggest that economic factors have only limited power to ex-
plain the observed effect between temperature and both intergroup and interpersonal violence
in Mexico. We find that changes in temperature do not affect other economically motivated
non-violent crimes, that other measures of economic conditions such as municipality-level
income do not predict the temperature response, that random variation in governmental in-
come assistance have only a modest dampening effect, and that growing season temperature
shocks are not differentially harmful. None of these results is independently definitive, but
together they suggest that economic factors are unlikely to be the driving force in explaining
the large response of violence to temperature in this setting.
    14
     Canicula is a mid-summer drought period in Mexico. Both the growing and harvest season were specified
following Skoufias (2012), who examines the effect of weather shocks on household welfare in Mexico.



                                                   19
    Could psychological factors instead explain the link between temperature and violence?
Because inducing experimental variation in these factors is both impossible and likely highly
undesirable, our approach to understanding their potential role is again indirect. In par-
ticular, our basic approach is a “pattern-matching” exercise, where we study whether the
response pattern of group violence to temperature matches the response pattern of another
type of violence that is almost certainly lined to psychological factors – intrapersonal vio-
lence, i.e. suicide.

    Suicide has long been understood to have a substantial psychological component. For
instance, the medical literature tells us that psychiatric disorders are reported present in at
least 90% of suicides (Mann et al., 2005), propensity toward suicidal behavior is strongly
associated with genetic inheritance (Brent and Melhem, 2008), and randomized controlled
trials suggest that suicide risk can be substantially shaped both by medications and by
psychotherapy (Mann et al., 2005). Researchers have also long recognized the role that
changes in temperature might play in shaping suicide risk, although the literature is currently
inconclusive as to whether stark seasonal patterns in suicide (which characteristically peak
during warm spring and summer months) are due to temperature per se or to other factors
that also vary seasonally (see Appendix A.2 for a review of this literature).

    Using an identical econometric strategy to that used for DTO killings and homicides
above, we begin by showing that suicides in Mexico also respond strongly to deviations from
average temperature. The non-parametric relationship between suicide and temperature is
shown in Figure 5, and corresponding regression results are given in the first column of
Table 8. As with DTO killings and homicides, the temperature-suicide relationship appears
strongly linear, with an estimated standardized effect of a 7% increase in suicide per σ
increase in temperature (Table 8). This estimate falls between the estimated effects for DTO
killings and homicides. As with these latter outcomes, the suicide response also appears fairly
homogenous across states, with positive estimates in all but 2 states (see Figure A.2-C).

    As with DTO killings and homicide, we then explore whether the temperature-suicide
relationship is mediated by economic factors. This is, in essence, a further gut check on
whether suicide is a fair “benchmark” for an outcome that we presume is mainly non-
economic in nature. Results from including interactions with income, inequality, Progresa
transfers, and growing season temperature are shown in the remaining columns of Table
8. Most coefficients on interactions are small and statistically insignificant, and the two
interactions with statistical significance have signs that go in the opposite direction than
what the typical income story would suggest: higher average incomes appear to slightly
worsen the impact of hot temperatures, and hotter-than-average growing seasons appear to
reduce the impact of temperature.

                                              20
    As a final “pattern matching” exercise, we study the temporal pattern of how intergroup,
interpersonal, and intrapersonal violence respond to temperature, using the leads/lags ap-
proach described in equation 4. As discussed above, studying the temporal pattern of re-
sponses can help shed additional light on mechanism, since income effects might be expected
to show up with some lag in monthly data but physiological effects should show up imme-
diately. Studying lags also allows us to understand whether contemporaneous effects are
simply “displacement”, causing violence to occur earlier than it would have otherwise, but
not changing the overall level of violence. Studying leads offers a simple placebo test, as
future temperature should not affect current violence.

    Results from estimating equation 4 on all three outcomes are shown in Figure 6, with
point estimates and confidence intervals for contemporaneous effects, 6 lags, and 6 leads
plotted for each outcome (for instance, a value of “-1” on the x-axis corresponds to the
effect of temperature in month t − 1 on violence in month t). Although estimates are
again more imprecise for DTO killings due to the smaller sample size, a number of common
patterns are apparent. First, statistically significant effects occur only in contemporaneous
periods for all three outcomes. That is, the most robust predictor of violence in a given
month is temperature in that month, suggesting that the primary effects of temperature are
immediate. We interpret this as additional evidence in favor of physiological mechanisms,
since these would be expected to respond immediately to temperature change.

   We also find evidence of some displacement, with lagged coefficients for both homicide
and suicides negative and (for suicides) significant. In absolute value, these coefficients are
about 1/3rd the size of the contemporaneous effects, suggesting that roughly one-third of the
temperature-induced increase in homicides and suicides were events that were likely to have
occurred anyway. Interestingly, we do not see a similar pattern for DTO killings, although
generally larger standard errors on the DTO estimates limit our ability to say anything very
precise. Finally, results on the leads (our placebo test) are largely reassuring, with most
point estimates of the 6 leads near zero and none statistically significant.

    We thus have two imperfect but consistent pieces of evidence that non-economic fac-
tors could explain some of the temperature-violence relationship. The first is that a known
psychologically-dependent outcome, suicide, responds strikingly similarly to changes in tem-
perature. We view the extent of this similarity as unlikely if suicide did not share some
underlying commonalities with these other forms of violence. The second is that the effect
of temperature on all types of violence that we measure is immediate – i.e. that it occurs
in the same month as the temperature shock – which is inconsistent with the most obvious
income-related stories in which temperature reduces agricultural output, given that the pe-
riod in which crops are sensitive to temperature is temporally disjoint from the period in

                                              21
which harvest income is realized. Again, each of these pieces of evidence on their own might
not be convincing, but together they suggest a substantial role for non-economic factors in
explaining how both intergroup and interpersonal violence in Mexico respond to changes in
temperature.


8   Conclusion

Using municipality by month variation in temperature, we find significant contemporaneous
effects of temperature on DTO killings, homicides, and suicides in Mexico. Estimated effects
are economically meaningful for each outcome, and imply that temperature can induce large
additional increase in violence on top of already high baseline levels of both DTO killings
and homicides. This is the first study to our knowledge to find such a similar relationship
across a spectrum of violence outcomes in a single setting, and our estimated effects are
surprisingly consistent with existing estimates in the literature from other settings.

    Using a variety of approaches and data, we then study whether economic factors likely
mediate this observed link between temperature and violence, or whether non-economic
factors are more likely at play. A constellation of evidence, including the limited influence
of a cash transfer program as well as comparison with economically-motivated non-violent
DTO crimes, indicate that economic factors can at best only partially explain the observed
relationship between temperature and violence. We present two pieces of evidence that
suggest a role for non-economic factors in explaining the temperature-violence link for group-
and interpersonal violence: the substantial similarity between how these outcomes respond
to temperature and how suicide responds to temperature, and the immediacy of the response
of these variables to changes in temperature.

    We draw two tentative policy implications from our findings. The first is that, at least in
this particular setting, economic interventions might not be an effective tool for shaping how
violence responds to changes in climate. Second, our results are equally pessimistic on the
role for adaptation in shaping this response, with neither higher average income levels nor
specific interventions that alter how individuals experience climate (i.e. air conditioning)
appearing to affect how violence responds to temperature. Reducing future temperature
increases through emissions mitigation, rather than trying to induce adaptation through
policy intervention (or hoping that it will occur on its own), thus unfortunately appears the
most fruitful strategy in this setting for limiting the violent consequences of climate change.

     Notes. Growing Season as an indicator for the months of April to September; this is considered the wet season for the majority of Mexico and
     includes both the canicula and pre-canicula period. Canicula is a mid-summer drought period in Mexico. The harvest season is during the months
     of October through December. We specified these months following Skoufias (2012) who look at the effect of weather shocks on household welfare in
     Mexico. All regressions control for precipitation and are weighted by population. Standard errors clustered at the state level in parenthesis. Levels
     of significance are reported as ***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1.
