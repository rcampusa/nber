Differentiated Accountability and Education Production: Evidence from NCLB Waivers

NBER Working Paper No. 23461
June 2017

                                         ABSTRACT

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education granted states the opportunity to apply for waivers
from the core requirements of No Child Left Behind (NCLB). In exchange, states implemented
systems of differentiated accountability in which they identified and intervened in their lowest-
performing schools (“Priority” schools) and schools with the largest achievement gaps between
subgroups of students (“Focus” schools). We use administrative data from Michigan in a series of
regression-discontinuity analyses to study the effects of these reforms on schools and students.
Overall, we find that neither reform had appreciable impacts on various measures of school
staffing, student composition, or academic achievement. We find some evidence that the Focus
designation led to small, short-run reductions in the within-school math achievement gap – but
that these reductions were driven by stagnant performance of lower-achieving students alongside
declines in the performance of their higher-achieving peers. These findings serve as a cautionary
tale for the capacity of the accountability provisions embedded in the recent reauthorization of
NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), to meaningfully improve student and school
outcomes.

I.      Introduction

        One of the central goals of K-12 education reform is to improve the performance of

chronically struggling schools and students. Test-based accountability has been the hallmark of

such reform efforts for decades. In the early 2000s, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act1

brought test-based accountability to scale across the United States by requiring states to

implement accountability systems that applied to all public schools and students. NCLB

mandated annual testing in reading and mathematics of students in grades 3 through 8 and at

least once in high school. States set annual goals for the share of students in the aggregate and in

specific demographic subgroups that should demonstrate proficiency on state-created, high-

stakes tests, with the proficiency target rising to 100 percent in the 2013-2014 academic year.

Schools and districts that failed to meet the aggregate or subgroup benchmarks were subject to a

series of escalating consequences under the federal law (Mills, 2008).

        The effects of NCLB and similar accountability systems have been mixed, with evidence

of improvement in student outcomes (Dee & Jacob, 2011; Deming et al., 2016) in tension with

unintended negative consequences such as an overemphasis of tested material (Jacob, 2005;

Rothstein, Jacobsen, & Wilder, 2008; Koretz, 2008) and cheating by teachers (Fausset &

Blinder, 2014; Jacob & Levitt, 2003).2

        Over the ensuing decade, many states and districts grappled with the increasingly

unrealistic expectation that all students demonstrate proficiency by 2013-2014 and scores of

schools fell into deeper sanctions as Congress failed to make changes to the legislation. In the

fall of 2011, Secretary Duncan and President Obama articulated a process by which states could

request relief from some of NCLB’s provisions.3 In exchange, states had to implement reforms

that aligned with a set of principles detailed by the Obama Administration. The waiver process

targeted some of the most widely criticized components of NCLB in an attempt to “[allow states]

to move beyond the one-size-fits-all mandates of NCLB, to be more innovative, and to engage in

continued improvement in ways that benefit educators and students” (Arne Duncan, U.S.

Department of Education, 2014a). As of fall 2015, 43 states had approved waiver plans in

action.4

        In exchange for receiving a waiver, states were required to implement reforms targeted at

their lowest performing schools (“Priority schools”) as well as schools with the largest

achievement gaps (“Focus schools”). For Priority schools, the required reforms are quite

prescriptive and demand multiple changes to school organization and instructional practice

consistent with elements of school turnarounds. The motivation behind such interventions is that

chronically struggling schools face myriad challenges that require extensive and multi-pronged

reforms, rather than marginal or targeted actions. Suggested interventions for Focus schools are

less clearly defined at the federal level, reflecting a belief such schools require external

incentives to focus attention and coordinate action on achievement gaps, but do not require

prescriptive guidance on effective strategies for ameliorating such gaps.

        Proponents of these reforms argue that states will be able to craft and implement

differentiated accountability initiatives that better address the varied and multifaceted problems

facing chronically low-performing schools as well as the specific barriers that depress the


3
  Common concerns about NCLB from education leaders in states that applied for waivers include mandating
consequences for schools that did not always lead to improved student achievement, setting an unrealistic goal of
100 percent student proficiency by 2014, stifling progress with overly prescriptive sanctions, inaccurately
identifying schools as “needing improvement,” overemphasizing standardized tests, and creating disincentives for
states to set ambitious standards (CEP, 2013, p. 11).

achievement of certain subgroups of students in other schools.5 Critics characterize the waiver

initiative as overly prescriptive, inflexible, unfunded, and an unwarranted extension of federal

authority into local public schooling.

        In this paper, we study the effects of Priority and Focus reforms on a range of educational

outcomes. Research on the causal effects of these new reforms is scarce. These waiver-based

reforms are one of the most direct, ambitious, and wide-ranging efforts in place to improve the

performance and prospects of disadvantaged students across the United States. Our analysis

centers on Michigan, a state with one of the clearest and most systematically applied procedures

for identifying Priority and Focus schools. Michigan identifies Priority and Focus schools using a

baseline measure of prior academic performance that is not manipulable at the time of

identification. These sharp, discontinuous assignment rules enable us to examine the causal

effects of Michigan’s Priority and Focus school reforms through the use of a regression-

discontinuity (RD) design. This design essentially compares subsequent outcomes of schools that

performed just poorly enough to garner a Priority or Focus designation and be required to

implement the associated reforms to schools that performed just well enough to be free of such

requirements. We use administrative data from Michigan to provide one of the first

comprehensive looks at the causal effects of Priority and Focus reforms on measures of

achievement as well as candidate mechanisms such as staffing and student composition.

        To preview our results, we find little to no effect of Priority status and associated reforms

on measures of school staffing, composition, or academic achievement. In fact, we find some

evidence of negative achievement effects, especially for students in the upper part of the within-

school achievement distribution. For Focus schools, we find some evidence that the designation

 One implication of findings from some of the early state-specific studies on the effects of NLCB’s accountability
provisions on academic performance was to differentiate approaches and supports to schools based on the manner in
which they failed to meet proficiency benchmarks (e.g., Hemelt, 2011).

                                                        4
led to small reductions in within-school math achievement gaps – but any such reductions were

short-lived and likely driven by the stagnant performance of lower-achieving students alongside

declines in the performance of their higher-achieving peers.

       The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we briefly synthesize overarching

findings from the literature on whole-school reform and the recent, rapidly developing literature

on school turnarounds, and then describe the “reform principles” that guided waiver

implementation. Section III describes the Michigan policy context along with details on

Michigan’s waiver-based reforms. Section IV details our primary empirical approach. Section V

describes the data we employ. Section VI presents the main findings related to Priority

interventions. Section VII discusses findings concerning Focus schools. Section VIII explores

results from a dynamic regression-discontinuity approach. Section IX concludes and offers

policy implications of our main findings.

II.    Literature Review

       In this section, we briefly summarize earlier work on whole-school reform. We next

discuss prior studies on the recent set of school turnaround efforts that started shortly after the

Great Recession. Finally, we outline the differentiated approach to accountability instituted by

the NCLB waiver process.

       A. The Challenges of Whole-School Reform

       Whole-school reforms are notoriously difficult to implement well. A prominent example

of federal efforts to promote whole-school reform began in 1998 with the introduction of the

“Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration” (CSRD) program. This initiative provided

three-year grants to schools that could then be used to purchase the services of independent,

school-reform developers using research-based designs. This grant program developed into a



                                                  5
“leading strategy” of the U.S. Department of Education between 1998 and 2005 (Gross, Booker,

& Goldhaber, 2009) when nearly $2 billion were distributed to roughly 6,700 schools to support

Comprehensive School Reform (CSR) efforts. Many additional schools also implemented CSR

reforms using non-federal funding sources. The U.S. Department of Education defined CSR

models as consisting of 11 key components with a prominent emphasis on the use of

“scientifically based” teaching and management methods and the school-wide integration of

instruction, assessment, professional development, and school management (U.S. Department of

Education, 2010).

       The evaluation evidence on the achievement effects of CSR is somewhat mixed. A

federally sponsored evaluation concluded that CSR schools did not demonstrate larger

achievement gains than comparison schools up to five years after receiving the award (U.S.

Department of Education, 2010). Similarly, a recent study of CSR awards in Texas (Gross,

Booker, & Goldhaber, 2009) concludes that CSR awards led to only modest achievement gains

among white students (0.04 effect size) and no detectable effects among minority students.

       However, these studies acknowledge that they focus on the effects of receiving CSR

funding rather than on the effects of the highly diverse set of CSR reform efforts. Other evidence

suggests that the quality of CSR implementation was uneven in ways that mattered for sustaining

school improvement (Desimone, 2002; Bifulco, Duncombe, & Yinger 2005; U.S. Department of

Education, 2010). A meta-analytic review (Borman, Hewes, Overman, & Brown, 2003) that

considered the efficacy of specific CSR models characterized three (i.e., Direct Instruction,

Success for All, and the School Development Program) as having the “strongest evidence of

effectiveness” in terms of the comparative quality and quantity of evidence suggesting




                                                 6
meaningful impacts on student achievement. However, Borman et al. (2003) also suggest that

CSR is more likely to have positive impacts when implemented over several years.

       B. Literature on Recent School Turnaround Efforts

       There is a growing literature on the recent school turnaround efforts that originate as part

of accountability schemes. To date, this research has yielded quite mixed results. In several

cases, reform efforts have led to improved student performance; in other instances, schools

subject to turnaround made no progress or experienced declines in achievement. This is perhaps

not surprising given the widely varying nature and context of such reforms. A review of this

research can help shed light on potential of the new NCLB-mandated reforms.

       Several studies find that state-led turnaround efforts in Massachusetts have been quite

successful. Using a difference-in-differences approach, Papay (2015) finds that traditional public

schools in Massachusetts that participated in state-led turnaround efforts experienced significant

gains in student performance. Schueler, Goodman, and Deming (2017) study the state’s efforts to

turn around performance in the Lawrence (Massachusetts) school district. Using a differences-in-

differences framework, they find that the state-takeover of the Lawrence Public Schools resulted

in substantially higher math achievement and moderately higher ELA achievement.

       Turnaround efforts in Tennessee have been less successful. Zimmer et al. (2016) study

school turnarounds in Tennessee that were implemented as part of the state’s Race to the Top

grant, which included both state takeovers as well as district-managed reform efforts. They note

that all reform models undertaken involved a change in school leadership and a substantial

turnover of teachers. Using a difference-in-differences approach, the authors find that schools

chosen for district-led turnaround efforts experienced significant achievement gains while the

schools taken over by the state or operated by charter management organizations saw no



                                                 7
improvement. They note that the three districts that led school turnarounds provided considerable

support to the target schools, which included offering substantial raises to teachers who remained

in or transferred to a target school.

        In other cases, individual districts have pursued a more tailored approach to school

turnaround. These reforms differ from the more recent type of turnarounds attempted under

NCLB waivers and ESSA, not only in that schools are more selectively chosen but also because

more resources are typically devoted to the reform effort. While there is some evidence that such

reforms have been successful (see Player and Katz, 2013 and de la Torre et al., 2013), these

cases are not amenable to more rigorous research designs.

        Strunk et al. (2016) present a similarly mixed assessment of turnaround efforts in Los

Angeles. Using a comparative interrupted time series approach, they find no sign of

improvement among the first cohort of schools (n=14), improvement in reading but not math for

the second cohort of schools (n=5), and declines in student performance for the third cohort

(n=9). They attribute the success of the second cohort to greater assistance on the part of the

district and greater reliance on school restarts and reconstitutions, and note that there were

substantial implementation problems with the third cohort.

        The use of external operators (e.g., CMOs) to manage failing schools has also met with

mixed results. Gill et al. (2007) examined reform efforts in Philadelphia in which the state

transferred the operation of 45 low-performing schools to education management organizations.

They find no impact on student performance despite the fact that these schools were provided

with extra resources. On the other hand, Ruble (2015) finds positive effects of a similar reform

strategy in New Orleans, where the state transferred operation of failing schools (both traditional

and charter) to non-profit school management organizations.



                                                  8
       Several prior studies have used a regression-discontinuity approach to study the impact of

turnaround efforts, comparing schools just above and below the cutoff used to identify schools

for reform. Mathematica Policy Research examined school turnaround reforms adopted in 2011-

2012 and 2012-2013 as part of the federal School Improvement Grant (SIG) initiative. The study

covered more than 400 schools across roughly 60 districts in 22 states (Dragoset et al., 2017).

The report concludes that the implementation of a SIG-funded reform model had no impact on

math or reading achievement, high school graduation, or college enrollment. The authors note

modest differences in the use of recommended practices in treatment schools, although these

differences were not statistically significant in the regression-discontinuity analysis. An earlier

study of SIG-funded reforms in California found that they did improve student performance,

particularly among schools that engaged in the most substantial reforms such as replacing the

principal and at least 50 percent of staff (Dee, 2012). Consistent with these results from

California, the national study found suggestive evidence in favor of the more severe

“turnaround” model in contrast to the “transformation” model.

       Three other regression-discontinuity studies find such reforms resulted in zero or even

negative achievement effects. Studying turnaround efforts in North Carolina implemented as part

of the state’s Race-to-the-Top application, Heissel and Ladd (2016) find that students in the

affected schools actually experienced a decline in math and reading scores. Interestingly, most

schools in this study opted for the less severe transformation model of reform. The authors find

that teachers in reform schools reported spending more time on professional development

collaborative planning, but also reported more time on administrative duties (e.g., meetings and

reporting) not relevant for instruction.




                                                  9
        Dougherty and Weiner (2017) use a regression-discontinuity design to study Priority

school reforms in Rhode Island. In the first two years, they find that schools just above the cutoff

do no differently in math or reading achievement than schools just below the cutoff. They find

suggestive evidence that the lowest performing schools in the state have even lower subsequent

performance than slightly higher-performing but still sanctioned schools. Finally, Saw et al.

(2016) find little impact of school turnaround efforts in Michigan that preceded NCLB waivers,

though their analysis is limited to high schools in a single year.

        C. Differentiated Accountability under NCLB Waivers

        Secretary Duncan announced the opportunity for states to apply for waivers from

NCLB’s main requirements in the fall of 2011. There were three submission windows spanning

from September of 2011 through September of 2012. States’ waiver plans were assessed

according to the degree to which they adhered to four key “reform principles” articulated by the

U.S. Department of Education (2012; CEP, 2013). First, states had to adopt “college- and career-

ready standards” in at least math and reading,6 align those standards to “high-quality”

assessments, and then use those assessments to measure growth in student achievement over time

and hold schools accountable. Second, states were required to craft and adopt “differentiated

recognition, accountability, and support systems.” Specifically, states had to propose how they

would identify the lowest-performing schools in their states (“Priority” schools) and the schools

that had the lowest performance for certain subgroups or the largest gaps in performance

between subgroups (“Focus” schools).7 States were then required to field different interventions


6
  The aim of the Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI) is to develop a set of standards that defines the
knowledge and skills students should acquire during their K-12 educational careers so that they will graduate
“college and career ready.” These standards are intended to provide parents and educators with a sense of students’
academic progress, regardless of state or locality.
7
  In December of 2015, Congress finally passed a reauthorization of the ESEA entitled the “Every Student Succeeds
Act” (ESSA; Public Law 114-95). The law will take full effect starting in the 2017-18 academic year. Broadly, the
law aims to provide states and districts with more flexibility (relative to NCLB) in crafting and implementing

                                                        10
in these groups of schools. Third, states had to design and implement systems to evaluate and

support teachers and principals. Finally, states were required to evaluate their reporting

requirements and ditch duplicative, unhelpful ones.

         Priority schools are among the lowest-performing schools in their states (i.e., the bottom

5% of all Title I schools based on state-determined measures of prior performance). Federal

guidance requires Priority schools in all states to implement multiple initiatives that are

consistent with federal “turnaround principles.” Acceptable approaches closely mirror those

required of schools that received School Improvement Grants (SIGs) funded by the 2009

stimulus package. That is, Priority schools must implement a specific reform approach:

transformation, turnaround, or restart (or otherwise close). These reforms emphasize new

leadership, teacher evaluations, professional development, and instructional changes that rely on

the continuous, formative use of data, as well as extended learning time.

         Focus schools must constitute at least 10% of Title I schools in a waiver state. Focus

schools (and their encompassing districts) are required to implement unspecified interventions to

reduce achievement gaps, which “may include tutoring and public school choice” (U.S.

Department of Education, 2012, p. 2). Thus, we expect ample heterogeneity in the types of Focus

interventions adopted, in contrast to the limited set of federally specified Priority-school

interventions shared across all waiver states.




accountability policies for schools and evaluation systems for teachers. Within these state systems, ESSA requires
states to identify the lowest-performing schools (i.e., the bottom 5 percent) and to intervene to improve performance.
Thus, some of the key elements of the waiver reforms will continue during the implementation of ESSA – but with
greater flexibility for states in determining the interventions to field in their chronically struggling schools.

                                                         11
III.     Policy Implementation Context in Michigan

         Michigan’s waiver application was approved in July of 2012,8 and Michigan identified its

first set of Priority and Focus schools in August of 2012. For this group of schools, the 2012-13

year served as a planning year during which schools flagged as either Priority or Focus consulted

with district- and state-level supporters in order to craft plans of action consistent with federally

required intervention components. These plans were then implemented during the 2013-14

academic year.

         A. Priority and Focus Assignment in Michigan

         Michigan adopted a cohort model of Priority and Focus school identification: once

identified as a Priory or Focus school, a school remains designated as such for four years, with

the first year being the planning period noted above. In practice, many schools began

implementation efforts immediately.

         In Michigan, schools were identified as Priority, Focus, or Reward using a “top-to-

bottom” (TTB) ranking, in which each school received a percentile score that located it in a

statewide performance distribution of schools. In Appendix B, we provide a detailed description

of the steps involved in calculating the TTB index as well as the manner in which the state used

this index to identify Priority and Focus schools. In broad terms, the TTB score was a weighted

function of subject-specific achievement measured in three ways: level achievement, growth in

achievement, and the within-school gap between the top 30% and bottom 30% of students – all

based on two to four years of prior data.

         Schools were arrayed from lowest (i.e., the worst performing schools) to highest by their

overall TTB score (regardless of level). The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) included

                                                          12
both Title I and non-Title-I schools in its rankings. Priority schools were identified as schools in

the bottom 5% of the TTB ranking distribution.9 The Priority school accountability designation

replaced Michigan’s previous label of “persistently low-performing” (PLA) schools,10 which was

solely based on math and reading scores, and divided by school level (e.g., elementary, middle

and high) – making it more difficult to array all schools in Michigan along a more

comprehensive index of achievement. Reward schools were those that constituted the top 5% of

the TTB distribution.11

         Focus schools were identified using one particular component of the TTB ranking: the

achievement-gap score. Within each school and tested subject, MDE calculated the gap in

performance as the difference between the average score of the top 30% of students and the

bottom 30% of students. Next, MDE averaged these subject-specific gap values to arrive at a

“composite gap index” for each school. Based on this composite measure, a stock of schools that

included 10% of non-Priority, Title I schools with the largest gaps were labeled Focus schools.12

Focus schools appear at all points in the TTB ranking list of schools – and are thought of as

having particular difficulty in supporting the specific needs of their lower-performing students,

even though the school as a whole may be achieving at an adequate (or superior) level.

9
  Federal guidance required states to identify the bottom 5% of Title I schools in the state as Priority schools.
Michigan wanted to identify all low-performing schools as Priority, regardless of Title I status. In the case of
Priority schools, the number of Title I schools that fell below the 5 th percentile Priority cutoffs in 2012, 2013, and
2104 was equal to or greater than 5% of the total population of Title I schools in Michigan in those years. Thus,
Michigan did not have to move farther up the TTB ranking distribution to capture 5% of the population of Title I
schools. See Appendix B for additional details.
10
   Any school that (a) was identified in 2010 or 2011 as a PLA school or (b) received SIG funds to implement a
turnaround model was automatically identified as a Priority school in August of 2012.
11
   Michigan also identified two other types of Reward schools: (a) the top 5% of schools making the greatest gains
in achievement and (b) schools determined to be “beating the odds” (i.e., those outperforming other schools with
similar socio-demographic makeups). For more details on Reward schools, please consult
http://www.michigan.gov/rewardschools.
12
   Once again, federal guidance required states to identify 10% of the population of Title I schools in a state as Focus
schools. Michigan wanted to identify all schools with large within-school achievement gaps as Focus, regardless of
Title I status. Thus, in each ranking year, Michigan found the standardized gap value below which 10% of the stock
of Title I schools would be identified as Focus schools. All non-Title I schools that fell below that value were also
labeled as Focus schools. See Appendix B for more details.

                                                          13
         Schools cannot be labeled as both a Priority and a Focus school. If a school meets the

criteria for both Priority and Focus designations, the Priority label takes precedence. Though

Priority and Focus schools remain in a “treated” status for four years, schools that just barely

missed being placed in Priority or Focus groups in one year could fall below a subsequent year’s

cutoff and become treated.13 The dynamic nature of a school’s treatment status informs our

empirical approach, which we discuss in our methodology section below.

         B. Treatment Components of Priority and Focus Designations in Michigan

         Both Priority and Focus schools receive supports from the state. All Priority schools must

develop a reform/redesign plan based on one of the four intervention models established by the

U.S. Department of Education: transformation, turnaround, restart, or closure.14 As of 2015, 60

percent of all Priority schools had chosen the least drastic “transformation” option (J. Doll,

personal communication, January 27, 2017). This option requires a school to replace the

principal,15 implement unspecified instructional reform strategies, and extend or repurpose time

for additional professional development or teacher planning. The turnaround plan is more severe

in that it also requires that schools release and rehire up to 50% of their staff, implement a new

governance structure, and implement a new or revised curriculum. The restart option is the most

drastic choice (short of permanent closure), as it involves formally closing and a school and

releasing all teachers and administrators (though some could be hired back by the new school).




13
   In addition, since Priority status take precedence, if a Focus school identified in 2012 (2013) fell below the
Priority cutoff in 2013 (2014), it was moved into Priority status and subject to the associated requirements (K.
Ruple, Michigan Department of Education, personal communication, June 10, 2016).
14
   By state law (MCL 280.1280c), all schools designated as Priority must submit a redesign plan that addresses one
of four federal intervention models identified by the U.S. Department of Education to Michigan’s School Reform
Office (SRO) for approval, regardless of Title I status. Priority schools that are Title I receive additional assistance
from the state.
15
   Schools that adopted the “transformation” model could retain the current principal if she had been in the role for
two or fewer years.

                                                           14
         Title I Priority schools must set aside 10% of their building-specific Title I funding to

support the implementation of the school’s reform plan.16 Title I Priority schools also work with

their district to assemble a “School Support Team” composed of a school improvement

facilitator assigned by the state, a district representative, and an intervention specialist (trained

and assigned by the School of Education at Michigan State University).17 All Priority schools

participate in “diagnostic dialogues”18 with stakeholders in which achievement data are

examined to determine relevant changes in the school’s teaching and learning practices.

         All Focus schools must undergo district-led, school-specific “data dialogues” to identify

district-level system changes needed to help Focus schools make substantial progress toward

closing achievement gaps. Focus schools receive a “District Toolkit” which outlines practices,

tools, and strategies that have been successful in helping other districts improve struggling

schools. The “data dialogues” are intended to generate discussion anchored on local achievement

information that will lead to locally appropriate, customized changes in learning practices,

curricula, and teaching necessary to improve student outcomes.

         Title I Focus schools receive a “District Improvement Facilitator” (DIF) who works with

the central office staff (at the district level) about 40 hours per week during the school year to

provide implementation assistance.19 Specifically, the DIF helps each Focus school identify one

or two major changes in such practices to implement during the academic year. The DIF also

leads changes in any district-level policies or practices necessary to support the school-level

16
   In addition, the district in which a Title I Priority school resides must set aside 20% of the district-level Title I
funding to support changes in its Priority schools.
17
   The state funded the intervention specialist (at the district level) for 50 days and the school improvement
facilitators (at the school level) for 40 days (J. Doll, personal communication, January 10, 2017).
18
   For a detailed treatment of the questions and structure that guide these data dialogues, please consult the document
“Data Dialogue Booklet” on the following MDE website: http://www.michigan.gov/focusschools.
19
   DIFs were initially funded and trained by the School of Education at Michigan State University. In subsequent
years, the state increased funding to Michigan’s Intermediate School Districts (ISDs) by about $8 million through
regional assistance grants. ISDs were then responsible for finding and hiring DIFs for any of their districts that
contained Title I Focus schools (V. Keesler, personal communication, March 18, 2016).

                                                          15
changes. Finally, Title I Focus schools in year two of Focus status are required to allocate a share

of their Title I building-specific funding toward implementation (with districts required to set

aside additional district-specific Title I funds for schools in year three of Focus identification).20

         Though Priority and Focus schools are assigned to cohorts for four years, Michigan

decided that if a school made consistent progress over the first two to three years of its cohort

membership, it could be released early. Criteria for early release differed by Priority and Focus

reforms. Priority schools had to maintain a TTB ranking of at least 15 for two consecutive years

after initial identification and meet all other testing stipulations (e.g., testing participating rate of

at least 95 percent). Release criteria for Focus schools were less well specified. The state looked

at growth and gaps in math and reading performance to make its early release decisions for

Focus schools (J. Doll, personal communication, January 27, 2017).

IV.      Empirical Approach

         We use a regression-discontinuity (RD) design to study Priority- and Focus-school

interventions in Michigan. This RD approach leverages comparisons of schools that are just

above and below the threshold values of the ranking variables used to identify Priority and Focus

schools. In this section, we discuss the basic issues underlying a standard RD analysis, which we

then use to examine effects of Priority and Focus designations by cohort (2012, 2013, and 2014).

We then raise some of the complexities that arise from the dynamic nature of these treatments




20
  These funds are most commonly used to support targeted professional development concerning the
implementation of a multi-tiered system of support within the school, with a focus on low-achievers; or to provide
space and time for weekly (or even daily) teacher collaboration (MDE, Office of Improvement and Innovation,
Focus School Technical Assistance, 2013). Whether Title I Priority and Focus schools were required to offer (and
pay) for the option of students to attend a different, non-Priority (or non-Focus) school depends on the academic
year. In 2012-2013, Title I Priority and Focus schools were required to offer school choice and transportation, and to
use Title I dollars to pay for transportation. From 2013-2014 onward, Priority and Focus schools were not required
to offer choice and transportation.

across cohorts, laying the groundwork for our consideration of results from a dynamic

regression-discontinuity approach later in the paper.

        A. Regression Discontinuity in a Cross-Section

        As described above, school j is assigned to intervention if its performance ranking, r, falls

below a specific cutoff: b j  1 rj  r *  . We are interested in the relationship between the

intervention and some school outcome. Suppressing time-related subscripts, we can write:

(1)     y j    b j  u j

Here,  is the causal effect of Priority or Focus status on the outcome. The identification

concern is that schools below the cutoff have unobservable characteristics that are correlated

with the outcome: E u j  0  . However, as long as there is some random component that

translates a school’s performance into a ranking, if one focuses on schools sufficiently close to

the cutoff, the comparison of treated and untreated units approximates a randomized experiment.

The schools that just “miss” passing the cutoff and are thus assigned the intervention become our

treatment group, while those that just “pass” the cutoff and avoid intervention serve as the

control group.

        There are two common approaches to estimating RD models. The nonparametric

approach estimates local polynomial regressions on either side of the cutoff, relying on various

algorithms to select the optimal bandwidth. The parametric approach includes a flexible

polynomial of the running variable in an OLS regression to absorb variation from schools farther

from the cutoff, as in the following equation:

(2)     y j    b j  Pg  rj ,    u j




                                                   17
where Pg  rj ,   is a polynomial in r of order g, with coefficients γ. The primary advantage of

the parametric approach is that by including a wider range of data around the cutoff, it typically

yields more precise estimates. In the analysis below, we demonstrate that parametric and

nonparametric results yield comparable point estimates in the cross-section.21 For the dynamic

regression-discontinuity approach described below, we use a parametric model. Regardless of

the estimation technique, a RD design should be interpreted as identifying the impact of a

particular intervention on units close to the cutoff.

        The key identifying assumption of any RD analysis is that the outcome is related to the

running variable in a continuous fashion. This might be violated for several reasons. In some

cases, one might be concerned that the actors themselves can manipulate the running variable

such that those with particularly good (or bad) unobservable characteristics fall on one side of

the cutoff. In practice, the algorithms used to rank schools for the purpose of Priority and Focus

determination were quite complicated and, more importantly, depended on a school’s relative

position. For these reasons, we believe that it was not possible for schools to intentionally

manipulate their performance ranking.

        A more realistic concern is that state officials determined the algorithm with the intention

of including or excluding specific schools from the intervention. We believe that this is unlikely

for several reasons. The 5 and 10 percent thresholds were determined by federal guidelines, as

was the mandate to incorporate performance levels and gaps to some extent. The components

that the state chose, and the weights attached to those components, appear quite standard. For

example, performance level, growth, and gaps received weights of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.25


21
  We employ the data-driven nonparametric commands developed by Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2014a,
2014b, 2015).


                                                     18
respectively in the overall school performance metric, and all test scores in all available grades

were included.

         A final concern is that the threshold for one intervention may correspond to other

treatments or policies. For example, if school funding formulas were related to school

performance such that schools below the 5th percentile received discontinuously more (or less)

funding, it would be impossible to disentangle the impact of Priority intervention from school

funding. In this case, however, we know of no other state or district policy that used these

cutoffs.

         We test this assumption by estimating equation (2) with outcomes prior to the

intervention, where we would expect θ to be zero. We also implement a procedure developed by

McCrary (2008) to determine whether there is any bunching in the distribution of the running

variable around the cutoff, which might suggest manipulation of the running variable itself. As

discussed below, both tests suggest that the key assumptions are met in our context.

         B. Accounting for Treatment Crossover in a Cross-Section

         In any individual year, there is strict adherence to the cutoffs described above. That is,

every eligible school scoring below the 5th percentile is assigned Priority status and every school

scoring in the bottom 10 percent of the gap measure is assigned Focus status.22 However, each

year after the initial set of schools was announced in 2012, the state followed a similar procedure

– calculating top-to-bottom rankings based on measures of student achievement level, growth,

and gaps, and assigning schools to Priority or Focus status depending on their rank in the

relevant distribution. All schools are included in the TTB rankings in each year, regardless of

whether they had been labeled Focus or Priority in prior years. Because school performance and


22
  As noted above, there are a handful of schools that qualify for both Focus and Priority interventions, in which case
they are assigned to the Priority category. For this reason, adherence to the Focus cutoff is not strictly perfect.

                                                         19
thus the TTB rankings change each year, additional schools can and do fall into the intervention

categories.

       For example, by Summer 2014, 124 (265) additional schools had been placed in the

Priority (Focus) category. More importantly, many of the schools that narrowly missed being

assigned Priority or Focus interventions in one year will be assigned in subsequent years. For

example, roughly 30 percent of schools in the 6th to 10th percentile on the composite TTB

ranking in 2012 had been assigned Priority status by Fall 2014. Roughly 40 percent of schools in

the 11th to 20th percentile of the gap measure in the initial year had been assigned Focus status by

Fall 2014.

       This creates a situation which is often referred to as treatment crossover in the context of

a cross-sectional RD analysis. To address this, we estimate a “fuzzy” RD (Hahn, Todd, & Van

der Klaauw, 2001) within an IV framework. For a given cohort, the equation of interest relates

the treatment, T, to the outcome, y, conditional on the flexible polynomial of the running

variable:

(3)     y j    Tˆj  Pg  rj ,     j

And the first-stage models the treatment as a function of the indicator for falling below the

cutoff, along with the flexible polynomial.

(4)     T j    b j  Pg  rj ,    v j

The estimate of θ from equation 3 captures the effect of the “treatment-on-the-treated” whereas

the estimate of θ from equation 2 captures the effect of the “intent-to-treat.” The estimate of α

above is the first-stage effect of missing the cutoff in year t on the likelihood of experiencing the

Priority (Focus) intervention in a subsequent year.




                                                 20
           In the context of a cross-section model, if one is willing to assume that the impact of the

intervention increases linearly with time, then then one can define the treatment, T, as the

cumulative years of intervention (i.e., the number of years since the school was first identified as

Priority or Focus). If one believes that the full impact of the intervention occurs immediately,

then one would define T as “ever identified” by year t. If one believes that it takes two years for

the intervention to take effect, then one could define T as being identified at least two years

earlier.

           C. Other Concerns with Internal Validity

           In addition to the mechanics of estimation, the fact that the “control” schools in one year

might become “treatment” schools in a subsequent year raises the issue of whether barely

missing the intervention has an independent impact on school performance. For example, one

might imagine that the fear of being sanctioned in subsequent years might motivate teachers and

administrators to take actions to affect performance in the short-run. These “threat effects” could

lead us to understate the impact of the intervention itself. To explore this possibility, we examine

the time trends of various outcomes in treatment schools as well as sets of comparison schools. If

we find positive trends in student outcomes following a school’s identification as a Priority (or

Focus) school, but that this occurs among observationally similar comparison schools in the

same cohort, we might be concerned about the threat effect. As discussed below, we do not find

any compelling evidence that threat responses among comparison schools were driving the

impact estimates.23




23
   This analysis resembles a comparative interrupted time series design. A key assumption of this analysis is that it
requires the existence of a set of comparison schools that were (a) far enough from the cutoff that they did not
experience a threat effect but (b) close enough to the cutoff that their trajectory reflects the counterfactual path for
treatment schools.

                                                           21
       A second potential concern involves school closures. One of the four approved reform

models for priority schools involved closing the school, and dispersing students and teachers to

other nearby schools. Because our primary analysis follows schools over time, if treatment

schools are more likely to close, our sample may suffer from differential attrition that could

introduce bias. In Appendix Table A3, we present results from an analysis of school closures by

cohort. We see some evidence that schools labeled as Priority were more likely to close and this

pattern is most pronounced among schools in the cohort of 2012: about 39 percent of initial

Priority schools in our preferred analytic sample for 2012 had closed by the 2015-2016 year,

compared to 18 percent of schools that just barely missed Priority designation in 2012. The

differentially higher closure rate of Priority schools is much less pronounced in later cohorts.

Very few Focus schools close during our period of analysis.

       It turns out that the lion’s share of 2012 Priority schools that closed did so during the

summer of 2012. The Priority schools were announced in August 2012, so it seems as if these

closure decisions were determined prior to or concurrently with the priority determination. For

this reason, we limit our analysis sample to schools that were open during the 2012-2013 school

year. When examining how the baseline (pre-treatment) characteristics of schools change

through the cutoff, we limit the analysis to this sample as well. Any differentiation selection

induced by these summer 2012 closures should show up in this analysis. We follow a similar

approach in our analysis of the 2013 and 2014 cohorts.

       A third concern is that the treatment itself might lead to changes in student or teacher

composition in the school. For example, some parents might be reluctant to send their children to

a Priority school because of the negative signal. On the other hand, if this designation signals

future reforms, parents might choose to send their children to the school. If one views these types



                                                 22
of changes as part of the treatment, they should be thought of as mechanisms through which the

intervention operates. This seems particularly appropriate for any staff changes generated by the

intervention. In the analysis below, we study whether the intervention has any impact on student

and teacher mobility or composition.

V.     Data

       To identify Priority and Focus schools, we use publicly available data from the Michigan

Department of Education (MDE). For each cohort, we also obtained the subcomponents that

were used to construct the composite ranking variables. We use measures of school- and district-

characteristics collected by MDE and the Common Core of Data (CCD), including measures of

school expenditures, school type (e.g., charter, magnet, vocational, etc.), Title I status, and

geographic location.

       To measure student and teacher characteristics (including standardized test scores), we

start with individual-level administrative data, which we aggregate to the school-year level. The

use of individual data allows us to construct measures that are typically not provided in publicly

available school-level data, such as the fraction of students or teachers that are new to a school in

any particular year and various quantiles of student achievement in a school and year. Given that

the fundamental unit of variation is the school-year, the use of aggregate data is more appropriate

and produces virtually identical results as the use of individual-level data.

       In recent years, Michigan has administered its standardized tests in the Fall of each

academic year. Given that schools first learned about their Priority (Focus) status in August, it

seems unlikely that they would have had an opportunity to implement any substantive reforms

before the October testing. For this reason, we use achievement scores from the following Fall to

measure the year 1 impact of the policy. When controlling for prior school characteristics,



                                                 23
however, we only use information from the pre-designation school year to avoid any possibility

of contamination. In the 2014-15 school year, Michigan switched to a new assessment program

(M-STEP), which is administered in the late spring (i.e., April and May) of the academic year.

For the 2014 treatment cohort, we therefore use spring 2015 scores as year 1 outcomes and 2016

scores as year 2 outcomes. We consider Spring 2016 (Spring 2015) exams as year 4 (3) effects

and Fall 2014 as the year 1 effect for the 2012 cohort. For the 2013 cohort, exams in Spring 2016

(Spring 2015) provide year 3 (2) effects.

       In calculating student achievement measures, we standardize test scores by subject-grade-

year. In order to examine whether the intervention had different impacts across the achievement

distribution, we estimate something akin to quantile regressions. It is possible to estimate

quantile regression models in an RD framework. However, estimates from a standard quantile

RD model using student-level data will reflect two distinct phenomena: the impact of the

intervention on the lowest-performing students within a school as well as the average effect on

the lowest-performing schools. To better distinguish between these channels, we estimate several

different specifications.

        To examine the impact of the intervention within schools, we calculate the achievement

level at different percentiles within the school as well as measures of within-school dispersion

such as the standard deviation, inter-quartile range, or the state-defined achievement gap. We

then proceed to use these measures as outcomes in a school-level RD specification like those

above. We also estimate the impact of the interventions on the distribution of school mean

achievement. That is, do the Priority or Focus reforms disproportionally help schools at the

bottom versus top of the achievement distribution? To do so, we estimate simple quantile RD




                                                 24
models at the school level. In addition to standard school-level covariates, we also control for

school-level averages of various student characteristics.

     A. Sample

         In this analysis, we focus on schools serving students in grades 3-8.24 The broad

majorities of Priority and Focus schools are elementary or middle schools: 67 percent and 85

percent, respectively. We exclude charter schools from our analysis because, while they were

subject to the same interventions, it is less clear that charter management organizations or charter

authorizers enforced the requirements.25 We also exclude schools that exclusively serve a special

needs population, as they were typically not subject to the same mandates as other schools. For

each cohort, we include schools that were open in the Fall immediately following the release of

the Top-to-Bottom list and identification of new Priority and Focus schools. As discussed above,

this will exclude schools closed during the summer when the announcement was made. For the

2013 and 2014 cohorts, we exclude schools that had been previously identified as Priority

schools because they were not eligible for additional intervention.26




24
   We exclude schools that only serve students in grades K-2 because student test scores are not available for these
schools, so in practice they were not eligible for Priority or Focus designation. We exclude schools that serve some
elementary or middle school students that also serve high school students, including schools with grade
configurations like 6-12 and K-12, because the Top-to-Bottom ranking for these schools was based in part on high
school graduation rates. We do include a small number of schools that extend to grade 9 because the clear majority
of students in these schools are in grades K-8 and high school graduation does not factor into the ranking decision
for these schools. Finally, we drop 1 or 2 schools in each year with a total enrollment of fewer than 50 students
because these were schools for special populations.
25
   Charter schools make up about 7 percent of all public, K-8, non-special education schools and roughly similar
proportions of Priority and Focus schools.
26
   We exclude schools that were identified as “persistently low achieving” (PLA) in 2010 or 2011. The PLA label
was the precursor to Priority schools. PLA schools represented the bottom 5 percent of public schools in Michigan
based on prior math and reading test scores. These schools were publicly identified, put under the management of
the School Reform Office (SRO), and required to design and implement a three-year plan to boost student
performance. Finally, we exclude schools that were a part of the first two cohorts of SIG schools as these cohorts
preceded the NCLB waiver intervention period. Priority schools in Michigan were encouraged to apply for SIG
funding during the third and fourth cohorts, and thus SIG funding during these cohorts constitutes a mechanism
through which any effect of Priority designation could operate. Indeed, Table 1 shows that 13 percent of Priority
schools (and zero Focus schools) in the 2012 cohort won SIG funding.

                                                         25
        Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the sample of schools in the 2012 analysis.

(Appendix Tables A2 and A3 present analogous statistics for the 2013 and 2014 cohorts.) Out of

the full group of public K-8 schools in our analytic sample for the cohort of 2012, about 3

percent were labeled Priority schools and roughly 14 percent Focus schools. The share of black

and Hispanic children in Michigan’s public elementary and middle schools is about 22 percent,

and over half of all students in those schools are considered economically disadvantaged.27 Only

15 percent of Michigan’s K-8 public schools are located in urban settings, while over 45 percent

and about 39 percent are located in suburban and rural settings, respectively.

         The three panels allow the reader to compare the characteristics of Priority and Focus

schools to the full analytic sample of K-8 public schools in Michigan. In terms of demographics,

Priority schools are heavily concentrated in urban areas and serve much higher proportions of

black and economically disadvantaged students: nearly 78 percent and 91 percent, respectively.

In terms of staff characteristics, the share of teachers new to a school in a given year is twice as

high in Priority schools compared to all public K-8 schools.

        In terms of demographics, staff characteristics, and location, Focus schools look more

like the typical K-8 public school in Michigan than do Priority schools. One difference is that the

typical Focus school serves a smaller share of economically disadvantaged students relative to

the average Michigan public K-8 school: 39 percent versus 52 percent. In addition, the average

academic achievement of Focus schools is above the state average.

        Broadly these descriptive characteristics confirm some general notions about Priority and

Focus schools. Schools that receive a Priority label exhibit very low overall academic

achievement and disproportionately serve minority and disadvantaged students in urban settings.


27
 This measure combines students who are eligible for free or reduced-price meals (FARM) with those who are
migrants or homeless.

                                                      26
Focus schools appear to have acceptable (or even above-average) overall achievement levels and

serve a collection of students that resembles the typical K-8 public school. But, the acceptable

global performance of these schools obscures sizeable gaps in academic achievement between

within-school subgroups of students.

VI.    Findings for the Priority Intervention

       In the sections that follow, we consider the effects of the Priority designation and

associated reforms on measures of staffing, composition, and academic achievement for each of

our three cohorts of schools.

       A. Exploration of RD Assumptions

       The ability to confidently interpret our findings as causal effects of Priority reforms turns

on a few key assumptions embedded in our RD setup. We test these assumptions before

discussing our main results.

       One key assumption is that schools are unable manipulate the assignment variable. In

terms of Priority schools, this variable was an index of achievement levels, growth, and gaps

based on several years of historical data – and thus very difficult to manipulate around some

unknown threshold value. In Figure 1, we present the distribution of this running variable in

2012, 2013 and 2014, and test for any jump at the cutoff value using the McCrary (2008) test.

We find no evidence of bunching near the cutoff suggestive of running variable manipulation for

the cohorts of 2012 and 2013. We see noisy evidence of possible bunching to the passing side of

the cutoff for the 2014 cohort.

       The second key assumption is that in the neighborhood of the cutoff, we can consider

schools to either side as equivalent in all observed and unobserved respects expect one: the

receipt of the Priority label and attendant intervention requirements. If true, we should see few



                                                27
differences in observable baseline characteristics of Priority and non-Priority schools across the

cutoff.

          Figure 2 shows scatterplots of various baseline (i.e., pre-intervention) school

characteristics by the school performance index (SPI), where the cutoff is re-centered on zero.

Hence, all schools with a negative SPI were labeled priority and no schools with SPI greater than

zero were labeled in that first year. To highlight changes around the cutoff, we limit the figures

to schools with SPI values within +/- 1 of the cutoff. Notes at the bottom of each figure report

estimates of θ from equation 2, using both the nonparametric approach of Calonico et al. (2014a,

2014b, 2015) as well as a parametric approach. For the parametric models, we limit the sample

to +/- 0.25 from the cutoff and include a linear term in the running variable which is allowed to

differ on either side of the cutoff. The lines shown in the figure are the estimated regression lines

from the parametric specification.28

          We show results for four baseline characteristics, including prior average math and

reading scores along with summary measures of student demographics and school structure. To

create these summary measures, we regress baseline math and reading scores on the set of school

characteristics shown in Table 1, and calculate predicted baseline math and reading scores.

Looking across these graphs, it does not appear that there are any discontinuous changes in

observable school characteristics at the cutoff for the first cohort of schools to be considered for

the intervention. Appendix Figures A1 and A2 show comparable graphs for the 2013 and 2014

cohorts of schools. As noted above, once a school is identified as Priority, it is essentially out of




28
  Graphs, results, and conclusions are similar when we limit the data window to +/- 0.50, but the +/- 0.25 data
window better fits the data – both visually and as evidenced by the average bandwidth selected by the nonparametric
calculations across various outcomes.

                                                        28
the risk-set for additional “Priority” treatment.29 For this reason, these figures exclude any

schools that have been previously identified as Priority schools. The number of new Priority

schools below the cutoff in these later cohorts is very small, making it difficult to draw strong

conclusions from these estimates. To control for any small baseline differences and increase the

precision of our estimates, we include a wide range of school characteristics in our preferred

specification, all of which are defined in the academic year prior to the Priority designation:

shares of students who are female, black, Hispanic, and Asian; share of students in special

education, share with limited English proficiency, share economically disadvantaged; average

math and reading scores, school type (i.e., elementary, middle, magnet); school enrollment;

average teacher experience, share of teachers new to the school, the share of teachers from very

competitive colleges; teacher-student and aide-student ratios. In addition, we weight our

parametric models by school-level enrollment. Unweighted results are similar in all respects and

available upon request from the authors.

         B. First-Stage Impact on Treatment

         Figure 3 illustrates the extent of dynamic treatment crossover discussed above. As with

the earlier figures, schools are plotted with the SPI on the x-axis. Figures 3A and 3B show the

probability that a school was identified for Priority intervention by 2013 and 2015, respectively.

For the very first cohort of Priority schools identified in 2012, the relationship between the

overall school index and Priority status is sharp: that is, as one passes the threshold value from

right to left, the probability of being categorized as a Priority school jumps from 0 to 1. In Figure

3A, we see how the movement of some control schools in 2012 to the treatment side of the cutoff

in 2013 mutes the relationship between a school’s initial (2012) rating index value and the


29
  Recall that a school that was identified as Focus in an earlier cohort remains in the “risk set” for possible Priority
designation in subsequent years.

                                                           29
cumulative likelihood it is ever flagged for Priority intervention. Figure 3B illustrates that nearly

35 percent of schools that fell just to the control side of the initial 2012 cutoff had been identified

as Priority schools by 2015.

       C. Impacts on Academic Achievement

       Figure 4 provides graphical evidence regarding the impact of the Priority designation on

math scores. Since any effects from large, whole-school reforms tend to take time to manifest,

we focus on test score outcomes by cohort that are at least two years from initial designation. As

above in our figures that showed baseline characteristics, each figure graphs the binned raw data

along with the estimated regression line from our simple, linear, parametric RD specification.

Below each figure are the point estimates from this basic parametric specification as well as the

nonparametric RD estimator, neither of which includes control variables. In Table 2, we present

estimates of intent-to-treat effects of Priority status on math and reading achievement from our

preferred RD specification that adds baseline controls. Thus, comparing estimates from Figure 4

and Table 2 allows the reader to assess the degree to which covariates matter for our conclusions.

In Table 2, we explore effects on achievement at the mean and at different points in the within-

school achievement distribution. We test the sensitivity of our estimates of the effect of Priority

status on math and reading scores to additional RD specifications that vary the data window and

the inclusion of controls in Appendix Table A4.

       Across the 2012, 2013, and 2014 cohorts, we find little to no evidence of improvements

in average math or reading performance or subject-specific performance at different quantiles of

within-school achievement distributions. If anything, we see some evidence that Priority

designation further depressed short-run performance. For example, we find that students in

Priority schools in the 2014 cohort were performing about 0.12 to 0.17 standard deviations below



                                                  30
their counterparts in barely non-Priority schools after one year in math and reading, respectively.

These negative effects persist into the second year for reading. For math and reading, the

negative achievement effects appear especially pronounced among the upper half of the within-

school achievement distribution.

        We can observe the most distal outcomes (four years out) for the cohort of 2012. Four

years after initial designation as a Priority school, students in the lowest parts of the within-

school achievement distribution are performing worse than their barely non-Priority counterparts

in mathematics, pulling wider the within-school gap between the top and bottom 30 percent of

students (i.e., the map gap score). We see little effect on reading performance by four years after

initial designation as a Priority school for the cohort of 2012.

        One caveat for all of our Priority estimates is that they are relatively imprecise. This

imprecision is a natural consequence of the process used to identify Priority schools: by

definition, they are a small group of chronically struggling schools. Estimation of causal effects

within an RD framework exacerbates this imprecision since one focuses on a subset of

observations close to the threshold that determines treatment.

        In Appendix Figure A3, we plot performance trends for the 2012 cohort30 alongside a

comparison group that should be less sensitive to any threat effects but still function as a

reasonable approximation of what the treatment group would have experienced absent

treatment.31 We see that performance declined over this period among treatment schools. This

suggests that the null effects from our RD models are not driven by short-run, comparable

increases among treatment and control groups, which is what one would expect in the case of

30
   We focus on the 2012 cohort for two reasons. First, the RD assumptions are mostly strongly met for this cohort.
Second, we can observe the longest trajectory of outcomes for this cohort (i.e., up to four years after initial
identification as a Priority school).
31
   We define this comparison group as schools that have running variable values between 0.25 and 0.50, which
correspond roughly to the 14th and 20th percentiles of the TTB rating distribution respectively.

                                                        31
threat effects. Further, the average math performance of Priority schools falls well below the

performance of the comparison group by the third and fourth years after initial designation. This

is consistent with some of our RD estimates that suggest negative effects of Priority status on

medium-run measures of achievement.

       D. Impacts on School Staffing, Enrollment, and Composition

       In Table 3, we examine the effects of Priority status on measures of enrollment and

staffing. We detect sizeable effects of Priority designation on total school enrollment for the first

cohort of 2012. This bump in enrollment is sustained through 2016 and jump started by a notable

increase in non-entry-grade enrollment. Recall that a large share of Priority schools closed

immediately prior to the 2012-2013 academic year (see Appendix Table A3). Students from

these schools had to be absorbed by other schools. We know that Priority schools in Michigan

tend to be clustered in urban areas such as Detroit. Thus, the bump we observe in non-entry-

grade enrollment in 2013 is consistent with the notion that Priority schools cluster together and

frequently close. In complementary analyses not shown, we created measures of the number of

schools that closed within three miles of each school during each year in our data as well as a

measure of enrollment at those schools. If we introduce these variables as additional controls and

drop the district of Detroit, we can “explain” about 60 percent of the initial and persistent

increase in total enrollment. The remaining, unexplained part of the effect of Priority designation

on enrollment suggests that some parents chose to move students into Priority schools. Perhaps

parents in nearby schools viewed the Priority label as an indication of additional state

involvement, help, and oversight with hope for improvement. We see little effect of Priority

status on enrollment for schools in the 2013 and 2014 cohorts.




                                                 32
       Almost all of the Priority school interventions required staff replacement and rehiring –

of teachers, the principal, or both. We examine effects of Priority designation on teacher mobility

and principal replacement. Overall, we find little to no effect of Priority status on these staffing

measures. In the top panel of Table 3, we see some evidence that schools designated as Priority

in the initial cohort of 2012 experienced greater shares of new teachers in the first post-treatment

year, relative to barely non-Priority schools. Yet, this increase in new teachers can be explained

by the enrollment boost discussed above. The effect of Priority designation on the share of

teachers new to the school in 2014, 2015, and 2016 is close to zero and statistically insignificant.

We depict this finding graphically in Figure 5. Further, we do not find evidence of such increases

in the share of new teachers as a consequence of Priority status for the cohorts of 2013 and 2014.

Our estimates of the effect of Priority designation on whether the principal of the school is new

are very noisy, but positive in magnitude for two of the three cohorts (2013 and 2014). We find

no effects on teacher-student or aide-student ratios for any of the three cohorts.

       One interpretation of these results is weak implementation on the part of schools and

districts. This interpretation is supported by a descriptive comparison of the share of teachers

new to a school by intervention type. We obtained data from the School Reform Office (SRO) in

Michigan on the intervention model (transformation, turnaround, restart, closure) chosen by each

Priority school in the cohorts of 2012, 2013, and 2014. If Priority schools that chose the slightly

more severe “turnaround” model were following the associated guidelines, the average share of

teachers new to those schools in the year following Priority designation should be around 50

percent. For such schools in the cohort of 2012 (n = 10), this share is 37 percent – a figure that is

not much higher than the corresponding share among schools that chose the most flexible option,

“transformation,” which carried no specific requirements regarding teacher and staff



                                                 33
replacement: 34 percent. Percentages for Priority schools in our analytic sample that chose the

“turnaround” model in the subsequent cohorts of 2013 (n = 1) and 2014 (n = 3) look similar,

though the number of newly identified Priority schools that chose this option is much smaller in

those later cohorts.

       In Table 4, we present estimates of several key measures of student composition. Despite

the substantial increase in enrollment in the 2012 cohort, we do not see any large or consistent

changes in the racial or socioeconomic composition of the schools. In the 2013 cohort, there

appears to have been an initial, modest decrease in the fraction of economically disadvantaged

students due to Priority designation. In the 2014 cohort, we see some evidence that Priority status

reduced the share of Hispanic students enrolled in Priority schools, relative to barely non-Priority

schools. Overall, however, most of the effects on measures of school composition are modest.

We see no evidence that Priority designation increased the share of students in special education

at Priority schools, relative to their barely non-Priority counterparts.

VII.   Findings for the Focus Intervention

       We next turn our attention to Focus schools. As we did with Priority schools, we first test

the key RD assumptions that allow us to interpret any subsequent differences between Focus and

barely non-Focus schools as causal effects of Focus reforms. We then discuss our main findings

concerning the effects of Focus designation on student achievement, school composition, and

staffing on a cohort-by-cohort basis.

       A. Exploration of RD Assumptions

       The first assumption is that schools are unable to manipulate the assignment variable. In

terms of Focus schools, this variable was a measure of within-school gaps in performance

between the top 30 percent and bottom 30 percent of students. In Figure 6, we present the



                                                  34
distribution of this running variable in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and test for any jump at the cutoff

value using the McCrary (2008) test. We find no evidence of bunching near the cutoff suggestive

of running variable manipulation for any of the three cohorts.

        The second assumption is that in the neighborhood of the cutoff, we can consider schools

to either side as equivalent in all observed and unobserved respects expect one: the receipt of the

Focus designation and associated intervention requirements. If true, we should see few

differences in observable baseline characteristics of Focus and non-Focus schools across the

cutoff. As we did with Priority schools, we show results for four baseline characteristics in

Figure 7, including prior average math and reading scores along with summary measures of

student demographics and school structure.

        Looking across these graphs, we fail to find discontinuous changes in the observable

school characteristics at the cutoff for the first cohort of schools to be considered for Focus

interventions. Appendix Figures A4 and A5 show comparable graphs for the 2013 and 2014

cohorts of schools. As noted above, once a school is identified as Focus or Priority, it is

essentially out of the risk-set for subsequent “Focus” treatment. For this reason, these figures

exclude any schools that have been previously identified as Focus or Priority schools. For the

cohort of 2013, we see some evidence that Focus schools performed better in math relative to

their barely non-Focus counterparts at baseline.32 For the cohort of 2014, we see little evidence

of differences in math achievement, reading achievement, or measures of school composition at

the cutoff.




32
 In all subsequent outcome models, our controls include baseline achievement in math and reading. Nevertheless,
we also caution readers in the standalone interpretation of this one cohort.

                                                       35
         B. First-Stage Impact on Treatment

         Figure 8 illustrates the extent of dynamic treatment crossover for the 2012 Focus

treatment cohort.33 Figures 8A and 8B show the probability that a school was identified for

Focus intervention by 2013 and 2015, respectively. In Figure 8A, we see how the movement of

some control schools in 2012 to the treatment side of the cutoff in 2013 mutes the relationship

between a school’s initial (2012) performance gap index value and the cumulative likelihood it is

ever flagged for Focus intervention. Figure 8B illustrates that about 45 percent of schools that

fell just to the control side of the initial 2012 cutoff had been identified as Focus schools by

2015.

         C. Impacts on Academic Achievement

         Table 5 presents estimates of the effects of Focus designation on measures of academic

achievement, with a special focus on within-school math and reading gaps.34 Since the principal

aim of the Focus label was to bring attention to large within-school gaps in achievement, these

outcomes are of prime importance in assessing the efficacy of any attendant interventions

implemented by Focus schools. We find little to no effect of Focus designation on reading

performance – at the mean and at various points along the within-school achievement

distribution. In Appendix Table A5, we test the sensitivity of our estimates of the effect of Focus

status on math and reading gap scores to additional RD specifications that vary the data window

and the inclusion of controls.




33
   We include all schools in the initial cohort of 2012 and thus a few to the left of the Focus cutoff met the Priority-
school criteria and were designated as such.
34
   These outcome measures are slightly different than the variable that functions as the running variable for Focus
assignment. That running variable is calculated over two years of prior test scores (see Appendix B for details). For
each subject area, we generate our outcomes based on data from each single year and calculate the gap between the
top 30 percent of students and bottom 30 percent of students, following the general steps of the state’s calculation
rules outlined in Appendix B.

                                                           36
         In Figure 9, we explore the effects of Focus designation on the math gap score for the

cohorts of 2012 and 2014.35 The linear parametric RD estimates below each graph come from

specifications without control variables. Estimates from our preferred specification that includes

baseline controls appear in Table 5 and tell the same story. For these two cohorts, we find

evidence that Focus schools shrunk within-school gaps in math performance more than their

barely non-Focus counterparts. Unfortunately, these reductions were small (i.e., about 4 percent

of the control mean) and short-lived. In both cohorts, the gap reductions disappeared by the

second or third year after initial identification. Further, estimates across the achievement

distribution suggest that decreases in the math gap were driven by declines in performance

among students in the top of the distribution while the performance of students in the lower parts

of the distribution remained steady.36

         One might be worried that one explanation for these findings is that schools that fell close

to the Focus threshold but remained untreated also responded and worked to improve their gap

scores. If such threat effects exist, our comparison between treatment and control schools within

the RD setup might understate the true causal impact of the reform. We explore this concern in

Appendix Figure A6, wherein we examine trends in the math gap score for Focus schools in the

cohort of 2012 alongside a comparison group of schools that should be less sensitive to any

threat effects but still function as a reasonable approximation of what the treatment group would

have experienced absent treatment.37 The decline in the math gap score from 2012 to 2013 for


35
   We focus on the cohorts of 2012 and 2014 since these are the two cohorts for which baseline tests of the RD
assumptions that undergird our analyses of the causal effects of Focus status are most compellingly met.
36
   In results not reported, we find no effect of Focus designation on the distribution of school mean achievement.
That is, we see no evidence that Focus status benefited some subset of very low-performing schools more than
others.
37
   We define this comparison group as schools that have running variable values between 0.25 and 0.50, which
correspond roughly to the 24th and 36th percentiles of the gap-score rating distribution respectively. We focus on the
2012 cohort because the RD assumptions are compellingly met and we can observe the longest trajectory of
outcomes for this cohort (i.e., up to four years after initial identification as a Focus school).

                                                          37
the treatment group is larger than that of the comparison group, but the net difference in those

changes is comparable to our RD estimate in magnitude. Thus, our RD findings are unlikely to

be driven by comparable improvements in this measure due to threat effects among the non-

treated schools. The graph in Panel A suggests that the treatment group experienced continued

declines in the math gap measure that were a bit larger than the comparison schools for another

year or so. Panels B and C of Appendix Figure A6 illustrate that even if the modest reduction in

within-school math performance gaps persisted a bit long, the character of the gap closure did

not change. We see that any small reductions in within-school math achievement gaps were

driven by little to no improvement of those in the bottom of the distribution (Panel B) alongside

declines in the performance of those at the top (Panel C).

       E. Impacts on School Staffing, Enrollment, and Composition

       In Table 6, we turn to effects of Focus status on measures of school staffing and

enrollment. We do not find an effect of Focus designation on total school enrollment in any of

the three cohorts. In terms of staffing, we find some suggestive evidence from the cohorts of

2013 and 2014 that schools under Focus status experienced higher rates of teacher departure than

their barley non-Focus counterpanes in the year immediately following identification. Figures

10B and 10C show the corresponding graphs for the 2013 and 2014 cohorts, respectively. Yet,

we see no such effect on teacher mobility for the cohort of 2012 (see Figure 10A). Of any cohort,

the evidence of an effect of Focus status on teacher mobility appears most suggestive for the

cohort of 2014, where we observe a concomitant decrease in the teacher-student ratio alongside

the increase in the share of teachers leaving the school.

       In Table 7 we explore the effects of Focus designation on the composition of students in

schools. Across all three cohorts, we find no evidence that Focus status influenced the share of



                                                 38
students who are black or Hispanic, or the share of economically disadvantaged students in a

school, or the share of students receiving special education services. The vast majority of results

are close to zero in magnitude, fairly precise, and statistically insignificant. In results not

reported but available upon request, we similarly find no evidence of an effect of Focus status on

a range of additional measures of school composition and student mobility including the share of

students new to the school who were not grade limited in their prior school and the share of

students with limited English proficiency.

VIII. Putting it All Together: Findings from a Dynamic Regression-Discontinuity

        Approach

        Given the dynamic nature of the school reforms we study, our analysis can be recast in a

frame similar to the study of school bond elections by Cellini, Ferreira, and Rothstein (2010).

Our context differs from the school bond case in at least two ways: (i) schools cannot choose to

be considered for Priority or Focus status in the way that a district can choose to hold a bond

election in a given year; and (ii) a school cannot be labeled Priority or Focus more than once –

that is, falling below the cutoff two years in a row does not constitute more intervention in the

way that passing two bonds constitutes more funding. This also means that once a school is

labeled a Priority or Focus school in one year, it is essentially out of the “risk set” for

consideration in future years (although these schools remain in the pool of schools that are

ranked, and thus influence the cutoff score for future cohorts). In this section, we pool our three

cohorts of schools and adapt the approach developed by Cellini et al. (2010) to estimate

treatment-on-the-treated effects in a way that accommodates the dynamic nature of the

intervention.




                                                  39
         Following Cellini et al. (2010), we create a panel in which the school by ranking year is

considered the fundamental unit of analysis, with time relative to the ranking year denoted by τ

(as distinct from academic year which is denoted t). We include data from academic year 2009-

2010 (2010) through 2015-2016 (2016). For the 2012 ranking,  runs from -3 through +3. For

the 2013 and 2014 rankings, respectively,  runs from -3 to +2 and -3 to 1. Hence, a school that

existed over the entire six-year period would be included 7 + 6 + 5 = 18 times in the panel.

However, once a school is designated as Focus/Priority, we exclude it from future risk sets. For

example, schools that are designated Priority in 2012 will only appear in the data for this first

ranking cohort, which will correspond to 7 annual observations. Likewise, a school that is

designated Priority in 2013 will appear in two ranking cohorts, for a total of 13 observations.38

         We estimate the following model to estimate the intent-to-treat (ITT) effects of

Focus/Priority designation:

                  2
(5)      y jt   b jt  hITT
                                h  Pg ( rjt ,   )     t   jt  e jt
                 h 0



in which y jt represents the outcome for school j in the t ranking cohort, τ years after (before)

the ranking year. The b terms are indicators for whether school j’s ranking in cohort t was below

the cutoff for the first time and, if so, whether the year in the model is τ years after the ranking.

The estimates of ITT capture the effect of missing the cutoff on school outcomes τ years later.

The equation includes fixed effects for academic year (κ) and year relative to ranking (α). Fixed

effects for school-by-cohort (λ) absorb across-school variation. Pg  rjt ,    is a polynomial in the

ranking variable for cohort (i.e., ranking year) t. Both the   and ITT are allowed to vary freely


38
   Because the Priority designation is the more severe sanction, schools that are designated Priority are no longer
eligible to be labeled Focus. Hence, in conducting the analysis of the Focus intervention, we exclude schools that
have previously been labeled Priority or Focus.

                                                                  40
with  for   0 , but are constrained to zero otherwise. The value of the school performance

polynomial, r j , is set to zero in years prior to the introduction of the policy (i.e., academic years

2010-2012). Standard errors are clustered by school.

        We include all schools that scored within -1 and 1.5 of the cutoff in the 2012 ranking in

our sample. This captures approximately 95 percent of schools that that were ever subject to any

intervention. In theory, we could include all schools. However, we have less confidence in the

ability of even a high-order polynomial to account for unobserved school characteristics if we get

too far from the cutoff. To estimate the impact of actually experiencing the intervention, we

estimate dynamic treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) parameters using the recursive method

outlined in Cellini et al. (2010).

        One final issue involves the inclusion of covariates. In a standard cross-section RD

model, one can include pre-treatment controls in order to increase the precision of the estimates,

or create balance that one believes is necessary for the RD assumptions to hold. In the dynamic

context described above, the inclusion of school fixed effects should go a long way toward these

goals. However, if one is willing to assume that the intervention did not impact certain outcomes

(e.g., the demographic composition of students in the school), then one can further include such

time-varying school characteristics in the models. We do not include such time-varying school

controls in our dynamic RD model since the interventions of interest could have plausibly

affected the composition and staffing of treated schools.

        Tables 8 and 9 present the TOT results for measures of school staffing and composition

(Table 8) and achievement (Table 9). These estimates should be interpreted as the effect of an

additional year under Priority or Focus status on an outcome. Overall, the patterns of coefficients

largely mirror the conclusions we drew from our cohort-by-cohort analyses. In Table 8, we find


                                                  41
little effect of Priority intervention on teacher or principal mobility. We see a boost in school

enrollment after four years under Priority intervention. Again, this is likely a product of the

closure of geographically clustered Priority schools over time. We see small to no effects of

Focus treatment on measures of staffing and the demographic composition of schools. In Table

9, we find no evidence that Priority or Focus reforms improved average student achievement in

math or reading.

IX.    Conclusions

       In this paper, we study the effects of waiver-based Priority and Focus reforms on a range

of educational outcomes. To date, there has been little research on the causal effects of these new

reforms. Our analysis focuses on the state of Michigan, a state with one of the clearest

procedures for identifying Priority and Focus schools. We exploit sharp, discontinuous

assignment rules used to distinguish Priority and Focus schools in conjunction with rich

administrative data on students and schools to study these effects.

       In terms of the prescriptive reforms that targeted the lowest-achieving schools, we find

little to no effect of Priority status and associated reforms on measures of school staffing,

composition, or academic achievement. Based on a review of federal and state reports, as well as

interviews with state officials, we suspect that these null results were – at least in part – due to

weak implementation at the school and district levels overlaid by poor monitoring and limited

capacity on the part of state officials. Further, our own descriptive analysis of teacher movement

in and out of Priority schools that chose different intervention models is consistent with such

notions of implementation infidelity.

       Our analysis of Focus schools yields similar findings. Although we find some evidence

that Focus designation leads to short-run reductions in the within-school gap in math



                                                  42
performance, these declines are small (i.e., a reduction of between 2 and 4 percent of the control

group mean gap score per year of Focus status) and appear to be driven by stagnant performance

of students in the lower part of the within-school achievement distribution in tandem with

performance declines by students in the upper quantiles of the distribution. We find no effects of

Focus status on measures of school composition or reading performance. As with the Priority

reforms, some evidence suggests that weak implementation contributed to the null results.

Michigan’s most recent federal monitoring report cites the state’s inability to adequately identify

and oversee implementation of specific interventions fielded in Focus schools (U.S. Department

of Education, 2014b, p. 5).

        This picture is largely consistent with emerging evidence from other states on Focus-

school reforms (Dee & Dizon-Ross, 2017). A recent report from the U.S. Government

Accountability Office found that many states struggled with multiple implementation challenges

related to waiver-based reforms, including incomplete accountability systems and difficulty

monitoring districts and schools (GAO, 2016). The one exception is Kentucky, where Focus

designation led to improvements in math and reading achievement for targeted students (Bonilla

& Dee, 2017). The authors cite strong state oversight and high-fidelity implementation that

included comprehensive school planning and professional development as likely mediators of

these positive effects.

        Like the NCLB waivers, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESEA) continues to require

states to identify their lowest-performing schools (i.e., the bottom 5 percent) and to intervene in

those schools; but, states will have much more flexibility in determining the attributes of the

interventions they field in those schools (Burnette II, 2016; National Council of State

Legislatures, 2016). However, the new accountability provisions in the ESSA tied to a state’s



                                                 43
lowest-performing schools differ in at least two additional ways from the waiver era reforms.

First, states must include at least one non-academic factor (such as student engagement or school

safety) along with academic indicators in their school rating systems. Second, districts with low-

performing schools will receive extra funds from the state-level pot of Title I dollars that are

specifically allocated to support the turnaround of chronically struggling schools (Burnette II,

2016). The degree to which these changes will translate into meaningful action on the part of

states, districts, and schools that leads to improved student outcomes is unclear. The first round

of EESA plans suggests that states have closely hewn to the accountability structures they set up

under their NCLB waivers (Klein & Ujifusa, 2017). Further research will be needed to determine

if the EESA reforms are able to improve student performance.

Notes: Standard deviations of select continuous variables appear in parentheses below the means. Sample is limited to K-8, non-special-
education, non-charter schools open as of the fall of 2012 with total enrollment in the baseline year of at least 50 students. Schools
identified as persistently low achieving (PLA) prior to 2012 and schools that received SIG grants during the first two competitions (prior to
2012) are also excluded from the sample. The running variable for Priority schools is an index of prior level achievement, growth in
achievement, and performance gaps; the running variable for Focus schools is a measure of the gap in performance between the top 30
percent and bottom 30 percent of students within a school. See text for additional details about running variables. LEP = limited English
proficient; SIG = school improvement grant. Cohorts I and II of the SIG competition were identified before the first cohort of Priority and
Focus schools. Priority and Focus schools were eligible to compete for SIG funding in Cohorts III and IV.

Notes: The analytic sample for the 2012 cohort includes all students enrolled in K-8, non-special-education, non-charter schools open as of the fall of 2012 with total enrollment in the baseline year
of least 50 students. For subsequent cohorts, we exclude schools identified as Priority in prior years since they leave the risk set for Priority treatment after initial designation for intervention.
Coefficients presented in the table come from our preferred parametric specification, which is estimated on a data window of +/- 0.25 from the cutoff, includes covariates, and is weighted by total
enrollment. For a full list of covariates, please consult the text. Robust standard errors appear in parentheses. Control group means appear in brackets. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. ITT = intent

Notes: The analytic sample for the 2012 cohort includes all students enrolled in K-8, non-special-education, non-charter schools open as of the fall of 2012 with total enrollment in the baseline year
of at least 50 students. For subsequent cohorts, we exclude schools identified as Focus or Priority in prior years since they leave the risk set for Focus treatment after initial designation for
intervention. Coefficients presented in the table come from our preferred parametric specification, which is estimated on a data window of +/- 0.50 from the cutoff, includes covariates, and is
weighted by total enrollment. For a full list of covariates, please consult the text. Robust standard errors appear in parentheses. Control group means appear in brackets. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *

Notes: The analytic sample for the 2012 cohort includes all students enrolled in K-8, non-special-education, non-charter schools open as of the fall of 2012
with total enrollment in the baseline year of at least 50 students. For subsequent cohorts, we exclude schools identified as Focus or Priority in prior years
since they leave the risk set for Focus treatment after initial designation for intervention. Coefficients presented in the table come from our preferred
parametric specification, which is estimated on a data window of +/- 0.50 from the cutoff, includes covariates, and is weighted by total enrollment. For a full
list of covariates, please consult the text. Robust standard errors appear in parentheses. Control group means appear in brackets. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, *
p<0.1. ITT = intent to treat.

Notes: The analytic sample for the 2012 cohort includes all students enrolled in K-8, non-special-education, non-charter schools open as of the fall of 2012
with total enrollment in the baseline year of at least 50 students. For subsequent cohorts, we exclude schools identified as Focus or Priority in prior years
since they leave the risk set for Focus treatment after initial designation for intervention. Coefficients presented in the table come from our preferred
parametric specification, which is estimated on a data window of +/- 0.50 from the cutoff, includes covariates, and is weighted by total enrollment. For a full
list of covariates, please consult the text. Robust standard errors appear in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Control group means appear in
brackets. ITT = intent to treat.
