Reserve Uncertainty and the Supply of International Credit

JEL No. F2, F3

                                            ABSTRACT
       This paper examines how increased uncertainty about an emerging market's international
reserves affects the willingness of foreign investors to supply international credits. We illustrate the
relevance of this concern for South Korea during the recent financial crisis. Using available
information about Korea's reserves at the onset of the crisis, we show that "usable" reserves turned
out to be much lower than what a reasonable forecast would have predicted. We then develop a
model of an emerging-market economy where there is sovereign risk and moral hazard is a problem
because agents expect the emerging market to bail out creditors with its reserves.
        We show that reserve uncertainty has a non-linear effect on the supply of credit. When the
expected reserve position of an emerging market is large relative to the potential bailout in bad states
of nature, reserve volatility does not matter. However, the same amount of reserve volatility can
cause a large reduction in the supply of international credit if the emerging market's foreign debt is
large enough or if the collapse of output forces the private sector to downgrade its priors about
repayment possibilities. In addition, reserve volatility can reduce international credit if investors
become more pessimistic about the emerging market's reserve position.

 I.       Introduction

          In October, 1997, turbulence in Hong Kong’s foreign exchange and equity markets

spread rapidly to other emerging markets. During the same period, market participants

became aware that the Bank of Korea was unable to use a large share of its reserves because

it had previously placed them with foreign branches of domestic banks. Uncertainty about

the size of South Korea’s “usable” reserves contributed to the crisis atmosphere in which

investors had to operate. In this paper, we examine how increased uncertainty about an

emerging market’s reserves might affect the willingness of foreign investors to supply

international credit. We show that increased reserve uncertainty has a nonlinear and

potentially large adverse effect on the supply of international credit. As a result, it can

contribute to the liquidity shortage often experienced by emerging markets during a crisis.

          We start with an overview of the events that led to increased uncertainty about

Korean reserves. Then, using available information about the reserve path before the onset

of the crisis, we show that official reserves and, even more dramatically, usable reserves,

turned out to be much lower that what a reasonable forecast would have predicted.

          Next, we examine the impact of greater reserve uncertainty on the supply of

international credit. We model an emerging-market economy where the private sector

believes the domestic authority will use its international reserves to bail out lenders. The

moral hazard problem associated with domestic bailouts has been cited by various observers

as a contributing factor in the Asian financial crisis.1

          We derive the supply of international credit to emerging markets when reserve

uncertainty interacts with uncertainty about the probability of a reserve-financed bailout.

     See Krugman (1998) and Corsetti, Pesenti and Roubini (1998).
We show that when the expected reserve position of emerging markets is large relative to

the potential bailout in a bad state of nature, reserve volatility does not matter. However,

the same amount of reserve volatility can cause a large reduction in the offered supply of

international credit if emerging-market debt is large enough or if the collapse of output

forces the private sector to downgrade its priors about repayment possibilities. In addition,

reserve volatility can reduce international credit if investors become more pessimistic about

the expected reserve position of emerging markets.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes the evolution of Korean

reserves and compares the actual paths of reported and usable reserves with a forecast based

on an auto-regressive process. Section III describes the model and analyzes the effects of

lower expected reserve levels and increased volatility of reserves on the supply of

international credit extended to emerging markets. Section IV concludes.




 II. South Korea’s reserve holdings

        In the summer of 1997, concern mounted about whether South Korea could

 withstand the financial crisis engulfing its Asian neighbors. South Korea’s official reserve

 position appeared strong. After having seen its reserves decline during the first quarter of

 1997 following labor unrest and the Hanbo Steel bankruptcy, the Bank of Korea reported a

 recovery in its reserve holdings during the second quarter. It announced that its May

 reserve holdings were almost $32 billion. It put its end-of-June holdings at $33.3 billion.

 But over the summer and into the fall, there were rumors that South Korea’s central bank

 had built up forward dollar liabilities by intervening in the forward market for won. In

 addition, stories circulated that the Bank of Korea was placing foreign-currency deposits

 with foreign branches of domestic Korean banks. It was not clear at the time whether this



                                               2
emergency short-term liquidity support for Korean banks was affecting official reserves.

As it turned out, the severity of the liquidity pressures facing these banks meant that the

central-bank deposits could not be withdrawn. Consequently, the international reserves the

Bank of Korea could use in a crisis were considerably less than its reported official

reserves.

         Indeed, the gap between South Korea’s “official” and “usable” reserves turned out

to be sizeable. The International Monetary Fund later reported that while official Korean

reserves fell from $31 billion to $24 billion between the end of October and early

December, 1997, usable reserves were only about $ 6 billion (Adams et. al. , 1998, p. 20).

Figure 1 shows the growing gap between official and usable reserves as the crisis

approached. The Bank of Korea’s practice of placing deposits with foreign branches of

domestic banks actually began in the late 1980s, but the discrepancy between official and

usable reserves stayed relatively small through 1996. At the end of 1996, only 10% of

official reserves were placed in such deposits, making the gap between official and usable

reserves $3.8 billion. The discrepancy increased during 1997 as the Bank of Korea

extended additional liquidity support to troubled off-shore branches of Korean banks. By

the end of June, 1997, the gap between official and usable reserves had grown to $8

billion. By the end of November, the gap had risen to $17 billion. (BOK news releases,

1998).

         The size of the gap was unknown to investors when Thailand floated its currency

on July 2, 1997, triggering the start of the Asian crisis. All investors had to go on were the

reported official reserve figures and rumors that some of those reserves could not be

accessed in case of an emergency. When, a few weeks later, Kia Motors requested a debt

work-out with its major creditors to avoid bankruptcy, confidence was further undermined.

The OECD later reported that “the lack of timely, reliable information on the state of

(Korean) banks’ non-performing loans, official foreign exchange reserves and foreign debt

added to uncertainty” during this period. (OECD, 1998, p. 31).


                                              3
          The Korean case raises an interesting set of questions. How does uncertainty about

the level of reserves affect the behavior of foreign lenders? Can reserve uncertainty

contribute to the onset of crisis? Does it make more severe a crisis that has already begun?

          Before examining these questions with the help of a model, we can get some

suggestive evidence on investor beliefs about Korean reserve levels by constructing

confidence bands around a prediction of reserves. To obtain the prediction, we assume

that investors viewed Korean official reserves as following an auto-regressive process. We

therefore regress monthly Korean official reserves on a constant and lagged official

reserves for the period January, 1995-July, 1997, where the June, 1997, official reserve

holdings represent the last available data for use in estimation prior to the start of the Asian

crisis. For these 30 observations, the regression results are:


                       Ft* = 0.4679 +      0.8668 Ft-1*                                  (1)
                             (0.2373)      (0.0687)


where F* is the logarithm of official foreign-currency reserves and standard errors of the

estimated coefficients are reported in parentheses. The adjusted R 2 is 0.84, the standard

error of the regression is 0.0350 and the Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.65 suggests that

serial correlation is not a serious problem. Suppose foreign lenders had used equation (1)

to forecast Korean reserves after June, 1997. What would be the implication of having

done so? 2




2
    For small samples, one cannot reject the hypothesis that reserves follow a random walk.
Both the auto-regressive process and the random walk formulation have similar
implications for our topic of interest. Estimating (1) through October 1997 does not affect
the main results. Note that Ft* is measured in log($ billions).




                                               4
       Figure 2 illustrates the data ultimately reported for official and usable reserves from

mid-1996 through mid-1998. 3 In addition, the figure shows the predicted values of

Korean official reserves for the estimation period based on the auto-regressive process and

the 95% confidence band surrounding that prediction. For the period July, 1997 and after,

we assume that investors continued to use the June, 1997 official reserve report to predict

monthly reserves. However, the confidence bands around the prediction widened to reflect

the growing uncertainty about the true value of reserves. Note that even before Thailand

devalued the baht on July 2, usable reserves were considerably beneath the lower

confidence band. After the Thai devaluation, Korean official reserves began to move

toward the lower confidence band, and shortly after the Hong Kong and Chinese stock

market crises hit on October 25, 1997, even official reserves moved below the lower

confidence band, while usable reserves were multiple standard deviations below the band.

Thus both officially-reported reserves and usable reserves turned out to be much lower

than any reasonable forecast.




3
 Some of the monthly observations in 1996 for usable reserves are unavailable, so missing
data are obtained by extrapolation.




                                              5
III. The Model

       Consider a global economy composed of a high-income countries and emerging-

market economies. Agents in the high-income countries are risk neutral, so their

preferences over a two-period planning horizon are characterized by:

                                            C2
                                V ≡ C1 +                                           (2)
                                           1+ ρ


where ρ is the rate of time preference and coincides with the risk-free interest rate.

Agents in the emerging-market economies have preferences represented by

                                                  u(C2*)
                                V * ≡ u(C1* ) +          ; u' >; u"≤ 0             (3)
                                                  1 + ρ*



We assume that ρ* > ρ because the real interest rate in the emerging-market

economies is substantially above the rate in the high-income group.

       The only exogenous source of uncertainty is a productivity shock to second-

period output in the emerging markets:


                                Y2* = Y * (1+ ε )                                (4)


where ε is a stochastic shock with probability density function f (ε) over the range
−ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε 0 , with ε 0 ≥ 0 . All private agents are price takers.

       The emerging-market economies may borrow internationally, but their ability to

borrow is constrained by the limited enforceability of international contracts. Consider

the simple case where the emerging markets initially have no outstanding foreign debt.
Suppose that the high-income countries lend an aggregate amount B1* in period 1 to

private agents in the emerging-market group at a contractual interest rate of r. In period

2, the borrowers must repay the loan, but because their output is uncertain, they may

default.



                                                    6
        Let S2 denote the debt repayment to foreign creditors in period 2. In the event

of default, suppose creditors can penalize the borrowing countries by reducing their net
output by an amount χY2* . The parameter χ reflects the bargaining power of foreign

lenders, where up to a fraction χ of output can be "confiscated" by lenders due to the

threat of embargoes, retaliatory trade measures and other actions.4 Consequently, the

effective ceiling on net resource transfers to creditors is:


                        S2 = min[(1+ r)B1* ,χY2*]                                    (5)



        The size of the productivity shock that makes the emerging-market countries

indifferent between repaying the loan or defaulting and facing the output penalty is ε * ,
where ε * is determined by the condition (1+ r)B1* = χY* (1+ ε * ) . Thus

                                (1+ r )B1*          
                        ε = max            − 1,−ε 0 
                         *
                                                                                     (6)
                                χY
                                       *
                                                     


For realized productivity shocks between −ε 0 andε * , default saves the borrowers (at

the expense of the lenders) the difference between the contractual repayment and the

output penalty. We denote this gap -- the potential bailout -- by b


                        b ≡ (1+ r)B1* − χY * (1+ ε) = χY* (ε * − ε)                  (7)


        The international credit market is risk neutral and characterized by competition

among banks that are fully informed about the debt exposure of the emerging-market

group. Default by the emerging markets requires that creditor banks spend real




4
 The term χ is influenced by a host of factors that relate to the integration of markets.




                                                7
resources µ in order to verify the productivity shock and to enforce the transfer of

resources from emerging markets according to (5). 5

       Since large defaults are potentially destabilizing, agents anticipate there is some

probability of a public bailout by the treasury or central bank of the emerging-market

block.6 We summarize the bailout expectations in a reduced-form equation, where the
bailout probability φ * increases with the default size:


                φ * = φ* (b), where [φ* (b)]′ > 0 for b > 0; φ * (0) = [φ * (0)]′ = 0   (8)


       In the event of a default, emerging-market governments try to compensate
lenders for the revenue shortfall using their period-two net international reserves, F2* .

However, their reserve stockpile may not be adequate to accomplish a full bailout.

Creditor income earned on the loan in the case of default and a bailout is equal to either

the full bailout or the stock of reserves held by emerging markets, whichever is less,

plus the output penalty obtained by lenders:


                                         min[b, F2*] + χY * (1+ ε ) ,                   (9)



5
 To simplify, we lump together the costs of monitoring and enforcement, and we ignore
the possibility of randomized monitoring. Boyd and Smith (1994) show that random
monitoring makes the financial contract more complex without altering first-order welfare
effects. See Townsend (1979) for a model where a debt contract with state verification
costs is optimal. See Bernanke and Gertler (1989) for a related analysis.

6
 While our focus is on the impact of uncertainty about the international reserves of the
emerging markets, we can easily add within our framework uncertainty about the
possibility of eventual bailouts financed by the global financial community. For a model of
moral hazard generated by the expectation of a bailout by the international community, see
Aizenman and Turnovsky (1999).




                                                  8
        The intertemporal pattern of consumption and lending is determined by agents

who maximize their discounted expected utility. The risk neutrality of lenders implies

that they offer an elastic supply of credit at an expected yield equal to their rate of time

preference. Thus the interest rate on emerging-market debt (r) is determined by an

arbitrage condition that equates the expected yield on loans to emerging markets to the

risk-free return:


                                                       {φ       min[F2* ,b] + χY * (1+ ε ) − µ } f (ε)dε =
                                                   *
                         ε0                   ε
           (1+ r)B1* ∫ * f (ε)dε +∫                         *
                        ε                    −ε0

           (1+ ρ)B1*                                                                                         (10)




The left-hand side of (10) consists of two components: (i) the return on the loan in the

absence of default; (ii) the return on the loan in the presence of default, which equals the

possible bailout and the share of foreign output claimed in a default, all less

enforcement costs.

        Using (7), we can rewrite the left-hand side of (10) as:




                      ∫ {φ             min[F2*,b] + χY* (1+ ε) − (1+ r)B1* − µ} f (ε)dε =
                            *
                        ε
        (1+ r)B1* +                *
                       −ε 0


        (1+ r)B1* + ∫−ε {φ * min[F2*,b] − χY * (ε * − ε) − µ} f (ε )dε =
                        ε*
                                                                                                             (11)
                             0




                                 {b + µ − φ        min[F2*,b]} f(ε)dε
                        ε*
        (1+ r)B1* − ∫                         *
                        −ε 0




Equations (10) and (11) imply that the financial premium charged to emerging markets

takes into account the riskiness of these loans:



                                      ∫ {b + µ −φ                         min[F2* ,b]} f (ε )dε
                                            ε*
                                                                      *
                                            − ε0
                                 r−ρ=                                                                        (12)
                                                                          B1*



                                                                       9
Note that monitoring and enforcement costs are passed on to borrowers by way of

higher borrowing rates.

       For future reference, we will want to use a rearranged version of (12):




                       ∫ {b + µ − φ       min[F2*,b]} f(ε)dε − (r − ρ)B1* = 0
                          ε*
                                      *
                                                                                      (12')
                          −ε 0




       We now examine how uncertainty about reserves held by emerging markets

affects the supply of international credit they can obtain. Consider the simplest form of

international reserve uncertainty that gives rise to a gap between "official international

reserves" and “actual reserves”. Suppose actual reserves in period two are either low or

high with equal probabilities:

 The specification in (13) is the simplest way to model reserve uncertainty. The key
results of the model, summarized below in Proposition 1, hold for other distributions of λ,
such as the uniform or truncated normal.

total reserves in the state where reserves are high. [where b = F (1+ λ) ]:

where Eb is the expected size of the bailout, conditional on having a bailout.

        Figure 3a illustrates the expected repayment of the loan for given values of the

productivity shock. In the absence of a bailout, the repayment is the minimum of the

contractual debt repayment (curve PK) and the output penalty (curve NJ). This

repayment is traced out by the thick dashed curve NLK. For shocks in the range
−ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε *, if a bailout occurs, the expected repayment is equal to the return in the

absence of a bailout plus either a full bailout or a bailout that just exhausts the reserves
held by the emerging markets. This expected repayment ( χY2* + Eb {min[b, F2 * ]} ) is

illustrated by the curve N ′M ′ML.8 Figure 3a shows that the expected return to

creditors is constrained by reserve uncertainty when the productivity shock lies in the
range −ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε .

        Figure 3b demonstrates that for productivity shocks in the range ε ≤ ε ≤ ε ,

greater reserve volatility (λ) also reduces the expected return to creditors. Curve

N ′QK represents the expected repayment if the bailout takes place and there is no

reserve volatility (λ = 0). A lower curve N ′M ′MK corresponds to the expected

repayment if there is some reserve volatility (λ = 0.2), while an even lower curve

N ′S ′ SK illustrates the expected repayment when reserve volatility is still higher

(λ = 0.4 ). Note that the range of shocks for which reserve volatility matters increases

as the level of volatility increases.

        To calculate the expected repayment on the foreign loan when the shock is in the
default range −ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε *, we substitute (17) into (10) to get:

    We assume that the emerging-market economies operate along the upward-sloping

           Proposition 1: Greater uncertainty about the reserve position of emerging

           markets reduces the supply of international credit available to them. If the

           expected reserve position of emerging markets is adjusted downward, the supply

           of credit shifts leftward. Greater reserve volatility also shifts the supply of funds

           leftward, and the shift is magnified as volatility rises or the probability of a

           bailout increases.

 For a sufficiently low level of foreign debt, ε * = −ε 0 . In these circumstances the critical

condition for dB1* dr > 0 reduces to µf (−ε 0 ) χY * <1 , a condition that is satisfied for a

low enough but positive enforcement cost, µ. If µf (−ε 0 ) χY * >1 , the supply of credit is
backward bending at interest rates marginally above the risk-free rate. In these
circumstances it would be in the interest of borrowers to prohibit borrowing.
Consequently, we assume µf (−ε 0 ) χY * <1 , so that the supply-of-credit curve is upward
sloping at relatively low interest rates. In general, the supply curve may contain a
backward-bending section at high interest rates and external debt levels. In these
circumstances, it would be in the interest of the borrowers to adopt policies that prevent
them from reaching the backward-bending section of the supply curve since such a point
entails lower welfare than the point where external borrowing is maximized. See
Aizenman (1989) for further discussion.

10
    The supply of international credit (defined implicitly by (19)) and the demand for
international credit jointly determine the equilibrium interest rate and lending level. The
demand for credit is obtained from (3) when price-taking agents maximize expected utility.
We focus our attention on the supply side.




                                                  14
       Applying (19), we find that for a given interest rate, a downward revision in the

expected reserve level shifts the supply of credit curve leftward since:

                                ε                     ε

                dB1*        ∫−ε0

                        =                                                       >0   (21)

       This reduction in the supply of international credit occurs whenever the stock of

emerging-market reserves is expected to limit the size of the bailout. The reserve
constraint is binding when productivity shocks lie in the range −ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε . Note that

the drop in expected reserves has a non-linear impact since the reduction in the supply

of credit is magnified by the expected marginal bailout associated with an extra dollar of

reserves. Hence, news about the expected reserve position of a country matters less for

countries where the commitment to a “no-bailout” policy is credible or where the

relative foreign indebtedness is small.

       We also observe that an increase in reserve volatility shifts the supply of credit

curve leftward by the amount:

                             dλ |r                     HB' 1*



An increase in volatility reduces the supply of credit in proportion to the expected

probability of a bailout in the range where the scarcity of reserves binds partially,
ε ≤ ε ≤ ε . This is the range where there is a full bailout if actual reserves turn out to be

high but only a partial bailout if actual reserves turn out to be low. Recall that the
threshold values defining this range, ε, ε , depend on both the expected reserve level

and the degree of volatility. A fall in the expected reserve level expands the range as

does an increase in volatility. (See (15) and (16)).



                                                              15
                 An important implication is that greater reserve volatility has a non-linear effect

on the supply of international credit. Greater volatility does not affect the supply of

credit when the expected reserve position is large enough so there can be a full bailout.11

But suppose the expected reserve position is low enough so that the size of the bailout

might be constrained by the scarcity of reserves. Then the impact of greater reserve

volatility is magnified by the expected bailout in the range where the scarcity of

reserves binds partially. In terms of Figure 3b, greater reserve volatility shifts down a
segment of the expected repayment line and widens the range [ε,ε ] where the scarcity

of reserves binds partially. The net effect of higher reserve volatility is minimal around
point Q, which corresponds to the case of no volatility (λ=0), but it progressively gets

larger as volatility increases (as we move to line segment M'M and then down to

segment S'S).
                 The above considerations may be illustrated more formally. Let φ˜ * be the
                                                                   ε

From (23) we observe that the leftward shift in the supply of international credit when

there is reserve volatility is larger as reserve volatility increases or as the probability of

11
  This will be the case if ε = ε = −ε 0 . Applying (14) and (15), this is equivalent to

[(1+ r )B1* − χY *(1− ε 0 )]/(1 − λ) < F * .


12
  Assuming that φ * is a continuous function, there exists a unique value of ε such that
ε > ε > ε , satisfying this condition.


                                                                         16
bailouts rises. The intuition for the latter result is based on a time inconsistency story .

A declared "no bailout" policy is not credible in regimes where the "too big to fail"

argument or the lobbying of pressure groups forces the government to use international

reserves for bailouts. In these circumstances, the lack of transparency of international

reserves acts as a tax. The tax is larger in weak regimes where the probability of bailout

is considered high.

       Inspection of (18) reveals that the leftward shift in the supply of credit due to

greater reserve uncertainty takes place only if reserve scarcity is a binding constraint.
Reserve scarcity binds as long as productivity shocks lie in the range −ε 0 ≤ ε ≤ ε ,

where we have assumed −ε 0 < ε . Given the definition of ε in (15), the assumption that

−ε 0 < ε is equivalent to


                        (1 + r)B1* − χY * (1− ε 0 ) > F *(1 − λ)                        (24)



This condition implies that the supply of international credit is reduced by greater

reserve volatility when the potential bailout in the worst state of nature (defined by the

lowest productivity shock) is greater than the lowest possible reserve level. This

condition is more likely to hold the lower is expected international reserves and the

greater is the volatility of reserves. Such reserve uncertainty characterized the Korean

episode and can help explain the collapse of the international credit market facing that

emerging market.

IV.    Conclusion

       The unwillingness of foreign lenders to extend new credits or to roll over

existing credits to emerging markets is thought to have been an important precipitating

factor in the 1997-98 Asian crisis [Chang and Velasco (1998a, 1998b), Radelet and

Sachs (1998)] This paper shows that when loan repayments become less certain,

foreign lenders are less willing to offer international credit. More importantly, it

demonstrates that reserve volatility can, under plausible circumstances, induce large

adverse effects for emerging markets. Volatility that is benign when nonlinearities are

absent generates large costs when nonlinear restrictions bind. We observe that when the

expected reserve position of emerging markets is large relative to the potential bailout in

a bad state of nature, reserve volatility is unimportant. The same amount of reserve

volatility can cause a large reduction in the offered supply of international credit if the

emerging market’s foreign debt is large enough or if the collapse of output forces the

private sector to downgrade its priors regarding repayment possibilities. In addition,

reserve volatility that was formerly benign may lead to a reduced supply of international

credit once investors become more pessimistic about the expected reserve position of

emerging markets.13




 The interaction between volatility and nonlinearity may help explain the finding that
13


higher macroeconomic volatility in emerging markets is associated with lower private
investment and economic growth. See Aizenman and Marion (1999).
