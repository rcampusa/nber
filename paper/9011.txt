How Could Everyone Have Been So Wrong?
Forecasting the Great Depression with the Railroads

                                               ABSTRACT

        Contemporary observers viewed the recession that began in the summer of 1929 as nothing
extraordinary. Recent analyses have shown that the subsequent large deflation was econometrically
forecastable, implying that a driving force in the depression was the high expected real interest rates faced
by business. Using a neglected data set of forecasts by railroad shippers, we find that business was
surprised by the magnitude of the great depression. We show that an ARIMA or Holt-Winters model of
railroad shipments would have produced much smaller forecast errors than those indicated by the surveys.
The depth and duration of the depression was beyond the experience of business, which appears to have
believed that recovery would happen quickly as in previous recessions. This failure to anticipate the
collapse of the economy suggests roles for both high real rates of interest and a debt deflation in the
propagation of the depression.

“It seems manifest that thus far the difference between the present comparatively mild
business recession and the severe depression of 1920-1921 is like that between a thunder-
shower and a tornado” (May 5, 1930)

“Business showed further gain last week and if improvement continues at the present rate,
September should mark the low of the depression.” (October 17, 1931)
                                                                        ---Irving Fisher1

        While some sages claimed to have forecast the collapse of the stock market in 1929,

no guru divined the ensuing depression. At the outset, the Great Depression appeared to be an

ordinary, though sharp, recession (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963). Most economic indicators

had declined almost continuously from August 1929 until the end of 1930.                          Although

consumers and investors seem to have become unusually uncertain after the 1929 stock

market crash (Romer, 1990), many businessmen seemed to believe that it would be only a

short contraction. In retrospect, this bullishness amazes, as the only relief from decline was

an increase in industrial production and personal income in the first quarter of 1931.

Mirroring this positive outlook of some business leaders, Irving Fisher of Yale and the

forecasters at the Harvard Economic Service remained extraordinarily optimistic two years

into the greatest economic recession of the twentieth century.2

        While the extant evidence shows that professional forecasters failed to predict that the

recession would turn into a depression, there is no clear consensus about whether business or

the public, in general anticipated it.         Much attention has focused on whether the price

deflation was predicted. If deflation were anticipated, the falling nominal yields would have

coincided with rising real yields, thus helping to explain the collapsing consumption and

investment that is emphasized in many explanations of the Great Depression (Brunner, 1981;

 Dominguez, Fair and Shapiro (1988) found that even if these contemporary forecasters had modern time series
methods at their disposal, they would not have been able to predict industrial production or price movements
with any greater success.

Cecchetti, 1992; Romer, 1992, 1993).        If, on the other hand, the decline in prices was

unanticipated, it would have hit the economy by adding to debt burdens, forcing otherwise

solvent debtors into bankruptcy and raising risk premiums (Fisher, 1933, Bernanke, 1983,

Bernanke and Gertler, 1989, Calomiris, 1993).

       Evidence for correctly anticipating the deflation was provided by Cecchetti's (1992)

forecasts of prices. He pointed out that changes in the price level were positively correlated in

the interwar period, implying that simple rules of thumb would have led to expectations of a

continued deflation. Reading the business press, Nelson (1991) concluded that up until mid-

1930 most observers expected only a mild deflation. Afterwards, they anticipated a much

greater deflation, which might move prices back to pre-World War I levels. Romer (1992)

found that high ex ante real rates of interest through 1932 were responsible for the collapse of

fixed investment and consumer durable spending.3 In contrast, Hamilton (1987) argued that

the information content of futures markets for commodities showed that the great deflation

was largely unanticipated. Modelling the relationship between commodity prices and the

aggregate price level, Hamilton (1992) found that for the first year of the depression people

only expected one tenth of the total price level decline, while in 1931 and 1932 half the price

drops were anticipated.       Supporting the view that changes in the price level were

unanticipated, Evans and Wachtel (1993) claimed that they were largely unexpected because

there was considerable ex ante uncertainty about the future course of prices.

       Times series models and futures markets, thus yield very different stories about the

public's expectations. Unfortunately, there are no surveys of the price expectations of either

the public or business. But, there is one very careful survey that reveals expectations about




                                                3
the level of economic activity. This paper uses a long ignored panel of survey data on railroad

freight car shipments. The survey data shows that business managers persistently failed to

anticipate the collapse of 1929-1933 each step of the way down. This finding is striking

because if business managers had forecasted demand from previous actual shipments, using

simple rules, their errors would have been much smaller. Likewise, a modern ARIMA model

predicts the demand for freight cars significantly better. It appears that business continued to

expect the economy to begin a recovery and that the shift in the level of activity took a long

time to accept. The magnitude of the collapse appears to have been beyond the public's

comprehension, as all recoveries within recent experience had begun after a few quarters. Like

the professional forecasters and investors in futures markets, railroad managers failed to

forecast the depression, expecting it to follow the pattern of recent recessions. Unexpected

policy and economic events fooled both the public and the experts.


                                     Surveying Railroad Shippers

          Surveys of expectations are relatively rare in economics, historical surveys are even

rarer.4    In this paper we have “rediscovered” the only known survey data concerning

macroeconomic events from the Great Depression. Although studied as late as the 1950s and

early 1960s, railroad shippers’ forecasts were forgotten just as the econometric revolution

began.

          Coordinating freight cars to move goods across the United States undamaged and on

time had always been difficult.         In the 1920s, the problem of freight car allocation alarmed

many shippers who found that they were unable to secure cars in sufficient number in time to

keep their shipments on schedule. In response, the Association of American Railroads (AAR)

asked shippers to estimate their freight car requirements one quarter in advance. Beginning in

1923, regional Shippers’ Advisory Boards were formed under the auspices of the Car Service

Division of the AAR (Hultgren, 1955).

        The AAR’s railroad shippers’ forecasts of the demand for freight cars for 32

commodities from 13 regions were produced by Regional Shippers Advisory Boards. These

regional boards collected data from business firms’ traffic managers. The traffic manager was

responsible for arranging and expediting the shipment of a firm’s product to purchasers and

the receipt of supplies and equipment.              With knowledge of the firm’s production and

shipment schedules, the traffic manager made arrangements with railroads and other carriers.

Approximately six weeks before the beginning of the next quarter, the shippers were asked to

forecast their freight car requirements for that quarter. The forecasts were compiled two to

three weeks later by the regional board and then submitted to the national board and the AAR.

The final figures were published just before the beginning of the quarter in a release, the

“National Forecast of the Regional Shippers Advisory Boards.” One quarter later, these

releases reported the actual freight car use, thus providing an easy measure of the error made

by these business managers in their forecast of the shipment of goods. According to Ferber

(1953), the AAR apparently found these forecasts useful and established nationwide forecasts

in 1927. These forecasts represent business firms’ estimates of the goods they planned to ship

and are thus a proxy for the demand for their goods. Figure 1 shows the actual and survey

forecast of shippers’ carloadings from 1927.2 to 1940.4.5 Although our study ends in 1940,

railroads during World War II changed the essential character of the forecasts.

                  The forecast errors made by the shippers, shown in Figure 2, are measured as the

difference between the actual and forecast carloadings as a fraction of actual carloadings.

This graph tells a striking story about business expectations. Although the errors ranged from

3 to 10 percent in the three years before the Great Depression, this broad sample of

businessmen made consistently larger errors after the crash of the stock market in October

1929. In the early years of the depression, they constantly overestimated the demand for

freight cars. Their errors rose from 10 percent to nearly 30 percent by the third quarter of


million. Class I railroads operated 95 percent of total U.S. mileage and hauled 99 percent of rail traffic. There is
no adjustment for the increase in the size of freight cars, which grew by 29 percent between 1916 and 1951.


                                                                 6
1932.             They appear to have been excessively optimistic, hoping that the economy would

revive, but they were repeatedly surprised and made larger errors as the economy sank. In the

second quarter of 1930, when Fisher termed the downturn "mild," shippers forecast they

would require 8.2 million cars (8.6 million were needed in the second quarter of 1929) but

only 7.5 million were used. Their worst failure occurred in the second quarter of 1932, when

after projecting a demand for 5.1 million cars, 3.6 million were actually employed.

The survey errors also appear to show the surprise of the New Deal. According to Temin and

Wigmore (1990), Roosevelt made a sharp unanticipated break with Hoover’s policies once he

was inaugurated in March 1933. Within six weeks of taking office, he devalued the dollar,

promoted fiscal expansion and championed the virtues of reflation, thus sending a message to

all industries of a new policy regime. The data on carloadings support this interpretation of

events, as business did not anticipate the positive shocks to the economy. But, unlike the


                                                              7
downward movement of the economy, their errors were not persistent. They underestimated

demand by as much as 15 percent in several quarters in 1933 and 1934. The surprisingly

good fortunes of the economy in 1936 were followed by a failure to anticipate the decline in

demand for goods in 1937-1938. All in all, the railroad shippers, with their eye on business,

do not seem to have done a much better job at prediction than Irving Fisher or his peers at

Harvard.



                            Survey Data and the Business Cycle

       Might these errors be the results of problems with the survey? Although this is a

possibility, this survey data is largely immune from the criticism of some types of survey data.

Contemporary macroeconomic surveys, like the Livingstone survey, ask professional

economists and analysts for their forecasts. Keane and Runkle (1990) argue that these surveys

are reliable guides to expectations because the individuals surveyed depend on their reputation

as forecasters for their livelihood. On the other hand, others argue that forecasters answers are

affected by strategic motives for introducing systematic bias into publicly available forecasts

(Ehrbeck and Waldmann, 1986). While not completely safe from these criticisms, traffic

managers’ livelihoods did depend on producing accurate reports. There may have been some

strategic behavior; but in most industries, each firm was sufficiently small that it could not

hope to influence the outcome. Furthermore, one contemporary expert (Hultgren, 1948) saw

no change in the movement of empty cars from 1920 onwards that might have been an

indication of strategic behavior after the introduction of the survey. Another possible source

of bias would be shippers loss functions; if these were asymmetric, it could create the

appearance of bias.




                                               8
       The data collected in this survey are not the longest nor the most comprehensive time

series. As surveying was costly, the AAR included only the “more important kinds of

carload traffic” (Hultgren, 1955, p. 363). In 1949, for example, the actual carloadings of the

commodities included in the forecasts were 91 percent of the number of carloadings reported

to the Interstate Commerce Commission and 76 percent of all known carloadings. Additional

data on freight carloadings was collected by the AAR beginning in 1918. These data are

fairly comprehensive for rail traffic, but they do not represent the actual total carloadings for

any month or quarter. The reported numbers are derived from weekly averages, which may

not correspond exactly to the reported month. Figure 3 displays the two series for actual

freight carloadings. The actual carloadings that were included in the reports of the shippers’

forecasts are lower because only major commodities were included. Nevertheless, the two

series are very closely correlated for the period 1927.2 to 1940.4, when they overlap, with a

correlation coefficient of 0.994.

       Carloadings have some limitations as measures of economic activity and freight-ton

miles would be a better indication of the services rendered by the railroads.          However,

carloadings are a good proxy for general economic activity even though agricultural

commodities bulked larger in carloadings than in an index of industrial production. Table 1

shows the actual and estimated carloadings by commodity for the first quarter of 1930. The

shares of each group in the total of actual and estimated carloadings are also reported. For

comparison, the Federal Reserve Board Index of Industrial Production with 1927 weights is

presented in the table, along with the weights for each group. Approximately, 21 percent of

the industrial production index is not found in the data on carloadings and the weights on the

represented groups differ significantly. To determine how well carloadings can be used as a




                                               9

                     Figure 4 charts the Federal Reserve Board’s index of industrial production and

the FRB weighted-carloadings. The weighted carloadings track industrial production fairly

closely until 1934. These series recover from the nadir of the depression in 1933; but

carloadings, unlike industrial production, never returns to its pre-1930 levels. This break in

the series produces a low correlation of 0.56 between them for the whole period.6 However,

breaking the period at the end of 1933, yields a correlation coefficient of 0.92 for 1927.2-

1933.4 and 0.87 for 1934.1-1940.4. Thus, except for the break, fluctuations in carloadings

generally follow industrial activity.

       The reason for this shift in the level of carloadings is the loss of traffic to trucks and

pipelines.   In 1930, railroads hauled 74.3 percent of the 524 billion freight ton-miles, with

trucks accounting for 3.9 and pipelines 5.3 percent. By 1940, total freight-ton miles reached

618 billion freight-ton miles, but railroads had only 61.3 percent, while trucks and pipelines

picked up 10.0 and 9.6 percent respectively (Stover, 1961). One reason for this shift was that

rail freight rates declined very little during the contraction of 1929-1933. The Interstate

Commerce Act (1887), as amended by the Transportation Act (1920) had given the Interstate

Commerce Commission the power to establish maximum and minimum rates among other

broad powers of regulation. When railroad revenues fell in the early 1930s, the industry

appealed for a 15 percent increase in freight rates in 1931. This plea was not answered and

rates were slightly increased an average of 2.6 percent. Yet, raising prices while other prices

tumbled is astonishing. In contrast, trucking was a highly competitive industry. Truck

transport, unlike rail transport was easy to enter, with the government providing the highways.

Trucks could be bought second hand and wages were determined by the market not the

railroad union or federal legislation. The loss of business to trucking helped to secure the

passage of the Motor Carrier Act in 1935, which regulated truck rates, but it had relatively

little effect in the period under consideration (Hultgren, 1948; O’Brien, 1989).



                                      Better Forecasts?

       The survey of shippers covered hundreds of firms and should have given a reasonable

measurement of business expectations. The large and repeated errors of the early 1930s are

quite surprising and raise the question whether business could have done a better job of

forecasting the depression. These forecasts of transportation services, which seem to proxy




                                               13
industrial production, fail in a fashion analogous to the forecasts of future prices of

commodities found by Hamilton (1987). Cecchetti (1992) raised the question of whether

deflation and ex ante real rates of interest could have been predicted with accuracy, estimating

ARMA models of inflation and examining the properties of the forecasts from these models.

In this section, we examine whether a simple ARMA model or rule of thumb using carloading

data could have outperformed the railroad shippers.

       A key problem is that the actual data on shippers’ carloadings corresponding to the

shippers’ forecasts is only available as far back as the third quarter of 1927, creating a paucity

of data on which to forecast the events of the early 1930s. To fill in the gap, we use the more

comprehensive AAR carloading series, shown in Figure 2, to reconstruct the shippers’

carloadings back to the first quarter of 1918.        The very closely correlated movement of the

two series led us to construct a new series, ActualShipCL for 1918.1 to 1927.2 by the

following formula:

                                             (AARCarloadings t -1 − AARCarloadings t ) 
(1)     ActualShipCL t -1 = ActualShipCL t 1 +                                         .
                                                      AARCarloadings t                  

That is, the percentage change in the AAR Carloadings series from period t to period t-1 was

used to extend the ActualShipCL series back to the start of the sample. Figure 5 contains a

graph of the extended series together with the AAR Carloadings series. Our forecasting

analysis uses the ActualShipCL series.

               Could a time series econometrician have forecasted the downturn of the early 1930s

better than the shippers in the survey?                                           To answer this question, we used an ARIMA time

series forecasting model, using the Box-Jenkins modeling philosophy. To select the

appropriate ARIMA model, we needed to identify any non-stationary components in the data.

Given the strong seasonal nature of the data, the seasonal unit test of Hylleberg et. al. (1990)

was used.; the results are reported in Table 2. There was evidence of a unit root in the data at

the long run frequency and the quarterly frequency but not at the half-yearly frequency. Hence

the data needed to be 1st differenced and 4th differenced to make it stationary. This data on

carloadings thus shares characteristics of many macroeconomic time series.

Letting yt = ActualShipCL t , we sought to fit the best ARMA(p,q)(P,Q)48 model to the

                                  *
stationary time series, y t , where

The model that minimizes both the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) and the Schwarz

Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC) was the ARIMA(3,1,3)(0,1,1)4 model.                         This model

was estimated using data for the period 1918:1 until 1927:2 and 1-step ahead out of sample

forecasts were produced using this model. Figure 6 graphs the forecast errors from ARIMA

model and the survey forecast errors for 1927:3 to 1940:4.

        Obviously, the men in the back offices of the railroads in the 1930s would not have

had today’s best practice time series forecasting technology.                However, they were familiar

with patterns of seasonality and plotted trends. As a possible approximation to some simple

rules they might have used, we tried the Holt-Winters9 exponential smoothing forecasting

model, which allows for a changing level, trend and seasonality:


         y t f = (at −1 + bt −1 )ct − 4

  For a reference to this forecasting method see Granger and Newbold (1977), Pindyck and Rubinfeld (1991),
Makridakis, Wheelright, and Hyndman (1998). This method is very much in the spirit of Ferber’s study (1953)
of railroad shippers forecasts. Lovell (1964) also compared a simple model of regressive expectations with the
survey forecasts for the period 1947-1956.

errors for the period 1920:1 to 1927:2. The values chosen were 0.99, 0.2 and 0.2 respectively.

The forecast diagnostics for all three forecasting efforts are shown in Table 3, which contains

the root mean squared forecast error (RMSE), Theil’s U statistic, and a decomposition of the

RMSE into its bias, variance and covariance components. The bias component represents the

proportion of the RMSE that is attributable to bias in the forecast, while the variance

component represents the proportion of the RMSE that can be explained by getting the

variance of the forecast wrong. The covariance component represents the unexplained portion

of the RMSE.

       Figures 6 and 7 and Table 3 provide disturbing evidence on the accuracy of

contemporary business forecasts. As Theil’s U for all forecasts is considerably less than one,

all methods forecast carloadings better than a naïve forecast using the previous observation.

However, as is evident in the size of the RMSE, business’ performance was notably worse.

Forecasts by the ARIMA or the Holt-Winters model reduced the error by about one-third,

approximately 200,000 railroad cars a quarter. The source of most of this higher error---the

mistakes during the Great Depression---is evident in Figures 6 and 7.        Both forecasting

methods avoid the growing error of the shippers because the constant bad news feeds into a

mechanical lowering of future forecasts. The large error in the survey forecast shows up in

the large bias in Table 3. While the shippers did not estimate the variance of the fluctuations

as well as an ARIMA model could have, they did not do worse than the Holt-Winters model.

Interestingly, business’ forecasts of recovery and the effects of the New Deal are better. Even

though large errors were made, business clearly absorbed additional information beyond the

past history of carloadings. The sharp downturn of 1937-1938 took the railroads by surprise,

and neither forecasting model is better in predicting this recession.

       The failure of business to anticipate 1930-1933 stands out. Business could have

projected their demand for freight cars with greater accuracy---they appear not to have been

able to believe what was happening to the economy. The results parallel the findings of

Hamilton and Cecchetti.      In his analysis of price forecasts embodied in futures prices,



                                                19
Hamilton found that investors in the market consistently and cumulatively erred, failing to

anticipate the prolonged price decline of the early 1930s. The survey data on the expected

demand for freight carloadings shows similar consistent and continuing errors at the same

time horizons, indicating that producers, like investors, Irving Fisher and other contemporary

forecasters, did not believe that the economic slide would continue.                       Yet, had the public

projected price movements, as Cecchetti suggests they could have done, their errors would

have been considerably smaller. Likewise, traffic managers could have used forecasts based

on the past record of carloadings with much greater success.                   Fortunately, we can examine

the sources of traffic managers errors more closely as they provided forecasts by

commodity.10



                                    The Composition of the Forecasts

         The railroad shippers’s reports provide detailed forecasts for twenty-nine goods.

Tables 4 and 5 provide forecast diagnostics for the survey forecasts and the forecast using the

Holt-Winters procedure. As we were unable to extend the series back before 1928, we did not

attempt to use an ARIMA model to produce out-of-sample forecasts, as the depression was

immediately on the horizon.           However, as the results above demonstrate, the Holt-Winters

forecasts are not inferior to our ARIMA model for the aggregate carloadings.

  We do not examine the question of whether the forecasts were rational, as the bias in the estimates, is often
difficult to interpret. See Webb (1987), Keane and Runkle (1990), and Bonham and Carter (1995).

         Once again, by Theil’s U, both methods are better than a naïve forecast of last period’s

value.      In Table 4, what is striking are the commodities where the proportion of error from

bias is high, indicating that these were the ones primarily responsible for the poor aggregate

forecast.     The commodities with high bias (greater than 10 percent) were intermediate or

capital goods for industry and construction: coal, coke, clay, gravel, sand, stone, lumber,

petroleum, iron, steel, machinery, cement, bricks, lime, plaster, automobiles, and trucks. In

contrast, the forecast of the demand for railroad cars for agricultural goods display much less

bias. This difference disappears in the measure of bias in the estimates by the Holt-Winters

procedure in Table 5. By this method, there is no visible difference between the errors made

in forecasting carloadings for industrial goods and agricultural goods.

         Prices for agricultural goods plunged during the depression, but consumption of

foodstuffs and agricultural products was stable by comparison. The greatest challenge for the

traffic managers was to predict whether there would be a bumper crop or crop failure, and

hence there were some large random errors. However, there were no long streaks of large and

growing errors in the forecasting for agricultural commodities. What the traffic managers did

not expect was the decline in industrial products and construction materials.       Demand for

these products collapsed as the economy slid into the depression.         Their prices certainly

declined but not enough to avoid a decline in inventories and production.



                                Deflation and Demand Surprises

         This study of expectations of the Great Depression offers new insight into the debate

over whether the economic decline was anticipated. Although Hamilton (1987, 1992) and

Cecchetti (1992) argue over whether the price decline was anticipated; this examination of




                                                23
railroad shippers forecasts helps to reconcile them. Like the investors and speculators in the

commodities futures markets or the forecasters at Harvard and Yale, the traffic managers at

the railroads continued to make large errors, anticipating a recovery. They could not believe

the steady decline in output (like others who could not believe the decline in prices), although

simple rules or a modern ARIMA model would have advised them to pay attention to the

most recent events. They could not believe that a depression of this length and depth could

happen; the economy surely had reached bottom and had to rebound.

       The recessions in recent experience had been brief.       The peak to trough was 18, 14

and 13 months for the recessions of January 1920-July 1921 (of great severity), May 1923-

July 1924, and October 1926-November 1927.             As seen in Figures 6 and 7, the survey

forecasts track the 1929-1930 recession no worse than the two models into its fifth or sixth

quarter. But, by the time the recession entered its second year, the large errors began to

cumulate, suggesting that the railroads believed that a turnaround had to be imminent.

       In Table 6, the percentage forecast errors made by railroad shippers are compared to

the models and the forecasts provided by Cecchetti (1992) and Hamilton (1992). To construct

a railroad shippers’ forecast error similar to an inflation error, it is measured as the difference

between the projected percentage increase in carloadings from the actual carloadings in the

previous quarter less the actual percentage increase in carloadings.         The forecast errors

reported for Cecchetti’s study are the differences between actual inflation, measured by the

consumer price index, and expected inflation from a MA(2) model, an AR(1) model and an

interest-rate model, while Hamilton’s error is the difference between actual inflation and

forecasts of inflation using commodity prices by trimester.     Hamilton’s errors from 1930.1 to

1933.1 are continuously negative reflecting a continued underestimation of deflation. This




                                                24
  pattern is mirrored in the continued overestimation of demand by the railroad shippers for the

  duration of the economy’s decline from 1929.3 to 1933.1.             While not displaying this

  persistent mistake, all the other forecasts do show very large errors underestimating deflation

  and overestimating demand that swamp the errors in the other direction.          This clear bias

  implies that even if businessmen and households had the best modern forecasting methods

  available they would still have been frequently surprised by deflation. Real expected interest

  rates were high, as Cecchetti and Romer have argued, but there was also considerable

  unanticipated deflation.

        The source of the surprises was the large and continued negative shocks to the

economy, against which policy makers took little action. The stock market crash of 1929 was

contained and did not spread to the rest of the financial system because of the reaction of the

Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but the decline in asset values reduced wealth.           As

Romer (1990) showed, households responded by reducing their consumption of semi-durables

and dramatically their consumption of durables---products that required the intermediate

goods shipped by the railroads.   The banking panics and gold outflows reduced the money

supply and the willingness and ability of banks to lend (Friedman and Schwartz, 1963;

Bernanke, 1983; Eichengreen, 1992).

       Business seems to have had considerable faith that either the business cycle would

quickly turn or the Federal Reserve would take corrective action as it appeared to have done in

the earlier recessions of the 1920s. As we know, the Fed certainly disappointed them. It kept

to a strict adherence to the policies that had been developed in the 1920s, using borrowed

reserves and nominal market interest rates as policy instruments (Wicker, 1966; Brunner and

Meltzer; 1968, Wheelock, 1991; Calomiris and Wheelock, 1998). When member banks

borrowed little from the Fed and market rates were particularly low, policy was interpreted by

the Fed as easy. The banking crises that made banks reluctant to borrow and the deflation that

made real rates high rendered these instruments useless, ensuring the Fed would not respond.

       While the Federal Reserve did not change its policy, business could not believe that

the Fed would not react to the economic decline, leading business to incorrectly forecast the

depth and duration of the depression. For the railways themselves, managers' animal spirits

remained high, but at a cost, keeping inventories and their prices too high.   The public and

business were able to anticipate some of the deflation, with the consequence that real ex ante




                                              26
interest rates were extremely high. Yet, the collapse of demand and deflation were certainly

not fully anticipated and thus business was left with excessive inventories and increasingly

expensive debt burdens.
