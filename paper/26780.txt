Cigarette Taxes and Teen Marijuana Use

                                           ABSTRACT

The spillover effect of cigarette taxes on youth marijuana use has been the subject of intense
public debate. Opponents of cigarette taxes warn that tax hikes will cause youths to substitute
toward marijuana. On the other hand, public health experts often claim that because tobacco is a
"gateway" drug, higher cigarette taxes will deter youth marijuana use. Using data from the
National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) for the period 1991-2017, we explore
the relationship between state excise taxes on cigarettes and teen marijuana use. In general, our
results fail to support either of the above hypotheses. Rather, we find little evidence to suggest
that teen marijuana use is sensitive to changes in the state cigarette tax. This null result holds for
the sample period where cigarette taxes are observed to have the largest effect on teen cigarette
use and across a number of demographic groups in the data. Finally, we find preliminary
evidence that the recent adoption of state e-cigarette taxes is associated with a reduction in youth
marijuana use.

                                         1. Introduction

       Cigarette taxes have long been lauded by anti-smoking advocates and policymakers as an

effective tool to curb youth cigarette use (Chaloupka et al. 2011; Marr and Huang 2014; U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services 2014; Truth Initiative 2019). Indeed, the American

Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends tax increases on all tobacco products to discourage

youth tobacco use initiation (American Academy of Pediatrics 2015). Beyond reducing negative

consumption externalities, deterring youth smoking may also have an efficiency rationale if teens

are more likely than adults to have time-inconsistent preferences and hyperbolically discount the

future (Underwood 2013; Huang et al. 2017), thereby imposing "internality" costs on their future

selves (Gruber and Koczegi 2001).

       In recent years, support for cigarette taxes has been strong and bipartisan. Voters

generally prefer cigarette tax increases to budget cuts and favor earmarking a portion of the tax

revenue for tobacco prevention efforts (Boonn 2019a). Even smokers often support cigarette tax

increases when the revenues are targeted at youth smoking prevention (Chaloupka et al. 2019) or

if they believe the tax hikes will serve as a self-control device (Gruber and Mullainathan 2005).

       Opponents of higher cigarette taxes have claimed that many smokers are rationally

addicted to tobacco (Becker and Murphy 1988) and warn that higher prices will have unintended

consequences such as encouraging youths to substitute toward marijuana and other harder drugs

(Chaloupka et al. 1999). According to recent data from Monitoring the Future, the rate of daily

marijuana use has actually surpassed the rate of daily cigarette use among high school seniors,

which some have attributed, in part, to anti-tobacco efforts (Khazan 2015).

       On the other hand, a large literature in medicine and public health suggests that tobacco is

a "gateway drug," and that use during adolescence will encourage subsequent consumption of



                                                 1
harder drugs (Kandel 1975; Ellickson et al. 1992; Lai et al. 2000; American Academy of

Pediatrics 2013; Suerken et al. 2014), which could include the combined consumption of

marijuana and tobacco in the form of a "spliff" (Hammersley and Leon 2006). However, outside

of research performed on mice in the lab1, none of these studies take into account the potentially

endogenous relationship between tobacco use and the use of other substances. For instance, the

National Center on Addiction and Substance Use (2003) concludes that "reducing teen smoking

can be a singularly effective way to reduce teen marijuana use" simply because survey evidence

indicates that teens who smoke cigarettes are also more likely to try marijuana.

           This study breaks the simultaneity in youth cigarette and marijuana consumption by

exploring the relationship between state cigarette excise taxes and teen marijuana use. While a

handful of studies have used cross-state variation in cigarette taxes to identify effects on youth

marijuana use, estimates from this type of research design could be biased due to unobservables

at the state level, including anti-tobacco sentiment (DeCicca et al. 2002; 2008b). To our

knowledge, only one previous study uses within-state variation to identify the relationship

between cigarette taxes and youth marijuana use. Using data for the period 1990-1996, Farrelly

et al. (2001) find that higher cigarette taxes are associated with decreases in the intensity of

marijuana use among 12- to 20-year-olds. Since 1996, 48 states and the District of Columbia

raised their per-pack excise tax on cigarettes, nearly half of all states increased their tax on three

or more occasions, and 17 states passed tax increases exceeding one dollar per pack.

           Using data from the National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) for the

period 1991-2017, we first confirm the negative relationship between state excise taxes on

cigarettes and teen cigarette use that has been documented in prior research (Carpenter and Cook

    Levine et al. (2011) find that dosing mice with nicotine increased their responsiveness to cocaine.

                                                             2
2008). We also confirm that this relationship grows substantially weaker over time (Hansen et

al. 2017). Next, we explore the relationship between cigarette taxes and teen marijuana use.

Because the YRBS data cover such a long period of time, and the frequency and magnitude of

state cigarette tax hikes increased markedly following the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement

(MSA), we are able to exploit significantly more policy variation than Farrelly et al. (2001). In

general, we find little evidence to suggest that teen marijuana use is sensitive to state-level

changes in the per-pack cigarette tax. Specifically, our estimates on the relationship between

cigarette taxes and teen marijuana use are generally small in magnitude and statistically

indistinguishable from zero, and these null results hold across various model specifications and

when we split the sample by gender, race, or age. Only for respondents ages 14 and younger do

we uncover some evidence of a negative relationship between cigarette taxes and frequent

marijuana use.

       In addition to exploring the effects of state cigarette taxes, we also examine how medical

and recreational marijuana legalization affects youth cigarette and marijuana use. We find that

medical marijuana laws (MMLs) are associated with decreases in both teen cigarette and

marijuana consumption, suggesting these goods may be complements among youths. Similarly,

recreational marijuana laws (RMLs) are negatively associated with teen cigarette and marijuana

use, but the relationship between RMLs and cigarette use is estimated with imprecision.

       Finally, we provide the first evidence on the relationship between state electronic

cigarette taxes and youth marijuana use. Here, we find that the enactment of an e-cigarette tax is

associated with a 7 percent reduction in youth marijuana use, consistent with the hypothesis that

e-cigarettes and marijuana are complements. However, given that this estimate is based on

limited policy variation, we view this evidence as preliminary and worthy of future investigation.

         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with a history of cigarette

taxes in the United States and review the relevant literature. In Section 3, we describe our data

and empirical strategy; in Section 4, we report our principal estimates; in Section 5, we briefly

discuss coefficient estimates on indicators for medical and recreational marijuana legalization;

and in Section 6 we include a preliminary analysis of e-cigarette taxes. Section 7 concludes.



                                                 2. Background

2.1 Cigarette Taxes in the United States

         The first federal cigarette tax in the United States was levied in 1864 as a revenue

measure for the Civil War (Tax Foundation 2019). Over the course of the next century, the tax

fluctuated in response to government revenue requirements, which generally corresponded to

oscillating periods of war and peace. For instance, in 1951, the federal cigarette excise tax

increased from 7 to 8 cents per pack to help fund the Korean War (Committee on Preventing

Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths 1994). Federal cigarette taxes were last increased in

2009, with the tax going up from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack (American Lung Association 2019).

         In 1921, Iowa became the first state to implement a cigarette tax and other states were

soon to follow. By 1969, all 50 states and the District of Columbia imposed taxes on cigarettes. 2

Likely due to large gaps between state cigarette tax rates, organized smuggling and illegal

diversion of cigarettes increased during the 1960s and 1970s. In response, the government

enacted the Federal Cigarette Contraband Act, which prohibits the transportation, distribution,

receipt, or purchase of more than 10,000 "unstamped" cigarettes (Committee on Preventing



2
 In addition to state excise taxes, hundreds of local jurisdictions levy taxes on cigarettes (Committee on Preventing
Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths 1994).

Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths 1994; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and

Explosives 2018).3 Currently, New York and the District of Columbia tax cigarettes at the

highest rates, imposing per-pack taxes of $4.35 and $4.94, respectively. Missouri levies the

lowest cigarette tax at $0.17 per pack (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019). Figure

1 shows state per-pack cigarette tax rates as of 2017, the last year of our sample period.



2.2 Cigarette Taxes and Youth Cigarette Use

         A number of studies have estimated the relationship between state cigarette taxes and

youth cigarette use. 4 While much of this literature relies on tax variation across states 5, making

it difficult to control for unobserved factors at the state level, more recent papers exploit within-

state tax variation (DeCicca et al. 2002, 2008a; Carpenter and Cook 2008; Hansen et al. 2017).

         Using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study, DeCicca et al. (2002) find

that state cigarette taxes passed between 1988 and 1992 have no observable effect on youth

smoking participation. A follow-up study by DeCicca et al. (2008a) explores heterogeneity in




3
  Unstamped cigarettes are those not bearing the indicia of the state in which they originated. Initially, the Federal
Cigarette Contraband Act set the limit at 60,000 unstamped cigarettes (Committee on Preventing Nicotine Addiction
in Children and Youths 1994). It has been estimated that "casual" cross-border cigarette smuggling still exists today
(Lovenheim 2008; Davis et al. 2014).
4
  There is a large economic literature on the determinants of youth cigarette use in general. For instance, previous
studies have estimated the effects of anti-smoking sentiment (DeCicca et al. 2008b), peer smoking interactions
(Krauth 2007; Nakajima 2007), parental influence (Powell and Chaloupka 2005), compliance inspections of tobacco
retailers (Abouk and Adams 2017), youth access laws (Ross and Chaloupka 2004), tobacco advertising (Beltramini
and Bridge 2001), and clean indoor air laws (McMullen et al. 2005).
5
  Important exceptions include Dee (1999), Gruber (2000), Gruber and Zinman (2001), and Ringel and Evans
(2001). These studies, however, come with notable limitations. All of them are restricted to tax variation prior to
the 1998 MSA. As noted above, many of the tax hikes in the post-MSA era have been substantial. Gruber (2000)
and Gruber and Zinman (2001) use information from the YRBS, but observe only four waves of data. Because they
use smoking information from birth certificate records, Ringel and Evans (2001) are only able to estimate tax effects
on teen mothers.

cigarette tax effects at the smoking initiation and cessation margins. They find that tax hikes are

ineffective at deterring smoking at the initiation margin, which largely affects teens.

           In contrast to DeCicca et al. (2002, 2008a), Carpenter and Cook (2008) rely on a

substantially longer panel of data with larger and more frequent changes in the state cigarette tax.

Using data from the National, State, and Local YRBS for the period 1991-2005, Carpenter and

Cook (2008) estimate the effect of state cigarette taxes on smoking participation and frequent

smoking among youths.6 Their results indicate that a one-dollar increase in the per-pack tax (in

2005 dollars) reduces smoking participation by 10 to 20 percent. Similarly, they find that a one-

dollar tax increase reduces the incidence of frequent smoking by 18 to 30 percent. 7

           Hansen et al. (2017) revisit the work of Carpenter and Cook (2008) and draw upon four

additional waves of YRBS data (2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013). Their results suggest that the

relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking has weakened over time. While they

confirm Carpenter and Cook's (2008) results for the period 1991-2005, they find little evidence

to suggest that cigarette taxes reduced youth smoking for the years 2007-2013. 8 Hansen et al.

(2017) hypothesize that recent state cigarette taxes may be less effective at deterring teen

smoking because the marginal youth smoker is now more price inelastic. This could due to

effective anti-smoking campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, such that price sensitive youths




6
 Bader et al. (2011) and Guindon (2013) review much of the literature published prior to Carpenter and Cook
(2008). Interestingly, despite the fact that they reviewed similar studies, Bader et al. (2011) and Guindon (2013)
come to different conclusions. Bader et al. (2011) conclude that cigarette taxes reduce teen smoking, while Guindon
(2013) concludes that there is not strong evidence that taxes affect teen smoking initiation.
7
    Carpenter and Cook (2008) define "frequent smoking" as having smoked during at least 20 of the past 30 days.
8
  In a recent working paper, Courtemanche and Feng (2019) corroborate Hansen et al.'s (2017) finding that the
cigarette tax effect wanes over time and eventually disappears. However, they do find some evidence that tax
increases may still reduce youth smoking in states where the baseline tax rate is low.


                                                          6
reduced their smoking participation, leaving only youths in the market whose marginal utility

from smoking is very high.



2.3 Youth Marijuana Use

        There is a substantial literature on the determinants of youth marijuana use. Previous

studies have estimated the effects of medical and recreational marijuana laws (Anderson et al.

2015; Pacula et al. 2015; Dilley et al. 2019; Anderson et al. 2019), marijuana decriminalization

(Dills et al. 2017), the minimum legal drinking age (Crost and Rees 2013), youth cohort size

(Jacobson 2004), high school graduation requirements (Hao and Cowan 2019), and state

education requirements for substance use prevention (Carpenter et al. 2019).

        To our knowledge, only a handful of papers have estimated the relationship between

cigarette taxes and youth marijuana use. However, with one exception, these papers do not

exploit within-state changes in the cigarette tax, leaving their estimates potentially biased due to

unobserved factors at the state level, such as preferences and attitudes (Pacula 1998a, 1998b;

Chaloupka et al. 1999). 9 The exception is Farrelly et al. (2001), who use data from the National

Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) for the period 1990-1996. These authors find that

higher cigarette taxes are associated with decreases in the intensity of marijuana use among

individuals 12 to 20 years of age and may also lead to modest reductions in the probability of use

among similarly-aged males.



9
  Using data from the 1984 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), Pacula (1998a) finds a negative, but
statistically insignificant, relationship between cigarette taxes and the probability of marijuana use in the cross
section. Pooling data from the 1983 and 1984 NLSY, Pacula (1998b) finds a negative relationship between cigarette
prices (inclusive of taxes) and the probability of marijuana use. Using data from Monitoring the Future for the
period 1992-1994, Chaloupka et al. (1999) find that higher cigarette prices (inclusive of taxes) reduce the level of
marijuana consumption among current users, but have no statistically significant effect on the probability of
marijuana use.


                                                         7
2.4 Contributions

        Our research makes a number of important contributions. First, the estimated cigarette

tax effects we present below are based on more policy variation than was used by any previous

study on youth cigarette or marijuana use. We extend the panel observed in Hansen et al. (2017)

by adding the two most recent waves of YRBS data (i.e., 2015 and 2017). Between 2013 and

2017, 17 states and the District of Columbia increased their per-pack tax on cigarettes10, and

many of these increases were substantial. For instance, California increased its cigarette tax in

2017 by over 200 percent from $0.87 to $2.87. To take another example, Nevada increased its

cigarette tax in 2016 from $0.80 to $1.80. Even some historically low-tax states have passed

large tax increases in recent years. In 2016, Louisiana increased its tax from $0.36 to $1.08.

Moreover, during the period 2013-2017, the first federally funded anti-smoking campaign was

implemented and the use of e-cigarettes among teens surged (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2016; Surgeon General 2019).

        Second, given the years we observe, we can compare estimated effects for the pre- and

post-2005 periods, when cigarette taxes have been shown to have more and less bite, respectively

(Hansen et al. 2017). Third, because Farrelly et al. (2001) use data from over two decades ago,

we believe a fresh investigation of the relationship between state cigarette taxes and youth

marijuana use is needed. Finally, between 2010 and 2017, seven states (CA, KS, LA, MN, NC,

PA, and WV) and the District of Columbia passed e-cigarette taxes. To our knowledge, this

paper is the first to estimate the relationship between e-cigarette taxes and youth marijuana use.




10
   We observe YRBS data before and after a cigarette tax change for 14 of these states. Appendix Table 1 shows the
state-by-year number of observations in our sample, while Appendix Table 2 shows the nominal cigarette tax over
time for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

                                        3. Data and Empirical Strategy

3.1 YRBS Data

         Our data are repeated cross-sectional in nature and come from the National and State

YRBS for the period 1991-2017.11 These data are used by government agencies to follow trends

in the behaviors of high school students including physical activity, unhealthy eating, suicidality,

violence, sexual activity, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit substances. The National

YRBS are carried out biennially by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), while

the State YRBS are coordinated by the CDC and administered by state education and health

agencies. 12 The National and State YRBS generally mirror each other in terms of content and it

has become commonplace for researchers to pool these two data sources. 13 Pooling the National

and State YRBS ensures that identification is based off of as many state-level changes in the

cigarette tax as possible (Appendix Tables 1 and 2). In odd years from 1991 to 2017, we observe

nine states increasing their cigarette tax once, 13 states increasing their tax twice, five states

increasing their tax three times, and 23 states and the District of Columbia increasing their tax

four or more times.14


11
  Previous researchers have used these data to study the effects of a wide range of public health policies, including
anti-methamphetamine advertising (Anderson 2010; Anderson and Elsea 2015), state physical education
requirements (Cawley et al. 2007), mandatory seatbelt laws (Carpenter and Stehr 2008), and anti-bullying laws
(Sabia and Bass 2017).
12
   For the national survey and a majority of state surveys, data collectors visit each participating school to administer
the questionnaires. Data collection is handled in a manner to protect respondent privacy, preserve anonymity, and
allow voluntary participation. The surveys are completed during one class period and students record their answers
in computer-scannable booklets. When possible, desks are spread throughout the classroom and students are asked
to cover their answers with an extra sheet of paper that is provided by the survey administrator. When finished, they
seal their booklet in an envelope and place it in a box. For further details on the YRBS data-collection protocols, see
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2013).
13
   For examples, see Anderson et al. (2015), Hansen et al. (2017), Anderson and Sabia (2018), and Courtemanche
and Feng (2019).
14
  In total, 49 states and the District of Columbia contributed data to the YRBS before and after a tax change. North
Dakota is the only state for which we cannot exploit tax variation. We observe pre- and post-policy data for tax
decreases in only two states (New Hampshire in 2013 and Oregon in 2005).

                                                           9
        Our initial analysis focuses on the same outcomes explored by Carpenter and Cook

(2008) and Hansen et al. (2017). Specifically, YRBS respondents were asked:



              "During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?"



Current Cigarette User is set equal to 1 if a student reported smoking cigarettes during at least

one of the past 30 days, and set equal to 0 otherwise. We set the variable Frequent Cigarette

User as equal to 1 if a student reported smoking cigarettes during at least 20 of the past 30 days,

and set equal to 0 otherwise.15

        Regarding marijuana use, YRBS respondents were asked:



                 "During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana?"



Current Marijuana User is set equal to 1 if a student reported smoking marijuana at least once

during the past 30 days, and set equal to 0 otherwise. We set the variable Frequent Marijuana

User as equal to 1 if a student reported smoking marijuana at least 20 times during the past 30

days, and set equal to 0 otherwise. 16

        On average, we find that 17.9 and 7.5 percent of high school students reported current

and frequent cigarette use, respectively (Table 1). Teen cigarette use increased from 1991 to

1997, but has been steadily declining since (Figure 2). YRBS respondents reported current and




15
   Respondents could choose among the following answers: 0 days, 1 or 2 days, 3 to 5 days, 6 to 9 days, 10 to 19
days, 20 to 29 days, or all 30 days.
16
  Respondents could choose among the following answers: 0 times, 1 or 2 times, 3 to 9 times, 10 to 19 times, 20 to
39 times, or 40 or more times.

increased at the beginning of our sample period, it has stayed relatively constant since 1997

(Figure 3).17



3.2 Empirical Strategy

         To estimate the relationship between cigarette taxes and youth smoking behaviors, and to

control for economic conditions and other policies (as well as any changes in the composition of

YRBS respondents), we call upon a difference-in-differences framework. Specifically, our

estimating equation is:



(1)                = 0 + 1   +   +   +  +  +  ,



where i indexes individuals, s indexes states, and t indexes years. The dependent variable, Yist,

represents one of the four possible outcomes listed in Table 1 (Current Cigarette User, Frequent

Cigarette User, Current Marijuana User, Frequent Marijuana User). Following Carpenter and

Cook (2008) and Hansen et al. (2017), we estimate equation (1) as a logit model. The variable of

interest, Cigarette Tax, is equal to the per-pack excise tax on cigarettes (in 2017 dollars) in state

s during year t.18 The vectors vs and wt represent state and year fixed effects, respectively. One

advantage of using the combined National and State YRBS data set is that it often contains


17
  Because the cigarette and marijuana questions are worded differently in the YRBS, we cannot directly compare
cigarette use with marijuana use over time. If we weight our YRBS estimates using sample weights generated from
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population data, the trends we observe are qualitatively
similar to those shown in Figures 2 and 3.
18
  Because states often implement cigarette tax increases on July 1st or later within a given year (Boonn 2019b), we
code Cigarette Tax as equal to the tax on July 1st in state s during year t. Our results change little if we instead use
the cigarette tax during year t ­ 1 or during year t ­ 2 as our regressor of interest.


                                                           11
thousands of individuals per state-year. If we observed small state-year cell sizes, a concern

would be our ability to generate consistent parameter estimates from a logit model that includes

state and year fixed effects. In all regressions, we correct our standard errors for clustering at the

state level (Bertrand et al. 2004).

           The vector X1ist includes individual-level controls for gender, age, grade, and

race/ethnicity 19, while X2st includes state-level controls for whether the state taxes e-cigarettes

(Any E-Cigarette Tax)20, the presence of a clean indoor air law (Clean Indoor Air Law)21,

marijuana policies (MML, RML, and Decriminalization) 22, alcohol policies (Beer Tax and BAC

0.08 Law)23, and economic conditions (Income and Unemployment). Table 1 provides means

and definitions for the variables included in X1ist and X2st. Appendix Table 3 lists the data

sources for the state-level covariates.

4.1 Cigarette Taxes and Youth Cigarette Use

           We begin by documenting the relationship between state excise taxes on cigarettes and

youth cigarette consumption. Table 2 presents estimates of the relationship between cigarette


19
  To retain sample size, we also control for a set of dummies that indicate whether information on gender, age,
grade, or race/ethnicity is missing. Results are similar if we simply drop the observations that are missing
information on any of these characteristics.
20
  Despite the fact that state e-cigarette taxes are a relatively new phenomenon, there is some research to suggest that
e-cigarettes serve as substitutes for traditional cigarettes among adults (Pesko et al. 2019) and pregnant women
(Abouk et al. 2019). Following Abouk et al. (2019) and Pesko et al. (2019), we code the variable Any E-Cigarette
Tax as equal to 1 if state s was enforcing an e-cigarette tax during year t, and equal to 0 otherwise. In Section 6
below, we discuss estimated coefficients on Any E-Cigarette Tax.
21
   There is some evidence that relatively strong clean indoor air laws may reduce the probability of smoking among
youths (Ross and Chaloupka 2004).

     Researchers have relied on beer taxes to proxy variations in alcohol price (Ruhm 1996; Markowitz et al. 2005).

taxes and youth cigarette use for the period 1991-2017. Without controlling for the individual-

or state-level covariates listed in Table 1, the estimated coefficient on Cigarette Tax implies that

a one-dollar tax increase (in 2017 dollars) is associated with a 1.0 percentage-point decrease in

the likelihood a YRBS respondent reported smoking cigarettes during at least one of the past 30

days (i.e., our definition of "current" cigarette use), and this estimate is statistically significant at

the 1 percent level. In column (2), the estimated effect falls slightly when we add the individual-

level controls for gender, age, grade, and race/ethnicity. When adding the state-level controls for

other polices and economic conditions (column (3)), our estimate of 1 falls further to -0.006, but

remains statistically significant at the 5 percent level.

        In columns (4)-(6), we replace Current Cigarette User with Frequent Cigarette User and

re-estimate equation (1). When controlling for individual- and state-level covariates, the

estimated coefficient on Cigarette Tax suggests that a one-dollar increase in the tax is associated

with a 0.5 percentage-point decrease in the likelihood a high school student reported smoking

cigarettes during at least 20 of the past 30 days.

        The estimates in columns (3) and (6) of Table 2 imply semi-elasticities of -3.4 and -6.7,

respectively. That is, a one-dollar increase in the cigarette tax is associated with a 3.4 percent

reduction in the likelihood of current cigarette use and a 6.7 percent reduction in the likelihood

of frequent cigarette use.

        In Appendix Table 4, we present estimates for the years 1991-2005 and 2007-2017

separately. Consistent with Hansen et al. (2017), we find that our estimates for the full sample

period are driven by the earlier cigarette tax hikes, and that tax increases for more recent years

have no observable bite.24 Estimated cigarette tax effects by gender, race, and age tell a similar


24
  We should note that the negative and statistically significant estimates presented in Table 2 and Appendix Table 4
become statistically indistinguishable from zero when we include state-specific linear time trends as controls.

story (Appendix Tables 5 and 6). Across all subgroups, there is evidence that tax increases were

only effective at reducing teen cigarette use during the earlier years of our sample period. These

results are consistent with the notion that continually rising tax rates have prompted price-

sensitive youths to quit smoking, leaving only price-insensitive youths in the market

(Courtemanche and Feng 2019). Hansen et al. (2017, p. 73) conclude that the post-2005 cohorts

include more "hardcore" teens whose "smoking decisions are insensitive to cost."



4.2 Cigarette Taxes and Youth Marijuana Use

         Table 3 presents estimates on the relationship between state cigarette taxes and teen

marijuana use. In general, we find little evidence to support the notion that teen marijuana use is

sensitive to changes in the cigarette tax. The estimated coefficient on Cigarette Tax is uniformly

positive in sign, but small in magnitude and, with one exception, statistically indistinguishable

from zero. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals around the estimates of 1 suggest that the

effect of a one-dollar cigarette tax increase on current marijuana use is no larger than 1.1

percentage points and the effect of a one-dollar tax increase on frequent marijuana use is no

larger than 0.5 percentage points.25


However, there is a discussion as to whether controlling for state-specific linear trends in cigarette tax models is
actually appropriate (Hansen et al. 2017; Courtemanche and Feng 2019). On the one hand, state trends are designed
to capture potentially important unobserved factors, such as attitudes and preferences. On the other hand,
controlling for them comes with the risk of using up potentially exogenous variation in state cigarette taxes.
Furthermore, if the state-specific trends are correlated with taxes even after important unobservables have been
"partialled out," their inclusion could lead to "unreliable or even wrong-signed estimates" (Sheehan-Connor 2010;
Hansen et al. 2017, p. 72). If we regress Cigarette Tax on the state-level controls listed in Table 1, state fixed
effects, and year fixed effect, we obtain an R2 of 0.897. If we include state-specific linear trends on the right-hand
side of this regression, the R2 increases to 0.959. This implies that the trends are soaking up approximately .062 of
the available variation in cigarette taxes.
25
   In columns (1)-(3) of Appendix Table 7, we consider alternative definitions of frequent marijuana use. Regardless
of whether we define frequent use as having smoked marijuana at least 3, 10, or 40 times during the past 30 days, we
find no evidence of a relationship between state cigarette taxes and frequent marijuana use. Similarly, we find no
evidence of relationship between taxes and teen marijuana use when we treat marijuana use as continuous variable
(column (4)).

                                                         14
         In Table 4, we present estimates separately for the years 1991-2005 and 2007-2017.

While the sign on the estimated relationship between cigarette taxes and teen marijuana use

becomes negative when we restrict our focus to the years 1991-2005, it remains small in

magnitude and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, our estimates for frequent marijuana use

stand in contrast to those presented in Farrelly et al. (2001), who find that higher cigarette taxes

are associated with decreases in the intensity of marijuana use among 12- to 20-year-old NHSDA

respondents for the period 1990-1996. 26 Not surprisingly, we find no evidence of a relationship

between cigarette taxes and marijuana use during the later years of our sample. 27

         Table 5 shows estimates on the relationship between cigarette taxes and marijuana use by

gender and race for the period 1991-2005. While it is worth noting that all estimates are negative

in sign, which is consistent with a story of complementarity, none are statistically significant at

conventional levels. Figures 4 and 5 show coefficient estimates on Current Marijuana User and

Frequent Marijuana User, respectively, by age for the period 1991-2005. With one exception,

these estimates are also statistically indistinguishable from zero. The lone statistically significant

estimate provides some evidence that cigarette taxes are negatively associated with frequent

marijuana use among respondents 14 years of age or younger. Taken together, the results in




26
   When comparing our estimates to those of Farrelly et al. (2001), it is important to note that they define their
measure of intensity as "the frequency of marijuana use in the past 30 days (1-30 days) conditional on use" (Farrelly
et al. 2001, p. 56). In results not reported for the sake of brevity, we estimated the relationship between cigarette
taxes and the frequency of marijuana use, conditioning on having smoked marijuana at least once in the past 30
days. Based on this alternative specification, we found little evidence that marijuana use on the intensive margin
responds to changes in the cigarette tax.
27
   The estimates presented in Table 4 are qualitatively similar if we control for state-specific linear time trends. Our
results are also similar if we estimate the relationship between Cigarette Tax and Current Marijuana User via a
linear probability model, rather than a logit specification (Appendix Table 8).


                                                           15
Tables 3-5 and Figures 4-5 suggest that teen marijuana use is generally insensitive to changes in

the state cigarette tax. 28



                         5. Medical and Recreational Marijuana Legalization

        In the first two columns of Table 6, we show the estimated coefficients on the variables

MML and RML that correspond to the regressions from columns (3) and (6) of Table 2. The

presence of a medical marijuana law, which Anderson et al. (2015) find to be consistently

negatively associated with marijuana use among YRBS respondents, is associated with

reductions in both current and frequent teen cigarette use. Within the context of Anderson et

al.'s (2015) findings, our estimates suggest that youths may consume cigarettes and marijuana as

complementary goods. 29

        In the last two columns of Table 6, we show the estimated coefficients on the variables

MML and RML that correspond to the regressions from columns (3) and (6) of Table 3. The

legalization of marijuana, whether for medical or recreational purposes, is negatively associated

with teen marijuana use. These results are consistent with the findings in Anderson et al. (2015,

2019) and the argument that it is more difficult for teenagers to obtain marijuana as drug dealers

are replaced by licensed dispensaries that require customers to be 21 years of age.




28
  In Appendix Table 9, we consider an alternative marijuana-related outcome that was available in the YRBS
through 2011. Specifically, we find no evidence of a relationship between state cigarette taxes and past-month
marijuana use on school property.
29
   Using data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, and
Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements, Choi et al. (2019) find that the legalization of medical
marijuana is associated with increases in marijuana consumption and decreases in cigarette smoking among adult
populations.

                               6. Preliminary Analysis of E-Cigarette Taxes

         An emerging literature has examined the determinants of teen e-cigarette use and whether

policies that raise the costs of accessing e-cigarettes have unintended spillover effects on youth

tobacco consumption. Using data from Monitoring the Future and exploiting within-market

variation in e-cigarette prices, Pesko et al. (2018) find that a 10 percent increase in the price of e-

cigarette disposables is associated with an 18 percent decrease in the average number of vaping

days reported by students.30 To our knowledge, no prior study has estimated the effect of e-

cigarette taxes on teen e-cigarette or traditional cigarette use.

         The literature on the relationship between state-level e-cigarette laws and traditional

cigarette use among teens has produced mixed findings. For instance, using data from the

National Survey of Drug Use and Health, Friedman (2015) finds that state bans on e-cigarette

sales to minors is associated with an increase in recent cigarette smoking among 12-to-17-year-

olds, consistent with the hypothesis that e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are substitutes. On

the other hand, using Monitoring the Future data, Abouk and Adams (2017) find that e-cigarette

sales bans are associated with reductions in cigarette smoking among U.S. high school seniors.

         Only one study of which we are aware has estimated the relationship between e-cigarette

policies and marijuana use. Using data from the National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys for the

period 2007-2013, Pesko et al. (2016) find that minimum legal purchase age requirements for

electronic nicotine delivery systems are negatively related to teen e-cigarette use, positively

related to teen cigarette use, and have no observable effect on teen marijuana use.



30
  Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Pesko et al. (2019) find that e-
cigarette taxes are negatively related to adult e-cigarette use and positively related to adult traditional cigarette use.
Using data from the Current Population Survey Tobacco Use Supplements, Saffer et al. (2019) find evidence that the
implementation of Minnesota's e-cigarette tax led to increases in traditional cigarette use and reductions in smoking
cessation among adult populations.


                                                           17
         In Table 7, we provide exploratory estimates of the effect of state e-cigarette taxes on

teen e-cigarette 31, traditional cigarette, and marijuana use. Following Abouk et al. (2019) and

Pesko et al. (2019), we consider a binary indicator for whether state s during year t was enforcing

an e-cigarette tax. The choice to use a simple dichotomous variable is due in large part to the

difficulty in harmonizing magnitudes of excise and ad valorem taxes. 32

         Before reporting our findings, it is important to note limitations. The YRBS only began

asking consistent questions about e-cigarette use in 2015, severely limiting the amount of policy

variation available to identify e-cigarette consumption effects. While our traditional cigarette

and marijuana use effects are identified off of the seven states (CA, KS, LA, MN, NC, PA, and

WV) that enacted e-cigarette taxes between 2010 and 2017, our e-cigarette consumption effects

are identified off of only three states (CA, PA, and WV).

         In the first two columns of Table 7, our results show that the enactment of an e-cigarette

tax is associated with a 3.4 percentage-point reduction in current e-cigarette use and a 0.8

percentage-point reduction in frequent e-cigarette use. This result is consistent with the

hypothesis that youths are sensitive to changes in the cost of obtaining e-cigarettes. 33 We also

find some evidence that e-cigarette taxes are negatively related to youth cigarette use, although

these estimated effects are not statistically significant. Finally, it appears that e-cigarettes and

marijuana may be complements for youths. The enactment of an e-cigarette tax is associated


31
  Respondents to the YRBS are asked, "During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use an electronic vapor
product?" Measures of Current E-Cigarette User and Frequent E-Cigarette User are coded analogously to Current
Cigarette User and Frequent Cigarette User, respectively.
32
  As noted above, seven states (CA, KS, LA, MN, NC, PA, and WV) and the District of Columbia passed e-
cigarette taxes between 2010 and 2017. Four of these tax changes are ad valorem taxes and four are excise taxes.
33
  During this period, we find limited evidence that cigarette excise taxes affected e-cigarette use. For Current E-
Cigarette Use, the estimated coefficient on Cigarette Tax was -0.050 with a standard error of 0.060. For Frequent
E-Cigarette Use, the coefficient on Cigarette Tax was -0.017 with a standard error of 0.013.


                                                         18
with a 1.3 percentage-point decline in current marijuana use and a (statistically insignificant) 0.5

percentage-point decline in frequent use.34 However, these estimates should be interpreted with

caution as they are based on limited post-treatment data and relatively few policy changes.



                                                 7. Conclusion

        As the legalization of marijuana proliferates throughout the United States, there is a

growing concern among policymakers that an increase in adolescent marijuana use will follow. 35

In turn, a number of strategies have been proposed to reduce marijuana use among youths.

Among these strategies has been a call to reduce youth cigarette consumption, despite the fact

that there is scant empirical evidence to suggest that cigarettes and marijuana are complementary

(or substitute) goods. State excise taxes on cigarettes are a commonly proposed policy lever to

deter youth cigarette use (Chaloupka et al. 2011; Marr and Huang 2014; U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services 2014; Truth Initiative 2019).

        Using data from the National and State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) for the

period 1991-2017, we explore the relationship between state excise taxes on cigarettes and teen

marijuana use. In general, we find little evidence to suggest that teen marijuana use is responsive

to changes in the state cigarette tax, and this null finding holds when we focus on the period

where taxes are observed to have the greatest effect on teen cigarette consumption (i.e., the years

1991-2005). We also find limited evidence of a relationship between state cigarette taxes and

marijuana use when we split the sample by gender, race, or age.



34
   In Appendix Table 10, we show the sensitivity of the Cigarette Tax and Any E-Cigarette Tax estimates to
controlling for state-level cigarette minimum legal purchase age laws and e-cigarette sales bans to minors. The
estimated coefficients on Cigarette Tax and Any E-Cigarette Tax change little when adding these controls.
35
  These fears seem impervious to the mounting research showing that the legalization of marijuana is not associated
with increases in youth marijuana use (Sarvet et al. 2018; Anderson et al. 2019).

                                                        19
       In addition to examining state cigarette taxes, we estimate the effect of medical and

recreational marijuana legalization on youth cigarette and marijuana use. We find that both state

MMLs and RMLs are associated with decreases in teen marijuana consumption, consistent with

the hypothesis that selling to minors becomes a relatively risky proposition for licensed

marijuana dispensaries. In addition, we find that MMLs are associated with decreases in teen

cigarette use.

       Finally, we provide the first set of estimates on the relationship between state e-cigarette

taxes and teen marijuana use. Specifically, the implementation of an e-cigarette tax is associated

with a 7 percent reduction in current marijuana use, which is consistent with the hypothesis that

e-cigarettes and marijuana are complementary goods among youths.

       Understanding the general equilibrium effects of substance use policies is critical for

optimal tax design (Pacula 1997). Our study contributes along this dimension by showing that

cigarette tax hikes in the United States have generally not led to spillover effects on youth

marijuana use. Based on our preliminary analysis of state e-cigarette taxes, we believe future

research should explore whether longer-run youth marijuana use is sensitive to raising the costs

of accessing e-cigarettes.
