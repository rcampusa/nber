            Sterjlizatjon and Offsetting Capital Movements:
                Evidence From West Germany, 1960 — 1970


                               ABSTRACT



     The purpose of this paper is twofold   First, to estimate, using

structural methods, the extent to which capital flows undermined West

German monetary policy during the Bretton Woods years 1960 to 1970. Arid

second, to show that earlier reduced form estimates of the capital—

account offset coefficient are tainted by simultaneity bias thanks to the

Deutsche Bundesbank's systematic policy of sterilization, and so overestimate

the true coefficient. The paper distinguishes between the short—run or

one—quarter offset coefficient and the long—run coefficient implied by the

full adjustment of all asset markets. An aggregative structural model

German financial markets yields short—run coefficients between .50 and .65

implying substantial Bundesbank control over the monetary base, at least in

the short—run. A formal test for simultaneous—equations bias provides

evidence that variations in domestic credit cannot be regarded as exogenous

and that equations regressing capital flows on changes in domestic credit

and other variables exaggerate the extent of the offset.

Introduction


     An ability to sterilize or neutralize balance—of—

payments disturbances in the   short   run is a prerequisite
for the effective conduct of monetary policy In an open
economy with fixed exchange rate.      Even when assets
denominated in different currencies are imperfect sub-

stitutes, sterilization operations may succeed only
temporarily. But as the Interest sensitivity of inter-
national capital movements Increases, domesIc monetary
policy tends to become powerless. A high degree of
international financial integration entails a powerful

capital—account response to changes in domestic interest
rates and thus substantial volatility in international
reserves.

     This essay attempts tO estimate the extent to
which the Integration of the Atlantic community's

financial markets undermined West Germany's ability

to conduct an Independent monetary policy during the
years between 1960 and 1970.1 The pioneers in this

area of empirical research were Argy, Kouri, and Por-
ter, who claimed a 'reduced—form' approach to the
problem would yield clear—cut results while avoiding

    the difficulties of structural estimation.2 The re-
    duced-form approach has led to a bewildering range of

    estimates of the 'offset coefficient', which measures

    the fraction of any domestic monetary expansion offset

    by capital outflow during the same quarter. Table 1

    presents a sample of these estimates, which range from

    roughly 50 percent to almost 90 percent.
         With the exception of the Argy—Kouri study ——

    which, significantly, yields the lowest offset esti-
    mate —— these reduced—form studies treat domestic mone-

    tary policy as an exogenous determinant of capital move-

    ments. They thus ignore the negative correlation
    between changes in the Bundesbank's domestic andfor—

    eign assets arising through systematic sterilization
    operations, and so introduce a potential simultaneous—
    equations bias into their results. These suspicions
    appear to be confirmed by a detailed econometric model

    of the West German financial sector constructed by

    Herring and Marston (1977). Simulation of the Herring—
    Marston model indicates an offset coefficient similar

to those found by Kouri and Porter (1971k). But the

Herring—Marston offset coefficient is a long—run co-

efficient: because asset markets adjust gradually, the

capital—account response to monetary policy is drawn
out over a period of sixteen quarters. These findings

suggest that the simultaneity bias in the Kouri—Porter

approach exaggerates the magnitude of the one—quarter
or short—run offset.

     This essay presents additional evidence that the
degree to which the monetary measures of the German

Bundesbank were undermined by interest—sensitive capital

movements during the years 1960—1970 is much smaller
than the reduced—form estimates suggest. We distin—
guish below between the short—run offset coefficient,

which measures the reserve loss associated with a

monetary expansion in the same          and the long—

run offset coefficient, which applies only after asset

markets have adjusted fully to the monetary disturb-
ance. While the exact values of the offset coeffici-

ents vary from quarter to quarter because of changes in
banks' reserve requirements, we find the typical short—
run offset coefficient to be between .10 and .15, with

the typical long—run offset between .50 and .65. The
offsets are derived from a small quarterly econometric

model, and are consistent with the findings of Herring

and Marston (1977). They imply that the Bundesbank

exercised substantial control over the German money

stock during the Bretton Woods period, at least in the
short run.

     Section I presents a highly aggregative model of
the financial sector of a small open economy with

fixed exchange rate whose bonds are imperfect substi-

tutes for foreign—currency bonds in asset—holders'
portfolios. We derive three structural equations

determining equilibrium values of the domestic interest

rate, the money stock, and the stockof net external
liabilities. The approach differs from that of Herring
and Narston in that the structure of our model (in-

cluding the lag structure) is simple enough to allow
explicit calculation of short— and long—run offsets.

     Section II closes the model by recognizing that

the central bank's monetary policy is endogenous. We

pecify and estimate a monetary policy reaction func-

tion which confirms previous findings that the Bundes—
bank consistently sterilized changes in its foreign
assets. Our measure of the impact of changes in re-

serve requirements on the monetary base is different

from the measure proposed by Porter (1972) and used in
all of the subsequent literature.

    Section III presents the results of estimating the

asset—demand equations, together with the implied short—
run and long—run offset coefficients. These are corn—
                                                                6




puted asthe equilibrium response of the stock of net
external liabilities to a change in the domestic assets

of    the Bundesbank, using first short—run and    then long—

run elasticities. As mentioned above, the short—run
coefficients are much smaller than any appearing in the
existing literature on offsetting capital movements.
        In Section IV we   undertake   a direct examination

of the Kouri—Porter approach for the presence of sim-

ultaneity bias, first showing that such a. bias always

increases the estimated offset. Using a test suggested
by Hausinan (1978), we find that we can reject the hypo-

thesis that monetary policy is exogenous in equations
explaining total and short—term capital flows. This
finding    lends support to the offset figures computed

in Section III.

        Section V offers concluding remarks. In addition,
there are two appendices. Appendix I derives the
asymptotic bias in the reduced—foi'm approach, while

Appendix II describes the data series used in estimation.

I. A Model' of the West German Financial Sector


     This section presents a highly aggregative model
of financial asset markets in a small, open economy
with a fixed exchange rate. The model differs from
that of Kouri and Porter (19714) only in allowing for

a domestic banking system.3 By postulating gradual
adjustment of asset stocks to desired levels —— a form-
ulation that does not preclude instantaneous portfolio
equilibrium —— we derive structural equations suitable

for estimation.

     The main building blocks are the domestic money
market and a market in internationally-traded, interest—

bearing claims. These markets jointly determine equi-
librium values of the money stock, the domestic interest
rate, and the stock of net liabilities vis—à—vis the

rest of the world. The description of the central

bank's policy reaction function, needed to close the
model, is taken up in the next section.

A. The International Bond Market


     We assume that capital is imperfectly mobile, in
the sense that bonds denominated in domestic currency

(Deutsche Marks) and bonds denominated in foreign



  The present model is nearly identical to one of
Dornbusch (1977).
                                                                                       8



currency (dollars) are imperfect substitutes. The
                                                                        *
interest   rate on dollar—denominated bonds is r                            ,   and
ts   exogenous to the West German economy. Foreign
residents' long—run desired holdings of D-Mark denom—
                                 *  * *
mated bonds are a function F(r,r ,Y ,v ) of rates of
                            *
return (r and ), income (Y ), and wealth (V * ). Here,
                 r
               *


r is the domestic bond rate; the function F is expressed

in dollar terms. Likewise, domestic residents' de-

sired holdings of dollar assets, in D—Mark terms,
                           *
is   a function H(r,r ,Y,v) of interest rates, domestic

income (Y), and domestic financial wealth (V). The
long—run equilibrium level of net external liabilities,

in terms of D-Marks, can be expressed as

                                 *     *    *               *
           NEL =     sF(r,r          ,Y ,V )      — H(r,r       ,Y,V)            (1)


where S is the D—Mark/dollar spot exchange rate.
Capital flows arise as changes in the stock of net

external liabilities.

      We adopt the assumption that asset—holders
abroad and at home adjust their holdings of foreign

assets toward their long—run equilibrium levels at the
same rate A, so that if F and H denote actual —- as

opposed to desired ——            asset holdings, we have

           F —         =       A(F —
                 F1                        F1),
                                                                               9



             H H1 = xdT — H1)

These, together with (1), imply the relation

            NEL = X(sF             -.        + (1   -
                                                         X9NEL1.         (2)


Linearizing (2), we obtain our structural equation for
the stock of German net external liabilities:

             NEL =             +
                          a1       a2r + a3r         +
                                                         aE   +
                                                                  a5Y
                                                                         (3)


                       + a6V +           a NEL1 +


In   this specification, E represents a set of dummy

variables corresponding to the speculative episodes
of 1968:IV— 1969:IV, while foreign income and wealth
have been dropped because of non—availability of data.

       Portfolio theory predicts that a2 > 0, for a
rise in domestic interest rates leads to a capital
inflow —— an increase in net foreign liabilities.

Similarly, an increase in the foreign rate induces

asset—holders to augment their holdings of dollar—
denominated bonds, and                  so a3 <     0.    A rise in nominal
income increases the transactions demand for money,

and NEL rises as foreign assets are sold off to meet
this demand, so that                     >   0.   Finally, we expect a6 < 0,
                                   a5
and   a   = 1 —   A   >   0.

13. Money Demand


     The monetary sector is described by a money

dertand equation and a money supply equation.

     The money demand equation, assumes that long—run

desired real money holdings N/P are a function of the

domestic interest rate, real income, and real wealth:


                     (r,Y/P,V/P) .                              (1)

P is taken to be the consumer price index. Denoting

deflated nominal variables by lower—case letters, we
assume that wealth owners adjust actual real balances

to desired real balances according to the partial ad-
justment rule


          m-m1=y(m—rn1)
Linearizing, we obtain the structural specification

          m =        +
                         b2r   +         + bv +
                b1                 b3y             b5m1 + '2
which is similar to the one adopted by Modigliani,

Rasche, and Cooper (1970) in their study of money
demand in the U.S. Our expectation is that b2 <                0,
h3 and b > 0, and b5 = 1 — y              >   0.


C. Money Supply


     Turning to the supply side, we hypothesize that
                                                                           11


the banking system's long—run desired money supply can
be written as a function of the difference between the

domestic interest rate and the central bank discount
rate     and the real monetary base, BA/P:

                 =    U(r_,BA/P)

As explained in the next section, we work in this

paper with a monetary base series BA adjusted to

reflect changes in reserve requirements. This allows
us to avoid explicit consideration of the deposit

multiplier.

       As before, we assume banks adjust the money supply

toward its long—run equilibrium level according to the
rule


           m —            =
                                     — m1)    .
                                                                     (6)

Taking a linear approximation to a, we obtain the
structural equation

           m =
                 c1
                      +
                              c2(r   —   )+   c3ba + cm1 + P3. (7)

Theory predicts that C2 and                   >   0.   Also, c =   1 — P
                                         c3               -
>0.

II. The   Reaction ?un'ctioi of the Montarr Authori
     This section   describes and estimates a monetary
policy reaction function for the Bundesbank. The non—

exogeneity of Bundesbank monetary policy was recog—
nized in the original work on sterilization by Argy

and Kouri (1971fl, but essentially ignored in subsequent
work by Kouri and Porter (197'4), Kouri (1975), Kohl—

hagen (1977), Neumann (1978), and others. Obviously,
knowledge of the German monetary authority's, behavior

during the 1960s, and its role in the breakdown of the

Bretton Woods system, is useful in itself. But there

is also the econometric issue that parameter estimates

for models of the West German financial sector will in

general be inconsistent if monetary policy is falsely
taken to be exogenous.

     Following Argy and Kouri (l97) and Herring and
1arston (1977), we take the position that Bundesbank

monetary policy can be modelled as a function of a

small number of targets, internal and external. In
view of the large number of instruments available to
the central bank —— minimum reserve policy, discount

policy, open market policy, and others —— a major ob—

stacle to estimation of such a function is the defin-

ition of a sufficiently comprehensive numerical measure
of monetary policy to serve as the dependent varia—

    Because of its limited holdings of domestic debt.

the Bundesbank, during the period of this study, used
changes in reserve requi.'ements as its primary instru-

ment of monetary control. Direct changes in the domes-
tic assets of the   central   bank, including changes in
the volume of discounting and the level of official

deposits, played only secondary roles. For this reason,
empirical studies of Bundesbank policy have always

recognized the need for a measure of the impact of

required reserve changes on the money supply.
     Porter (1972), who initiated the empirical study

of offsetting capital movements, approached the problem
by asking what increase in the foreign assets of the
central bank would have to occur after an increase in

reserve requirements to completely offset that policy's



  On Bundesbank policy, see Schlesinger and Bockelmann
(1973) and Organisation for Economic Co—operation and
Development (1973). The latter contains an excellent
chronology of central bank monetary measures during
the period under study here.

  The problems raised by capital controls, 100 percent
reserve requirements on foreign deposits, and similar
measures are discussed in the next section.

impact on the money stock. Neglecting the influence

of the currency—deposit ratio, we need only find LB
such that


            B+AB


where ct is the new required reserve ratio. If D =

B/a1   is the level of deposits before the change in

the reserve ratio, we can write AB as the change in

required reserves, (a —   a1)D.   This is the measure
of monetary policy that has been used in subsequent

work in this area, and is surel' the right one if

one's goal is to calculate a summary, reduced—form
offset coefficient.

     But it is harder to argue that monetary policy—

makers think in these terms, and that this measure

of the magnitude of minimum reserve policy therefore

belongs on the left—hand side of a reaction function.

Policy-makers are more likely to ask what change in

the monetary base, given the existing reserve ratio,

of the change in monetary policy associated with a
change in required reserves.

        In applying this measure, we              are,    in effect,

systematically redefining the base each period so as

the first and fourth quarters. The coefficient d2
Is the sterilization coefficient, which measures the

extent to which the Bundesbank attempts to neutralize

the money creation resulting from its foreign exchange

intervention through countervailing domestic monetary
measures.7 The price and activity variables are in-
tended to capture the influence of domestic cyclical

factors on monetary policy, and their coefficients

should be negative.

       During much of the period with which we           deal,
the Bundesbank offered domestic banks forward cover at
preferential rates as an inducement to hold foreign

pursued. A positive value of d2 would he evidence of
a monetary policy aimed at external —— rather than in-
ternal —— balance.

rather than domestic assets. These forward swap arrange-

ments were a useful tool from the standpoint of domes-

tic monetary control, for by increasing the level of

swap contracts outstanding, the Bundesbank was able to
bring about a decrease in its net foreign assets.8 Be-

cause these swaps assumed massive proportions relative
to the monetary base in some quarters, they must be

included in any assessment of central bank policy.
          While the Bundesbank quoted swap   rates   rather than
directly choosing a desired volume of swap contracts,

we assume that, during the course of any quarter, it
was able to vary the swap rate so as to elicit the

desired quantitative response from domestic banks.
This allows us to redefine our measure 1MP of monetary
policy as the sum of reserve requirement changes,
changes     in the Bundesbank's net domestic asset holdings,
and    changes in the level of forward swap    commitments,

Recognition that the swaps are a policy—induced component
of net external liabilities entails an adjustment         of
that    series. We accomplish this adjustment by redefin—

the period 1960:1 to 1972:11:

                                                  —   0.522

            Standard error = 11.606; Durbin—\atson
            statistic =    2.19.

All coefficients have the expected signs. The equation
provides strong evidence that the Bundesbank pursued

a policy of systematic sterilization; the estimated
sterilization coefficient is not significantly differ-

ent from —1. The implication is that monetary policy
is indeedeni3.ogenous, and should be treated as such in

econometric estimation.

III. The Offset to Monetary Policy


     This section presents estimates of the three asset—

demand equations described in Section I, and uses them
to calculate the offset to monetary policy in the short-
run and in the long run. All equations are estimated

by two—stage least squares. We assume that changes in
real variables have an immediate impact on financial

markets, but that financial disturbances influence the

level of economic activity only after some time has

elapsed. We thus assume that income, the price level,
wealth, and   the   current—account balance may be used as
instruments. In addition, we use as instruments the
foreign interest rate, the central-bank discount rate,

the exogenous variables In the policy reaction func-

tion, GOVDEP (the level of government deposits at the
J3undesbank), and GOVMON    (government   holdings of money
M2). The data series are described In detail in Appen-
dix II.

     Our period of estimation is 1960:1 to l970:IV.
Although the exchange value of the Deutsche Mark was

pegged in 1971:1 and again between the Smithsonian re-

alignment of December 1971 and the crisis of February—

March 1973, the starting point of the current period of

managed floating, there seemed to be little to gain from

including this particularly turbulent period in our sam—

pie.

       We discuss each equation in turn.9


A. Net External Liabilities


       We obtin the following estimate of the equation

explaining net external liabili,ties:


           NEL/P =     6.5140     +   0.8'42 r — 1.556 r* +
                       (3.039)        (0.371)        (0.659)

                      (0.011)              (0.067)


                       11.299 Dl - 6.1410 D2 +           6.203 D3 +
                      (2.582)             (3.008)       (3.771)


                       8.912 D21      —
                                          9.'416 D5
                       (3.1413)           (3.225)

           Standard   error   =   2.286; Durbin-Watson
           statistic = 2.214.



  The h-statistic of Durbin was used to test for first—
order serial correlation. While the asymptotic distri-
bution of h is not standard normal in a simultaneous—
equations context, it can be shown (see Godfrey (1978))
that if all instruments are exogenous, h is asymptotic-
ally normal with variance exceeding 1. This means that
if we treat h as N(0,l), we are more likely to reject
the hypothesis of no serial correlation. Lagged endo—
genous variables were not used as instruments to obtain
the estimates of this section; as a precaution against
more complicated forms of time—dependence in the equation
residuals. In all three cases the h—statistic was less
than 1 in absolute value, giving no grounds for reject—
ing the hypothesis of no first—order serial correlation.
                                                                21


Note that nominal variables have been deflated by the

price level. The .variables Di Ci. =   l,...,5)   are dummies

for each of the five turbulent quarters 1968:IV —

l969:IV.   As explained in the previous section, NEL

has been corrected for forward swap commitments of the

BLindesbank.

     The parameter estimates for thi equation support
the portfolio—balance theory. Only the coefficient of
wealth was insignificantly different from zero, leading

us to exclude it from the equation. The other coeffi-
cients are significant at the 5 percent level and are

correctly signed.
     A striking feature of the equation is the signifi-

cant positive coefficient of income, indicating that a
DM 1 billion rise in income (at an annual rate) leads

German asset owners to repatriate DM 24 million to

satisfy their increased desire for real balances. The

lagged endogenous variable has a high coefficient,
implying a rather slow adjustment speed of only about

11 percent per quarter.

     The aggregate measure of monetary policy appearing
on the left—hand side of the reaction function in (9)

does not account for the effects of the sharper policy

weapons deployed in an effort to discourage capital in-
flows rather than offset their effects on the money

supply. The chief omissions are the high (at times 100
                                                                22


percent) marginal reserve requirements imposed on for-

eign—owned deposits and prohibitions on interest pay-
ments to foreigners.

       Our justification for ignoring these measures i.n

the equation for net external liabilities is that they
                                                           10
could be, and in fact were, circumvented quite easily.

Thus, at the level of aggregation we have adopted, we
would expect their effects to he negligible. This view
is supported by a recent study on German capital controls

by flewson and Sakakibara (1977).


B. Money Demand


       The money demand equation uses 142 as dependnt var-

iable.. Two—stage least squares yields the estimate:



10
     For example, Hewson and Sakakibara (1977) point out
that 'A typical approach to cirurnventing the minimum
reserve requirement was that German banks would transfer
loan business vis—a—vis German residents to the books of
their foreign branches. As a result German (nonbank)
residents would incur liabilities to the foreign branches
of German banks, and since neither these foreign branches
(which, legally are classified as nonresidents) nor dom-
estic nonhank customers were subject to the minimum re-
serve requirement, German banks were able to circumvent
the control without any loss of business. The notable
expansion of the foreign branch activities of German
banks throughout this period suggests the widespread
use of this loophole.' The loophole was closed only
in 1972 when minimum reserve requirements were imposed
on nonbanks' foreign borrowings.

          Standard error = 14.116, Durbin—Watson

          statistic          2.16.


     The coefficient of the domestic interest rate,

while having the correct sign, is small and insignifi-
cant at the 5   percent level. This is probably due to
the fact that M2 contains some interest—bearing assets.

     Both real income and real wealth have highly sig-

nificant positive coefficients, however. As we would
expect, an increase in either of these variables raises

the demand for real cash balances. The speed of adjust—

ment is roughly 50 percent per quarter, quite rapid by
the standards of quarterly money demand equations.


C. Money Supply


     The estimated money supply equation is

         m = —1.5Oi          +   3.252     (r —     cS) +0.'450 ba   +

                   (3.126) (1.1438)                      (0.1146)


                  0.907 rn_i
                  (0.039)

         Standard     error =         5.176, Durbin-Watson
                                                             2LI



            statistic = 1.90...


        The estimated coefficients for this equation have

the signs predicted by theory. An increase in the dom—
estic interbank rate increases money supply, while an

Increase in the Bundesbank discount rate causes banks

to restrict lending. A rise in the adjusted base, of
course, leads to an expansion of the money supply.

        However, the coefficient of lagged money is prob-

ably too high: the implied speed of adjustment of the

money supply to Its long—run equilibrium level is only
about 10 percent per quarter, far too low to be believ-

able.


D. Offset oefficients

        We now use the simple econometric model we have

estimated to derive the short— and long—run offsets to

monetary policy. This is done by computing the total
derivative of the stock of net external liabilities,

NEL, with respect to DACB, the net domestic assets of

the Bundesbank. In computing the long-run offset coeffi-

cients, we    use the long—run derivatives implied by the
asset demand equationst speeds of adjustment to steady—

state equilibrium.

        Differentiating the system consisting of equations

(3),    (5), (7), and   the identity
                                                                          25

             BA =    .e(FACB + DACB)

yields the total derivative

             dNEL
                     —              0a2c3
             dDACB              —
                          (b2       c2) —®a2c3

The capital outflow resulting from an open market pur—

chase is just equal to the resulting decrease In net

external liabilities. Thus, —dNEL/dDACB is precisely
the short—run offset coefficient. We see that It will
not be the same in each quarter, for It depends on the

level of reserve requirements. The offset becomes                 corn—

plete, of course, as a2, which measures the Interest—

sensitivity of capital movements, becomes infinite.11

        To compute the long—run offset, we replace the
short—run derivatives in the above expression with the

corresponding long—run derivatives
                                            a2       a2/(l—a7),
     b2/(l-b5), C2       = c2/(l-c),
                                and              =
                                                     c3/(l-c).
                                                     The
two sets of offset coefficients are reported in Tables
2a and 2b.

        The short—run offset coefficients are remarkably

small when compared with those appearing In the liter-

ature and generally accepted. The highest is only 15.5
percent, implying that the Bundesbank had to purchase



   Note that the offset is also complete when b2 = C2 = 0.
Thus a unit offset Is in theory consistent
with full central—bank control over the domestic Interest
rate.

DM 1.18 billion in domestic assets to increase the base

by DM 1 billion in that quarter. As asset markets are

given time to adjust, however, the offset increases:
the long—run coefficients reported in Table 2b are sub-

stantial. The highest, 63.6 percent, implies that an
open market purchase of DM 2.75 billion was required to

bring about a permanent DM 1 billion increase in the

monetary base. In general, the long—run offset figures
are somewhat lower, in the neighborhood of 50 to 55 per-

cent.

        The results reported here suggest that the Bundes—

bank had ample leeway to conduct an independent mone-
tary policy over a short horizon during the Bretton

Woods period. In the long run, the cost of an indepen—
dent policy, measured in terms of reserve volatility,

appears to have been greater. But our findings indicate
the short—term constraints were not nearly as severe
as suggested by reduced—form estimates of the offset
coefficient.

 are represented by
                       exogenous dummy vriable. (Wealth
 and foreign Income variables are dropped.)

      The problem with this equation Is that It contains
 AMP, which, as we have
                         seen, Is endogenous, thanks to the
 central bank's sterilization
                               policies. In other words,
 there exists a reaction
                          function having the form

           LMP       (TCF + CAB) + AZ + v

where the variables Z
                     are exogenous targets of monetary
policy. This raises the issue of •the consistency of
the ordinary least
                      squares estimator, which is used by
Kouri and Porter to estimate the capital_flow
                                                  equation.
But it also raises the issue of
                                   identifiability, for
the capital_flow equation will be unidentified
                                               unless
  differs significantly from zero. We should not be
                                                      too
complacent on this score, for the evidence, both
                                                 sta-

 bank's response to foreign money inflows was stable

 and strong, its response to cyclical developments was
weaker and more erratic.

        Assuming identification, we turn to the question of
bias. Denoting the offset coefficient by a, we can
write the capital—flow 'reduced form' as TCF =                 ctE]'4P +

small when the influence of the exogenous targets Z on

monetary policy is weak. On the assumption that Q is
indeed small and that the unexplained volatility of

capital movements Is much greater that that of monetary
policy (so that            >   > ci),     we see that plim aOLS
a + 1/f —     a =   1/a.    If, as our evidence indicates,

sterilization is complete, the OLS estimate of the
offset coefficient will be biased toward —l when the
variance of u Is high, and will thus reflect the behav—
br of the central bank rather than that of private
asset—holders.

   Formula (12) is derived in Appendix I. Note that the
condition E[u'v] = 0 guarantees the identifiability of the
reduced—orin capital—flow equation's parameters.

     Kouriand Porter argue that a reduction in the OLS
bias can be achieved through addition to the equation of

the expectational dummy variables, which assume non—zero

values during speculative episodes when the reduced form

predicts badly. This argument makes little sense, for
while addition of dummies reduces the sample variance,

the probability limit in (12) is calculated on the

assumption of homoscedastic errors. To see whether the
dummies do reduce the bias in the offset coefficient,

we have estimated Kouri—Porter capital flow:equations

with and without dummy variables over our sample period,

1960:1 to 1970:IV. In Table 3 we present results of
estimation for both the total capital—flow equation (11)

and the short—term capital—flow (STCF) equation ex-
plaining international loans maturing in less than a

year; the latter differs from (ii) on1yin that CABLTC,
the sum of the current account and the long—term capital

account, replaces CAB on the right—hand side.'3 The
estimated offset coefficients in both sets of equations
are very close --—   in   the neighborhood of 1 for the capi-
tal account as a whole and near .9 for short—term flows.



13
   Of course, treatment of the long—term capital account
as exogenous in the eguation for short—term capital move-
ments introduces another possible source of simultaneity
bias. We return to this issue below. Equations in Table
3 have been corrected for a first—order moving average

Any reduction in bias is quite small.

     it is possible, however, to make a convincing ar-

gument that the observations corresponding to specula-

tive attacks are Toutlierst that play a large part in

worsening the OLS bias. The simplest way     to   see if
this is so is to drop the speculative periods from the

sample. Rows (a) and (b) of Table       report the results
of estimating the total and short—term capital—flow

equations over the tranquil sub—period 1961:111 to
1967:IV; they show that the observations from turbulent

quarters do exert a preponderant influence on the esti-
mated offset. The latter declines from nearly 100 per-
cent to 55 percent for the TCF equation, and from
90 percent to L16 percent for the STCF equation. For the
policy maker, the difference could not be more striking.

In view of this large discrepancy, it hardly seems rea-
sonable to take the view that the normal interest re-

sponse of capital flows during th Bretton Woods period
entailed a nearly complete offset to domestic monetary

policy.

     Of course, even these lower short—run offsets are

much higher than those calculated in the previous

section. But they are still biased if sterilization is

systematic. To get some idea of the degree of bias, we
estimate the 'reduced form' over the period 1961:111 to

l967:IV by 2SLS, using the instruments suggested by the

reaction function estimated above. The results appear
in Rows (c) and (d) of Table !.    The coefficient of AMP

in the total capital—flow equation is now    slightly   posi-
tive and not significantly different from zero. The
estimated offset in the short—term capital flow equation

falls to 26.3 percent, but the 2SLS variance is so high

that the coefficient is not significant. 2SLS estimation
thus seems to indicate that some simultaneity bias is

still present.

        We can test for the presence of such a bias using

the specification test suggested by Hausman (1978). The
basic idea of the test is to compare the difference be-

tween   the OLS estimate      of the capital—flow equa—
tion's parameters, which is   efficient under the null
hypothesis   of no simultaneity bias, and the 2SLS esti-
mator b2SLS, which is consistent in the presence of

simultaneity bias but inefficient when the null hypo-

thesis is true. The appropriate metric for inference
is given by the test statistic


        (2SLS_OLS)'[var(62SLS)_var(OLS)1 (2SL3bOLS)

which is distributed asymptotically x2(6) under the

null hypothesis.

        Computation of this statistic would be laborious,

but fortunately a simpler method of implementing the

            This apparent contradiction disappears when we
    notice that we have used CABLTC as an instrument in

    equation (b), in accordance with the common practice

    of regarding    long—term capital flows as exogenous           in

    estimating   offset coefficients. But there are no
    good    grounds to believe this is a valid assumption.
    Since   we have CAB available as an instrument, we can
    use it instead of CABLTC to form the instrumental var-
    iable estimate of the short-term capital—flow equa-

    tion's parameters. The result is

                 Standard   error = 1.103;      Durbin—Watson
                 statistic =   2i5.
    which is very different from equations (b) and (d) of
    Table .     This shift in the coefficients suggests that
    long-term capital flows are indeed endogenous, and that
    our previous test for the endogeneity of AMP             in the
    short—term capital—flow equation was invalid. We              ob—
•




    tam a valid test by adding CABLTC as well as AMP to

    this equation's regressors and applying OLS. The result,
    reported in Row (c) •of Table 5, provides unambiguous
evidence of simultaneity bias: the sum of squared re—

siduals of equation (b) of Table 14 is 5.023, while that

of equation (c) of Table 5   is   only 1.839. We therefore
can reject the joint hypothesis that both monetary policy
and long—term capital flows are exogenous.

     When examined carefully, the conclusions of the

Treducedformt approach to capital movements provide
no grounds for rejecting the offset coefficients implied

by structural estimates. This section's evidence is
consistent with the view that the reduced—form approach
is a misleading short—cut, and that the offset coeffi—
dents it yields are seriously biased. However, the

structural approach taken in this essay avoids the prob—
lems of the Kouri—Porter method. Although structural
estimation is more roundabout and certainly more diffi-

cult, it is probably the only way to obtain a reliable
answer to the offset question.

V. Conclusion


     This essay presented a small econometric model of
the West German financial sector and used its parameters

to calculate the short—run arid long—run offsets to mone-

tary policy due to interest—sensitive capital movements.
The resulting series of short—run offset.coefficients

suggested that the offset over.one quarter was quite

small during the 1960—1970 period, typically between 10
and 15 percent. The long—run offset, based on full ad-
justment of asset markets, was found to be quite large,

however, indicating an ultimate reserve loss of between
500 and 650 million Deutsche Marks for every DM 1 bill-

ion increase in the domestic source component of the

monetary base. It therefore appears that the Bundes—

bank's conduct of monetary policy was relatively un-

hampered by international reserve volatility on a quart-

erly basis, at least during periods of tranquility In

international financial markets. Only over a horizon
of several quarters did monetary policy entail large
reserve losses. But, thanks to a substantial degree

of Imperfect substitutability between DM-   and foreign—
currency—denominated bonds, these losses did not suffice

to render monetary measures ineffective in the long run.
    While consistent with the simulation results of

Herring and Marston's (1977) more elaborate model, our
                                                                 l'2

findings   contradict those of the popular 'reduced—form'

approach to measuring the short-run offset, which typ-

ically yields estimates ranging from 50 to 90 percent.

This essay suggested that these estimates pick up the

correlation between monetary policy and capital flows
resulting from the Bundesbank's sterilization operations,
and do not measure the capital—account response to mone-

tary policy. Formal statistical tests allowed us to
reject the hypothesis that monetary policy can be
treated as exogenous in the estimation of capital—flow

equations. In addition, we found that it is improper
to assume that long—term capital flows are exogenous in

equations explaining short—term flows.

     Or estimated offset figures must be interpreted
with caution because of the imprecision of the under-

lying parameter estimates. In addition, we       must   recog-
nize that periods of  heavy speculation agains the
existing   exchange parities posed special problems for
the Bundesbank. Our results do not imply the contrary.
We have made no attempt to explain exchange—rate expec-

tations or their connection with domestic monetary

policy, and our offset coefficients measure the re—
SpOflSIVCnCSS of   capital   flos to interest—rate changes
only. They   are   calculated on   the assumption that ex-
pectations   can be held constant —— a bad assumption

during periods of turbulencein world financial markets.

Appendix I: Sterilization and Simultaneity Bias'5


      In this appendix we consider the consequences of

estimating cx by ordinary least squares in the simul—

taneous system

                  =         + Xy + u




where X and Z are exogenous. This is of course the
situation that arises when the capital account and

monetary TJolicy are simultaneously determined by the
capital—flow and sterilization equations


              TCF =czAMP+LXy+u,
            tMP =          TCF   +   AZ   + v


and a is the offset coefficient. (Here, —l <                 a,   <   0.)
      Multiplying the first of the two equations by
I —   X(XtXy'x,       we can write


                      —
aOLS =     [y2'(I         X(X'X)'x')y2jy2'(I           —
                                                           X(X'XYX')y1
  =                   —
                          X(X'X)'X')y2Jy2'(I           —   X(X'X)X')u.

and substituting it into the expression for ctOLS, we
obtain


                "OLS a_

From   this expressidn, we see       that if E[u'v = 0,,

                           T   cU

       The calculation implies       that    the bias from OLS
estimation will be greater the greater is                   and the
smaller    is        it will be smaJ.ler when       the   Z's are
orthogonal to the X's. In the context of the two—
equation   model of sterilization and offsetting capital
flows,   the expression implies that the bias will be

great when the unexplained component of the capital—
flow equation is large, and when            the   unexplained corn-.
ponent of   the     reaction function is small. It will also
be great when the capital—flow equation is weakly iden-
tified, so that the Z's are collinear with                the   X's.
