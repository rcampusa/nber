The representative agent model (RA) has dominated macroeconomics for the last thirty years. This
model does a reasonably good job of explaining the co-movements of consumption, investment, GDP
and employment during normal times. But it cannot easily explain movements in asset prices. Two
facts are hard to understand 1) The return to equity is highly volatile and 2) The premium for holding
equity, over a safe government bond, is large. The equity premium has two parts; a risk premium and
a term premium. This paper constructs a lifecycle model in which agents of different generations have
different savings rates and I use this model to account for a high term premium and a volatile stochastic
discount factor. The fact the term premium is large, accounts for a substantial part of the observed
equity premium.

        Abstract. The representative agent model (RA) has dominated macroeconomics
        for the last thirty years. This model does a reasonably good job of explaining the
        co-movements of consumption, investment, GDP and employment during normal
        times. But it cannot easily explain movements in asset prices. Two facts are hard
        to understand 1) The return to equity is highly volatile and 2) The premium for
        holding equity, over a safe government bond, is large. The equity premium has two
        parts; a risk premium and a term premium. This paper constructs a lifecycle model
        in which agents of diﬀerent generations have diﬀerent savings rates and I use this
        model to account for a high term premium and a volatile stochastic discount factor.
        The fact the term premium is large, accounts for a substantial part of the observed
        equity premium.




                                      I. Introduction

  The dominant macroeconomic representative agent, (RA) model of the last thirty
years assumes that the co-movements of aggregate consumption, investment, GDP
and employment behave as if they were chosen by a representative agent who maxi-
mizes the expected discounted sum of a stream of future utilities. Although the RA
model can capture the volatilities and co-movements of aggregate quantities during
‘normal times’, it cannot easily explain movements in asset prices.1 Two facts, in
particular, are hard to explain.
  The first fact is that the stock market is highly volatile and daily movements in
the average price of stocks are much too large to be accounted for by movements
in future earnings (Leroy and Porter, 1981; Shiller, 1981). To explain this excess
volatility puzzle the rate at which agents discount the future must be stochastic and

   1The Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Recession of 2008 are clearly not ‘normal times’

and the fact that the RA model does not explain those episodes suggests that we need to rethink
the foundations of macroeconomic theory in a more radical way. That topic, which I have discussed
in other work (Farmer, 2012), is beyond the scope of the current paper.

highly volatile. In a representative agent economy, the stochastic discount factor is a
function of aggregate consumption, and when the utility function of the representative
agent is calibrated to a reasonable degree of risk aversion, the observed volatility of
consumption is not large enough to account for observed price volatility in the data.
  The second fact is that the return to holding a risky asset has historically been
six hundred basis points higher than the return to holding government bonds (Mehra
and Prescott, 1985). To explain the equity premium puzzle, the covariance of the rate
of return on a risky asset with the agent’s marginal utility of consumption, must be
large. It is hard for the RA model to explain a six hundred basis point equity premium
because asset prices do not covary enough with marginal utility for any reasonable
model of preferences.
  Much of the empirical work in the literature on the equity premium does not
distinguish between the premium that arises from the fact that a dividend stream
is random and the premium that arises from the fact that it is paid at diﬀerent
times. The former is a risk premium; the latter a term premium. Abel (1999) oﬀers
a theoretical framework for understanding the diﬀerence between these two concepts
and he points out, that in U.S. data, the premium for holding long-term government
bonds over short-term government bonds has historically been of the order of 17%.
  In this paper I construct a lifecycle model that successfully explains both volatile
asset prices and a substantial term premium as equilibrium responses to purely non-
fundamental shocks.2 In simulated data, my model can account for a Sharpe ratio
of 029 which is more than half of the annual value in U.S. data. Further, it can
account for an equity premium on leveraged equity of 35%, in a model where there
is no fundamental uncertainty and where agents are risk neutral.3




  2Cass   and Shell (1983) use the term intrinsic uncertainty, to refer to anything that aﬀects pref-
erences, endowments or technology, and they use the term extrinsic uncertainty, or sunspots, to
refer to anything that doesn’t. Azariadis (1981) uses the term self-fulfilling prophecy to refer to
sunspots. In this paper I will use the term fundamental shock, to refer to intrinsic uncertainty and
non-fundamental shock to refer to extrinsic uncertainty or sunspots. These terms are, I believe,
more commonly accepted in the literature.
  3The Sharpe ratio is the sample average of the diﬀerence between the risky rate and safe rate of

return divided by the standard deviation of the risky rate. It is a better measure of the return diﬀer-
ence between two assets because, unlike the equity premium, the Sharpe ratio cannot be increased
by leveraging a risky portfolio through borrowing.

  In my model, agents have recursive preferences with an elasticity of substitution of
1, and a risk aversion coeﬃcient of 0. This subset of Epstein-Zin preferences is attrac-
tive because it admits closed form solutions to individual maximization problems.4 In
addition to this preference assumption, I set the discount factor to 097, and I choose
two parameters to match an average working life of 45 years and an average time
spent in retirement of 15 years. These three parameters, plus the standard deviation
of non-fundamental shocks, are the only parameters of my model economy.


                          II. Relationship to the Literature

  There is a large literature on asset price puzzles summarized by Campbell (2003).
The current consensus amongst finance economists, as laid out by John Cochrane
(2007) in his Presidential Address to the American Finance Association, is that most
of these puzzles occur because of unexplained movements in the stochastic discount
factor.
  The excess volatility puzzle and the equity premium puzzle are related to each other
and both puzzles are connected to our lack of understanding of why the stochastic
discount factor moves around so much. A large equity premium implies that the
covariance between the marginal utility of consumption and the stochastic discount
factor must also be large. Because the covariance of two random variables is bounded
by the product of their individual standard deviations, a high equity premium implies
that the marginal utility of consumption, or the stochastic discount factor, or both,
must have a large standard deviation. The bounds placed on the equity premium
by this condition are known in the literature as the Hansen-Jagannathan bounds
(Hansen and Jagannathan, 1991).
  Constantinides (1990) and Abel (1990) have proposed resolutions of the equity pre-
mium puzzle by modifying the representative agent’s preferences. By adding ‘habits’
to the utility function, these authors provide alternative models of preferences in
which the representative agent’s marginal utility is highly sensitive to movements in
consumption. The additional volatility in marginal utility that occurs in habit forma-
tion preferences increases the covariance of the marginal utility of consumption with
the stochastic discount factor and helps to explain a large equity premium.
  In Constantinides’ (1990) paper, habits are determined by the previous consump-
tion of a representative agent whereas Abel, (1990), assumes that there are many

  4This   is the special case of RINCE preferences (Farmer, 1990) for which the elasticity of substi-
tution is unity. RINCE is an acronym for RIsk Neutrality Constant Elasticity of substitution.

identical representative agents, each of whom cares about what other agents con-
sumed in the past. Although these papers can account for a large equity premium,
they do it at the cost of producing a riskless rate that is counterfactually volatile.
Campbell and Cochrane (1999) solve this problem by using the data to determine
how the past consumption of other agents, influences marginal utility.
  In a separate literature, Rietz (1988), and Barro (2006), argue that there is a small
but significant probability of occasional large disasters. Even if a disaster has not
occurred in sample, the possibility that it might occur in the future will cause the
representative agent to appear excessively cautious. But although the Barro-Reitz
model can explain the equity premium, it cannot explain the excess volatility of stock
market returns.
  Bansal and Yaron (2004) have shown that persistence of the dividend growth rate,
and time varying volatility of asset returns, are important elements of an explanation
of a high equity premium. In separate but related work, both Gabaix (2008, 2012)
and Wachter (2013) modify the rare disaster model by assuming that the probability
of rare disasters varies over time. Using that assumption, they are able to explain
volatility in the stochastic discount factor in a model that also has a high equity
premium. But although the rare disaster explanation is promising, it is not uncontro-
versial, and Julliard and Ghosh (2012) have argued that rare disasters do not occur
often enough in the data for the hypothesis to be plausible.
  An alternative explanation for excess volatility was developed by Farmer, Nourry,
and Venditti (2012). Building on Farmer (2002a,b), they constructed a two-agent ver-
sion of Blanchard’s (1985) perpetual youth model, and they showed that it generates
a volatile stochastic discount factor as a consequence of non-fundamental shocks.5
But although their model succeeds in generating large and volatile fluctuations in the
stochastic discount factor, it cannot explain why there is a large equity premium or
a large term premium.
  The current paper is most closely related to a literature that combines incomplete
participation with heterogenous agents and incomplete markets. Guvenen (2009)
constructs a production economy with all three of these features that he solves com-
putationally. Kubler and Schmedders (2011) construct a heterogenous agent overlap-
ping generations model with sequentially complete markets. By dropping the rational

  5Cass   and Shell (1983) refer to non-fundamental shocks as ‘sunspots’. They showed that sunspots
can alter the allocations of consumption goods across agents, even when there is a complete set
of asset markets. Farmer, Nourry, and Venditti (2012) extended the model of Cass and Shell to a
calibrated example with long-lived agents.

expectations assumption, they are able to generate substantial asset price volatility.
Constantinides and Duﬃe (1996) exploit cross-section heterogeneity of the income
process and they show that uninsurable income risk across consumers can potentially
explain any observed process for asset prices. However, Storesleten and Yaron (2007)
argue that the ability of the Constantinides-Duﬃe model to explain the equity pre-
mium, is considerably reduced, once one allows for realistic population demographics
and the possibility of capital accumulation.
  Vissing-Jorgenson (2002) has argued that the elasticity of substitution of stock hold-
ers is lower than that of bond holders and Vissing-Jorgenson and Attanasio (2003) use
that fact to oﬀer a partial resolution of the equity premium puzzle. My work exploits
that same idea. The equity premium depends on the covariance of the stochastic
discount factor with the consumption of asset holders. And since, in my model, there
is more than one type of agent, the consumption growth of individuals can be volatile
even when the consumption growth of aggregate consumption is not. Although ag-
gregate consumption in my model is constant, the consumption growth of individual
agents displays substantial variation.
  I will argue, in this paper, that a large part of the equity premium puzzle is a puzzle
over the term premium, not the risk premium. I will show, that if the stochastic
discount factor is suﬃciently volatile, the value of leveraged equity in a company will
oﬀer a high and volatile return, even if the dividend payment oﬀered by the firm is
safe.


                           III. Risk Premia and Term Premia

  Macroeconomists typically assume that households maximize the expected dis-
counted present value of a time-separable von-Neumann Morgenstern (VNM) utility
function. In this paper, I use a more general class of recursive preferences developed
by Kreps and Porteus (1978, 1979), Epstein and Zin (1991, 1989) and Farmer (1990).
These preferences separate the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion from the intertem-
poral elasticity of substitution: two concepts that are indistinguishable in the special
case of expected utility.6
  Recursive utilities are generated by an aggregator function  ( )  where

                                      =  (   [+1 ])                                   (1)

  6Recursive   preferences for finite horizons are due to Kreps and Porteus (1978, 1979). Epstein and
Zin (1991, 1989) generalized their results and extended them to the infinite horizon case. The risk
neutral example used here was first studied by Farmer (1990).
                                         ASSET PRICES                                               6

Expected utility is the special case of recursive preferences in which the function
 ( ) is linear in  and, in this case, utility can be expressed recursively as

                                   =  ( ) +  [+1 ]                                     (2)

where  (·) is an increasing concave function and  is the agent’s discount factor.
  Here, I use a special case of recursive preferences, RINCE preferences, (Farmer,
1990), in which agents are indiﬀerent to one step ahead risk and in which they display
a constant intertemporal elasticity of substitution.7 RINCE preferences are generated
by the aggregator
                           log ( ) = log ( ) +  log ( [+1 ])                            (3)

Importantly, these preferences admit closed form solutions to intertemporal problems
with incomplete asset markets. Agents with RINCE preferences will tolerate very
large swings in one-step ahead consumption, but they become risk averse at longer
horizons.
  One might conjecture that, if agents are indiﬀerent to one-step-ahead risk, that
the model has no hope of explaining an equity premium of 6%. That conjecture
is false since agents with RINCE preferences do care about the covariance of asset
returns with the marginal utility of consumption. And since the term premium and
risk premium are confounded in much of the empirical literature, a model with a
substantial term premium can go a long way to towards explaining the observed
equity premium puzzle.

                                IV. My Lifecycle Model

  In this section I will construct a lifecycle model in which agents of diﬀerent gener-
ations have diﬀerent savings rates and I will explain how this model can account for
both a high term premium and a volatile stochastic discount factor. Unlike the habit
formation models of Constantinides (1990) and Abel (1990), my model generates a
smooth path for the safe rate of interest.
  My model builds on Gertler (1999), who studied an economy with two generations.
Following Blanchard (1985), Gertler constructs an economy where agents die each
period with an age-invariant probability. He extends Blanchard’s framework to allow
for a stochastic transition from youth to old age. I use that same idea.
  In my model there are two generations of agents. Workers earn a constant endow-
ment stream of 1 unit and retirees earn nothing, and like Gertler (1999), I assume

  7RINCE    is an acronym for RIsk Neutral, Constant Elasticity of substitution (Farmer, 1990).
                                         ASSET PRICES                                         7

that the transition from work to retirement is stochastic. Gertler uses RINCE prefer-
ences to find a solution to a problem where agents cannot insure against the event of
retirement. I modify the Gertler economy by allowing for an insurance market over
the observable random event of retirement.
  Three features of my model account for its success in solving the two asset pricing
puzzles. The first feature is that shocks are unbounded above. That allows me to
construct equilibria in which the stochastic discount factor is extremely volatile.8 The
second feature is that the lower bound on non-fundamental shocks is state dependent.
That provides additional volatility to the stochastic discount factor and generates
time varying return volatility, a property that also characterizes the time series data.
The third feature, is that agents are indiﬀerent to one-step ahead consumption risk.
By exploiting these three features, my lifecycle model is able to explain both excess
volatility and a considerable part of the equity premium with a parsimonious model
in which the parameters of the model are pinned down by population demographics.

                      V. Asset Pricing in a Lifecycle Model

  In this section, I will explain how asset pricing in a lifecycle model diﬀers from asset
pricing in a representative agent model. The main diﬀerence is that the expression for
the pricing kernel no longer depends on aggregate consumption growth. Instead, it
depends on the division of resources between workers and retirees. That fact allows
me to construct equilibria in a lifecycle model in which asset prices are volatile, even
when aggregate consumption growth is not.
  Consider an asset that sells for price  and pays 1 unit of a unique consumption
good with probability  1 and 0 units in all future periods, with probability (1 −  1 ).
This asset has three interpretations.
  First, it is the human wealth of a worker who retires with probability (1 −  1 ).
Second, it is a bond that pays a coupon that decays at rate  1 , a theoretical construct
suggested by Woodford (2001) to model long duration bonds.9 Third, it is a claim
to an unleveraged firm that has a dividend stream of 1 unit with probability 1 and
nothing in all future periods with probability (1 −  1 ).
  Let 0 represent the price for delivery of a consumption good next period in state
0 , divided by the conditional probability that this state will occur. The price of the
  8This   diﬀers from previous work by Farmer, Nourry, and Venditti (2012) where non-fundamental
shocks have bounded support.
  9A Woodford bond has a duration of 1 (1 −  ) years. By choosing this number appropriately,
                                              1

a Woodford bond can be used to find a tractable formula for the price of a bond of any desired
maturity.
                                          ASSET PRICES                                           8

asset  is determined by the equation,

                                        = 1 +  [ 1 0 0 ]                                 (4)

  Because I assume that the aggregate endowment is constant, this is a model with no
fundamental aggregate uncertainty. In a representative agent model, the assumption
that there is no fundamental uncertainty would imply that 0 is constant and equal
to . In the lifecycle model studied here, I will show that 0 can be expressed as a
rational polynomial in asset prices
                                                0 + 1 
                                         0 =                                                 (5)
                                                0 + 1 0
where the parameters 0  1 , 0 and 1 are functions of the rate of time preference,
the expected duration of a person’s working life, and the expected duration of his
time spent in retirement. Because agents are indiﬀerent to one-period return risk,
the marginal rate of substitution will not be equated, state by state, to the pricing
kernel. But because agents care about when they consume, they do care about the
covariance of 0 with human wealth. That fact explains why the model is able to
deliver a term premium for a long lived asset over a one period bond.

                                      VI. Demographics

  This section explains the assumptions I make about population demographics. I
assume a pure exchange economy that consists of a measure 1 of workers and a
measure 2 of retirees. Population is constant and equal to one,

                                           1 + 2 = 1                                        (6)

Time is discrete and retirement and death are modeled as stochastic events. Each
period a worker has a probability 1 , of remaining active and a probability 1 −  1 of
retiring. A retired worker has a probability  2 of surviving for an extra period and a
probability 1 −  2 of dying.10
  I assume that the number of deaths equals the number of births and the measures
of workers and retirees are constant. Since 1 (1 − 1 ) workers retire each period
there must be 1 (1 −  1 ) births to replace them. And since I assume a stationary
population, the measure of births must equal the measure of deaths,

                                   (1 − 1 ) 1 = (1 −  2 ) 2                               (7)
  10I   assume for simplicity that workers retire before dying although relaxing that assumption is
not diﬃcult and does not materially alter the main results.
                                      ASSET PRICES                                      9

Using the assumption that the total population size is one, equations (6) and (7) imply
that the stationary measures of workers and retirees are given by the expressions,
                                1 − 2                   1 − 1
                       1 =                    2 =                                (8)
                              2 − 1 − 2              2 − 1 − 2
Since the population of each group is stationary, the inflow of new workers must equal
the inflow of new retirees, also equal to the number of deaths. Using the symbol  to
represent this number, we may rewrite the expressions from Equation (7) as follows,
                                      (1 −  2 ) (1 − 1 )
                                 =                                                 (9)
                                         2 − 1 − 2

                          VII. Pensions and Annuities

  In this section, I explain the institutions that insure workers against the event of
retirement and that provide annuities to retirees to support their consumption in old
age.
  Each worker is endowed with one unit of the endowment in every period in which
he remains active. Retirees are endowed with zero units of the endowment and they
must live oﬀ the assets acquired during their working life. These assumptions provide
a demand for two specialized assets; pensions and annuities. I assume that workers
can purchase actuarially fair pensions and that retirees can purchase actuarially fair
annuities. Consider first, the market for pensions.
  There is a large number of competitive risk-neutral pension funds that invest in
a riskless security that costs ̄ units at date  and pays 1 unit at date  + 1. Each
pension fund oﬀers two securities for sale to workers. A type 1 security sells for price
1 and pays 1 unit in the subsequent period if the worker remains active, and nothing,
if he retires. A type 2 security sells for price 2 and pays nothing next period if the
worker remains active, and 1 unit, if he retires. By purchasing a portfolio of these
two securities, the worker can provide for any chosen allocation of his future wealth
between the states of employment and retirement. Importantly, I assume that the
event of retirement is stochastic and cannot be influenced by any decision taken by
the worker.
  The assumption that this pension scheme is actuarially fair implies that

                              1 =  1    2 = (1 − 1 )                        (10)

  There is a similar scheme for retirees. A retired person pays  2  units at date  for
a security that pays 1 unit at date  + 1, if he remains alive, and nothing, if he dies.
In the event of death, the assets of the retiree are returned to the annuities company.

                VIII. Assumptions about the Financial Markets

  In the lifecycle model I construct in this paper, I will allow for a complete set of
Arrow securities and I will use the notation  ()  or just , to refer to a type 
Arrow security. The security  () pays 1 unit of the commodity, if and only if state
 occurs.
  I will show, in Proposition 1, that the assumption that agents have RINCE pref-
erences implies that the division of Arrow securities between workers and retirees is
indeterminate, and hence, the equilibrium I describe would be supported even if the
asset markets were incomplete. I view this assumption as a convenient short-cut to
finding the closed form solution to an incomplete markets problem.11
  Armed with this notation, I will introduce three concepts of wealth, and I will use
these concepts to construct the period budget constraints of a worker and a retiree.
These three concepts are the total wealth of a worker that I call  , the human wealth
of a worker, that I call , and the financial assets of a worker or retiree that I call
 where I use a subscript 1 to denote a worker and 2 to denote a retiree. Using this
notation, the wealth of a worker is given in Equation (11) as the sum of financial
assets, 1 and human wealth, 

                                           = 1 +                                          (11)

There is no subscript on  or  because I use these terms exclusively to refer to
workers. Retirees have no human wealth and, as a consequence, their wealth is equal
to their net financial assets, 2 .
  Human wealth is defined recursively by the following functional equation,


                                       = 1 +  1  [0 0 ]                                 (12)

This is Equation (5) from Section 5. The human wealth of a worker is equal to
the discounted stream of endowments, discounted at price 0 , where 0 is the
Arrow security price in state  and  is the probability that state  occurs. In a
representative agent economy, this equation would be solved forward after replacing

  11The   assumption of RINCE preferences allows me to find a closed form for the decision rules of
the agents. Although I assume that markets are complete, that assumption is made for notational
convenience, and the model with incomplete markets has the same equilibria. I conjecture that
a model with risk aversion and incomplete markets will display a similar solution to the explicit
equilibrium that I derive here. That conjecture follows from the work of Balasko and Cass (1989)
who have shown that sunspot fluctuations occur generically in models with incomplete asset markets.
                                        ASSET PRICES                                         11

0 by the constant discount factor, , to find an expression for  as the discounted
sum of all expected future income.
  I will show, in this model, that 0 can be expressed, in equilibrium, as a function of
 and 0 . Replacing 0 by this function in Equation (12) leads to an expression that
can be solved backwards to find 0 as a function of . And because the steady state
of this equation is stable, there exist equilibria in which stochastic sunspot shocks
reallocate resources between workers and retirees.

             IX. Budget Constraints of Workers and Retirees

  In this section, I will use the definitions of wealth, human wealth and financial
assets to write down the budget constraints of a worker and a retiree.
  Consider first, the budget constraint of a representative worker.

                                                               £      ¤
                    1 + 1 − 1 =  1  [01 0 ] + (1 − 1 )  00 0
                                                                 2                     (13)
The worker enters the period holding net financial assets 1 . He receives an endow-
ment of 1 unit and he chooses to consume 1 units of the consumption good. That
explains the left side of Equation (13).
  The first term on the right side,  1  [01 0 ], is the worker’s purchases of Arrow
securities, contingent on remaining a worker. The second term on the right side of
Equation (13), (1 −  1 )  [00 0
                              2  ]  is the workers purchase of pension assets contingent
on retirement. In the event that the worker retires in period  + 1, he receives the
retirement assets 00
                   2  I use the subscript 2 because, if he retires, the worker becomes
a retiree.
  A similar expression to Equation (13), holds for retirees,

                                  2 − 2 =  2  [02 0 ]                             (14)

The retiree has no endowment income and his wealth is equal to his financial assets
2 . His consumption is 2 and his accumulation of contingent assets is equal to
 2  [02 0 ( 0 )]  I now turn to the behavior of an agent at diﬀerent stages of life.

                                   X. Decision Rules

  This section derives the decision rules that would be followed by a worker and a
retiree who maximize utility subject to the budget constraints outlined in Section IX.
I assume that utility is recursive, and described by the functions,

                       log (1 ) = log ( ) +  1 log ( [1+1 ])                (15)
                                        ASSET PRICES                                      12

for workers and
                       log (2 ) = log ( ) +  2 log ( [2+1 ])              (16)
for retirees. The parameter  is the common discount factor, (1 −  1 ) is the probabil-
ity that a worker will retire and (1 −  2 ) is the probability that a retiree will die. The
assumption of RINCE preferences leads to decision rules that are linear in wealth.
The form of these rules is summarized in Proposition 1.

Proposition 1. The solution to the workers’ and the retirees’ decision problems are
represented by a set of linear decisions rules described by equations (17)—(19):

                                     1 = −1                                        (17)

where  and  are positive real numbers, defined by the expressions

Workers and retirees are indiﬀerent to any asset allocation for which

Proof. See Appendix A.                                                                    ¤

  Equations (17) and (18) are the decision rules for a young agent. Equation (17)
instructs him to consume a fraction −1 of his wealth in every state and Equation
(18) provides the rule for how his saving is to be allocated between pension assets
and non pension assets. Equation (19) is the decision rule for a retiree.
  Equations (22) provide restrictions on the set of equilibrium pricing kernels. They
are the only restrictions that follow from the first order conditions for choice of future
consumption. Even though workers and retirees have the option of determining the
allocation of consumption across states, the linearity of the value function in expected
wealth implies that both types of agents will be indiﬀerent to one-step ahead con-
sumption risk. Notice however, that agents are not indiﬀerent to the covariance of
the pricing kernel with consumption. That fact generates a term premium for long
lived assets.

                                    XI. Equilibrium

  In this section I will characterize an equilibrium as the solution to a functional
equation in a single state variable, human wealth. The proof proceeds by establishing
two lemmas. First I show how the consumption of the young depends on human
wealth; then I establish that the stochastic discount factor is a rational polynomial
in  and 0 .
  To establish the first lemma, I use the solution to the decision problems from
Proposition 1 together with the asset market clearing and goods market clearing
conditions.

Lemma 1. Define the sets  ≡ [ ] and ̄ = [0 1]. There exists an increasing aﬃne
function  (·) :  → ̄ such that the aggregate consumption of workers, 1  is given
by the expression,
                                             −
                                   1 =  () ≡                                  (23)
                                             −
Further, the aggregate consumption of retirees, 2  is given by
                                                      −
                                 2 = 1 −  () ≡                                (24)
                                                      −
In period 0, human wealth is pinned down by the initial condition
                                         ( − )
                                  0 =            ̄10 + 1                       (25)
                                             
where ̄10   is the net financial assets of workers in period 0.

Proof. See Appendix B.                                                              ¤

  Next, I turn to the pricing kernel, 0 . To obtain an expression for this term, I
use the first order condition of a worker, together with the asset and goods market
clearing conditions.

Lemma 2. There exists a function  (·) :  ×  → + such that the stochastic
discount factor, 0 given by the expression
                                                   1 ( − )
                               0 =  ( 0 ) ≡                                 (26)
                                                   2 0 − 
is a valid equilibrium pricing kernel. The parameters 1 and 2 are defined as,

                          1 =  1       2 =  (1 − ) +                   (27)

and  is the measure of newborns from Equation (9).

Proof. See Appendix C                                                               ¤

  Using lemmas 1 and 2, I am ready to provide a characterization of competitive
equilibria for this economy. From (12) we have

                                   − 1 =  [1 0 0 ]                            (28)

Replacing 0 in (28) from (26) gives
                                     ½                ¾
                                         1 ( − ) 0
                             − 1 =  1                                          (29)
                                         2 0 − 
Equation (29) is a diﬀerence equation in 0 that characterizes sequences {} which
satisfy the goods and asset market clearing conditions,

                             1 + 2 = 1      1 + 2 = 0                         (30)

and the optimal decision rules, (17) — (19). Any sequence {} that satisfies this
equation, together with the feasibility conditions that 0  0 and 1 ∈ ̄, and the
initial condition, 1 (0) = ̄1 , completely characterizes a competitive equilibrium.
  One equilibrium sequence is generated by non-stochastic solutions to the implicit
diﬀerence equation
                               1 ( − ) 0              ( − )
                   − 1 = 1                  0 =             ̄10 + 1          (31)
                               2 0 −                    
But this is not the only equilibrium in this economy. Because of the fact that agents
are indiﬀerent as to the allocation of consumption across states, there are also solu-
tions to this equation in which non-fundamental shocks influences outcomes. That
idea is captured in Proposition 2.

Proposition 2. Define the set ̄ ≡ [1  ] where
                                              

There exists a sequence of non-fundamental random variables {0 }, a function ̄1 :

sequence {} given by the diﬀerence equation

                                     0 =  ( 0 )                               (33)

Proof. See Appendix D.                                                                  ¤

  The function  ( 0 ) describes the evolution of human wealth from one period to
the next. The domain of this function is the set ̄. The first component of ̄ is 
which must be in the support of the invariant distribution. The second component
of ̄ is 0 which is a random variable with a support that is unbounded above, and
bounded below by a number that depends on .

                          XII. The Properties of Shocks

  This section is technical and can be omitted without losing the flow of my argument.
I show how to construct the set ̄ and I explain why the support of the shocks is
unbounded above and why the lower bound of the shock distribution depends on
. These important features of the model enable it to explain excessive asset price
volatility and a large equity premium.
  Figure 1 illustrates the properties of the function  ( 0 ) −  for three diﬀerent
realizations of the shock 0 . This function plots the change in  between dates  and
 + 1 on the vertical axis against the value of  on the horizontal axis. The feasible set
is [ ]. When  = , the retirees consume the entire endowment and when  = ,
the workers consume everything

               Figure 1: The Evolution Equation for Human Wealth
  The solid blue line represents the function  ( 0 ) −  for a relatively large value
of 0 , equal to 12. The dashed green line is the function  ( 0 ) −  for a small value
of 0 , equal to 098; and the dash-dot red line is the value of the this function when
the shock is equal to its mean value of 1. The figure illustrates that, if the economy
were to be hit by a constant sequence of shocks, all equal to 1, that  would converge
to point .
  The fact that the shock distribution is unbounded above follows from equation (36)
which I repeat below
                                                                                    ( − 1) 0

Dividing the numerator and denominator of Equation (42) by 0 and taking the limit
as 0 → ∞, it follows that  ( 0 ) converges to a number, 1 as 0 converges to ∞
where,
                                                                                          
                                                                    1 =            ≡                                                  (43)
                                                                                 2   (1 − )  + 
Notice that the number 1 is greater than  and less than  and hence 0 = ∞ is
feasible and the support of feasible shocks is unbounded above.

  What about a lower bound? Inspection of Equation (42) reveals that small shocks
can cause 0 to become larger than the maximum feasible value of  and it follows
from that fact that the set of feasible shocks is bounded below. But the smallest
feasible shock is not state independent; it depends on .

                                   Figure 2: The Support of the Shock Distribution
  Figure 2 plots 0 on the vertical axis and  on the horizontal axis. The figure
illustrates the function  ( 0 ) for two diﬀerent values of the shock, 0 = 08 and
0 = 2. When the economy is hit by a large shock, next period’s human capital will
always remain feasible. That fact is illustrated by the solid blue curve which shows
what happens to next period’s human capital when the shock 0 , is equal to 2.
  When the economy is hit by a small shock, next period’s human capital will remain
feasible if  is small, but not if  is large. That is illustrated on Figure 2 by the dashed
green line which represents the function  ( 0 ) for a value of 0 equal to 08. The
figure shows that for values of  less than 1 , 0 is feasible since  ( 08) is feasible.
But if  is greater than 1 then 0 equal to 08 is not feasible since  ( 08) will be
bigger than .
   To ensure that 0 remains feasible for all 0 ∈ ̄, we can make the support of
                                                              ¡          ¢
0 conditional on  by defining a function ̄1 () such that   ̄1 () = . This

function is illustrated on Figure 2. The figure shows that ̄1 (1 ) = 08 since 0 = 08
maps 1 to , the boundary of the feasible set.
  What else do we know about feasible values of 0 ? Not much since economic theory
does not place strong restrictions on the distribution of 0 . It must obey the property
that
                                       (0 | ) = 1                                 (44)
and its support, ̄ must have the property that
                              ¡     ¢
                               ̄ ⊂ ̄ for all  ∈ ̄.                            (45)

  In the simulation results, reported below, I used a log normal distribution for
0 − ̄1 (). Specifically, I assumed that
                               µ                          ¶
                      0              2      ¡           ¢
                     ∼ exp  −        + log 1 − ̄1 () + 1 () 
                                      2
where  is a standard normal random variable and  is a parameter that controls the
standard deviation of 0 . It follows from the properties of the lognormal distribution
                                                   £           ¤
that  (0 ) = 1 and that the support of 0 is ̄ ≡ ̄1 ()  ∞ .
  Is it reasonable to impose a conditional bound on the support of sunspot shocks? I
think so. The assumption that shocks have a larger support when  is small, implies
that the risky rate will be more volatile when asset prices are low than when asset
prices are high. In other words, the model displays conditional heteroskedasticity, a
feature that is known to characterize real world asset data.

           XIII. Using a Simple Lifecycle Model to Explain the Data

  The lifecycle model I have constructed is extremely simple. There is no fundamental
uncertainty and no production, and, there is a complete set of asset markets and two
generations of agents. Agents have rational expectations and a simple generalization
of logarithmic preferences. Nevertheless, the model captures the two anomalies of
asset pricing that I referred to in the introduction: it produces volatile asset prices
and a substantial term premium. To illustrate these features of the model, I calibrated
it in the way described in Table 1.

       Table 1                          Value             Implied Value

  Figure 3 compares simulated data on the left two panels with actual U.S. data on
the right. The simulated data represents one draw of 60 years using the parameter
values from Table 1. The top left panel plots the yield to maturity on a long bond
(the dashed red line) and the risk free rate (the solid blue line). The gross yield to
maturity for a long bond in simulated data was calculated as

                                                    
                                         =  1                                             (46)
                                                   −1
and the gross short rate was calculated as
                                                   1
                                          =                                                (47)
                                                  (0 )
The gross yield to maturity is the annualized return from purchasing a bond at price
 and holding it to maturity. The gross short rate is the inverse of the sum of the
Arrow security prices.
  The parameter 1 enters Equation (46), because the coupon on the bond decays at
rate 1 . I chose this parameter to equal the survival probability of a worker and its
value of 09778 implies an expected life of 45. Hence, the implied maturity of a long
bond in this model is also 45 years and the yield to maturity,  , is the yield on a 45
year bond purchased at price . For the simulated data series depicted in Figure 3,
the average yield on a long bond was 249% and the average return to a short term
asset was equal to 143% yielding a sample term premium of 11%
  The top right panel of Figure 3 plots the three month treasury bill rate against
the yield to maturity of a long term government bond in time series data. The data
are monthly at annualized rates and they start in 1960 and end in 2000, when the
long bond data were discontinued. This sample includes the great inflation of the late
1970 and early 1980 and I have not attempted to correct either series for inflation.12
The mean of the long bond yield in these data is 72% and the mean of the Tbill rate
is 6% giving a term premium of 12%.
  To compute the risky return on a leveraged claim, I first computed the unleveraged
gross risky rate,  as
                                                  1 0
                                           =                                               (48)
                                                 −1

  12An   inflation premium will be included in both series and, although these premia need not be
identical, it is not obvious how the two series should be adjusted to account for these diﬀerences.
That caveat should be taken into account when comparing the term premium from the model with
the term premium in the data.

The numerator of the risky rate  , is  1 0 as opposed to the numerator of the long
bond yield, which is  1 . This reflects the assumption that the long asset is purchased
at date  for price  and sold one year later for price 0 .

  The center left panel of Figure 3 plots the safe rate and the leveraged return to
equity. In this simulated data series, the equity return was equal to 50% and the
equity premium was equal to 35% The standard deviation of the leveraged equity
claim was equal to 1212 which implies that the Sharpe ratio for this simulation was
029.
  The calculation used to construct the stock market return assumes that the investor
holds the stock for one year and sells it for price 0 . The fact that  is volatile, partly
accounts for the volatility of the simulated stock return in this figure.
  There is a second factor generating volatility in simulated stock returns. To com-
pute data for the risky return, I assumed that the stock is leveraged and I computed
                                                                   ASSET PRICES                                                21

the equity return using Equation (49). Leverage increases the mean return of a risky
asset; but it also increases its volatility. If the debt to equity ratio is represented by
, then a movement of 1% in the value of the underlying risky asset causes the value
of the firm to move by 1 (1 − ) %.13

  In the U.S., the average value of  across all U.S. firms is roughly 06 which implies
that the realized value of a leveraged claim should swing by approximately two and
half times as much as the value of the underlying asset.
  Although the model delivers a high term premium and a volatile risky rate, ag-
gregate consumption in the model is constant and equal to 1. Agents are willing
to pay a high premium on a long asset because the stochastic discount factor has a
high covariance with the consumption growth of individual agents. And to generate
a high covariance, the variance of consumption growth must itself be high. That fact
that is reflected in the lower left panel of Figure 3 which plots the consumption of all
workers.
  On average, workers as a group consumed 84% of GDP each year in this sample;
but that average reflects considerable year to year variation. In a bad year for the
working population, consumption in this sample fell as low as 58% of GDP and in
a good year, it was as high as 97%. Since 75% of the population are workers and
25% retirees, these numbers imply that in an average year, a retiree consumed 57% as
much as a worker, but that fraction fluctuated with a low of 9% and high of 221%.14
  Although one draw of sixty years of data displays a high equity premium, one is
entitled to ask if the realization was a statistical fluke. Since the standard deviation
of equity returns is so high, there is a significant probability of observing a high equity
premium simply as a result of sampling error. Figure 4 investigates that possibility.
The figure plots the empirical densities of the mean riskless rate, the mean leveraged
equity rate and the mean Sharpe ratio in 500 replications of 60 years of data, using
the parameters from Table 1. The figure illustrates that the mean Sharpe ratio is
equal to 016 with a significant probability of observing a Sharpe ratio of 03 or higher.

                             XIV. A Summary of my Results

  What has this paper achieved? We know from the work of Barro (2005) and Rietz
(1988) that a model with occasional large drops in consumption can generate a large
equity premium. And from the work of Gabaix (2012) and Wachter (2013) we know
that the ability of the rare disaster model to explain the facts is enhanced when the
probability of a disaster is time varying. But what explains sudden large drops in
consumption? And are those large drops in consumption frequent enough in the data
to explain an equity premium of 6%?
  14If   the workers consumes a fraction  of the endowment, the average worker receives a fraction
3 and the average retiree receives (1 − ), reflecting the fact that there are three workers for every
retiree. The relative consumption of a retiree is 3 (1 − ) .

  The first contribution of this paper is to show that disasters need not be fun-
damental; in a lifecycle model, they may be generated by sunspots or self-fulfilling
prophecies.
  We know from the work of Constantinides and Duﬃe (1996), Guvenen (2009) and
Storesleten and Yaron (2007), that uninsurable cross-section risk can contribute to
asset price volatility and to a high equity return. Guvenen (2009) has formalized that
idea in a two agent model and Kubler and Schmedders (2011) come to a similar con-
clusion in an overlapping generations model when markets are complete but agents
have diﬀering beliefs. The equilibria in both of these papers are solved computation-
ally.
  The second contribution of this paper is to provide a simple tractable framework
that can be solved analytically and that generates asset price volatility and a consid-
erable term premium.
  I show that interpersonal consumption volatility interacts with diﬀerential savings
rates to generate a mean Sharpe ratio of 019 which is roughly half of the observed
risk premium in U.S. data. Agents in my model are risk neutral; nevertheless the
model explains a large fraction of the observed risk premium.
  How should one interpret the risk neutrality assumption? The fact that my agents
are indiﬀerent to consumption risk allows me to derive a simple analytic expression
for the pricing kernel that would apply in a world where markets are incomplete. And
since the shocks to my model are purely extrinsic, it is stretching belief to assume
that there are complete markets that are contingent on their realization. Even if
agents currently alive could agree on the nature of the random variables that trigger
movements in asset prices, the agents that are as yet unborn would not be party to
those agreements.
  I conclude that many of the features I describe in this paper could be replicated
in an incomplete markets model in which agents are risk averse. And in a model of
that kind, the term premium that holds in my model would be supplemented by an
additional term representing aversion to consumption risk.


                                   XV. Conclusion

  The lifecycle model I have constructed in this paper is simple and elegant. There is
no fundamental uncertainty and no production, and, there is a complete set of asset
markets and two generations of agents. Nevertheless, my model is able to capture
significant features of the behavior of real world asset markets: asset prices are volatile
and the return to equity is significantly higher than the return to government bonds.

  The model is persuasive, precisely because it explains so much with so few parame-
ters, each of which is pinned down by a few simple facts. Despite its simplicity, the
model oﬀers an elegant way to explain two important features of asset prices; asset
prices are volatile and there is a substantial term premium in the data.
  Although I assume a form of risk neutrality, I conjecture that the pricing kernel in
my model may help applied researchers in finance to explain other features of asset
pricing that I have not addressed here. My work suggests that it may be fruitful to
explore a class of pricing kernels in which the stochastic discount factor is modeled as a
rational polynomial in aggregate wealth. That assumption has testable implications
for other areas of empirical finance including foreign exchange markets, the term
structure of interest rates and the role of government asset purchases in influencing
the term premium.

                        Appendix A. Proof of Proposition 1

Proof. The worker and the retiree solve the following problems. First, recall the
following definitions of wealth, human wealth and the budget constraint of workers;


                                           =  + 1                                   (A1)
                                       = 1 +  [ 1 0 0 ]                           (A2)
                                                                 £      ¤

                                                                   2                  (A3)
Summing Equations (A2) and (A3) and using the identity, (A1), leads to the following
expression for the budget constraint of a worker, defined in terms of wealth, 
                                                           £       ¤
                     − 1 =  1  [0  0 ] + (1 −  1 )  0 00
                                                                2              (A4)

We have a similar expression for the budget constraint of a worker,

                                     2 − 2 =  2  [02 0 ]                         (A5)

Let  ( ) represent the value function of a worker and let  (2 ) be the value of
function of a retiree. These functions are defined as follows,

The fact that the expectations operator appears inside the value function distinguishes
these preferences from von-Neumann Morgenstern representations of expected utility
maximization.
  The unknown functions  ( ) and  (2 ) must satisfy the following envelope
conditions,

In addition, they must satisfy the three sets of Euler equations for the transfer of
wealth into the future,

These equations must hold state by state since, by assumption, there is a complete
set of Arrow securities.
  Since this is a logarithmic problem I will guess that the functions take the form

                    ( ) =  log ( )   () =  log ()                     (A13)

and I will verify this conjecture by finding values for the numbers  and  such that
equations (A8) — (A12) hold. By replacing the unknown functions  (·) and  (·)
with their conjectured functional forms from Equation (A13) we arrive at Equations
(A14) — (A18).

where terms without a prime are functions of  and terms with a prime are functions
of  0 . Notice, that equations (A16)-(A18) are identical for all states  0 . This follows
from risk neutrality and it is the property that allows me to construct a pricing kernel
in which consumption fluctuates across sunspot states in the presence of complete
markets.
  The two budget equations, (A4) and (A5) and the five first order conditions (A14)
                                                                             0
— (A18) constitute seven equations in the seven unknowns,  0 , 2  02  1 , 2 , 
and . We next solve these equations to find the values of the parameters  and 
in terms of the fundamental parameters   1 and  2 . First, from (A4), we have
                                                           £       ¤

substituting for  0  0 and 02 from (A14), (A16) and (A17) we have

To find a second equation in  and , we use the budget constraint of a retiree,
Equation (14)

Substituting (A24) into (A21) gives the solution for 

To establish that    we need to show that

which follows from the fact that  2  1. Using (A25), the decisions rules for con-
sumption of workers and retirees and the asset allocation rule for workers can be
represented by equations (A27),

          (1 −  1 ) (1 −  2 )                                            1 − 1

This establishes the form for equations (17) — (19) in Proposition 1.
  To establish indiﬀerence across asset allocations, notice that (A16) — (A18) are
independent of  0 . Substituting the consumption rules into equations (A16) and

                        Appendix B. Proof of Lemma 1

Proof. Using the decision rules, (17) and (19) and the definition of wealth, (11), we
obtain the following equations for the financial wealth of workers and retirees,

                                    1‘ = 1 −                                  (B1)

Since this is a closed economy with no government sector, asset market clearing and
goods market clearing give the following two equations linking 1 to 2 and 1 to 2

                                     1 + 2 = 0                                  (B3)

                                     1 + 2 = 1                                  (B4)
Combining equations (B1) — (B4), gives the expression we seek,
                                             −
                                     1 =                                         (B5)
                                             −
It follows from the definitions of  and  that  ≤  and Since 1 ∈ [0 1]  we must
have that  ∈ [ ] for the consumption of workers to be feasible. This gives the
domain of  (·) as  ≡ [ ]  The expression for 2 follows from the goods market
clearing condition, Equation (B3). The initial condition for  comes from combining
equations (23) and (B1) in period 0.                                                  ¤

                        Appendix C. Proof of Lemma 2

Proof. From the first order condition of a representative worker,

                                    [0 1 0 ] = 1                           (C1)

where 1 is the consumption of worker  at date  and 1 0 is the consumption of the
same worker at date  + 1 in state  0 . Aggregating this condition over all workers
alive at date  gives
                                    h       i
                                    0 ̃10 = 1                                (C2)

where 1 is the aggregate consumption of all workers at date  and ̃10 is the aggregate
consumption of all workers alive at date  who are still alive at date  + 1 There is a
measure 1 of these agents and their consumption, plus the consumption of newborns,
is equal to aggregate consumption of workers at date  + 1;

Here, 10 is consumption of all workers at date  + 1 and 1 0 is the consumption
of all new born agents at date  + 1. Replacing (C3) in (C2), using Equation (23),
reproduced below,
                                             −
                                   1 =  () ≡
                                             −
and the fact that there is a measure  of newborns who consume a fraction −1 of
aggregate human wealth,
                                      1 0 = −1 0                                (C4)
leads to the expression

                              [0 (2 0 − )] = 1 ( − )                        (C5)

where
                       1 =  1  and, 2 =  (1 − ) +                          (C6)
Since the allocation of assets across states is indeterminate, there are many possible
pricing kernels in this economy. Since the only restriction on 0 is that it satisfies
Equation (C5) it follows that the function  (·)  defined as
                                                   1 ( − )
                               0 =  ( 0 ) ≡              
                                                   2 0 − 
is a valid pricing kernel.                                                               ¤

                     Appendix D. Proof of Proposition 2

Proof. Equation (36) follows from multiplying the left side of Equation (29) by 0 and
taking expectations. Solving the resulting expression for 0 leads to the definition of
 (·). The function  (·) is found by substituting (36) into (26) and rearranging terms.
The fact that 0 is unbounded above follows from the fact that
                                                
                      lim  ( 0 ) =    =                ≡ 1                      (D1)
                      0
                      →∞              2   (1 − )  + 
Further, since 0    1, it follows that 1 is feasible;
                                    
                                             = 1   ∈                           (D2)
                              (1 − )  + 
These facts demonstrate that there is no upper bound on the set of feasible values
of 0 for any  ∈ ̄. To derive a conditional lower bound on 0 , note that  (·) is
decreasing in 0 for 0  ̄1 () where ̄1 () solves (40). For all values of 0 ≥ ̄1 (),
 ( 0 ) ∈ ̄ for all . Shocks smaller than 1 () can lead to infeasible values for
0 .                                                                                     ¤
