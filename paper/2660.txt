                         THE PENSION INDUCEMENT TO RETIRE:
                             AN OPTION VALUE ANALYSIS


                                  ABSTRACT
    The option value model developed in an earlier paper is used to simulate

the effect on retirement of changes in a firm's pension plan compared to the

effect of changes in Social Security provisions.    The provisions of the firm's

                                                                         on
pension plan have a much greater effect than Social Security regulations

the retirement decisions of the firm's employees.    The analysis supports the

following conclusions:


                                                            to 60, for example,
     •
         Increasing the firm's early retirement age from 55

         would reduce by almost 40 percent, from .48 to .30, the fraction of

         employees that is retired by age 60.

     •   The effect of changes in Social Security rules, on the other hand,

         would be small.   Raising the Social Security retirement ages by one

         year, for example, has very little effect on employee retirement rates.

         The proportion retired by age 62 is reduced by only about 4 percent.

     •
         Changes in Social Security provisions that would otherwise encourage

         workers to continue workfng can easily be offset by countervailing

         changes in the provisions of the firm's pension plan.   Firm responses,

         like delaying the Social Security offset to correspond to m later

         Social Security retirement age, may simply be m logical revision of

         current firm plan provisions.

      The labor force participation rates of older workers have declined

dramatically in recent years.       The data for men show the trend:

introduced rapidly beginning In the 1950s.            Now about 50 percent of employees

are covered by firm plans.        The proportion of retiring workers that is covered

retirement. The amount is typically determined by final salary and years of

firm employment. Bulow [1981] described pension wealth accrual under rhese

plans and Lazear [1983] emphasized the porential role of plan provisions in

inducing early rerirement, as a suhsriture for mandatory rerirement. The very

substanrial incentive effects of these plans have been emphasized most

recently by Kotlikoff and Wise [1985, 1987, 1988], who summarize the

incentives of approximately 2500 plans covered by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics Level of Benefits Survey,    and consider in great detail the effects

of the provisions of a large Fortune 500 firm.    This work demonstrates that

the typical firm plan provides a large reward for remaining with the firm

until some age, often the early retirement age, and then a substantial

inducement to leave the firm, often as early as 55.    Almost all plans

incorporate a large penalty for working past age 65.    The gain in wage

earnings from working an additional year is often offset in large part by a

loss in the present value of future pension benefits.

     There has been very little analysis of the actual effects of these

incentives on retirement, however.     Exceptions are Burkhauser [1979], Fields

and Mitchell [1982], Lazear [1983], Kotlikoff and Wise [1987], and Hogarth

[1988].   One reason for the limited attention has been the absence of

appropriate data.   The analysis in this paper is based on the personnel

records of a large Fortune 500 firm.    The firm pension plan was described in

detail by Kotlikoff and Wise [1987], who also related the plan provisions to

departure rates from the firm.

     The goal of this paper is to quantify the effects of pension plan

provisions on departure rates from the firm and, in particular, to demonstrate

the effect of potential changes in plan provisions. A particularly important

component of the analysis is to demonstrate the relative effects of changes in
                                             (3)

               intended to prolong the labor force participation of the elderly,
               like the planned increase in the retirement age, may be offset by
               the response of firms to the change.



     We begin in section    I   with a description of the incentive effects faced

by workers in the firm.     The description of the incentive effects is also used

to motivate our method of analysis.         The option value model is summarized in

section II.     Parameter estimates are presented in section III and the model

fir is emphasized.     It is shown that the model capturea extremely well the

several discontinuous jumps in firm departure rates caused by pension plan and

Social Security provisions. An out of sample test of the predictive validity

of the model is also presented.         Simulations of the effect on departure rares

of changes in fitm pension plan and in Social Security provisions ate

discussed in section IV.        A   suzmsary and concluding discussion is in the last

section.



I.   The Firm Pension Plan and Retirement Incentives


     The analysis in this paper is based on salesmen who are at least 50 yeara

old and have been employed for at least three years.1          To understand the

effect of the pension plan provisions, consider several figures.       Figure 1
shows the expected future coapensation of a person from our ssmple who is 50

years old and has been employed by rhe firm for 20 years.2       It is importsnt to

consider total compensation--including wage earnings,      the accrual of pension

benefits, and the accrual of Social Security benefits.      As compensation for

working another year the employee receives salary earnings.       He also receives

compensation in the form of future pension benefits.      The annual compensation

in this form    is the change in the present value of future pension benefits,

due to working an additional year.       This accrual is comparable to wage

earnings.     The accrual of Social Security benefits may also be calculated in a

similar manner, and is also comparable to wage earnings.       Figure 1 shows the

present value at age 50 of expected future compensation in all three forms.

The line labelled earnings represents cumulated earnings, by age of

retirement.3       For example, if the person were to retire at age 62, his

cumulated earnings between age SO and age 62, discounted to age 50 dollars

would be about $300,000.      The slope of the earnings line represents annual

earnings discounted to age 50 dollars. Earnings decline rather slowly through

age 60 and much more rapidly thereafter.

     The solid line shows the accrual of firm pension plus Social Security

benefits, again discounted to age 50 dollars.      The shape of this profile is

determined primarily by the pension plan provisions. The most important




     2For convenience, the graphs assume a 5 percent real discount rate and
zero inflation. In the empirical model that is estimated, the discount rate
is estimated and the inflation rate is assumed to be S percent.

     3Departure from the firm would be a more accurate description than
retirement, because for some employees the alternative to continued employment
at the firm   is
               likely to be another job, rather than retirement.

provisions are described here.4          An employee could leave   the fira at age 53,

for example.    If he were to do that, and if he were vested in the firm's

pension plan- - which occurs after 10 years of service- -he would he entitled to

normal retirement pension benefits at age 65, based on his years of service

and current dollar earnings at age 53.            He could start to receive benefits as

early as age 55, the penaion early retirement age, but the benefit amount

would be reduced actuarially.           If he started to receive benefits at age 55,

they would be only 36 percent of dollar amount he would receive at age 65.

If, however,   he were to remain in the firm until the early retirement age, the

situation would be quite different.           He would be entitled to normal retirement

benefits based on his years of service and salary at age 55.            But,   if he were

to start to receive them at age 55, the benefits would be reduced less than

actuarially, about   3   percent for each year that retirement precedes age 65,
instead of 6 or 7 percent.         In addition, the plan baa a Social Security offset

provision.    Pension benefits are offset by a specified amount,         depending on

the firm estimate of Social Security benefits.           But if the person takes early

retirement, between 55 and 65, the Social Security offset is not applied to

benefits received before age 65.          These two provisions create the large

discontinuous jump in retirement benefits at age 55; there is an enormous

bonus for remaining with the firm until that age.           After age 55, however, the

person who does not retire foregoes the opportunity of taking pension benefita

on very advantageous     terms.     Thus the minimal change in the discounted value

of benefits between 55 and        60.   If,   a person has 30 years of aervice at age

60,   he is entitled to full normal retirement benefits.         No early retirement




      4full details of the plan provisions are presented in Kotlikoff and Wise
[1987].
                                            (9)

reduction is applied to benefits if they are taken then.        That is, by

continuing to work he will no longer gain from fewer years of early retirement

reduction, as he did before age 60.        Thus the kink in the profile and the

decline thereafter.

        The top line shows total compensation.     The large jump at 55 reflects the

early retirement provisions of the pension plan.        Total compensation declines

modestly each year through age 60 and very rapidly thereafter.        After age 62

or 63, total compensation is close to zero.        Under these circumstances, it

would be surprising if this person were to continue to work until age 65.

        The graph can also be used to motivate the option value model used in the

subsequent analysis. Suppose that the person depicted in figure 1 is

considering whether to retire now, at age 50.        If he does he will receive

utility indirectly from the retirement benefits that he will receive until he

dies.    (In fact, he will not be able to receive firm pension benefits until

age 55 and Social Security benefits can not be taken until sge 62.)          If he
leaves the firm at age 50, though, he foregoes the option of retiring at some

future age.    In this case, there will be a large increase in
                                                               pension benefits
at age 55, and thus a jump in total lifetime income,       if he postpones

retirement until then,      Some later age may be even more advantageous.     In

particular, if he does not     retire,   he maintains the option of retiring at the

future age that for him yields the highest expected utility.        The central

feature of the option value model is that the person will
                                                          postpone retirement
at age 50   if, based   on his expectations at age 50, the best of   the future

possibilities is better than retiring now.        That is he postpones retirement if
the value of the    option to retire later exceeds the value of retiring today.

At each subsequent age, he will make the same                   At some age, future
                                              comparison.

retirement possibilities will look worse thsn immediate retirement and

leave the firm.

     It is clear that the early retirement provisions in this firm are likely

to have an important effect on retirement decisions.   The qualitative effect

of changing the early retirement age can be seen by comparing figures 1 and      2.


       2 describes the expectations of the same person considered
                                                                  in figure      1,
Figure
                                          has been shifted from 55 to 60, with
except that the firm early retirement age

all other plan provisions remaining unchanged.    It is apparent that the person

would under these provisions be much less likely to retire before age 60.

Estimates of the actual effects of such a change are presented below.

     To calculate the amounts graphed in figures 1 and 2, future income is

discounted at a 5 percent real interest rate, and, no distinction is made

between individual valuation of wage earnings versus pension benefits.      To

                                          values are not these, but rather the
predict retirement, however, the relevant

discounted value of future utilities based on rhe weights that individuals

                                               whether to retire.    Such values
assign to future income streams in determining

are estimated in the subsequent analysis.    As it turns out, the estimated

discount factor is much higher than 5 percent, and individuals value a dollar

of retirement benefits much more than a dollar of wage earnings; a dollar

without work is better than a dollar with work.    Based on our parameter

                                                                would look
estimates, the graph, from the point of view of the individual,

like figure 3 instead of figure 1.   Based on these valuations of future income

streams, the person depicted in figure 1 would be much more likely to retire

before age 60 say, than is in fact suggested by figure 1.

     Persons of the same age face very different options depending on years of

service and earnings histories.   A comparison of figures 1 and 4 demonstrates

 this point.   The person whose expected future options are shown in figure 4
                                          (11)

has only three years of service when he is 50 years old.           He will not have 30

years of service until he is 77.      He will not be vested until he is         57.


Compared to the person in figure 1, this person would apparently be much less

likely to retire before age 65.

      Finally, consider a person who is still working at age 58 in 1980.               He

has 18 years of service.    His expected future options are shown in figure 5.

                                                          the next 10 years,
Alrhough his wage earnings will decrease only slightly in

the present value of retirement benefits will decline almost continuously.

The graph suggests that retirement would be likely around 63 or 64.              It was

clear from a comparison of figures 1 and         2   that changing the firm early

retirement age from 55 to 60 would have a substantial effect on retirement.

The potential effect of changes in Social Security provisions can be seen by

altering the options faced by the person described in figure 5.              The current

Social Security rules reduce benefits by 5/9 of a percent for each month that

benefits are taken before age 65.       Suppose that the reduction were 1 percent

per month instead of 5/9.      The effect on the options faced by the figure 5

person are shown in figure     6.   The effect is noticeable, but not extreme.           The

value of retirement benefits before age 65 has been shifted downward, and thus

total income associated with retirement before age 65 has been shifted down.

The result would apparently be a lower likelihood of retirement between 62 and

65, judging   by the change in the graph. Actual estimates of the effect of
such a change in Social Security provisions are presented below.



II.   The OptiQn Value Model


      The details of the option value model are set forth in this section.

Antecedents for the model begin with Lazear and Moore [1988]          ,   who argue   that
                                                       (12)

the option value of postponing retirement is the appropriate variable to enter

in a regression equation explaining retirement. Indeed, it was their work,

and analysis of military retirement rates by Phillips and Wise [1987],                                    that

motivated us to pursue this approach.                   Our model is also cloae in apirit to

the much more complicated dynamic programming model of Rust [1988]                                 .    A dynamic

programming     model of employment behavior has also been proposed by Berkovec

and Stern [1988].

        To begin, consider rhe expected gain at age t from postponing retirement

to age r.      We denote it by



                     —
(1)           G(r)         EV(r)   -
                                       EtVt(t)

where              is the expected value from working through age r-l and retiring
        EV(r)
at age r, and EtVt(t) is the expected value associated with current

retirement,      Suppose that r* is the value of r that maximizes (1)                          .       The person

postpones     retirement     at age t    if   Gt(r*)     >    0.   That is,



(2)           Postpone retirement if Gt(r*) —                 EtVt(r*)     -
                                                                               EtVt(t)   > 0



If Ct(r*) < 0, the person retires at age t.                        Thus
                                                                          G(r) is the retirement
decision function.

      The value function V depends on future earnings and on firm pension and

Social Security benefits after retirement, More precisely, V depends on the

indirect utility from future earnings and retirement benefits.                             It is

described by



(3)         V(r) —         XLfl5tUw(Ys)       + X_rfl5ttjr(.Bs('))
                                        (13)




If the person continues to work, his wage earnings in year         s    are given by Y5

and the indirect utility from these earnings by Uw(Ys)           The weight assigned

to future utility, in the determination of the retirement decision, is             fi.          If
he retires in year r, he will receive retirement benefits       in subsequent
                                                          B5(r)

years s, which he values according to the function Ur(Bs(r)).            As explained

above,   a person's retireent benefits will depend on his age and years of

service at the time of retirement r, as well as his earnings history: thus the

notation indicating that       is a function of r.    (We adopt the convention that

if s is the first calendar year during which the person has no wage earnings,

he is assumed    to have retired at the age that   he was on January 1 of year              s.)

      The two utility functions are specified as



           U(Y) —       ÷

(4)


           Ur(B) — (kB5(r))7   +



where      and    are individual-specific random effects.        The parameter k is to

recognize the possibility that a dollar with leisure      -   - while   retired   -   -    is
better than a dollar that is only had together with work.          The random terms

reflect a variety of unobserved differences smong individuals.            The values

thet individuals attach to wage and pension income may differ.            Some persons

may enjoy work more rhsn others: some may enjoy retirement more than others.

Both may be affected by health status, for example.       Retirement decisions sre

likely to be affected by assets, other than pension wealth, which we do not

measure.   Such differences will be reflected in different values of E.                   In
addition, we consider retirement to be the alternative to continued employment
                                                     (14)

with the firm.           For some, especially the younger persons in the sample            the

alternative may well be another job.                  The utility of the alternative to work

in such cases will presumably be greater than the utility represented by

Ur(Zs) for the typical person.                  These differences too will be reflected in

different values of E.              (The heteroskedsstic error structure that the model

implies, as explained below, is well suited to capture the effects of

alternatives other than retirement, with the likelihood of such an alternative

greatest for younger employees.)

      Differences in preferences for work versus retirement, differences in

health status, and other individual differences are likely to persist.                    Thus

these terms are assumed to follow a random walk over tiae.                  That is,



                    —                                 —
              us        w51 +         ,

future forecasts of          is   and e   are   based on (5).   The randoa walk assumption

means, for example, that if a person's health status worsens between periods t

and t+l, his expected health status in period t+2 is not what it was in period

t, but rather what it was             in period     t+l.

      With the substitution of the specifications (3) and (4),                G(r)     may be

decomposed into two terms, one depending on the individual-specific random

terms         and         and the other depending only on measured variables.           We have

that yield the present value in year t of the future expected values of the

random components of utility.                      The further r is in the future, the larger is

K(r).         That      is,       the more distant the potential retirement age, the greater

the uncertainty about it.                     This yields a heteroskedastic disturbance term.

        In short, C(r) may be written simply as


(10)              G(r)        —
                                  g(r) + Kt(r)vt
        The probability of retirement is easily described using this expression.

If the person is to retire in year t,
                                      G(r) must be less than zero for every
potential retirement age r in the future.                                 If rt is the r that yields the

maximum value of
                              g(r)/K(r), the probability of retirement becomes

     In fact, we are able to follow persons in the sample for 5 consecutive

years.     The analysis in this paper, however, is based only on data for one

year.     Retirement probabilities for several years may be derived as a simple

extension of (11);         they are shown in Stock and Wise [1988],      together with

estimates based on several consecutive years for each person.5



III. Parametet Estimates and The Model Fit



     Evaluation of g(r)/K(r) requires estimates of future earnings.

Individual earnings forecasts are based on a second order autoregression that

                                                                     for past
recognizes individual differences in earnings potential and accounts

evidence of earnings increases.               The autoregression was estimated using the

individual earnings histories of all salesmen employed at least three years,

with earnings converted to 1980 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.                  The

                                                         of service, and an
parameters of the forecasting model depend on age, years

interaction term.6

         The option value model parameter estimates and standard errors are:7



                               k                          oNtO5)        I

               (0.07)       (0.02)       (0.032)          (0.001)




     51n fact, the estimates based on several years are very close to those
                                                                     is only
reported here. Implementation using two or more consecutive years
slightly more complicated than the exposition here, with 115
                                                             —      +      €5     €,
i.i.d. N(0,o),     i.i.d. 5(0,02), where
                       w                     and      s—tn       are

independent. The covsriance between      and 11T+l is var(v), and the variance
of    for r       t
                is a +            (See Stock and Wise [1988].)
                                   (r-t)o6.
         6For more detail see Stock and Wise [1988].

     7The estimates were obtained by maximum likelihood, using 1500
observations.
                                          (18)




All of the parameters are measured quite precisely, with the possible

exception of the weight $.     The estimated y      of    1 means that the value function

V   is linear in income.   This evidence rejects s log-linear value function, for

example.   The estimated value of k means that a dollar without work is worth

1.66 times a dollar gotten   by working.       In other words, the typical person

would be willing to exchange a dollar with work for 60 ceots without work.

This suggests, loosely interpreted, that retirement benefits that replaced 60

percent of wage earnings would make a person indifferent between work and

retirement.    In the retirement   decision,     the estimated weight given to income

one yemr in the future versus now is .847; income five years hence is given

about half as much weight ma income today.          The variance term          $11,900,
                                                                        a1,,

should be interpreted relative to the present value of future income.              Typical

values are indicated by the graphs at the beginning of the paper.

      The model fits the data very well.         First,   consider three likelihood

valuea:


                           Prediction Method                                   £

           Using the sample average retirement probability               -579.6
           Using average probability for each age                        -477.9
           Using the model estimates                                     -397.7


Comparison of the aecond and third values shows that retirement probabilities

based on the model fit the data much better than predictions that would be

obtained by using a dummy variable for each age.            One might assume that using

the sample average retirement rate for each age would provide very good

predictiona.   But what the comparison reflects ia that retirement

probabilities vary a great deal among peraons of the same age.            That this was

likely to be true was evident from the graphs at the beginning of the paper.
                                               (19)


In addition, the probabilities for any age group depend strongly on discounted

future income streams, as cumulated in the model.                Thus the model with only

four parameters performs better than a model with 17 age dummy variables that
                                                                    of the
ignores differences in expected future income streams among persons

same age.         Unlike other models of retirement, age enters the option value

model only indirectly        --
                                  through the survival probabilities, the earnings

forecasts, and the firm pension plan and Social Security rules.

       Another way to understand the model fit is to compare actual versus

predicted retirement rates.           These are shown in table 1 and in figure 7.

There are large jumps in the actual retirement rates at specific ages:                55,


60,   and 62.       All are matched very closely by the model predictions.        Both the

actual and predicted rates are          8   percent at age 55.     One is 22, the other 19

at age 60.         One is 46, the other 65 at age 62.      Beyond age 64 the sample sizes

are too small to make reliable comparisons. The proportion of those in the

firm at age SO that would remain at age 54, based on actual retirement rates,

is .14; the predicted proportion is .12.              This suggests that even though

measured variables may often not evaluate correctly the alternative to

continued work in the firm for younger employees, the error specification

allows enough flexibility that the model predictions are still quite accurate.

At older ages, the model predicts almost precisely the proportion of employees

who have left the firm,           as shown in figure 7.

        We have also used the model to predict retirement rates in 1981 for

persons in the sample who did not retire in 1980,                The results are shown in

table 2.          The interesting feature of this comperison is that retirement rates

at    59,   60,    and 61 were considerably higher in 1981 then in 1980.        Nonetheless,

the model matches the actual rates very closely.              Presumably the dliferent

retirement rates were due to different predictions about future earnings in

the firm that the model captures, or to differences in the distribution of


employees by age and years of service,     that also enter the model calculations.

From the earnings regression, it is evident that future earnings prospects

changed significantly from one year to the next.      The model underestimates a

bit the departure racss of persons under 55.      Again, the model predictions are

much better than predictions based on age-specific retirement rates,         as shown

by the following likelihood values:

IV.     Simulations of the Effects of Changes in Pension and SS Provisions


       We have used the model    to simulate the effect   of several potential

changes in the firm pension plan and in Social Security provisions.          We

conclude that potential changes in the firm pension plan have a much greater

effect on retirement rates than changes in Social Security rules.          Four

changes are considered:


        A.   Increase the Firm Early Retirement Are from 55 to 60

        The effect of increasing the firm's early retirement age from 55 to 60,

                                                                     and is graphed in
leaving other provisions as they were, is shown in table        3,


figure 8.      Under the current plan 48 percent of those employed at 50 have left

by    59.    only 30 percent would have left by age 59 if early retirement had been

at 60 instead of 55.       Only 11.5 percent of employees leave between 55 and 59

if early retirement is at 60, whereas 36.7 peccant leave between these ages

under the current system.       On the other hand, because the early retirement

"bonus" is now farther in the future, more employees leave the firm between 50

and 54.    This is the result of the greater weight given to current versus

future income.    In short, many more workers would be employed between the ages

of 37 and 65 if the early retirement age were 60 instead of 33.


      B.   Increase the SS Early Retirement Reduction Factor

      The current Social Security rules include s benefit reduction of 5/9

percent per month of retirement before age 65.               We consider the effect of

increasing the reduction factor to 1 percent per month.               The results are shown

in table 4 and graphically in figure            9.     It is clear that the effect of this

change is small relative to the effect of the change in the firm early

retirement age.     This is primarily because only a small fraction of firm

employees are still working at age 62, only 18 percent in the base case.                 The

retirement rates of those still employed at age 62, however, are considerably

lower -- about 21 percent      -   -   with   the higher reduction factor.    They are also

lower at 63.     Still,   the net result on the employment of persons covered by

the firm's pension plan is negligible.


      C.   Increase the SS Retirement Area by One Year

      Current plans are to increase the Social Security retirement age from 65

to 67 by 2027.     To judge the effect of much a change on workers with pension

plans like the one in our firm, we simulate the effect of increasing the

normal retirement age from 63 to 66 and the early retirement age from 62 to

63.   The results are in table S and in figure 10.               Again, the effect on the

retirement rates of persona in our firm is small.                This is true even though

the effect on the annual retirement rates of 62 and 65 year oldm is

substantial.     The retirement rate of 62-year-oids is reduced from 44.7 to 33.2

percent.   The rate at 65 is reduced from 46.8 to 40.2.   But only a few workera

remain in the firm to be affected by these changes.


      0. Increase SS Retirement Ages   by One Year and Start the SS Offset at 66

      If the Social Security retirement age were increased to 66, the firm

                                                                    of 65.
might be expected to begin the Social Security offset at 66 instead

Thus we have simulated che effect of increasing the Social Security retirement

ages by one year   g4 beginning   the Social Security offset to the firm pension

benefits at 66 instead of 65.     The result is reported in table 6 and ahown

graphically in figure 11.    Increasing the Social Security retirement ages

reduced retireaent rates by a small amount, as shown in table 5.     But even

these small effects would essentially be counteracted if the firm were to

                                                          offset.    For
respond by delaying the imposition of the Social Security

example, increasing the Social Security retirement ages reduced the retirement

rate at age 62 by .115; the reduction is only .030 if the Social Security

action is accompanied by the firm response that we have simulated.



IV.   Summary and Concluding Comments


      The option value model developed in Stock and Wise [1988] has been used

to simulate the effects on retirement of changes in a firm's pension plan and

of changes in Social Security rules.     Several important conclusions are

supported by the analysis:


           •   The provisions of the firm's pension plan have a much greater
               effect than Social Security regulations on the retirement
               decisions of the firm's employees.

                                                                55 to 60, for
           •
               Increasing the firm's early retirement age from
               example, would reduce by almost 40 percent, from .48 to .30, the
               fraction of employees that is retired by age 60.

          •   The effect of changes in Social Security rules, on the other hand,
              would be small. Raising the Social Security retirement ages by
              one year, for example, has very little effect on employee
              retirement rates. The proportion retired by age 62 is reduced by
              only about 4 percent.
          •
              Changes in Social Security provisiona that would otherwise
              encourage workers to continue working can easily be offset by
              countervailing changes in the provisions of the firm's pension
              plan. Firm responses, like delaying the Social Security offset to
              correspond to a later Social Security retirement age, may siaply
              be a logical revision of current firm plan provisioos.


Thus in considering the effect of changes in Social Security rules,   like the

retirement age, it is important to understsnd the implications of private

pension plan provisions.    In particular, if rhe effect on retirement decisions

of changes in Social Security rules is to be predicted the potential response

of firms to the changes cannot be   ignored.

     Although the analysis is based on the retirement experience in a single

large firm, the firm's pension plan is typical of defined benefit plans.

Approximately 75 percent of the employees who are covered by a firm pension

have defined benefit plans.    Thus the results suggest that pension plans in

general have had a very substantial effect on the labor force participation

rates of older workers.

     In addition to the simulations, the paper describes the option value

model of retirement.    Comparisons of actual versus predicted retirement rates

demonstrate that the model predicts very complicated retirement patterns with

considerable precision.    That the model fits observed data well increases our

confidence in the simulated results.
