                                              ABSTRACT

While openness to trade is a well-recognized hallmark of many successful emerging market economies
known as “growth miracles,” another component of the growth model is a leapfrogging strategy –
the use of policies to guide the industrial structural transformation ahead of a country's factor endowment.
Does the leapfrogging strategy work? Opinions vary but the evidence is scarce in part because it is
more difficult to measure the degree of leapfrogging than the extent of trade openness. We undertake
a systematic look at the evidence across countries to assess the efficacy of such a strategy. So far, there
is no strong and robust evidence that this strategy works reliably. Future research can explore a number
of refinements.

1. Introduction

    All countries want to grow fast on a sustained basis. In East Asia, for example, many
economies excel in this area. Following Japan after World War II, the “four little dragons” –
Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong – are by now familiar success stories. Many more
economies in the region, including Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, quickly followed,
achieving higher growth rates than most other developing countries that had a comparable level
of development in the 1960s. Since 2000, China, India and Vietnam are the new “growth
miracles” – achieving the same high growth rates as their neighbors for 2-3 decades in a row.1
Naturally, this record invites admiration and scrutiny. What is the Asian growth model? Is it
something that can be transplanted to Latin America, Africa, or elsewhere, and have the same
magic effect?
    While the growth records of these economies are (almost) uncontroversial, what is
responsible for the growth results is subject to debate. At the risk of over-simplification, we
suggest that two aspects of these economies’ growth model merit particular attention. First,
almost all high-growing emerging market economies since the 1970s embrace trade openness.
Trade barriers are taken down or progressively reduced either at the start of the growth process
or not long after the start of the process. Trade liberalization doesn’t have to take the narrow
form of reducing tariff rates on imported goods, although that is often part of the process. It can
take the form of de-monopolizing and de-licensing. While the right to import and export used to
be concentrated in a small number of firms by government regulations, trade liberalization
broadens the set of firms that could directly participate in international trade. Even holding tariff
rates constant, such “democratization” of trading rights could dramatically increase a country’s
trade openness. This was a significant part of the Chinese trade liberalization in the 1980s. Trade
liberalization can also come in conjunction with reducing entry barriers or offering incentives for
foreign firms to jump start the domestic export industry. This may be particularly important for
those countries that have been isolated from the world market for a while. Sometimes, the Asian
model is called an “outward-oriented strategy.” This is not very accurate since many Asian

1
  Myanmar (Burma) also consistently has reported double-digit real GDP growth rates every year since 2001, but
international financial institutions and other observers appear to be somewhat skeptical about the reliability of the
statistics. Chinese official growth rates are sometimes challenged for their veracity, although most scholars,
economists of major international investment banks, and international financial institutions take the view that the
officially released figures are reliable. (Or, if there is a bias, the bias could be either positive or negative.)

                                                           1
economies do not simultaneously embrace capital account openness, at least not by the same
degree in the areas of cross-border portfolio equity and portfolio debt flows.
   The second aspect of the growth model is the use of government policies to promote high-
tech and high domestic value-added industries, presumably beyond what the economies would
naturally develop if left to their own devices. This aspect may be labeled as a leapfrogging
strategy. China, Singapore, and Malaysia all have various aggressive policies to promote certain
high value added sectors. Other countries in the region do not wish to fall behind. For example,
Philippines’ National Information Technology Council announced in 1997: “Within the first
decade of the 21st Century, the Philippines will be a knowledge center in the Asia Pacific region:
the leader in IT education, in IT-assisted training, and in the application of information and
knowledge to business, professional services, and the arts.”
   Are these two aspects responsible for the growth success? The first aspect – the role of trade
openness in economic growth – has been subject to extensive (and intensive) scholarly scrutiny.
While there is notable skepticism (Rodriguez and Rodrik, 2000), most economists read the
evidence as suggesting that trade openness does help to promote economic growth. Following
and extending the work by Frankel and Romer (1999), Feyrer (2009), in a recent paper that pays
attention to sorting out causality from correlation, again shows that greater trade openness
causally leads to a rise in income. Using changes in infant mortality and life expectancy as an
alternative measure of well-being, Wei and Wu (2004) present evidence that trade openness
helps to improve social welfare by reducing infant mortality and raising life expectancy to a
degree beyond raising per capita income. Based on an overwhelming amount of evidence, we
lean strongly toward believing that trade openness has played a key role in the success stories in
Asia, and indeed in most high and sustained growth episodes in the world.
   How about the second aspect of the growth model? Has a leapfrogging strategy played a key
role as well? In comparison to the trade openness issue, there is far less scholarly work on the
effectiveness of a leapfrogging strategy. In theory, if the production of sophisticated goods
generates positive externalities via learning-by-doing, then there generally would be an under-
investment among private economic agents relative to the socially optimal level. A leapfrogging
strategy – a government-led industrial policy that tilts resource allocation to technologically
sophisticated industries – could correct this market failure. The natural inference from this
argument suggests that a country may benefit more from exporting sophisticated products than

                                                 2
from exporting unsophisticated and low domestic value-added products, even if its comparative
advantage in the current time is to produce the latter type of goods. Recent academic studies
have reported evidence supporting such comparative advantage-defying development strategy.
In Hausman, Hwang, and Rodrik (2007) (henceforth, abbreviated as HHR), the authors suggest
that some export goods have higher spillover effects than others. They develop a measure of
export sophistication and find that a positive relationship exists between their measure and the
country’s subsequent economic growth rate. However, there is no shortage of skepticism toward
the leapfrogging growth strategy. On one hand, one might question the size of any such market
failure in the real world if there is one. On the other hand, one might wonder whether the
existence of a “government failure,” if it were to pursue a leapfrogging strategy, could
overwhelm whatever benefits a country may derive from correcting the market failure. In a series
of papers, including Lin (2009), the World Bank chief economist Justin Lin advocates strongly
for development strategies that follow a country’s comparative advantage, and against what he
calls “comparative advantage defying strategies” which include a leapfrogging industrial policy.
(At the same time, Lin is open to the idea of a government role in helping private firms to find
“latent comparative advantage” (Lin, 2010).)
           In this paper, we aim to test the validity of the leapfrogging hypothesis with fresh
evidence from a cross-country data set. One bottleneck in testing this hypothesis is to identify
which countries (regions) engage in such a growth strategy.2 We employ four different measures
including a new indicator that is based on the proportion of identifiable high-tech products in a
country’s exports.
           Overall, it is difficult to find strong and robust evidence that a leapfrogging strategy
contributes to a higher growth rate. In other words, the empirical investigation does not support
the contention that a government intervention that is aimed at raising a country’s technological
sophistication beyond what is expected of its level of development could produce a better growth
result on a sustained basis.
           There are important caveats for our approach that should be borne in mind when
interpreting the results. Our measures of a country’s leapfrogging strategy are based on its export
data. To the extent that a country’s export structure may not accurately capture its production
structure, we may have missed some true leapfrogging strategies. In addition, the efficacy of a

2
    Literature review of previous tests of the hypothesis will be added in the next revision.

                                                              3
leapfrogging strategy could be more subtle than what is being tested in this paper. For example,
it is conceptually possible that only when several policy instruments are implemented as a
package can the positive effect of a leapfrogging strategy be detected. Because of these
qualifications, we view the current paper as a stepping stone toward a more comprehensive
examination of the leapfrogging strategy.
       The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our measures of leapfrogging.
Section 3 examines the empirical connections between technological leapfrogging and economic
growth rate. Section 4 concludes.


2. Statistical Specification and Leapfrogging Measurement


       A key to this exercise is to assess whether a country pursues a leapfrogging strategy, and,
if it does, what the degree of leapfrogging is. Ideally, we would want to compare a country’s
actual production structure with what would have been predicted based on its factor endowment.
There are two challenges. First, data on production structure by an internationally comparable
classification are not available for most countries, especially developing countries for which
evaluating the efficacy of a leapfrogging strategy is most pertinent. Second, even when
internationally comparable production data are available, one gets only a relatively coarse
classification, with less than 100 sectors. Many differences in the economic structure do not
reveal themselves at such an aggregate level. For example, many countries have electronics
industries, but different types of electronic products may have very different levels of skill
content. We address these challenges by looking at trade data instead. Generally speaking, a
country’s export structure closely resembles its production structure. Trade data are available for
a much larger set of economies (over 250 in the WITS database). At the most detailed and still
internationally comparable level (Harmonized System 6-digit, there are over 5000 products a
country can export (or import). To control for the “normal” amount of sophistication based on a
country’s factor endowment, we include a country’s income and education levels as controls in a
growth regression framework.
   In the rest of the section, we first review two existing measures of export sophistication in the
literature, and propose two additional measures that may address some shortcomings of the
existing measures. We then describe the data that we use to implement the measures. Finally, we

                                                  4
conduct some simple “smell checks” to see how well these measures capture those countries that
are commonly reported as having a leapfrogging industrial policy.


2.1 Regression specification
       We consider a growth regression specification of the following type:


        LnGDPcit +k − LnGDPcit = α 0 + α1 LnGDPcit + α 2 ExpSophisit + X it Γ + ωit            (1)


The left-hand-side variable measures the growth rate for country i from year t to year t+k. In
most cases, we examine the growth performance from 1992 to 2003. LnGDPcit denotes the
natural log of per capita GDP for country i in year t, ExpSophisit denotes the level of economic
sophistication measured using trade data, and Xit is a vector of other control variables.
Coefficient α2 measures the impact of leapfrogging policies.


2.2 Measures of a country’s industrial sophistication based on export data
   While it is difficult to directly measure a country’s industrial sophistication, in part because
the standard industrial classification is too coarse for this purpose, the existing literature has
considered proxies based on the data on a country’s export bundles. The idea is that, leaving
aside non-tradable goods, the structure of the export bundle should mimic that of production.
One measure is the level of income implied in the export bundle, introduced in Hausmann,
Hwang, and Rodrik (2007). This measure builds on the concept that the degree of sophistication
in a country’s exports can be inferred by the income level of each good’s exporter. The second
measure is the Export Dissimilarity Index (EDI), introduced by Schott (2007) and adopted by
Wang and Wei (2010), which gauges the distance between a country’s export structure and that
of high-income economies such as Japan, the U.S. and the European Union (EU15). Both
measures assume that higher income countries, on average, produce more sophisticated products.
One can avoid making this arbitrary assumption, and focus on the degree of technological
sophistication of the product itself, based on a classification of high-tech “advanced technology
products” (ATP) that comes from the OECD and the United States.




                                                   5
Income implied in a country’s export bundle (EXPY)
        This indicator of export sophistication is a measure of the typical income associated with
a given country’s export basket. For every good, one can compute the “typical income”
(PRODY) of the countries that export the good, or the weighted average of the income levels
across the exporters of this good, with weights proportional to the value of the exports by
countries. For any given exporter, one can look at its export basket and compute the weighted
average of the typical income levels across all products in the basket, with the weights
proportional to the value of each good in the basket. The key underlying assumption here is that
advanced countries produce more sophisticated goods and poorer countries produce less
sophisticated goods.

         PRODYi = ∑k

                             j



        EXPYk = ∑ sik • PRODYi                                                                (2)

Where sik is the share of country k’s exports in product i,Yk is country k’s per capita GDP. Table
1 displays the summary statistics for the EXPY over the time period 1992-2006.
        There are two major merits of this index. First, it does not require one to tediously sift
through and classify goods as “sophisticated goods” or “high tech products.” Second, it can be
computed easily with data in trade flows and GDP per capita. But it also has several
weaknesses. First, the key assumption underlying PRODY, that more advanced countries
produce sophisticated goods, may not be true. Advanced countries often produce a larger set of
goods than poor countries. Furthermore, larger countries also produce a larger set of goods than
smaller countries. These features suggest that the PRODY index may over-weight advanced and
large countries. Second, the index may conceal diversity in the quality and type of goods in finer
details within a product category. Third, the index fails to capture processing trade, where a
country imports sophisticated product parts to produce the final sophisticated product. This is
the case in China, where a significant share of sophisticated exports is based on processing trade.
Given the weaknesses of the EXPY index, we construct the following index in hopes of avoiding
some of its pitfalls.




                                                  6
Unit value adjusted implied income in the export bundle - Modified EXPY
        In this modified version of the EXPY index, we discount the PRODY of each good by
the ratio of the unit value of the exporter to the mean unit value of the same goods in G3 (The
United States, Great Britain, and Germany) countries.


                                   s ik        v
        PRODYi = ∑k
                              n
                                        • Yk • ik                                                (3)
                                  ∑ sij
                                      j
                                              viG 3

The modified EXPY is computed similarly as in the original EXPY index in equation (2).
        The motivation of this modification is our belief that the unit value data adds an
additional layer of differentiation among goods of different quality or varieties. This can take
account of the diversity within the 6-digit HS category. The assumption behind this modification
is that unit value is a proxy for quality, and the G3 countries export higher quality goods.
        Since we only have unit value of products at the 6-digit HS level across the world for
2005, we apply the same unit value discount factor to the PRODY during our whole sample
period. Table 2 shows the summary statistics of this modified EXPY.


Distance to the export bundle by high-income countries
       We define an index for a lack of sophistication by the dissimilarity between the structure
of a country (city)’s exports and that of the G3 economies or the export dissimilarity index
(EDI), as:

        EDI rft = 100(∑ abs ( s irt − s iref
                                          ,t ))                                                  (4)
                          i


                               Eirt
                    sirt =
        where                 ∑ Eirt                                                             (5)
                                  i



where sirft is the share of HS product i at the 6-digit level in a country (city) r’s exports at year t,
and si,tref is the share of HS product i in the 6-digit level exports of G3 developed countries. The
greater the value of the index, the more dissimilar the compared export structures are. If the two
export structures were identical, then the value of the index would be zero; if the two export
structures were to have no overlap, then the index would take the value of 200. We regard an
export structure as more sophisticated if the index takes a smaller value. Alternatively, one could

                                                      7
use the similarity index proposed by Finger and Kreinin (1979) and used by Schott (2006)
(except for the scale):
       ESIrft = 100 ∑ min (sirft , si,tref )                                                 (6)
                       i

This index is bounded by zero and 100. If a country (city) r’s export structure had no overlap
with that of the G3 developed countries, then ESI would be zero; if the two export structures had
a perfect overlap, then the index would take the value of 100. It can be verified that there is a
one-to-one, linear mapping between ESI and EDI:


                   200 − EDIrft
        ESIrft =                                                                             (7)
                        2


Share of Advanced Technology Products in total exports – ATP share
       Besides the measures already in the literature, we also propose a new measure on the
share of high-tech products in a country’s exports bundle that does not require assuming that
richer countries automatically export more sophisticated products.
                       EXPitATP
        ATPSH it = 100                                                                       (8)
                       EXPitTOT

where EXPitATP is exports of ATP of country i at time t, EXPitTOT is total exports of country i at

time t. This measure of export sophistication requires us to specifically define what is meant by
“high-tech exports”; thus it sacrifices EXPY’s simplicity.
       To compute this measure, one needs an expert definition of which product is high-tech.
Two lists of expert definitions are well respected. One is developed by the U.S. Census Bureau,
which identified about 700 product categories as “Advanced Technology Products” (ATP) from
about 20,000 10-digit HS codes used by the United States. The other is developed by the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which identified 195
product categories from 5-digit SITC codes as “high tech” products. Because the Harmonized
System classification (HS) is more detailed and is cross-country comparable at the 6-digit level,
we concord both lists into 6-digit HS product categories. We convert the OECD “high tech”
product list to 328 6-digit HS codes based on concordance between SITC (rev3) and HS (2002)
published by the United Nations Statistical Division.


                                                  8
       To condense the U.S. Census ATP list from 10-digit HS to 6-digit HS, we first calculate
the ATP value share in both U.S. imports from the world at the HS-6 level based on U.S. trade
statistics in 2006, bearing in mind that within each HS-6 heading, some of the U.S. HTS-10 lines
are considered to be ATP and others are not. We choose two separate cutoff points. For a narrow
ATP definition, we select the 6-digit HS categories which the ATP share is 100 percent in total
U.S. imports from the world according to the Census ATP list, which resulted in 92 HS-6 lines.
For a wider ATP definition, we select the 6-digit HS categories which the ATP share is at least
25 percent in total U.S. imports from the world, which resulted in 157 HS-6 lines. We use the 6-
digit HS code in which all products are in the Census ATP list and also in the OECD “high tech”
product list as our narrow definition of ATP. For a wider ATP definition, we deem an HS-6 line
as ATP when either it is in the OECD high-tech product list or at least 25 percent of its value is
ATP products in U.S. imports from the world according to the Census ATP list.
       The recent literature also documents significant variations within the same product.
Although both developed and developing countries may export products under the same 6-digit
HS code, their unit value usually varies significantly, largely reflecting the difference in quality
between their exports. To allow for the possibility that a very large difference in the unit values
may signal different products (that are misclassified as in the same 6-digit category), we take unit
value for all products from Japan, EU15 and the United States (G3) in our narrow ATP definition
as reference, and any products with unit value below the G3 unit value minus 5 times standard
deviation will not be counted as ATP. This gives our third definition of ATP.


2.3 Data and Basic Facts
       The EXPY measure requires data on trade flow and GDP per capita. We computed
EXPY for both a short and a long sample. For the short sample, dating from 1992 to 2006, the
data on country exports come from the United Nations’ COMTRADE database, downloaded
from the World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). The data from 1992 to 2006 is at the 6 digit
HS (1988/1992 version) covering 5016 product categories and 167 countries. For the long
sample, dating from 1962-2000, the trade flow data are taken from the NBER-UN data compiled
by Feenstra et al., which could be downloaded from the NBER website. The data is at 4 digit
SITC, revision 2, covering 700 to more than 1000 product categories and 72 countries. The GDP
per capita data on PPP basis is taken from the Penn World Table.

           The modified EXPY measure in addition requires data on unit value. The data are
obtained from Ferrantino, Feinberg, and Deason (2008), which in turn are obtained from the
United Nations’ COMTRADE database. The data is only for the year 2005, and is cleaned of
products that do not have well defined quantity units, have inconsistent reporting, have small
value, or have unit value belonging to a 2.5 percent tail of the distribution of the product’s unit
values. In total, the resulting unit value dataset covers 3628 6-digit HS subheadings.
           The other two export sophistication indices – EDI and ATP share (narrow, broad) – are
computed excluding HS Chapters 1-27 (agricultural and mineral products) as well as raw
materials and their simple transformations (mostly at HS 4-digit level) in other HS chapters. A
list of excluded products is reported in Appendix Table 1. Each country’s ATP exports share is
computed by the country’s ATP exports divided by its total manufacturing exports. Our sample
of countries is listed in Appendix Table 2.
           The other explanatory variables included in the growth regressions are human capital,
GDP per capita, and institutional quality. The human capital variable in the cross country
regressions uses the average school year in the Barro-Lee education database. GDP per capita is
on PPP basis and taken from the Penn World Table. The institutional quality variable is proxies
by the government effectiveness index downloaded from the World Bank and Transparency
International websites.3


3. Do Leapfroggers Grow Faster? An Examination of Cross-country Evidence


3.1 The Elusive Growth Effect of a Leapfrogging Strategy
           Since Hausman et al. (2007) is the most recent and the best known paper that is supposed
to have provided an empirical foundation for the proposition that a leapfrogging strategy as
measured by a country’s export sophistication delivers a faster economic growth rate, we start
our statistical analysis by taking a careful look at their specification, with a view to check the
robustness of their conclusion. In particular, we follow their econometric strategy, regressing
economic growth rate across countries on a leapfrogging measure and other control variables that
are typically included in empirical growth papers. After replicating their regressions with EXPY

                                                        10
as the leapfrogging proxy, we use the alternative measures discussed above – modified EXP, the
EDI indicator, and the ATP shares.
       Table 1 shows our replication of the HHR’s cross-section regressions for the short sample
of 1992-2003 (corresponding to their Table 8). The controls include human capital and a
measure of institutional quality. Since the source of their “rule of law” index is not clearly
stated, we use four other well-known institution variables: corruption, government effectiveness,
regulation quality, and the CPI score. In the OLS regressions, the coefficients on the first three
institution measures are significant; in particular, the coefficient on regulation quality (0.013) is
close to HHR’s coefficient on their rule of law index (0.011). Columns 1, 2, 7, and 8 in Table 1
can be compared to the corresponding regression in HHR’s Table 8; the coefficients on the initial
GDP per capita and human capital variables are basically the same as HHR’s. While the
coefficients on log initial EXPY have different magnitudes than HHR’s results for the same
sample period of 1992-2003, they are all statistically significant (though not as strong, depending
on the institution variable) and are positive as HHR’s. A possible explanation for this difference
in the size of the coefficients is that trade data for the countries in the 1992-2003 sample has
been revised since their usage. The bottom line from this replication exercise is that their results
can be replicated.
       In the next step, we replace the EXPY variable with alternative measures of export
sophistications—modified EXPY, EDI, and the ATP shares—and re-estimated the regressions.
The results for each of these respective variables are displayed in Tables 2-5. In Table 2, the
coefficient on the modified EXPY is statistically insignificant in all but the first specification
with only human capital as control, even as the direction of the coefficients and significance on
initial GDP per capita, human capital, and institution variables remains the same as in Table 1.
This observation extends to the case where either EDI or the broad definition of ATP is used as
the export sophistication measure, as shown in Tables 3 and 4. However, the coefficient on the
ATP share using a more stringent definition is positively significant across all specification. We
will show in the next section that even this result is not robust.
       To summarize, the positive association between a country’s export sophistication and
economic growth rate is not a strong and robust pattern of the data. In particular, alternative
measures of export sophistication often produce statistically insignificant coefficients. For
example, a reasonable adjustment to the HHR measure of sophistication by taking into account

                                                  11
possible differences in unit values when computing the implied income in an export bundle
would render the positive association to disappear. We therefore infer that it may be too early to
conclude that pursuing a leapfrogging strategy would raise a country’s growth rate.


3.2 Does growth in sophistication lead to growth in income?
   It is possible that the level of a country’s export sophistication may not capture well policy
incentives or other government actions. In particular, if a country pursues an education policy
that generates an unusually large pool of scientists and engineers, its level of export
sophistication may surpass what can be predicted based solely on its income or endowment. A
useful alternative empirical strategy is to look at the growth of a country’s export sophistication.
Holding constant the initial levels of export sophistication, would those that have an unusually
fast increase in sophistication also have an unusually high rate of economic growth?
   In Table 6, we rank the 49 countries in our sample by descending order in the pace of the
growth of their export sophistication. As a smell test, we pay particular attention to where Ireland
and China fit by this metric as both countries are often said to be examples of extensive
government programs to promote industrial transformation toward high-tech industries. While all
five measures are able to capture China as having experienced a high level of change in its
export sophistication, only the modified EXPY variable is able to capture both China and Ireland
as having undergone a significant change in export sophistication. This again strengthens our
confidence in the relative adequacy of the modified EXPY against the original EXPY in
capturing leapfrogging in industrial structure.
   Table 7 displays the regression results with this specification for all five export sophistication
measures and their changes over the period 1992-2003. The initial GDP level, human capital,
and institution variable all have the correct signs. None of the export sophistication growth
variables enters significantly into the regression. But the most conspicuous observation is the
initial export sophistication measures: all but the EXPY variable are insignificant with this
specification. In contrast to the previous specification, the ATP share is no longer significant
either. This once again shows that when export sophistication is constructed in alternative ways,
it no longer indicates significant impact on growth. To summarize, these results cast doubt on
the view that leapfrogging leads to higher growth.



                                                  12
3.3 Panel regressions with instrumental variables
    The cross section regressions assume that productivity growth is the same for all countries
except for differences in the leapfrog policies. As an extension that relaxes this assumption, we
turn to a panel analysis with separate country fixed effects. New challenges emerge with the
panel analysis: one has to deal with shorter time intervals and has to have instrumental variables
that have meaningful time series variations.
    We do not have clever instrumental variables. For lack of better ones, we experiment with
the idea that professional background and educational preparedness of a political leader may
affect his/her choice of economic strategy, and are therefore candidates for instrumental
variables. The idea is imported from Dreher, Lamla, Lein, and Somogyi (2009). After
constructing a database of profession and education for more than 500 political leaders from 73
countries for the period 1970-2002, these authors find that pro-market reforms are more likely to
be proposed and implemented by leaders who are former entrepreneurs and former scientists.
Educational background sometimes has an influence but the effect is not robust. We follow their
approach and in fact borrow their data set. One set of dummies codify the educational
background for chief executives: law, economics, politics, natural science, and other. Another
set of dummies codify the professions of chief executives before they take office: entrepreneur,
white collar, blue collar, union executive, and science, economics, law, military, politician, and
others. We use this set of variables as instruments for export sophistication.
    These instruments are not ideal. In the first stage regressions (not reported), we cannot
confirm the findings by Dreher et al (2009) that former entrepreneurs or former scientists-turned
politicians do things differently in the context of a leapfrogging strategy. However, there is some
evidence that leaders who are former blue collar workers or former labor union executives are
more likely to pursue a leapfrogging strategy (when leapfrogging is measured by the criterion of
EDI). There is also some evidence that life-time politicians are more likely to pursue a
leapfrogging strategy.
    The Durbin-Wu-Hausman chi-square test fails to reject the null that the OLS and the IV
estimates are different (with a p-value of 0.50). This might imply that there is no significant
endogeneity issue in the current context, and that an IV approach is not necessary. On the other
hand, the F statistics (for the null that all regressors are jointly zero) is only 3.08. So we cannot
rule out the possibility that these leader background variables are weak instruments.

                                                  13
    For what it is worth, Table 8 shows the second-stage growth regression results for the long
sample of 1970-2000, for using EXPY and EDI as measures of export sophistication.
Unfortunately, we cannot use the ATP shares as they are not available for early years. Panel A
shows the results for using EXPY as export sophistication. To compare with the analysis in
Hausman et al., our sample starts a few years later (as opposed to their 1962-2000). Our OLS
estimation closely replicates their estimates: the coefficient on initial GDP per capita is negative
and significant at –0.001, the coefficient on initial EXPY is positive and significant at 0.02, and
the coefficient on human capital is positive and significant at 0.01. In the fixed effects and IV
specifications, neither of the coefficients on initial EXPY is significant, despite the improved
Hansen-J statistics given our set of instruments. The R-squared of our regression for the OLS
case is more than twice as large as theirs, despite the similarities in the estimates. Panel B shows
the results for the same regression except replacing EXPY with EDI. None of the export
sophistication variables are significant, while the initial GDP per capita and human capital
variables are both significant. We conclude that in the panel regressions, there is no strong and
robust support for the notion that a leapfrogging strategy promotes growth (subject to the caveat
that we may not have found powerful instruments).


   5. Conclusion


   To be able to transform an economy’s economic structure ahead of its income level toward
higher domestic value added and more sophisticated sectors is desirable in abstract. Many
governments have pursued policies to bring out such transformations. To be sure, there are
examples of individual success cases – promotion of a certain industry by government policies
that result in an expansion of that industry. However, any such policy promotion takes away
resources from other industries, especially those that are consistent with the country’s factor
endowment and level of development. On balance, the effect is conceptually less clear. Given the
popularity of such leapfrogging strategies, it is important to evaluate empirically if they work.
Unfortunately, such an evaluation is difficult because it is not straightforward to quantify the
degree of leapfrogging an economy may exhibit. Typical data on production structures are not
refined enough. Most relevant policies are not easily quantifiable or comparable across countries.



                                                 14
       One way to gauge the degree of leapfrogging is by inferring from a country’s detailed
export data. This paper pursues this strategy. It develops a number of different ways to measure
leapfrogging from revealed sophistication in a country’s exports, recognizing that any particular
measure may have both advantages and shortcomings.
       After a whole battery of analyses, a succinct summary of the findings is a lack of strong
and robust support for the notion that a leapfrogging industrial policy can reliably raise economic
growth. Again, there may be individual success stories. But there are failures. If leapfrogging is a
policy gamble, there is no systematic evidence that suggests that the odds are favorable.
       We conclude by noting again two distinct aspects of a growth model that embraces the
world market. The first aspect is export orientation – an investment environment with few policy
impediments to firms participating in international trade. While this paper does not reproduce the
vast quantity of analysis on this, we do not doubt its validity. The second aspect is leapfrogging –
the use of policy instruments to engineer a faster industrial transformation than what may emerge
naturally based on an economy’s stage of development and factor endowment. We cast some
doubt on how effective such a strategy is empirically.
       There is important follow-up research to be done. First, part of the leapfrogging strategy
works on the “import side,” which our current empirical strategy doesn’t capture fully – for
example, the use of tariff and other policies to reduce imports of high-tech or high-value added
products in order to give domestically produced substitutes some space. One can imagine ways
in which such a strategy could backfire. But a systematic examination of the data would be
useful. Second, while a leapfrogging strategy may not work in general, there are moderate or
subtle version of the strategy that aims not to defy comparative advantage generally, but to
explore “latent comparative advantage” – the economical structure that a country would have
evolved into naturally in the next stage. Is a pattern of “latent comparative advantage”
identifiable and explorable on a systematic basis? We leave these topics for future research.
