Previous economic research shows that recessions lead to worsening substance abuse. In this
paper we study the effect of recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment
using administrative data between 1992 and 2015. Using data from Treatment Episode Data Set
and a differences-in-differences empirical strategy, we find no evidence that recessions influence
the overall number of admissions. However, we document substantial heterogeneity across drugs
of abuse. Combining our findings with previous economic studies suggests that unmet need for
substance abuse treatment increases during recessions.

1. Introduction

        There is a complex relationship between economic recessions and health. Ceteris

paribus, recessions decrease income and, according to standard health economic theory

(Grossman 1972), reductions in income worsen health by decreasing resources available for

health investments. However, in his seminal work, Ruhm (2003, 2000, 2005, 2008, 1995)

documented a somewhat controversial finding: recessions improve a wide range of health and

health behaviors. Ruhm outlined a series of economic mechanisms through which recessions

may influence health and health behaviors. First, during recessions workers are more likely to

lose their job, which lowers their opportunity cost of time. Thus, the full cost of time-intensive

health investments (e.g., physical activity) declines and, all else equal, these investments should

increase during recessions. Second, if health is a normal good – which canonical health

economic models assume, e.g., Grossman (1972) – health demand will decline in recessions as

income levels fall. Third, during recessions individuals also tend to lose health insurance, which

increases the out-of-pocket price of healthcare services which should lead to a reduction in the

quantity of healthcare services demanded and thus worsen health. Fourth, during expansions, the

employed work longer hours and are more likely to experience on-the-job injuries and strain,

which should reduce health. Fifth, immigration to areas experiencing growth creates congestion

and the emergence/spread of communicable diseases leading to worse health.

        The mechanisms outlined by Ruhm operate in opposition to one another, with income

and insurance effects implying that recessions should worsen health and other mechanisms

implying that recessions should improve health. Thus, the overall effect of recessions on health

ex ante ambiguous and empirical study is required. 1 Moreover, it is plausible that the overall

 Ruhm showed that the vast majority of health outcomes and health behaviors improve during recessions, suggesting
that reductions in prices for time-intensive health investments, job-related health impairments, and immigration-

effect of recession varies across health outcomes. 2 In this study, we extend the economic

literature on recessions and health, and address the following question: What is the effect of

recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment?

         Substance abuse is an important health outcome potentially influenced by recessions

(Ruhm 1995) and is prevalent in the U.S. For instance, 22 million individuals 12 years and

older, or 8.5% of the population, met diagnostic criteria for substance abuse in 2015 (Center for

Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2015). These conditions impede health, employment,

and relationships of afflicted individuals. Substance abuse is one of the leading causes of

preventable death in the U.S. Such deaths exceed suicides, traffic fatalities, and firearm-related

deaths (Murphy, Xu, and Kochanek 2013). Recent estimates suggest that, by 2020, the costs of

substance abuse treatment within the U.S. will be $42B per year, with the vast majority ($30B or

71%) of this treatment financed by public payers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services

Administration 2014). In terms of other important economic outcomes, substance abuse has

been linked with increased general healthcare use and costs (Balsa et al. 2009; Mark et al. 2016),

crime and violence (Carpenter 2007; French and Maclean 2006; Markowitz 2000), and reduced

labor market productivity (Terza 2002). Estimates suggest that the economic cost of substance

abuse to the U.S. is $519B per year (Caulkins, Kasunic, and Lee 2014). 3 Moreover, there is

convincing economic evidence that substance abuse, for a wide range of substances including




related congestion and disease-incidence offset reductions in income and increases in healthcare service prices faced
by consumers. One exception is mental health, which appears to decline during recessions. Ruhm also advanced
the literature substantially in terms of highlighting methodological limitations in previous, primarily non-economic,
studies. For example, Ruhm noted that many studies did not account for area-level unobservable heterogeneity and
failure to account for this heterogeneity lead to substantial bias in regression coefficient estimates.
2
  Indeed, the literature has produced a mixed set of estimates, suggesting that effects vary across health outcomes.
3
  This estimate is inflated by the authors from the original estimate of $481B (with $255B attributable to alcohol and
$226B attributable to illicit drugs) in 2011 dollars to 2017 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

                                                          3
alcohol and opioids, increases during recessions (Davalos, Fang, and French 2012; Frijters et al.

2013; Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees 2017; Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017). 4

        To mitigate the substantial internal and external costs associated with substance use there

are numerous effective and cost-effective treatment options available (Swensen 2015; Kresina

and Lubran 2011; Popovici and French 2013; Lu and McGuire 2002; French and Drummond

2005; Cartwright 2000; McCollister and French 2003; Schori 2011), including treatments for

opioid abuse (Murphy and Polsky 2016; Volkow et al. 2014; Doran 2008). Although the

effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment is well-established, most

individuals who would benefit from such treatment do not receive it. For instance, recent work

shows that, among individuals predicted to suffer from substance abuse, 7% receive treatment

(Creedon and Cook 2016). While there are myriad reasons for failure to receive treatment,

inability to pay is an important barrier (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality

2016). As financial resources available for all goods, including healthcare services, decline and

individuals lose health insurance (Simon, Soni, and Cawley 2017; Cawley and Simon 2005)

during recessions, cost barriers to treatment may increase. However, there is no economic

evidence on how substance abuse treatment utilization varies across the U.S. business cycle.

        Factors outside those advanced by Ruhm may be relevant for substance abuse and may

also be influenced by recessions. Financial strain, which is likely more prevalent during

recessions than other periods of the business cycle as income levels fall and poverty rates rise

(Hoynes, Miller, and Schaller 2012), leads to worse mental health (Maclean et al. 2015;

Maclean, Webber, and French 2015). Mental health is the one health outcome that Ruhm, and



4
 We note that the relationship between recessions and more moderate measures of substance use (e.g., any use,
binge drinking, and heavy drinking) is mixed. However, as we argue later in the manuscript, these forms of
substance use are less relevant for our research question which relates to serious substance abuse problems.

                                                        4
others, consistently show declines during recessions (Ruhm 2000; Charles and DeCicca 2008;

Tefft 2011; Bradford and Lastrapes 2013; Davalos and French 2011). Individuals may self-

medicate financial strain-induced mental health problems with substances, leading to substance

abuse and, in turn, treatment (Khantzian 1997; Peirce et al. 1994). Moreover, a substantial share

of substance abuse treatment is provided by government for free, or at a heavy discount, to

patients. Such provision of care may mute cost-based barriers to treatment but may leave

patients who rely on government-financed treatment vulnerable to state budgets which contract

during recessions (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). Finally,

the substance abuse treatment delivery system operates at capacity with limited financial

resources available to absorb increases in demand that may occur during recessions and/or

reductions in government funding (Carr et al. 2008; Buck 2011).

       In this study, we examine how admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment vary

across the U.S. business cycle. Specialty care is defined as a hospital, a residential facility, an

outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with a treatment program that offers substance

abuse treatment. To study the relationship between recessions and specialty substance abuse

treatment utilization, we use administrative data from the Treatment Episodes Data Set (TEDS)

between 1992 and 2015. We estimate differences-in-differences models that control for a wide

range of state characteristics and state-specific linear trends. Also, we test for heterogeneity

across substances of abuse, in particular opioids; both heroin and prescription opioids given that

the U.S. is in the midst of the largest opioid epidemic in the history of the country (U. S.

Department of Health and Human Services 2017).

       We find no evidence that recessions influence the overall number of admissions to

specialty substance abuse treatment. However, we identify heterogeneity across substances of



                                                  5
abuse. More specifically, a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate leads

to an 8.5% reduction in heroin admissions, a 7.0% increase in stimulant admissions, and a 6.9%

increase in admissions for drugs not classified elsewhere. Combining these findings with

previous economic studies showing that substance abuse worsens in recessions suggests that

unmet need for substance abuse treatment increases during recessions. Put differently, substance

abuse worsens during recessions, but there is no commensurate increase in specialty treatment

for most substances. Thus, many individuals with serious substance abuse problems are

plausibly remaining untreated during recessions.

       While obviously recessions create government budget shortages, and numerous social

programs must be constrained (Association of Schools of Public Health 2008; Gordon 2012),

unmet need for substance abuse treatment can be extraordinarily costly to society. Thus,

although recessions require difficult funding allocation decisions, policymakers may wish to

prioritize substance abuse treatment, given the social costs associated with this health condition

and the benefits from treatment for both patients and society at large.

       The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on

substance abuse and substance abuse treatment, and a review of the related literature. Our data,

variables, and methods are reported in Section 3. Section 4 outlines the main findings and

robustness checking is reported in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes.

2. Background and related literature

2.1 Background on substance abuse treatment

       Substance abuse ‘occurs when the recurrent use of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically

and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet

major responsibilities at work, school, or home’ according to the Substance Abuse and Mental



                                                 6
Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) (2015). Diagnosis of substance abuse 5 is established

using information on diminished control, social impairment, use of substances, and so forth.

        Most healthcare professionals rely on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of

Mental Disorders (DSM-5) developed and published by the American Psychiatric Association

(2013) to diagnose patients with substance abuse. In particular, the DSM-5 includes 12

questions that relate to substance use and related behaviors over the past 12 month period. The

questions include continuing to use substances when consumption causes employment,

interpersonal, and health problems; tolerance; 6 and forgoing important social, employment, or

recreational activities in favor of substance use. Individuals who report two or more of these

outcomes/behaviors are typically classified as suffering from substance abuse.

        Although in many cases substance abuse is a chronic condition and therefore cannot be

‘cured’, substance abuse can be successfully managed, that is allowing individuals to stop

abusing substances and lead productive lives, through suitable treatment (National Institute on

Drug Abuse 2012). Depending on the particular substance, treatment may begin with

detoxification, a process (often assisted by medications to ease withdrawal symptoms) that

allows the body to clear itself of alcohol and/or drugs (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2012).

        After detoxification clears the patient’s system of substances, there are a wide range of

available treatment options. For example, counselling (individual, group, or family); self-help

programs (e.g., Alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous); outpatient care that can include

educational classes, receiving treatment in a private doctor’s office (e.g., buprenorphine for




5
  The clinical term used by SAMHSA is ‘substance use disorder’. However, we use the term ‘substance abuse’ in
our manuscript as this term is commonly used outside clinical settings and may be more appropriate given the large
number of criminal justice referrals to specialty substance abuse treatment who do not necessarily meet DSM
criteria. For example, 39% of admissions in our sample are referred through the criminal justice system.

  Requiring the user to consumer a large quantity of the substance to obtain the same level of intoxication.

opioid addiction), or intensive outpatient treatment that requires the patient to attend classes at a

specialized substance abuse treatment facility several hours a day for an extended period; care

received in a residential setting for extended periods of time; and inpatient hospital care.

         We focus on specialty substance abuse treatment in our study. This treatment modality is

defined by SAMHSA as a specialty treatment facility such as a hospital, a residential facility, an

outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with a treatment program that offers: (i) outpatient,

inpatient, or residential/rehabilitation treatment; (ii) detoxification treatment; (iii) opioid

treatment; or (iv) halfway-house services that includes substance abuse treatment (Substance

Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). While specialty care is clearly not the

only treatment modality available to patients (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2012), it is a

costly modality – both financially and non-financially in terms of the patient’s time. Moreover,

this modality is heavily financed through government sources (Levit et al. 2013; Substance

Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014) and reflects the majority of substance

abuse care received (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2016). 7

2.3 Related literature on the relationship between recessions and substance abuse

         Economists have explored how substance use (e.g., any use, binge drinking, heavy

drinking, drinking and driving) varies across the business cycle and this literature has produced a

wide range of estimates for the direction and magnitude of the relationship; see Pacula (2011) for


7
  The 2015 National Survey of Drug Use and Health asks respondents the location of substance abuse treatment
received in the past year (respondents can list multiple responses). The percentages are as follows: hospital 19.5%,
rehabilitation facility – inpatient 27.8%, rehabilitation facility – outpatient 48.0%, mental health center – outpatient
29.1%, emergency room 9.4%, private doctor's office 18.3%, self-help group 50.3, and prison 8.4%. The share of
treatment received in a specialty treatment facility is 59% when considering hospital, rehabilitation facility –
inpatient, rehabilitation facility – outpatient, and mental health center – outpatient as specialty care. Many mental
health centers also deliver specialty substance abuse treatment given the high degree of comorbidity across these
two conditions. For example in the 2015 National Survey on Substance Abuse Treatment Services, which is
administrated by SAMHSA and collects detailed service offering information on the near universe of licensed
specialty substance abuse treatment facilities, 34% of facilities list mental health as their primary focus. More
details available on request.

an excellent review of this literature. While consensus has not been reached on the relationship

between recessions and substance use, a series of economic studies provides convincing

evidence that substance abuse, at least for several substances including alcohol and opioids,

increases during recessions. Given that we focus on admissions to specialty substance abuse

treatment, the linkage of substance abuse and recessions is most important for our purposes.

       Davalos, Fang, and French (2012) leverage data from the 2001/02 and 2004/05 National

Epidemiological Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) and show that a one

percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate leads to 1.17 greater odds of alcohol

abuse and/or dependence. Using internet search data Frijters et al. (2013) document that during

recessions searches for alcohol abuse-related terms increase. In particular, the authors show that

a 5% increase in unemployment leads to a 15% increase in searches for alcohol abuse-related

terms. Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees (2017) draw data from the 2002 to 2013 National Survey

of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to explore how drug abuse responds to recession. Although

Carpenter and colleagues findings were somewhat mixed, they show that the abuse of analgesics

and hallucinogens increases during recessions. Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017) find

that a 1 percentage point increase in the county unemployment rate leads to a 3.6% increase in

the opioid overdose death rate and a 7.0% increase in the opioid-related emergency department

(ED) rate, which proxies for non-fatal opioid overdoses. The authors show comparable, although

somewhat smaller, increases in overall drug-related overdose deaths and ED visits during

recessions, suggesting that the increases in substance-abuse related overdoses and ED visits are

not limited to opioids. Overall, the economic evidence suggests that during recessions substance

abuse, across a range of substances, increases and thus need for treatment may also increase.




                                                9
       In terms of the impact of recessions on substance abuse treatment, there are two related

epidemiological studies. Storti et al. (2011) evaluate how outpatient illicit drug treatment

respond to recessions in Europe. The authors find that admissions decline modestly during

recessions. Cantor, Stoller, and Saloner (2017) assess the effect of state unemployment rates on

treatment settings, accepted payment forms, charity care, offered services, special programs, and

use of pharmacotherapies by U.S. specialty substance abuse treatment providers. The authors

find that an increase in the unemployment rate leads lower patient volumes (measured by the

number of patients treated per day) and an increase in acceptance of private insurance.

       We build on the premise established by the extant economic and epidemiological studies

by investigating admissions to specialty treatment and heterogeneity across substances of abuse.

Of additional importance is that we utilize 24 years of data to explore these relationships.

Access to a long time-series is critical from a methodological standpoint as it helps establish the

presence of a relationship as described in Ruhm (2015). Indeed, Ruhm cautions that reliance on

shorter time-series (less than 15 years) can lead to biased parameter estimates.

3. Data and methods

3.1 Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS)

       We utilize data on admissions to specialty SUD treatment from the TEDS 1992-2015.

The TEDS is an administrative database compiled annually by the U.S. government in

collaboration with state substance abuse agencies. TEDS includes information on roughly two

million admissions to specialty substance treatment each year, and contains nearly the universe

of specialty substance abuse treatment facilities that receive financing from the state or federal

government, are certified by the state to provide specialty substance treatment, or are tracked for




                                                 10
some other reason. Within this dataset we focus on specialty substance abuse treatment. 8 Note

that because of this data feature, we do not capture substance abuse treatment received in private

doctors’ offices or self-help treatment, or providers that accept only cash and/or private health

insurance. 9 Moreover there are some differences across states in terms of what admissions are

reported to TEDS (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2016).

         In our view, even with the above-noted caveats in mind, the TEDS are the best available

data to examine how admissions to specialty substance treatment in the U.S. responds to

recessions. Indeed, the TEDS are commonly employed within the economics literature to study

specialty substance abuse treatment (Anderson 2010; Jena and Goldman 2011; Dave and

Mukerjee 2011; Saloner et al. 2017; Powell, Pacula, and Jacobson 2015; Maclean and Saloner

2017; Pacula et al. 2015) and are utilized by the Federal government to estimate the costs of

substance abuse treatment to the U.S. economy (Office of National Drug Control Policy 2012).

Moreover, Gfroerer et al. (2014) document that the demographics of patients in receiving care in

TEDS-tracked facilities are comparable to individuals receiving substance abuse treatment in the

nationally representative NSDUH. These findings suggest that the TEDS are generalizable to the

specialty substance abuse treatment-seeking population in the U.S., which is precisely our target

population. Finally, the TEDS are available over a long time period (1992-2015) and contain

consistent measures of substance abuse treatment, these data features are important for studying

the health effects of recessions (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Ruhm 2015).




8
  The specific settings in the TEDS are as follows: detoxification (hospital, ambulatory, or free standing facility);
rehabilitation/residential programs in hospitals, short-term (<30 days), or long-term (>30 days), ambulatory
intensive or non-intensive (intensive is treatment ‘lasting two or more hours per day for three or more days per
week’; non-intensive is ‘treatment services including individual, family, and/or group services, and may include
pharmacological therapies).
9
  Unless these providers operate in a state that requires reporting to TEDS for some reason.

                                                           11
       The 1992 to 2015 TEDS include 42,901,509 specialty substance abuse treatment

episodes, the number of episodes per year are reported in Appendix Table 1. An episode can

include detoxification services only, outpatient care, or inpatient care received in a hospital or

free-standing residential facility. We refer to each specialty substance abuse episode as an

‘admission’; although we realize that some episodes may not lead to an actual admission.

       We exclude admissions that occur outside the 50 states and D.C., and for which the

primary substance is missing or not listed. A non-trivial fraction of the TEDS admissions are

referred to treatment from the criminal justice system; roughly 39% during our study period. In

our core analyses, we report results based on the full sample of admissions, regardless of referral

source. We are concerned that during recessions public financing for policing services may

decline which could alter the number or composition of admissions referred from the criminal

justice system. Selecting our sample on referral source could lead therefore to conditional-on-

positive bias in our regression coefficient estimates. However, admissions referred from the

criminal justice system are more likely to be coerced than voluntary and thus are less likely to be

determined by factors outlined in traditional economic models of consumer choice (Dave and

Mukerjee 2011). To explore this possibility, in robustness checking, we report results generated

in the sample of admissions not referred from the criminal justice system and document that our

findings are not sensitive to excluding criminal justice system admissions.

       We aggregate the TEDS to the state/year level for computational ease. Not all states

report information in all years. Appendix Table 1 reports the states not reporting to TEDS by

year, this number ranges zero to five. We measure the total number of admissions and total

number of admissions by substance of abuse. Specifically, we construct separate admission

counts (based on the primary substance listed at admission) for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana,



                                                 12
heroin, prescription opioids (e.g., prescription opioid pain relievers such as oxycontin),

hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, inhalants, and substances not classified

elsewhere (e.g., other-the-counter medications and ketamine). Appendix Table 2 lists substances

included in each category. We convert admissions counts to rates per 100,000 residents in the

state using population data from the U.S. Census (University of Kentucky Center for Poverty

Research Center 2016). We take the logarithm of each outcome variable to address skewness

(our outcomes are highly left skewed), thus regression coefficient estimates have the

interpretation as an approximation to the percent change.

3.2 Economic conditions data

        Our proxy for economic conditions is the annual state unemployment rate from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics Local Area Unemployment Rate Database. 10 This variable is a

standard measure of economic activity within the literature that explores the effect of recessions

on health outcomes, in particular studies examining substance abuse (Ruhm 2000;

Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Lindo 2015; Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees 2017).

3.3 State-level characteristics

        Admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment are determined by myriad factors

outside the prevailing economic conditions. We attempt to control for such factors in our

regression models. In particular, we seek to include factors that are correlated with both

admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment and economic conditions in efforts to mitigate



10
  As noted by Lindo (2015) there are inherent trade-offs in selecting the level of aggregation for analyses of the
effect of recessions on health. We choose to use the state over more dis-aggregated measures (e.g., county) for two
reasons. (i) We are concerned that, due to limited supply of substance abuse treatment (Buck 2011), many
individuals may seek treatment outside of a smaller geographic unit, and our data only allow us to observe where the
patient receives treatment, not where the patient resides. Thus, a smaller unit of aggregation may lead to
measurement error. (ii) As we note later in the manuscript, the smallest geographic unit available in the public use
TEDS is the Core-Based Statistical Area and this measure is not defined for rural areas (<10,000 residents), leading
us to omit rural treatment. We return to this issue more formally in robustness checking reported in Section 5.

omitted variable bias in our regression coefficients. We include variables that proxy for state

preferences towards substances and addiction treatment: marijuana decriminalization (Pacula,

Chriqui, and King 2003), 11 legalization of medical marijuana (Sabia and Nguyen 2016), and a

prescription drug monitoring program (Ali et al. 2017). We include two policies that arguably

capture social preferences toward providing support for vulnerable populations (the maximum

monthly Temporary Aid for Needy Families [TANF] for a family of four and the Earned Income

Tax Credit [EITC] state-to-federal ratio) and an indicator for a Democrat governor (University of

Kentucky Center for Poverty Research Center 2016). Finally, we control for state demographics

from the Current Population Survey (Flood et al. 2017): age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.

3.4 Methods

         To estimate the impact of recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse

treatment the following differences-in-differences we use the following regression model:

(1)      𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 = 𝛼𝛼0 + 𝛼𝛼1 𝑈𝑈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 + 𝛼𝛼2′ 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠

         This model is comparable to specifications used in other recent analyses of the effects of

recessions on substance abuse outcomes (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Carpenter,

McClellan, and Rees 2017). The dependent variables is 𝐴𝐴𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 , which represents an admission

outcome in state s in year t. In terms of explanatory variables, 𝑈𝑈𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠−1 is the unemployment rate in

state s in year t, and 𝑋𝑋𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a vector of time-varying state demographics and policies. 12 Finally,

𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠 is a vector of state fixed effects, 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 is a vector of year fixed effects, Ω𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a state-specific

linear time trend, 13 and 𝜀𝜀𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is the error term. We estimate all regressions with (unweighted)

OLS and standard errors are clustered around the state (Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan 2004).

   Results are not appreciably different if we remove the vector of observable state characteristics.
13
   That is we interact each state fixed effect with a linear time trend that takes on the value of 1 in 1992, 2 in 1993,
and so forth.

                                                                14
       The appropriate lag structure between admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment

and the state unemployment rate in our context is not obvious ex ante. Previous literature on

recessions and substance abuse shows that changes in the current unemployment rate are linked

with changes in substance abuse (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Carpenter, McClellan,

and Rees 2017). We hypothesize that changes in the unemployment rate first leads to changes in

substance abuse which then, after some period of time, leads to changes in admissions to

substance abuse treatment. Hence, in our primary specification, we chose to lag the

unemployment rate by one year. However, in robustness checking we also report results using

alternative lag structures (no lag, two lags, and three lags).

4. RESULTS

4.1 Summary statistics and trends

       Before proceeding to our main analyses, we provide some descriptive evidence on the

characteristics of patients receiving specialty substance abuse treatment within TEDS-tracked

facilities. Specifically, we examine age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, employment status,

living arrangements, prior receipt of substance abuse treatment, and referral source. Results are

reported in Table 1. Overall these statistics suggest that patients receiving care in TEDS-tracked

facilities are less advantaged than the general U.S. population. For instance, 79% have a high

school diploma or less, 69% are unemployed or not in the labor force, and 35% are homeless or

reside in a supervised living facility. The sample is relatively young, 96% is less than 55 years

of age. The sample is more racially diverse than the U.S. population as whole. Finally, a

majority (54%) of the sample has received previous specialty substance abuse treatment and 39%

is referred to treatment through the criminal justice system.




                                                  15
         Table 2 reports summary statistics for our outcome and control variables. Admissions to

specialty substance abuse treatment are 674 per 100,000 over our study period. Alcohol is the

most commonly reported substance of abuse at admission (345 per 100,000) followed by

marijuana (97 per 100,000), heroin (80 per 100,000), cocaine (68 per 100,000), stimulants (41

per 100,000), prescription opioids (33 per 100,000), sedatives (5 per 100,000), hallucinogens (2

per 100,000), and inhalants (1 per 100,000). There are 3 admissions per 100,000 for other drugs

not otherwise classified. The mean lagged state unemployment rate is 5.7%. In terms of

policies, 25% of state/year pairs have decriminalized marijuana over this time period, 18%

permit medical marijuana, and 49% have implemented prescription drug monitoring programs.

         We report trends in the total number of admissions per 100,000 to specialty substance

abuse treatment in Figure 1. We observe that admissions are relatively flat 1992 to 2005,

ranging between 650 and 700 admissions per 100,000. Over the period 2006 to 2010 admissions

surge, peaking at nearly 750 per 100,000 in 2009/2010. This is a period in which prescription

opioid drug abuse increased rapidly. Admissions decline monotonically over the period 2011 to

2014 followed by an uptick in 2015.

         Figure 2 reports the average lagged state unemployment rate during our study period

(1992 to 2015, thus unemployment rates correspond to the period 1991 to 2014). This period

encompasses three recessions: the mild recessions of 1991-1992 and 2001-2002, and the severe

recession (‘Great Recession’) of 2008-2010 (National Bureau of Economic Research 2010). In

addition, we capture two growth periods: the mid- to late-1990s and the mid-2000s. Our study

period also includes the recovery from the 2008-2010 recession. Thus, we are able to leverage a

broad range of variation in economic conditions in our study. 14


14
  Of course, because we rely on differences-in-difference regression models, the variation we use for identification
of treatment effects is within-state variation.

                                                         16
       Comparing trends in admissions and the lagged state unemployment rate (i.e., Figures 1

and 2) does not reveal an obvious relationship between the two variables. However, we next to

turn to our regression analysis to study this question more rigorously and to explore

heterogeneity across substances of abuse.

4.2 Admissions regressions

       Table 3 reports selected results from our differences-in-differences analyses of

admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment. When considering all substances, we find no

statistically significant evidence that recessions lead to changes in the number of admissions to

specialty substance abuse treatment. Although the coefficient estimate is negative (-0.017)

suggesting that total admissions may decline during recessions.

       In terms of heterogeneity across substances, for the majority of the substances we

consider there is no statistically significant evidence that recessions lead to changes in

admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment. In particular, there is no statistically

significant effect for alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, prescription opioids, hallucinogens, sedatives,

and inhalants. As is the case when we consider all substances, the majority of coefficient

estimates are negative which suggests that recessions may lead to declines in admissions.

       There are three exceptions to this pattern, however. We find a statistically significant

decrease in admissions for heroin (a one percentage point increase in the lagged state

unemployment rate leads to an 8.4% decrease in admissions for this substance), a statistically

significant increase in admissions for stimulants (a one percentage point increase in the lagged

state unemployment rate leads to a 7.0% increase in admissions for this substance), and

admissions substances not classified elsewhere (a one percentage point increase in the lagged

state unemployment rate leads to a 6.9% decline in admissions for such substances).



                                                 17
       While the underlying mechanisms behind this heterogeneity across substances (similar

heterogeneity has been identified in other studies such as Carpenter, McClellan, and Rees (2017)

and Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017)) is obviously important for both policymakers and

providers, the TEDS data will not allow us to fully investigate this important question. However,

we can propose hypotheses that may, at least partially, explain the observed heterogeneity.

       First, there may be substance substitution effects associated with recessions; that is

individuals may abuse different substances at different points of the business cycle due to factors

such as income, price, or access. Second, different types of individuals abuse different types of

substances; for example those who abuse marijuana may simply differ from those who abuse

heroin, stimulants, and other substances. These groups may – for myriad reasons such as

employment or insurance coverage – respond differently to recessions in terms of their demand

for specialty substance abuse treatment. Third, the decline in heroin admissions may be due to

increased mortality among heroin abusers during recessions (Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon

2017). Fourth, there may be differences in risk for treatment across substances. For example,

stimulants include methamphetamine, which is linked with violent behavior and paranoia that

can plausibly be easily observed by others (National Institute on Drug Abuse 2017), leading to a

higher transition rate from abuse into treatment for stimulants than other substances.

5. Robustness checks

       We next report results of several robustness checks that probe the sensitivity of our

findings to alternative specifications.

5.1 Dynamics

       In our core regression models we use the contemporaneous state unemployment rate.

However, the specific timing between changes in economic conditions and changes in demand



                                                18
for specialty substance abuse treatment is ex ante unknown. To explore the stability of our

results to different lag structures, we re-estimate Equation (1) using the contemporaneous

unemployment rate, two year lags in this rate, and three year lags in this rate. We report results

in Appendix Table 3. Our finding for all substances is largely unchanged across models that

employ alternative lag structures: coefficient estimates range from -0.0103 to -0.0282, suggesting

that admissions may decline during recessions, but are imprecise in all specifications.

       Our finding that heroin (substances not classified elsewhere) admissions decline

(increase) during recessions is stable across specifications: coefficients range from -0.0580 to -

0.0791 (-0.0547 to -0.0867; although the coefficient is not precise when the contemporaneous

unemployment rate is used). The coefficient estimate in the stimulant admission regression is

similar when we use the contemporaneous unemployment rate (𝛼𝛼�1 = 0.0776) but decreases in

magnitude and becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero when we apply more distal lags

in the unemployment rate (two and three). Interestingly, when we apply more distal lag

structures (two and three lags) we find stronger, and precisely estimated, evidence that

admissions for marijuana, prescription opioids, hallucinogens, and inhalants decline when the

state unemployment rate increases. As noted earlier, the particular time dynamics between

recessions and admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment is unknown ex ante.

5.2 Alternative controls for between-state differences

       Equation (1) utilizes observable state characteristics (e.g., demographics), state fixed-

effects, and state-specific linear time trends to account for between-state heterogeneity.

However, the ideal specification is unknown a-priori. If there are no omitted variables at the

state-level that are correlated with both the state unemployment rate and admissions to specialty

substance abuse treatment, then this empirical specification would ‘throw away’ a substantial



                                                 19
degree of variation in state unemployment rates. On the other hand, if our controls do not

adequately account for between-state heterogeneity, then our estimates may be biased.

       To explore this possibility, we re-estimate Equation (1) using alternative controls for

between state differences. First, we control for state-level policies and demographics, year fixed

effects, and state fixed effects (Model 1). Second, we control for state-level policies and

demographics, year fixed effects, state fixed-effects, and state-specific quadratic time trends

(Model 2). Results are reported in Appendix Table 4. Overall, the parameter estimates are in

line with our main findings (Table 3). Not surprisingly, the estimated regression coefficients are

larger (smaller) in specifications that offer more (less) ability to control for heterogeneity.

5.3 Alternative measures of economic conditions

       In our main analyses we use the state unemployment rate to proxy for economic

conditions. However, Lindo (2015) shows that analyses of economic conditions can be sensitive

to the level at which these conditions are measured. In particular, analyses that rely on state-

level measures tend to produce larger coefficient estimates than analyses that rely on lower levels

of aggregation. Thus, in addition to the above robustness checks for economic conditions we

also re-estimate Equation (1) using the unemployment rate specified at the finest level of

aggregation available in the TEDS: the Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA). Note that this

variable is not available for rural areas (<10,000 residents), and thus we lose roughly 25% of our

sample. In these models we replace the state fixed effects and the state-specific trends with

CBSA equivalents. Given well established shortages of specialty substance abuse treatment

(Carr et al. 2008; Buck 2011) and in particular within rural communities (Hyde 2013), relying on

smaller areas may not accurately reflect the treatment facilities patients consider when they are

determining where to receive substance abuse treatment.



                                                  20
       Results from this analysis are reported in Appendix Table 5. Findings are broadly in line

with our main findings (see Table 3). However, as documented by Lindo, the estimates are

generally smaller when we use finer levels of aggregation and less likely to be statistically

different from zero. Interestingly, we find that the estimate for prescription opioid admissions is

precisely estimated: a one percentage point increase in the lagged unemployment rate leads to a

1.3% increase in admissions for this substance.

5.4 Non-criminal justice system referrals

       Thus far in our analysis we include all admissions, regardless of referral source.

However, admissions from the criminal justice system may be less responsive to changes in

factors outlined in models of consumer choice (Dave and Mukerjee 2011). We next re-estimate

Equation (1) excluding admissions referred through the criminal justice system. We note that, if

policing budgets decline during recessions, then the number and composition of individuals

referred through criminal justice system sources may be altered, which could lead to conditional-

on-positive bias. With this caveat in mind, we report results from this restricted analysis sample

in Appendix Table 6. Results are not appreciably different from our main findings (Table 3).

5.5 Population weighting

       Our results thus far are unweighted. However, there is some controversy within the

economics literature as to whether weights should be applied in analyses seeking to recover

causal estimates (Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge 2015; Angrist and Pischke 2009). Thus, we

estimate a weighted variant of Equation (1). More specifically, we use the state population to

weight this equation. Results are reported in Appendix Table 7 and are not appreciably different

from unweighted results; although we note that the estimated coefficients are somewhat smaller.

5.6 Balanced sample



                                                  21
         Our results presented thus far are based on the unbalanced sample (Appendix Table 1).

However, it is plausible that economic conditions could lead to changes in the propensity for

states to report specialty substance abuse treatment admissions data to SAMSHA, leading to

year-to-year changes in the composition of states in our sample that is linked to our treatment

variable (state unemployment rates). Hence, we re-estimate our regression models on the

balanced sample (i.e., the sample of states that appear in TEDS in all years). Results are reported

in Appendix Table 8 and are not appreciably different from our main findings. However, we

note that the stimulant admissions coefficient is no longer precise.

5.7 Other robustness checks

         We focus our analysis on specialty substance abuse treatment, which reflects several

modalities of treatment but not a complete enumeration of treatment options available to patients.

It is plausible that other modalities (e.g., self-help or office-based care) are more responsive to

recessions than specialty care. To explore this possibility we examine two additional data sets:

(i) the NESARC 2001/2002 and 2004/2005 to study the effects of economic conditions on non-

specialty substance abuse treatment 15 and (ii) the Medicaid State Drug Use Database (SDUD)

and examine Food and Drug Administration approved prescription medications used to treat

substance abuse within Medicaid (Maclean and Saloner 2017; Mark et al. 2015). 16 Neither of

these datasets produce results that recessions lead to changes in these forms of treatment.

16
   We note that neither of these extensions is optimal. The NESARC is limited to just two time periods covering a
relatively strong economic period and the SDUD covers prescription medications purchased through online and
retail pharmacies for which Medicaid was a third-party paper; thus these data allow us to study the Medicaid
population only. However, examining whether use of these forms of treatment within these time periods and
populations can shed light on the extent which our focus on specialty substance abuse treatment limits our analysis.

6. Discussion

       Health economists have examined the complex relationship between recessions and

health and health behaviors for over two decades (Ruhm 1995, 2015, 2000). However, to the

best of our knowledge, only a handful of studies have explored the relationship between

economic conditions and measures of substance abuse in the U.S. (Davalos, Fang, and French

2012; Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon 2017; Frijters et al. 2013; Carpenter, McClellan, and

Rees 2017), and no studies have investigated the relationship between recessions and admissions

to specialty substance abuse treatment. The available literature on substance abuse and

recessions suggests that, for a broad set substances, there is evidence that substance abuse

worsens during economic downturns. In this study, we evaluate the corresponding impact of

recessions on admissions to specialty substance abuse treatment in the U.S. All else equal, we

expect an increase in substance abuse to translate into increased admissions. However, due to

numerous factors related to the nature of substance abuse, patients receiving substance abuse

treatment, and substance abuse treatment delivery system, this relationship is ex ante unclear.

       When we consider all substances collectively, we find no statistically significant evidence

that changes in economic conditions leads to changes in admissions to specialty substance abuse

treatment. However, aggregating across substances of abuse masks important and policy

relevant heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that admissions for heroin and other drugs not classified

elsewhere decline while admissions for simulants increase during recessions.

       In interpreting these results a number of limitations should be noted. First, admissions to

substance abuse treatment is a function of both supply and demand. Our reduced form methods

cannot separate supply from demand side factors. It is plausible that during recessions public

financing – the primary source of funding – available for specialty substance abuse treatment



                                                23
may decline which prevents individuals from entering treatment and, based on the economic

studies discussed earlier, that substance abuse increases during recessions. Second, the

substance abuse treatment providers in the TEDS disproportionally receive public financing.

Thus, the extent to which our findings generalize to other settings is unclear. However, given

that specialty substance abuse treatment is heavily supported by the public sector we suspect that

our findings are potentially generalizable to a large share of the specialty care that is delivered.

Indeed, Dave and Mukerjee (2011) state that TEDS captures approximately 67% of such

providers. Finally, we do not have objective measures quality of care, expenditures, and length

of stay. Thus, we cannot explore how quality or intensity of treatment changes across the

business cycle. However, recent epidemiological work by Cantor, Stoller, and Saloner (2017)

does not imply that there are large changes in quality of care across the business cycle. 17

           Given these limitations, policymakers and providers may find our results useful.

Recessions may lead to increases in untreated substance abuse which can, in turn, lead to

increases in mortality and social costs such as crime, healthcare use, and poor employment

outcomes. For example, Hollingsworth, Ruhm, and Simon (2017) show that during recessions

overdose deaths increase. While we cannot fully test this hypothesis, it is plausible given that

there are effective methods available to treat addiction (Volkow et al. 2014; Swensen 2015;

Murphy and Polsky 2016), that expanded substance abuse treatment may have prevented some of

these deaths. Thus, directing government resources toward substance abuse treatment during

recessions may have social benefits.




17
     However, we note that measuring quality of substance abuse treatment in available datasets is challenging.
