               Inflationary Finance Under Discretion and Rules



                                    Abstract



        Inflationary finance involves first, the tax on cash balances from

expected   inflation, and second, a capital levy from unexpected inflation.
From the standpoint      of minimizing distortions) these capital levies are

attractive,   ex post, to the policymaker. In a full equilibriuni   two conditions

hold:     1) the monetary authority optimizes subject to people's expectations
mechanisms, and 2) people form expectations rationally, given their     knowledge

of    the policymaker's objectives. The outcomes under discretionary policy
are   contrasted with those generated under rules. In a purely discretionary

regime the    monetary   authority can make no meaningful commitments about the

future behavior of money and prices. Under an enforced rule, it becomes

possible to make some guarantees. Hence, the links between monetary actions

and inflationary expectations can be internalized. There is a distinction

between fully-contingent rules and rules of simple form. A simple rule allows

the internalization of some connections between policy actions and inflationary

expectations, but discretion permits some desirable flexibility of monetary

growth.

Introduction

     Inflationary finance has often been studied in the context of a

once-and-for-a11 choice of the monetary growth rate. See, for example, Bailey

(1956) and Phelps (1973). The nominal interest rate is the tax rate levied on

real cash balances. The effects of this tax on governmental revenues

and excess burden can be analyzed in a manner similar to that for taxes

on labor income, produced commodities, etc. The special characteristics

cf money concern the tendency for monopoly on the supply side, and the

possibility that the marginal cost of production (for real balances)

is near zero.

     Cagan (1956, pp. 77, ff.) observed that surprise inflation is also

a source of government revenue. The discussions in Auernheimer (1974)

and Sjaastad (1976) link surprise inflation to unanticipated capital losses

on real cash (or, more generally, on any governmental obligations whose

payment streams are fixed in nominal terms). The revenue obtained through

surprise inflation amounts to an ex post capital levy. As with other

capital levies, this form of tax--when not foreseen- -can raise revenue

at little deadweight loss.

      Since people understand the attractions of ex post capital levies,

they will attempt to forecast, ex ante, the government's tendency to

exploit such situations. So, in deciding to hold money or other nominal

liabilities of the government, people will take into account the govern-

ment's power to engineer ex post "surprises," which depreciate the real value

of these claims. (Default on public debts and high rates of taxation on "old"

capital are similar phenomena.) The expected cost of holding money takes

into consideration the likelihood of these subsequent capital losses.
                                    —2—



Further, in making optimal forecasts of these losses, people essentially

have to model themonetary authority's behavior. Specifically, people

would project the reaction of monetary growth to a set of state variables,

which include the position of the money-demand function. In a full rational

expectations equilibrium, no systematic inflation surprises can occur.
Prices may be higher or lower than predicted because of the realizations
of some random events, but the government cannot be systematically generating
proceeds from surprise inflation.
    Although a regular pattern of inflation surprises cannot arise               in

equilibrium, the government's capacity to create these shocks, ex post,

influences   the position of the equilibrium       for   the growth   rates of money and
prices. If the policymaker could commit himself in advance to resist the ex
post benefits from surprise inflation, then the equilibrium rates of monetary
growth and inflation are likely to be lower. Monetary and price rules provide
such commitments to varying degrees. In contrast, a purely discretionary regime
has no scope for these types of restrictions on subsequent monetary behavior.

This type of distinction between rules and discretion has been stressed by

Kydland and Prescott (1977).

       Calvo (1978) studied a model   in   which   the government     was   interested
only   in maximizing its revenue from inflationary finance. In a purely
discretionary   setup, where people have rational expectations, there is

no finite equilibrium solution for monetary growth and inflation. In

the present paper the government's objective is modified to trade off

costs of inflation against the benefits from revenues. A finite equilib-

rium is then determined under purely discretionary monetary policy.

The   implied growth   rates of money and prices depend on some stochastic

state   variables, which   include the government's valuation of revenues
                                        -3-




(which may vary with the overall level of government spending or with

aggregate business conditions), and the position of the money-demand

function.

         The results under discretion are contrasted to those obtainable from

monetary rules.      I consider rules that allow for a full set of state-

contingent responses, as well as those of simple form that do not allow

for full contingencies. The constant-growth-rate rule is of the latter

type. Although state-contingent rules can unambiguously outperform

discretion (abstracting from costs of enforcing the rules), the ranking

of discretion and simple rules is. uncertain. The rules have the benefit

of internalizing all linkages between monetary behavior and inflationary

expectations. However, discretion (and fully-contingent rules) allow

for a flexible response to changes in circumstances, which has some

value in the model under study.



Setup of the Model

         It is convenient (for me) to develop the model in a framework of dis-

crete time. The length of the period is denoted by T, which has units of

time, say of years. Since the length of the period plays no economic role

in the present model, I ultimately focus on the results when t is allowed to

approach zero.

         The government determines the nominal money stock at the start of period

t   to   be the amount
                         Mt.   No private issues of money are considered. The

growth rate of money from period t-l to t is             (l/t)log(M/M1) which
has units of per year. The general price level for period t is           so
                                                   -4-




that real balances are Mt/Pt. I focus here on holdings of money, although

the approach can            be    applied also to government bonds that have prescribed

nominal payouts.              The inflation rate from period t-l to t is

(lIT)   lo(P/P1)3 which is measured per year.
         Let I. denote the information set that each person has during period t.
 (The government will have equivalent information when setting the money stock,
         This information set includes knowledge of Pt and Mt. Based on                  this infor-
 Mt.)
 mation,       everyone calculates the expected rate of inflation from period t to t+l,



         (1)                       E(iT1jI) =       . [E(log?÷1FI)   _loP].
         Demand for real balances during period t depends inversely on

 and    positively on a stochastic scale variable, At.                I use   the semi-logarithmic
 form, as in         Cagan (1956),



         (2)          Mt/Pt =         A.exp(_a+i).

 The logarithm of the scale variable, At, is generated from a random-walk

 process,


                                  =
         (3)              logA.       logA_1
                                               +
                                                   a,

 where
          a     is    white noise.         The variance of      a, is proportional to the period

 length,       t.      People know the value, of At at the start of period t--that is,

 At and    a        are   contained     in the information set, I•
      Taking logarithmic first differences of equation (2), and using equation

(3) and the definitions of        and           leads to the condition,



       (4)
               tT       =     + a(r1 -           - a.
               =                            -
Note that
                    (l/t)[E(logPII_1)           logP1].   Equation (4) indicates that

the   inflation rate, iTt, is above (below) the monetary growth rate, ii, to
the extent of the proportionate fall (rise) in real money demanded from
period t-l to t. The change in real money demanded reflects either a change
in expected inflation,       -    (multiplied by the proportionate sensitivity
                                 ir
of money demand, a), or a proportionate change in the scale variable, a =
log(A/A1).
      The government's real revenue from money creation for period t is

       (5)     Rt       (M_Mt_i)/Pt         (Mt/Pt) -   (M1/Pi)(P1/Pt).
Substituting for the real-balance terms from equation (2), and using the
condition, I1_l/I'.t = exP(_1rr), leads to the expression,

       (6)          =                   -
                        A.exp(_aIr1)        A1exp(_a1r_1Tt).

       For given inflationary expectations         between periods t   and t+l,

there is a given amount of real cash that people will hold during period t,

                                Given this term, governmental revenue will be
(Mt/Pt) =    A.exp(_a7r+i).
higher if the real value of money carried over from the previous period,

                                       can be reduced. Therefore, if              could be
Mt i/Pt =    A1.exp(_r_1rr),
held fixed (and for a given value of the prior expectation, ir), revenue

would be enhanced by choosing monetary growth, ,             in   order to engineer a

higher   value of      Higher inflation depreciates more real cash, which

allows the policyniaker to provide more new real cash as a replacement.        Of

course, this procedure works best when          is insulated from the deterinina-

tion of      and i__that is, when people do not anticipate a repetition of the

high rate of depreciation in the real value of their money.       The model has to

clarify the interconnections among anticipated inflation rates, ir and

monetary growth, 1i and inflation, it•       This   analysis requires a theory of

expectations, as well as a model of the policymaker's incentives to choose

different rates of monetary expansion. The discussion deals first with the

objectives of the policymaker. The solution to this problem- -which private

agents are    assumed to   understand--ultimatelY provides the basis for the

theory    of expectations.


The   Policymaker's Objective
       The government likes more revenues from money creation- -perhaps because
the alternatives are either extra revenue obtained from distorting taxation or
less (valuable) public expenditures. For any period the policymaker values
each mit of real revenue from money issue by the positive amount, e. This
valuation    would be higher   in times when alternative revenue sources require
greater welfare losses at the margin. Possibly, e would be especially high
during wartime, in other periods where government expenditures have risen

sharply from previous levels, or in recessions. In this model changes in the
logarithm of the e parameter are regarded as unpredictable--that is, I use

the random-walk specification,

       (7)     loO = loge1       +
where         is white noise, and independent of a in equation (3).   The vari-

ance of c,, c, is proportional to the period length, T. People know the value

of et at the start of period t--that ,          and    are included in the infor-

mation set,

     The policyinaker is also concerned with costs from inflation. The usual

liquidity costs, which are associated with the quantity of real money

demanded during period t, involve the expected inflation rate between periods

t and t+l, ir1. The actual inflation rate between periods t-l and t, w, is

assumed to entail separate costs from the standpoint of the policyinaker. There

might be costs of changing prices, L Se, as well as losses from       unexpected
inflation. The costs of inflation, as perceived by the policymaker,

are written as the function, $(1r, ir1).       These costs have units of
commodities per year. The total costs incurred over period t, which

has length r, are equal to

     Overall, the government's objective concerns the net costs of inflation

for each period, Z,, as calculated from

                              '+) - o[Aexp(_ctir1)

where the formula for Rt has been substituted from equation (6). The cost

function satisfies the properties, /9ir. > 0 and               > 0. The valua-

tion placed on revenue,           is subtracted from the costs ascribed to actual

and expected inflation. In general the policymaker would seek to minimize

the expected sum of net costs--that is, of the Zr's__where each period's cost
is expressed in present-value terms. The expectations of the Zr's would be

evaluated as of some appropriate starting date.



The Choice of Monetary Growth under Discretion

     The analysis of discretionary policy follows the general line of argu-

ment presented in Barro and Gordon (1981). The policymaker selects the

monetary growth rate, p, for each period. Under discretion, there are no

possibilities for prior constraints or commitments that would restrict the

subsequent choices of monetary growth rates.

    At date t the expectation of inflation that was formed last period, ir,

cannot be altered. Suppose for the moment that current and future inflationary

                                   are also treated as givens by the policymaker
expectations, TT1,   t+2'   ...,

during period t. The choice of Pthen determines          from equation (4),

given the exogenous disturbance, a. The value for         also determines the

real revenue for period t, Rt, from equation (6) (given the values of At and

At1). Therefore, we can compute the full effect of          on the contemporaneous

net cost, Z, in equation (8). With the various              held fixed (and future

        restricted by current actions), there are no effects in this model of

the choice of p on future Z.4's. Therefore, the optimizing policymaker

would choose    in order to minimize the contemporaneous net cost, Z.

    More generally, the iT's will be related to expectations of future

p .'s. Hence, the 11e .'s can be held fixed above only if the choice of
 t+1                 t+1
  has   no implications for expectations of the 1+1' In the present con-

text each      will emerge from a minimization problem that starts from

date t+i. The choice of       and the resulting value for      do nothing to
                                                  -9-




alter the objective characteristics of this problem for any future period.

Therefore, it is reasonable to look for an equilibrium solution to the model

where the          are invariant with the selection of i. (Note that there
is nothing to learn about in this model--in particular, people already know

the government's objective and "technology.") With the                                 held   fixed,

it is reasonable also to hold fixed the                         when            varies. (In other

words there will be a sensible equilibrium that satisfies this condition.)

     For a discretionary policymaker, the choice of                             follows from the

first-order condition, (3Z
                        t /i) e   e                  -
                                                            = 0,     as
                           t1lT, IN
                              t                   t+l,

                         -                                  =   0.


This calculation uses the conditions, (rr/ji) 11e                                  1 (from equation (4)L,
                                                                   t'      t+l
                                                                          ,re


and (ir'÷1/u )     e         =    o:    (The period length ,     t,     appears multiplicatively in
                  t+l
both terms in equation (9) and has been cancelled out.) Rewriting equation (9)

yields the condition,


                       =
     (10)
                                 Afexp(_a1T_7rt.T)              Ot(M1/Pti).exp(_1rt.r).


The monetary growth rate, '                is   chosen so as to equate the marginal cost of

(actual) inflation to the marginal benefit from additional revenue. The

latter quantity equals the valuation per unit of revenue, O, times the

marginal effect of               on revenue, R. With                 and         held fixed, it

follows from equations (5) and (6) that aR/P =

Notice   that--because                 is held fixed when        changes--the marginal

cost of expected inflation does not enter into the first-order
                                         -10-




condition. The discretionary policymaker also does not consider any effects

of monetary behavior- -via influences on expected inflation--on the real

money demanded for periods t-l or t.

     In order to obtain some closed-form results, I specialize the cost

function to


     (ii)                    =
                                 (k1/b).exp(bT)
                                                  +
                                                      (k2/b).exp(b?r1);   k1, 1c, b > 0.


The exponents, b, could differ in the two cost terms without affecting most

of the results. Equation (11) implies positive and increasing marginal costs

for actual and expected inflation. (r and                  are also entered in separable

form in this example.) With this specification of costs, equation (10) implies


     (12)       k1.exp(b1T) =     GtAi.exp(_rtT).
Rearranging terms and taking logarithms of both sides yields


                                  =                    +
     (13)       (b+T)rr +             log(O1A1/k1)
                       =                    Given the formula for rr in equation (13),
where recall that
                            log(O/O1).
the implied choice for           (given rr1, ir and at) can be determined from

equation (4).



Rational Expectations

     Equations (4) and (13) determine actual rates of inflation and monetary

growth,       and u, as functions of exogenous variables and the expected

inflation rates, 1T and 1t.1• In order to close the model, these expecta-

tions must be determined.        I use a rational expectations condition,
                                                       11—




        =
            E(Trt+iIt)      and   =
                                      E(rIi).                The information set,         includes

observations of all variables for date t, including M, ''
                                                                                    0   and At.

People also use knowledge of the model's structure in order to calculate

these expectations. Most importantly, everyone understands that the policy-

maker chooses            in each period in order to minimize costs_Z from equation

(8)--while treating ir and                   as       givens. Hence, they know that equation

(13) holds. In a full equilibrium, people's inflationary expectations,

        and
               ir,   will be consistent with           well-informed      projections of the policy-

maker's future choices of monetary growth. Although the policymaker is not

forced to accord with these expectations (which will appear as givens to the

policymaker during each period), the first-order condition in equation (10) will

guide the choices to this result                 in   equilibrium. That is, the poliymaker will

not be motivated in equilibrium to deviate systematically from people's prior

expectations.
        People form the expectation, ir, based on the information available in

period t-l. The variables,                   and At_i, are known at this date. Therefore,

taking expectations of equation (13), conditional on the information set

the expected inflation rate must satisfy

substituted back into equation (13) in order to calculate the actual inflation

rate,           The form of equation (14) can be updated by one period to determine

        the anticipated rate of inflation between periods t                    and t+i.    Then, the

results for ir, ir1 and               can   be   substituted into equation (4) in order to

determine      the monetary growth rate,

     The period length, t,             is   now assumed to be negligible relative to the

parameters, b and ct.         As T          0, the full solution to the model is as follows:

        The solution for monetary growth and inflation is an equilibrium in the

following sense. First, at a point in time, the policyinaker treats                             as


given and regards 7T+l as generated from the expectations mechanism in

                                                                     with the choice of
equation (17)--in particular, ,r1 is invariant

Given          and          and the relation of          to          from equation (4), the

 setting for         in equation (18) satisfies the policymaker's first-order

 condition for minimizing Z, as specified in equation (13).                           Second, the

 expectations mechanisms in equations (16) and (17) are rational--that is,

                                   =
    =
        E(rlI1)         and
                                       E(+1jIt),       given that monetary growth for each

 period follows the form of equation (18).

        Notice from equation (10) that the marginal cost of inflation,                          /ir,

 must be positive in equilibrium. Therefore, if k1 =                         0--so   that no costs

 are attached by the policymaker to actual inflation, 7r__then no finite

 equilibrium values for                and       are determined in equations (15) and (18).

 This case corresponds to the one explored by Calvo (1978), where the dis-

 cretionary policymaker considers only the maximization of revenue, R.
                                    -13--




     Within a discretionary setup where the policymaker attempts to minimize

net costs in each period, Z, the results provide a positive theory of mone-

tary growth and inflation. As long as            > 0, inflation and monetary growth

depend on the two variables that move around in the model, 0 and A. A higher

level for °t-1. (given the value of         =                means a greater value
                                                log(O/e1))
placed on revenues. Hence, in an equilibrium where the first-order condition

from equation (13) is satisfied, the values of Tt and          are higher.2

Similarly, a higher level for real money demand, At_i (given a =           log(A/A1))
encourages the revenue objective relative to the cost of inflation (if the

cost parameter, k1, is held constant3). Therefore,            and     rise with

At_i. A higher value for the cost parameter, k1, reduces             and

     Although   expectations are rational, surprises do occur because of
the stochastic terms in the model. The amount of unexpected inflation
follows from equations (15) and (16) as


                         (l/b)c.
                                                                      =
When the valuation of revenue rises unexpectedly--that is,                 log(e/O1)
> 0--inflation   is unexpectedly high. This result obtains because the policy-
maker is motivated by the rise in 0 to incur a higher marginal cost of
inflation, which means a higher value for ir. The positive value for
means also a: rise in the expected inflation rate--that is, -iT >              0

from equations (16) and (17). Because of the reduction in real money demanded,
we need a downward shift in        in order to satisfy equation (4) (hence, the
term, _ac/; in the expression for in equation (18)). Expected future
rates of monetary expansion rise with
                                              —14-




          A surprise shift in the level of real money demanded, at =

does not generate unexpected inflation (although it does produce unanticipated

monetary growth). Given Ai a higher iraiue for at means a higher level of

At. Revenue rises from equation (6) in accordance with the term, (Mt/Pt) =

                                    with       treated as invariant with the choice of
A.exp(_a1r+i). However,
          a shift in this term leaves unaltered the value of                  that satisfies the

policymaker's first-order condition. The term, ai does influence the

relation between monetary growth and inflation in equation (4). This

element raises             for a given value of             A positive value for a

also    raises anticipated future rates of monetary growth, which means
an    increase in rye1. This element lowers     for a given value of

          The    model determines the variance of the inflation rate over various

horizons.          Using equation (15) and   the   random—walk specifications for log(O)
and   log(A) (from equations (3) and (7)),            the   variance of the inflation

rate is


          (20)        VAR(TrtlIO) = (l/b+ct)2(t-1)(o2+a2)     +   (l/b)2a2,

where 1a is the information available in period zero. The variance of the
inflation rate depends on the variances of the two innovation terms,                      and
          The    forecast variancefor        increases linearly with the distance in time,

  Discretion versus Rules

        Constant State Variables

        Inthe discretionary regime the policymaker holds fixed current and
 future inflationary expectations' when deciding on period t's rate of
 monetary growth. Since these expectations are, in fact, related to
 monetary     behavior, the discretionary policymaker is unable to internalize
 some   effects of his actions. Recall the form of the             objective function
 from   equation      (8),



                       t'*(T,           -                      -
                                            Ot[Atexp(_air+1)

 The   discretionary policy-maker has no way to consider the effects of monetary
 behavior on inflationary expectations, which influence             costs, *(ir, '+l' and
 revenues, through the terms, exp(_c1n+1) and exp(-ctir).
        The difference between discretion and policy rules--or commitments--can
best be clarified by initially suppressing the variations over time in the
state variables, O and A. Assume now that       = e, and
                                                         At = A, so that
     =
  at 0 holds for all t. The discretionary solutions now dictate constant
=

rates of monetary growth and inflation. The results follow from equations
 (15)——(18) as


             (21)                  p=
                                        (l/b+)log(oA/k1).

       Suppose      that the   policy-maker could restrict himself in advance to

a particular value for future
                                        monetary growth. That is, the policy-maker
                                                      -16-




rules out the possibility of altering his subsequent behavior, even if

such alterations would appear advantageous, ex post. In this case there

would be a linkage between the policymaker's choice of (constant) mone-

tary growth, .i, and the values of inflationary expectations. Namely,

     =     would hold for all periods t. Rather than treating expectations
1T
s givens at any          point        in time,   the    policymaker would now choose monetary

growth     subject   to the condition that ir                  i holds   for all t.7 Because

the state variables are constant, it also follows here (from equation (4))

that it    = i, and (from          equation (6)) that R/t =

         The policymaker's objective still entails minimization of net costs--

which are now the same                for   all periods (see, however, n. 7 above)--

Given that ,1e       =       = i holds,      the optimizing value for the monetary growth

rate, denoted by , satisfies                     the first-order condition,

This condition       can be rewritten as



                                  =
                                      log( 12

If         is much less than one (which means that p              is   well below the purely

revenue-maximizing rate), then log(l_cj*)z -                ct.   The approximate solution

for 1.1*   can   then   be written as



       (23)          u l.10g(6A) jf * is                     much less than one.




Since people anticipate this monetary behavior under a rule, their expecta-

tions,               accord with        and   with   the actual inflation rate.-that is,

71*   = (e)      =




       Compare the choice of monetary growth under a rule,                    with   the value

of from equation (21), which arises under discretion. The growth rates of

money and prices tend to be higher under discretion for two reasons.8

First, by neglecting the interplay between monetary behavior and (future)

inflationary expectations, the discretionary policymaker ignores the costs

of expected Inflation. Therefore, the cost parameter k2 is absent from

equation (21), but is present in equation (23). Second, the discretionary

policymaker neglects the negative effect of higher anticipated inflation--

associated with higher expected rates of monetary expansion--on real money

demanded. This factor enters into the rules solution of equation (23)

through the parameter, 2c&. For the discretionary solution in equation (21),

a appears instead of 2a.


       Viewed alternatively, suppose that ii' were conjectured to be the equilib-

rium rate of monetary growth            under   discretion. This rate of monetary expansion
                                         18-




minimizes net costs in equation (22), given that e and ir move one-to-one with

i.    But,   jf ii   (at   all dates) were set by the formula in equation (23), the

discretionary policymaker--who is not bound to set i.i = U*__WOuld not find

this rate of monetary growth to be advantageous. Rather, a (surprisingly)

higher value for monetary growth, which depreciates more of the initial real
                                                       9
                                                           The increase in costs due to
balances (in each period), would be preferred.

added   inflation would be more than outweighed by the gains from additional
revenue. Of course, agents would not then maintain their inflationary
expectations at the         value indicated in equation (23). The full equilibrium

under the assumption of an         unrestricted policymaker is the   discretionary

outcome that is specified in equation          (2l).
        Net costs, Z, are lower under the monetary rule__1* in equation (23)--thafl

under discretion--'i in equation (21). It is unclear whether revenues are higher

under rules or discretion. Since monetary growth is higher under discretion

(n. 8 above), revenues will also surely be higher under discretion if the rate

i    from equation (21) is below the purely revenue-maximizing rate, which is

1/a in this model. Using equation (21), this condition holds if (OA/k1) <

expj(b+a)IaI.        (Because the discretionary policymaker does not internalize

the full consequences of his monetary behavior, it is conceivable that he

would choose a monetary growth rate that exceeds the revenue-maximizing rate.)



 Changes in the State Variables

        Given constant state variables, e and A, discretion and rules generate

 constant values for monetary growth, which are u and             respectively.   When

 0 and A move randomly over time, the discretionary choice of monetary growth
                                     -19-




also moves randomly, as shown in equation (18). What does a monetary rule

dictate when the state variables change? Suppose that we interpret a rule

as a commitment to a prescribed functional relation between       and the per-

tinent state variables__Or, At, '      a'   etc. Then, we could in principle

solve for the rule that minimizes the expected sum of net costs--that is,

the Zr's__in present-value terms. The expectations would be evaluated as of

some starting date (see below). Although I have not figured out how to

determine the best contingent rule of this type in the present model, it is

clear that such a rule would outperform discretion- -in particular, it would

be possible to deliver a lower level of Z, contingent on any configuration

for the state variables.11 Basically, the contingent rule differs from

discretion only because it allows the policymaker to internalize the relation

between monetary behavior and inflationary expectations. The consideration

of this linkage can only allow for better preformance, regardless of whether

o and A are constants or variables. (Note also that discretion is one form

of "rule" that is admissable to a policymaker who can choose among all pos-

sible contingent forms of action.)

     Alternatively, it might be argued that only simple commitments can be

adequately monitored and enforced. (The fact that I have not figured out the

optimal contingent rule in the present model may or may not be evidence in

this context.) Rules with a Lull set of contingencies may be infeasible.

Then, the operational choice would be between discretion and simple rules.

Discretion has the advantage of responding "flexibly" to movements in the

state variables. (This flexibility may be valuable in a model, such as

the present one, where it would be desirable to alter monetary behavior

in response to new information.) However, the nature of the response and
                                             -20-




the choice of average monetary growth under discretion are "wrong,t' because

they fail to internalize the connection between monetary behavior and

inflationary expectations. That is, the discretionary policymaker lacks the

valuable option of making binding promises (long-term contracts with the

public) about his future actions. A simple rule exercises this option, but

misses the flexibility of response to changes in the state variables.

      To illustrate, suppose that logO again moves as the random walk,


                logO =                   +
       (24)                 loge     1


For simplicity, continue to assume that At =                      A applies for all t. Suppose

that the only admissable form of rule is a constant-growth-rate rule. At

some starting date, 0, the policymaker makes a once-and-for-all, binding

selection of the monetary growth rate, .                Since At is constant, we also

have--for all periods after period

                                                    = ire=         . Further,
     time is constant in all periods after period 0 at the amount, R/T =

= Aexp(-a).      Net costs for any            period   t >    1     are therefore given by


                          t(k1+k2)         A            A              A

given by

       A comparison of equation (30) with equation (23)       indicates   that the

new feature is the variance term, a2. If a2 is higher, relative to r,

the value of the monetary growth rate,          is increased. Essentially,

the policymaker recognizes that the mean of          advances over time in

accordance with the value of a2. Given the assumed inability to match

  to et at     each date, the policymaker compensates partially by picking

a higher value for         at the start. Of course, as time passes, the rate

  is   likely to depart farther and     farther from the rate that would have

been chosen on a fully contingent basis. There might eventually be,

sufficient pressure to generate a breakdown in the constant-growth-rate

rule. But, in order to analyze this situation, we would have to specify

precisely the conditions that motivate a departure of monetary growth from

the value .        We   would then have a rule that allows   for limited contingencies,
although      not for a full set of these contingencies.

       It is possible to compare the outcomes from a constant-growth-rate

rule, as specified in equation (30), with those generated under discretion, as

shown in equation (21). It is now uncertain which method of operation delivers

the lower sum of expected present values of net costs (say, from period 1
                                  -23-




onward). The expected costs can be calculated explicitly for the two cases,

although the results are hard to interpret. Generally the relative sizes

of the two expected costs depend on the parameter values, c, b, A, k1, k2,

   and r. For example, a high value for k2 tends to favor the simple rule,

because discretion does not internalize the responses associated with this

parameter. However, a higher value for 2 favors discretion, because the

flexibility of adjustment becomes more significant as a2 rises.



Concluding Remarks

    The interaction between monetary behavior and inflationary expectations

determines the time path of inflation. In order to understand this interaction

and the mechanisms by which expectations are generated, we have to model the

money-supply process. In the present analysis monetary behavior reflects the

governmentts desire for inflationary finance, subject to some concern about

the costs of inflation. The outcomes depend heavily on the characteristics

of monetary institutions. Specifically, there are important distinctions

between discretion and rules. In a purely discretionary regime the monetary

authority can make no meaningful commitments about the future behavior of

money and prices. Under an enforced rule--such as a serious gold standard

or statutes that restrain monetary growth--it becomes possible to make these

conunitments, which amount to long-term contracts with holders of the govern-

ment's liabilities. Thereby, the policymaker can internalize some linkages

between monetary actions and inflationary expectations--some of these con-

nections are missing under discretion.

    The analysis distinguishes fully-contingent rules from commitments of a

simple form, such as a constant-growth-rate-rule for the money supply. Abstracting
                                 -24-




from costs of erecting and enforcing the rules, discretionary monetary policy

is always inferior to a fully-contingent rule. The comparison with limited

rules is ambiguous. The rules allow the internalization of some links between

policy actions and inflationary expectations, but discretion permits some

desirable "flexibility" of monetary growth.

    Generally, monetary institutions are important in two respects. First,

the characteristics of these institutions--such as discretion versus rules--

matter for predicting the actual course of monetary growth and inflation.

That is, institutional features matter at the level of positive analysis.

Secondly, it may be that economists' normative analysis of governmental

policy is usefully directed toward changes in institutions, rather than to

day-to-day operating procedures within a given regime. Whether this is so

depends on a positive theory of institutional choice, which is not well developed.

    One specific issue needs more attention. The contrast between discretion

and rules amounts to the distinction between no promises and fully-binding

promises. There seems to be a middle ground where policymakers can build up

a reputation--that is, credibility--which is based on past actions. We want

to know when these reputational forces will substitute satisfactorily for

formal rules of law--that is, for fully articulated monetary or price rules.

Reputation seems to work well in many types of private exchanges, as well

as in some areas of governmental policy. We want to know when reputation

will generate satisfactory outcomes in the context of monetary growth and

inflation.

would tend to be accompanied by a parallel rise in the cost parameter, k1.

These changes leave         and    unaltered over time.


      4As r ÷ 0 the variance of e/r approaches infinity. - In other words jumps

 in the money stock are required in order to maintain equality between money

 supply and demand at all points in time. However, the policymaker acts in

 this model to avoid jumps in the price level--see equation (15).


      5The term, a/T, appears in equation (18). The variance of this term

approaches infinity as T 4- 0.      Hence, jumps in the money stock can occur,

as discussed in n. 4 above.


     6The variance of the monetary growth rate, p,         is   infinite. However,

the variance of the log of the future money stock, log(M), is finite.


      71n some initial period where the rule is implemented, say date 0,

expectations need not be realized. That is,               p may apply. Under

reasonable assumptions, this element has a negligible impact on the

policymaker's once-and-for-all choice of the monetary growth rate.

    9This preference does not require any difference of opinion between

the policyinaker and the typical member of the private sector. The valua-

tion of revenues, O, reflects some externality (for example, from distorting

taxation). The inflation surprise lowers the welfare loss from this existing

distortion.


   10There may be other equilibria where people condition subsequent infla-

tionary expectations, rr1, ..., on the history of monetary growth, including

     (This conditioning arises in these cases although             affects no objective

state variables that appear from date t+l onward.) These types of reputationa].

equilibria are fragile because they always allow the policymaker to "cheat"

in the short run. (Recall from n. 9 above that this cheating may be

socially optimal, ex post.) An important issue is the potential for the

policyinaker to reinstate a reputation for low inflation--this process cannot

be too easy, or else cheating would always arise (and the equilibrium would

then be the discretionary one from equation (21)). Some discussion of these

matters appears in Barro and Gordon (1981, Section 6).

     11Rules would also deliver a variance for the inflation rate that

differs from the one generated under discretion in equation (20).            In a

larger model the forecast variance for the price level might enter into the

cost function, Z in equation (8), or in the money-demand function.

        Under reasonable assumptions, this element would not have a significant

impact on the policymaicer's once-and-for-all choice of monetary growth rate.

We would also have to consider whether the implementation of the monetary

rule were anticipated at earlier dates--that is, it may be inappropriate

to treat     as an arbitrary parameter.
