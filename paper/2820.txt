            IMPERFECT ANNUITY MARKETS, UNINTENDED BEQUESTS, AND TUE
               OPTIMAL ACE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS


                                   ABSTRACT




     The social   security program now provides a constant real
benefit throughout each retirees lifetime. This paper examines
whether total welfare would rise if benefits were lower in early
retirement years (when most individuals have some saving with
which to finance consumption) and higher in later years (when the
uncertainty of survival    and the absence of actuarially fair
private annuities makes the availability of social security
benefits more important.)
     The analysis shows that there is a potentially important
difference between the structure of benefits that would be
preferred by the current population of workers and retirees and
the structure of benefits that would maximize the steady state
level of social welfare. This difference reflects the role of
unintended bequests.

     The provision of higher benefits to older retirees reduces
individually optimal savings and      therefore the     level of
unintended bequests.  While those bequests may have no value to
the retirees, they are clearly of value to the young workers who
will receive those bequests.  More generally, the system of level
benefits raises the steady state level of the capital stock and
of total   real income.

     The present paper provides an explicit analysis of a case in
which the current workers want benefits to increase      with age
while the social    security  system that maximizes steady state
welfare would provide higher benefits to young retirees than to
the very old.

    Although individuals csn save while they are working to finance

consumption during their retirement years, they cannot purchase actuarially

fair annuities with which to spread their accumulated wealth over an

uncertain retirement period.    Because insurance companies cannot know as

much about individuals' health and life expectancy as the individuals

themselves,   an adverse selection problem leads to the underprovision of

annuity insurance.1   As a result, individuals are forced to leave

involuntary bequests and to consume less during their retirement and

preretirement years than an actuarial fair annuity would permit.

     In contrast to the limited voluntary private annuity market,

compulsory public social security retirement systems can provide actuarial

fair annuities.    This feature is a potentially important justification for

mandating social security retirement benefits even though the implicit

return on social security is less than the return on private investmenta.2

        It is perhaps surprising therefore that in practice the social
                                                   benefit that is fixed
security program provides each retiree with a real
for life.     It seems at least plausible that the social security program

should instead provide a lower level of benefits in the early retirement

years    (when most individuals have savings with which to finance

consumption)    and a higher level of benefits in later years (when the

uncertainty of survival and the absence of actuarial fair private annuities

makes the availabilityof social security benefits more important).           The

present paper examines this conjecture and shows the types of conditions

under which it may be true.

        The paper also indicates that there is a potentially important

difference between the structure of benefits that would be preferred by the

current population of workers and retirees and the structure of benefits

that would maximize the steady state level of social welfare.        This

difference reflects the role of unintendedbequests.      The provision of

                                                                 reduces
higher benefits in old age (i.e., in the later retirement years)

the amount that rational individuals will save for their old age.           This

reduced saving implies a reduced level of unintendedbequests.        While those

bequests may have little or no value in the eyes of the retirees, they are
                                                        those bequests.            If
clearly of value to the younger individuals who receive

the level of bequest to be received by those who are currently alive

reflects the social security benefit rules that existed in the past, those

who are currently alive may favor a system in which benefits rise with age

 even if everyone would prefer to live in an economy in which security

benefits are and previouslyhave been a constant real annuity.         The present

 paper provides an explicit analysis of a case in which the current workers
                                        3

want benefits to increase with age while the social security system that

maximizes   steady state welfare would provide higher benefits to young

retirees    than to the very old.

     It is useful to begin the analysis     f the   optimal age distributionof

social security benefits by considering the simple but extreme case in

which individuals are completely myopic: they do no saving and are

therefore completely dependent on social security benefits for their

retirement consumption.     Since such individuals do not save, there are no

unintended bequests and therefore no distinction between the optimal

structure of benefits from the vantage point of retirees and of younger

workers.     The socially optimal structure of benefits maximizes the welfare

of retirees.     Section 1 discusses the optimal age profile of social

security benefits in such an economy.
     Section 2 then goes to the opposite extreme and considers the

structure    of benefits that would be preferred by a young worker who is a

rational life-cycle saver but who ignores the value of the unintended

bequests received by the next generation.     The structure of benefits that

maximizes the utility of such an individual is shown to depend in a very

simple way on the implicit rate of return on social security,     the return on


private saving, and the probability that young retirees survive to old age.

It is shown that this solution also corresponds to the benefit structure

that maximizes the welfare of all those alive at a point in time.

     The third section derives the socially optimal benefit structure when

the effect of the benefit structure on the value of the unintendedbequests

received by the next generation of workers is explicitly recognized.      The

analysis shows that recognizing the value of unintended bequests can
                                         4

reverse the desired age structure of benefits.     The desirability       of

providing an actuarially fair annuity can be outweighedby the inefficiency

of social security as a savings vehicle when the excess savings are

transferred to the next generation through unintendedbequests.

     The analysis in this paper is restricted to extremely simple models in

order to separate the effects of imperfect annuity         markets,   individual

myopia, and the value of unintendedbequests.      A   realistic analysis of the

optimal age structure   of social security benefits would have to recognize

that the extent of economic myopia varies in the population3 and that soae

bequests are intended.4    A more complete diacussion would also consider the

character   of private group pension annuities, the possibility of means

testing additional benefits for the very old5, of a funded social security

system instead of the current pay-as-you-go approach, etc.


1.   The Optimal Annuity Structure with Complete Myopia

     The economy examined in this paper is an extension of the overlapping

generations model first developed by Samuelson    (1958).      Instead of the

Samuelsonian two-period framework, individuals are assumed here to work for

two period and then retire for either one or two periods.         All individuals

are alike and each has a probability p of surviving to the second

retirement period.    The population grows at rate n per period and wages

grow at rate g.

     If the number of new retirees at time t is       R,   the number of older

retirees who survived from the previous generation of new retirees is

as-you-go nature of the social security program implies the budget

constraint:


(1)
      blt Rt
             +    b2 pEtl — 9wL

      To focus on the optimal age structure of the annuity, I will assume

that the socisl security tax rate (9) and therefore total social security

benefits (Tt) sre fixed.             Since individuals are myopic and therefore do no

saving, the appropriate welfare criterion in this section csn be written as

a function of the retirees' consumption only.

      Each individual's utility during retirement will be written in the

separable    form           +            where          is consumption during the first

retirement period (i.e., the third period of life) end c4 is the

consumption during the second period of retirement if the individual

survives to have that consumption.                  I tske the relevant measure of social

welfare in each period to be the sum of the utilities of the retirees alive

in that period (since the utility of the myopic workers is independent of

the structure     of the retirement benefits):


         —                      +

by social security:         c3t         b1   and
                                                   c4 — b2.       The optimal design of the

social security benefits is then equivalent                   to maximizing

subject to the government budget constrsint given by equation (1).            It

follows immediately that u' —       v'   at the optimal levels of benefits.   Thus

if the two utility functions are identical, the optimal benefits of young
                                                       *         6    *
retirees and older retirees are equal in each period: b1 — b2.

      Since real wages are rising at rate g per period, the common level of

benefit is also increasing at rate g per period.          The equality of benefits

of the younger and older retirees at each point in time therefore means

that the optimal level of each individual's own benefits increases at rate

g between the early retirement period and the late retirement period.


2.    The Optimal Annuity Structure for Rational Egoists: The Initial
      Retirees

      The present section drops the assumption that all individuals are

completelymyopic in favor of the alternative extreme assumption that

everyone ia a rational life-cycle saver.          To show the importance of

unintended bequests, the analysis assumes that the individuals are

"egoists" who care only about their own utility and who give no weight to

the bequests received by the next generation.          Since the analysis in this

section completely ignores the effect of social security benefits on

bequests received, it represents the appropriate analysis for the "initial"

generation of retirees.       The results of this section can then be compared

with those of section 3 in which the individual utility criterion reflects

the effect of the age structure of social security benefits on the value of

the unintendedbequests that result from premature death, i.e., in which

the individual entering the labor force "chooses" the social security
benefit structure knowing that it will affect the bequests that he receives

as as well as the expected value of the bequests that he will make.

      Although the current criterion ignores the effect of the social

security benefit structure on the bequests that are made, the individual's

budget constraint does depend on the bequests that he received during his
own preretirement years.                 More specifically, the analysis now assumes that

each individual chooses s psth of desired consumption levels based on his

wage income, inherited bequests and social security benefits that maximizes

expected utility.              This consumption path implies the accumulation of assets

during working years which, together with the social security benefits,

finances consumption during retirement.                    If the individual dies at the end

of the first period of retirement, those assets are bequeathed.                      In

deciding his own path of consumption,                  the egoistic individual assigns no

value to those unintended bequest.                 No private annuities are available.

      To derive explicit results, I will now adopt the log-linear utility

specification7         used in the social security models of Feldstein (1985, 1987)

and posit that individuals who will retire in period t maximize

where k—l for        s-'4   and k — 0 for the previous periods.

      Substituting these optimal consumption levels into the lifetime

(9)    b1   +   pbp(l+n)          owt[(l+n)         (l+n)2]

total benefits)        is taken as fixed.          With b2      —
                                                                    b2     (1 +   g),   maximizing

it follows directly that the optimum is a corner solution in which all of

the benefits are paid either to new retirees or to older retirees but not

to both.

        More specifically, individual utility is an increasing function of

if (l+g)/(l+r) C        p/(l+n)   and a decreasing function of                    >
                                                               blt if (l+g)/(l+r)

p/(l+n).        Since both benefits must be non-negative,                (l+g)/(l+r) <    p/(l+n)
implies that the preferred social security program would be a lump sum to

new retirees with no benefits to older retirees,                    Conversely,     if

(l+g)/(l+r) > p/(l+n), the preferred program would psy no benefit to new

retirees and a lump sum to those who survive to the second period.

        To understand this result, note that the key inequality can be

reststed as a comparison of the survival probsbility p and the "efficiency

of social security," x —          (l+n)(l+g)/(l +r).          This term can be characterized

as the efficiency of social security becsuse it compares the implicit

return on social security [(l+n)(l+g)] to the return earned on private
                                               10

assets (l+r).8     Previous analysis (e.g., Feldstein          (1985)) has emphasized

that sinte social security is inefficient in the sense that x < 1, a social

security program is justified only to the extent that the provision of

benefits to those myopic individuals who would otherwise save too little

outweighs    the losses to the rational life cyclers who are forced to

sacrifice    a return of I +   r   in exchange for a return of (l+n)(l+g).

     In the present context in which the size of the overall social

security program is fixed and in which all individuals are rational life

cyclers,    the comparison of x and p indicates whether the gain from social

security's    ability to provide a fair annuity outweighs the loss due to its

lower rate of return.     If x C     p,   the return on social security is so low

that individuals are better off receiving a lump sum social security

benefit when they retire with no second period benefit at all.               Another way

of stating this is to note that x         <p   is equivalent    to (l+g) (1-i-n) < p(l+r),


i.e., the return provided by the social security annuity              [(l+g)(l+n)] is

less than the return from private saving reduced by the mortality

probability Ip(l+r) 1.
     In     the alternative case, the low return on the social security annuity

is nevertheless great enough to exceed the expected return on private

saving:      (l+g)(l+n) > p (l+r) or x > p.         In this caae, the preferred social

security program pays the benefits only to those who survive to the second

period of retirement.

     A    numerical example will indicate the nature of this comparison.

Assume for simplicity that younger retirees are age 70 (i.e., the midpoint

of the decade 65 to 75) and that older retirees are 85 years old.                For

American males, the probability that a 70 year old will survive to age 85
                                           11

is 0.49. Using the average annual growth rates of population              (1.4 percent)

and real wages (2.3 percent) for the three decades from 1950 through 1980,

the 15 year return on social security is (l+g)(l+n) —            1.73.   If the real

rate of return available on savings is six percent per year, for the 15

year period l+r — 2.40 and the efficiency of social security is x —

1.73/2.40   — 0.72 and therefore substantially greater than the survival

probability of 0.49.     In this case, benefits should be postponed and given

only to the older retirees.      If the return on private savings is taken to

be the pretax real return on nonresidential cspital or approximately 11.5

percent (see Feldstein, Poterbs and Dicks-Miresu, 1983), so that 1 +              r—
5.12 and the efficiency of     social security is only 0.34, the basic

inefficiency of social security dominates the effect of providing a fair

annuity (x C p) and therefore that benefits should be paid only to the

younger retirees.

     Two comments on the results of this section are in order.               First,

paying all of the benefits to the older retirees could csuse the

consumption path implied by equation 6 to violate the constraint that

                          that the potential bequest at the end of the first
c4 t+l      b2 t+l' i.e.,
retirement period must be non-negative.             If this constraint   is binding,   it

must be imposed explicitly and the optimal consumption path and optimal

benefits recalculated.     Doing so will imply sn interior solution for the

two benefit levels:     bi >   0 and
                                       b2 t+1
                                                >   0.   It can never imply that all

of the benefits should be paid during the first retirement period.

     Second, it should be emphasized that the extreme result that it might

be optimal to give no benefit in one of the two periods reflects the lack

of sny myopia in the population.        Whenever some individuals are omplete1y
                                       12


myopic,   it is necessarily optimal to pay benefits in both periods.

Although any realistic analysis of the optimal age structure of benefits

would have to deal with myopia as well as imperfect    annuity markets, the

basic analytic significance of balancing the imperfect annuity market and

the inefficiency of social security is clearer if myopia is ignored.


3.   Endogenous Bequests and the Optimal Steady State Age Structure of
     Benefits

     The results derived in section 2 show the age structure of benefits

thst maximizes the welfare of a representative worker of the initial

retiree generation.    It does not recognize that the bequests received by

each generation of workers depends on the age structure of the social

security benefits anticipated and received by a previous generation of
retirees.    Promising a high level of benefits to older retirees reduces

their optimal saving for their very old age and therefore reduces the

unintendedbequests that are made by those who die at the end of their

first retirement period.    A social welfare function that properly

recognizes that the welfare of each cohort is affected in this way by the
benefit structure faced by previous cohorts will imply that the optimal

level of benefit paid to older retirees is generally less than (although

possibly equal to) that derived in the previous section.

     The present section extends the analysis of section 2 by explicitly

recognizing the effect of the benefit structure on the level of unintended

bequests.    It shows that in a very simple model with rational life cycle

savers (no myopia), complete egoism (no altruistic bequests)   and

logarithmic utility functions,   the age structure of benefits that maximizea

steady state utility always gives all of the benefits to the younger
                                                   13

retirees unless social security is fully efficient                  (x   a l).    Thus in this

case the unintended bequests that result form the payment of early benefits

always outweigh the gain from providing an improved annuity as                       long as

private saving has a higher return than social security (x < 1).                       The key

reason for this difference is that the total return to saving for the older

age is now recognized as being received by someone --                    either   the surviving

retiree or the deceased retiree's heir -- and therefore as long as the

return on that saving exceeds the return on social security (x                     <   1), it

increases steady state welfare to have the funds invested in real assets.

       To analyze this problem, I assume that the unintendedbequests made at

time t are divided equally among all of the young workers alive at time

       A   worker who would have been an older retiree at time t but who dies

prematurely leaves a bequest equal to c4                —          the excess of planned

consumption over the social -security benefit that would have been received

had the individual lived.           Since the proportion 1—p of those in this age

cohort do die prematurely and there are (l+n)3 as many young workers as

there are members of the original cohort of older retirees, the bequest

received by each young worker is:

More generally, the other consumption terms can be derived using the

       The representativeutility function of equation 12 is maximized by

maximizing the cst.             The optimal steady state age structure of benefits is

therefore    obtained by maximizing equation 16 subject to the budget

where        A         does not depend on b1.      It follows immediately that stesdy

state social welfare is maximized by setting                      — 0 if the expression in

                               b1)
         Consider first the case in which social security is fully efficient,

i.e. ,       in      which x — 1.    The numerator of the expression is 18 to their

identically zero and steady atate welfare is not affected by the age

structure of the social benefits.

         In the more relevant case in which social security ia inefficient

(x < 1), equation 18 implies that it is optimal to pay all of the benefits

to new retirees: b2t — 0 and                b1 > 0.     To demonstrate this, assume first

that the denominator of the bracketed expresaion is positive.                   Note that at

p=O the numerator equals —x[l—x3] > 0 and at p—1 the numerator equals l—x

>   0.       Since the value of the numerator decreases monotonically with p (at

rate 1           —   x2),   the numerator is positive at all feasible values of

0        p        1.    It follows therefore that steady atate aocial welfare is

maximized by setting b2t               —   0 and having the highest value of        compatible
                                                                               b1
with the government budget constraint.

         For any given value of p, a low enough value of x makes the

denominator negative.                Although a literal interpretation of equation 18

would suggest that in thia case blt should be zero, this is a false

conclusion.              It is clear from the economics of the problem that reducing x

(i.e. ,          making     social security less efficient) increases the advantage of

giving benefits earlier.                This can be seen in equation 18 since, as long as

the denominator of the bracketed expressive is positive,                  the value of the

bracketed expression as a whole varies inversely with x.                   When x gets below
                                            17

a certain critical value, the sign of the denominator changes as the effect

of
     b1 on consumption and   steady state welfare appear (falsely) to he

reversed.   In fact, when x drops below that critical value the system

becomes unstable in the sense that the shift of benefits from the older

aged to the younger aged causes the ratio of inherited wealth to labor

income to increase over time without limit.           In such a situation there is

no steady state level of consumption and equation 18 is invalid.            It

remains true however that         — 0 and          > 0 maximizes the log-run path of
                             b2             b1
consumption and social welfare.

      It should be emphasized that the results of this section refer to the

benefit structure that maximizes the steady state level of social welfare.

The analysis of section 2 showed that the welfare of the initial generation

will be increased by paying benefits to older retirees whenever p < x.

Thus the optimal permanent structure of benefits is unambiguous only when

p < x.   In the reverse case (when social security is efficient enough to

outweigh the lack of private annuities) the optimal permanent structure of

benefits requires an explicit intertemporal social welfare function

balancing the utilities of different generations.          A   high enough discount
rate makes such an intertemporal welfare function equivalent to maximizing

the welfare of the initial generation.           As the discount rate declines, the

optimal structure of benefits shifts in the direction of increased benefits

for younger retirees.    See Feldstein (1985) for an explicit example of the

intertemporal welfare function in this context.

      More generally, the very strong result that paying benefits to younger

retirees maximizes   steady state welfare reflects the very special

assumption that everyone is a rational life-cycle saver.            Introducing
                                         18


myopia in the population would make it optimal to provide benefits for the

older aged as well.      What the current analysis brings out, however, is that

taking into account the effect on bequests of the age structure of benefits

reduces the ratio of the optimal benefit of older retirees to the optimal

benefit of younger retirees.


4.      Concluding Comment

        This paper has begun an exploration of the important issue of how

social security benefits should vary with the age of the recipient in an

economy with imperfect annuity markets.       Three formal results are derived.

                                                                         all
        (1) When everyone is myopic and has the same utility function,

retirees should receive the same benefit at each point in time.       In an

economy in which real wages rise with time, benefits rise as the individual

ages.

        (2) Egoistic rational life-cyclers in the initial generation of

retirees (whose inheritances are unaffectedby the structure of social
                                                                         if
security) prefer to postpone benefits until their later retirement years

and only if the "efficiency" of social security (the implicit return on

social security relative to the return on private investments) is high

enough relative to the probsbility of surviving from initial retirement to

older age.      When the "efficiency" of social security is low, they prefer

tenefits to be paid immediately upon retirement.

        (3)   Looking beyond the initial generation of retirees and taking into

 account the effect of social security benefits on the bequests to future

 generations     implies that steady state utility is maximized by paying

 benefits only to young retirees since shifting benefits to an earlier
                                       19


period increeses saving and therefore unintendedbequests and the aggregate

capital stock.

     Because the models analyzed here are very simple, the results are only

of suggestive and heuristic value.    The problem deserves further analysis

with more realistic models.    Such analysis would recognize the existence of

imperfect   annuity markets (rather than assuming that no private annuities

exist) and of private group pension annuities that are fixed in nominal

terms.   The role of individual myopia would be specifically incorporated.

The implications of imperfect annuity markets and unintended bequests for

the optimal size of the social security program and for the desirability of

means testing should also be explored.

1.   On the absence of actuarial fair annuities, see Friedman and tJarshawsky

(1985a, l985b).    In practice individuals may also not buy annuities because

of their lack of understanding of annuities or an irrational fear of

"betting" on a long life.

2.   See Feldatein (1985) for an analysis that shows that it may be optimal

to have no social security in an economy in which the implicit return on

social security is low even though individuals save too little privately

for their own old age.

3.   Feldatein (1985) uses two different models of partial myopia to discuss

the optimal level of social security benefits.       In one model, all

individuals are "partiallymyopic" and give less than the full weight to

future utility.    In the alternative model, a fraction of the population is

completely myopic while everyone else is a fully rational life-cycle saver.

4.   Even the distinction between intended and unintended bequests is

ambiguous when younger individuals do not know what their income will be

later in life.    See Feldatein   (1988).

5.   Feldatein (1987) discussed the conditions under which a means tested

social security program is preferable       to a universal program.

6.   Although it is of course possible to argue that differences in the

utility function imply a different benefit structure, it is not clear in

which direction this points.      Younger retirees may have a higher marginal

utility of consumptionat emch level of spending because they are healthier

and therefore able to engage in a broader range of activities.

Alternatively,    they older retirees may have a higher marginal utility of

consumption at each level of spending because they have higher fixed costs

for medical care and other personal services.   While recognizing both

possibilities,   the present analysis proceeds on the assumptions that both

utility functions are the same.   Note that even if the individual discounts

second period utility, the social welfare function reflects utility at a

point in time and therefore should not incorporate such a discount.

7.   The basic results derived here are valid for any homothetic utility

function.   Equations 6 and 7 show that maximizing lifetime utility is

equivalent to maximizing the present value of lifetime resources since

utility depends additively on consumption and consumption is each period is

proportional to the present value of lifetime resources, a property of any

homothetic utility function.

8.   Note that an "inefficient social security system (x < 1) corresponds to

an economy that is dynamically efficient in the traditional sense.

9.   The analysis here is in terms of the utility of a representative

individual in the steady state.   The analysis is easily shown to be

formally equivalent to maximizing the sum of all of the utilities    of

everyone alive at a point in time if the additively separable individual

utility functions are given the necessary cardinal interpretation.       A

complete intertemporal utility function requirea aggregating the utilities

of the "initial generation" whoae inheritances are unaffectedby the choice

of the age structure of social security benefits and the subsequent

generationa whose inheritances depend on the age structure of social

security benefits;   this issue is discussed further at the end of the

current section.

10.   A model that recognized that only some workers in each generation

receive bequests would lead to stochastic distributions of bequests and of

consumption among the individuals of each age cohort.   Because of

diminishing marginal utility, the unequal distribution of bequests would

reduce the welfare value of bequest (relative to the current model).

Recognizing the effect of the benefit structure on bequests would therefore

imply s smaller increase in the optimsl level of benefits of younger

retirees thsn when all are sssumed to receive equal bequests.

11.   This implies that the results of this section also hold for any

homothetic utility function.
