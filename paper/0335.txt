              Feedback and the Use of Current Information:

The   Use of General Linear Policy Ruacs in Rational Expectations    Mode]s




                               ABSTRACT


      The behavior of several stochastic   dynamic rational expectations models

is studied when policy behavior can be described by a linear rule. Four

policy components are distinguished: a current response component, a

feedback component, an open—loop component and a stochastic component.

Policy is evaluated in terms of the current and asymptotic first and second

moments of the state variables. The importance of distinguishing between

variability and uncertainty is brought out. The conditional variance is

argued to be the appropriate measure of uncertainty. The analysis is

applied to a model of foreign exchange market intervention.

1. Introduction

     In a number of recent papers (Kareken, Muench and Wallace [1973], LeRoy

[1975], Friedman [1975, 1977], Wog]otn [1979], Black [1976, 1977]. Boyer

[1978] Roper and.Turnovsky [1978], Siegel [1978] and Wogiom [1979]), th

ability    of the policy authorities to stabilize the economy has   been   shown

to depend in an important way on the extent to which the current value of
the policy instrument(s) can be made a function of current random distur-
bances——more precisely of the innovations in these disturbances. This
issue is especially important for financial policy and foreign exchange
market    intervention and exchange rate management. Financial policy in-

struments, be they financial asset stocks, interest rates or exchange rates

can be adjusted virtually continuously and costlessly. Some financial

market data (e.g., exchange rate observations, stock prices and trans-

actions in government debt) are observable and available on a fairly cur-

rent basis. Such currently observable data provide information about the

sources of random shocks to the economy. Financial policy should be con-

ducted in such a way as to extract the information contained in observ-

able financial market data and exploit it in achieving the authorities'

stabilization objectives.

     In this paper I evaluate the effect of general linear policy rules on

the behavior of a number of stochastic linear rational expectations models.

This extends the analysis of Aoki and Canzoneri [1979] who only consider

feedback policy. The implications of the policy rules are evaluated by

considering the first two moments of the joint distribution of the state

variables of the model. The short—run policy effects are measured by the

single period mean and variance. The long—run policy effects are evaluated

by considering the steady—state mean and variance (see also Turnovsky

[1976]).
                                               —2—


        The importance of           distinguishing   oetween variability and uncertainty

is   brought out. The current period variance can be vowed               as   the sum of

an anticipated component arid an             unanticipated   component. By   making   use of the
information contained in currently observed variables the policy authority
can reduce——and in the simple models of Poole, Boyer and Siegel eliminate——
the    anticipated variance of the target variables. It cannot affect the

unanticipated component. This unanticipated component is, as Siegel [1978]

points out, given by the conditional variance——the conditional second

moment about the conditional mean, where the conditioning information set is

the subset of the state that is currently observed.

        The formal analysis is presented in Section 2. An application to

Boyer's model of foreign exchange market intervention complements the

theoretical exposition.


 2. General Linear Policy Rules in Linear Rational Expectations Models

         The simplest possible linear rational expectations model is given in

 equation (1).

                t




 z is a vector of endogenous (or state) variables. x is a vector of
policy instruments. u is a vector of i.i.d. random disturbances with

 a zero mean vector and contemporaneous variance—covariance matrix EU

           is the rational           expectation of t as   of t—i. It is defined by

 ztlcj =     E(zI).                 I. is the information set, common to the public

 and private sectors, available at the beginning of period t—i.                 E is   the

 mathematical expectation operator. Equation (1) will be generalized in

 three directions represented in equations (1'), (1") and (1"').


 (1')           z =   Az1      1-

In   equation (1'), if policy at t can be based on information that became

available   in   t—l      (or t),   it will    he   based on more recent information than

was available when private agents formed expectations of                    in   period

t—2, even if     at    each point in time,          public and private agents have the

same information available. Multi—period nominal wage or price contracts

can generate models like (1').


(1")        z =   Azi +         BizI + BZt+iIt + Cx + Ut.

In (1") the current value of z depends on current expectations of the

future and on past expectations of the present. An example of such a

model Is an IS—LM model with a Lucas supply function. If Pt denotes the

log of the price level, current real output is a function of Pt t!t—l

The real interest rate will be a function of                         —     In    (1'") agents

       Note that E depends on the current response matrix G0 and on the

second moment of the stochastic component of policy,                         and .
Even if the current response matrix were the zero matrix and even if

policy behavior were non—stochastic (E =                         = 0),   policy will affect

the asymptotic variance of z, because E depends not only on e' but also

on A, which is a function of the feedback component C1. Both the first

and second moments of the steady—state distribution of                           will therefore

in general depend on the deterministic components of the policy rule, even

if there is no current response of the instrument vector to the state

vector.

         The unconditional single—period mean and variance of z


       From equation (5) it is easily seen that the unconditional single—period

(or current—period) expectation of z is:


(14)       E(z) = Atzt    1   + tt
                                         —7—



This is a function of the current rcsponse component,            in A andC,
of the feedback component          in      and of th? open—loop component x.
       The unconditional current—period or singl c—period variance of z is

(15)       E(z z')     = E(ee')     =
                                        e,t
Thus the single—period unconditional variance of z depends on the current

response component, G, and on the stochastic component, Li and                  It


is independent of the open—loop component            and of the feedback com-

ponent G. Boyer [1978], Roper and Turnovsky [1978] and Black [1976, 1977]

analyze foreign exchange market policies aimed at minimizing the uncon-

ditional single—period variance of real income. Woglom [1979] analyzes

a rational expectations extension of Poole's model (Poole [1970]) in which

a monetary policy rule is chosen that minimizes the single—period uncon-

ditional variance of real income. The policy rule consists of a current

response component and a feedback component. Woglom's conclusion that the

variance of real income is independent of the feedback component is correct

for the single—period variance but not for the asymptotic variance.

       In general, the stabilization policies pursued by the authorities can

be represented as the selection of values for the policy matrices that will

minimize some bilinear form       of    the appropriate variance—covariance matrix,

 i.e. minimize w E w with respect to C° and G1 or minimize w E w with
                                                           1 e 2

           The conditional single—period mean and variance of z

       The interpretation of the current response component of policy is by

no means obvious. The value of the policy instruments in period t, x, is

made contingent on     the   realized value of the state vector in period t,
                                                                                 z.
This   realized or equilibrium value of the state vector is in turn co—determined
                                       —8--


by the value assigned to the policy instrument vector n t. The ability to
plan and execute current policy decisions contingent on the current value
of the state vector, requires that      the state   vector can be currently ob-
served,     whoiiy or partly. Current policy is determined on the basis of at

least partial information about the current state. Such partial information

about the current state can be modelled in many ways. One          natural way to
proceed     is to take an errors—in—variables approach: the policy maker at
time       does not observe z but z =
       t
                                         z    c, where        is a random, i.i.d.
                                                                                   —
                                                                        1
observation error. If the true policy rule were x 0'Cz +                        + x,
this would provide an explanation of the error term v In the policy func-

tion, because the policy rule can now be rewritten as:         x =     Gz +             +
   +
       v,   where v =           This is not the approach adopted in this paper.

Instead I shall assume that when the response of       x to      is decided, the

policy authority observes some linear combination of the current state,

i.e. he observes           If     is invertible, knowledge of tYis equivalent

to the observation of z, as the policy authority knows                 We do not
assume       to be invertible but we do assume it to be of full rank. The

current response of the policy instrument is a linear -function               of this

currently accrued information. Thus the current response matrix G can

be viewed as the product of the current information matrix        tp   and the

true current policy response matrix G.

       If   the private sector has access to the same partial information as the

public sector, and if it is uncertainty about           rather than merely

ability of z that matters, the conditional variance of z rather than its

unconditional variance should be evaluated, with 'conditional'
                                                                            referring

Thus the conditional expectation of          is a weighted average of the uncon—

ditional expectation and the c.urrent partial observation on z. Consider

some special cases. In the information matrix                   is invertible, E(zIz) =

as if the complete state is currently observed. If the information matrix is the

null matrix, E(zI!1z) =        Azi +           When there is no information con-

ditioning the forecast, the conditional expectation equals the unconditional

expectation. Note that unless there is full current information, the con-

ditional expectation will depend on C0, C1,             ,   E       and E

This is indeed the most appropriate definition of the uncertainty about

the conditional second moment of z around the conditional mean of z. It

is instructive, however, to first consider the unconditional variance about

the conditional mean, given in (19).


(19)



Two    limiting   cases arise when     is invertible (the full current information

case) and when         is the zero matrix (the no current information case).

When       is invertible, the unconditional variance about the conditional

mean is zero. When          is the zero matrix the unconditional variance about

the conditional mean equals Ze the unconditional variance about the un-

conditional mean. The unconditional variance about the conditional mean

depends on the current information matrix            and on the determinants of

the unconditional variance about the unconditional mean,          e,t .    The   latter
is, as was shown in equation (10), a function of the current response

Let (zt —   E(ztII)) (z — E(zII)) be denoted by P. If                     is on n--vect:or,

   is the th column of A. To obtain the conditional expectation                  of A is

therefore   equivalent   to obtaining the conditional expectation of vec(A).

The information set conditioning the expectation is the variance—covariance

matrix of the disturbances,         and the current observation ' A 'p'. We can
                                e                                    ttt
express this in "vec" form by using the result that vec(ABC) = (C'               A) vec(B)
(Nissen [1968]). Thus the information set conditioning the expectation is


              =                              vec(E)'}
                               vec(P))',
We then apply the formula for the linear least squares predictor (see. Shiller

[1978]):

(20)
           E[vec(AY lIt] =   I[E(I'It)]' E(It'(vec(At))}
It is readily seen that the evaluation of (20) will in general be extremely

messy. E(I'It) and E[I'(vec(A))']involve expectations of fourth powers

of the elements of the z vector. The assumption of normality of the distur-

bances is therefore essential for practical purposes.

       It is quite easy to derive the explicit solution for the two—dimensional

case (z =
             (zi,   z2)') when only z1 is observed concurrently. This cor-

responds to the case studied by Poole [1970], in which the interest rate

(or money stock) is observed concurrently but real income is not. It is also

The simplicity of this result is due to the fact that z1 is observed con-

currently; E(z1_E(z1jI)ll) is therefore equal to zero. Because of this

special structure, the conditional variance about the conditional mean

equals the unconditional variance about the conditional mean, given by (19).

Note that the conditonal variance of the unobserved variable will be strictly

less than the unconditional variance, unless the errors in the reduced form

equations of the observed and the unobserved variables are uncorrelated, i.e. unless
                           2     —l =           —             2                      .

obtained by   minimizing (27) with   respect to the   policy instruments         and

     Thus   current response policy can alter (and in     general   reduce) the
anticipated   variability of currently unobserved real income. It cannot

alter the residual uncertainty (i.e. the unanticipated variance) of real

income, if private agents have the same information as the public economic

agent engaged in the current response policy.

     The essence of this result, that the policy authorities can affect the

single—period anticipated variance but not the single—period unanticipated

variance should survive generalization to a greater number of instruments

and state variables. Note however, that in the example under consideration,

the number of unobserved variables (1) equals the number of linearly inde-
pendent policy instruments (1). If the number of unobserved variables (or

more generally the order of the rank deficiency of the 'Y matrix) were to

exceed the number of linearly independent instruments, the policy authorities

will not be able to eliminate all anticipated variance. A trivial example

is a "model" consisting of a single stochastic state variable and no in-

struments. If the state variable is observed concurrently, the single—

period conditional variance Var(ztz) is zero. This however is not the

minimized value of the unconditional variance, Var(z), which is indepen-

dent of the non—existent instrument. If randomness is incorporated in the

policy reaction function, the single—period conditional variance will de-

pend on the stochastic component of policy. A multi—period objective
                   T
functions such as E      E(z till) will also yield a role for policy in
                    t=l
reducing true uncertainty.

     One— and two—period 1aged expec tat Ions of the current s tate


     To endow a macroeconomic rational expectations model, open or closed,

with the inertia or sluggishness in price and quantity adjustment character-

istics of many commodity and labor markets, it is necessary to introduce
                                                 —14—



expectations of z formed at several different dates                      before    t. The pro-
cedure will be illustrated              with ore-- and two—period forecasts of x. The

                                        finite length    of   the   forecast   horizon   can   be
extension   to an arbitrary

found in Aoki and Canzoneri [1979]. The new state equation is equation (1').

The "policy surprise" version of the model is obtained by assuming that x

is again included in z. b1 and b2 are the submatrices of B1 and B2 cor-

responding to xdti and xtk2. If —c                            b1 + b2, policy can only affect

the behavior of               via policy forecast errors. Because of the lag in ex-

pectation formation, however, deterministic feedback control (G) now can

affect the single—period variance of z. This is because policy forma-

tion can be. based on more recent information than was available to private

(and public) agents when some of the expectations that influence the cur-

rent state were formed.

        The rational expectations solution of equations (1') and (2) is most

easily found by the method of undetermined coefficients.                         After substitut-

ing (2) in (1') we obtain

Substituting    these expressions for                  and   into   (29) and equating
coefficients between (29) and (31) we obtain the following expressions for

R0, R1, R2 and R3 (all relevant inverses are assumed to exist).

As   pointed   out by Aoki and Canzoneri [1979], the number of lagged expecta-

tions of the current price can be extended without technical complications.

If the earliest forecast of z in a generalization of (29) is                    the

solution analogous to (31) will be a first order difference equation with

an (n_l)th order serially correlated disturbance vector.

       Equations (30), (31) and (32) make clear how the four components of a

linear policy rule, current response, feedback, open—loop and stochastic,

affect the probability distribution function of the z• The major dif-

ference between this model and the single period forecast lag model of

equations (5) and (6) is that the stochastic process that characterizes

the disturbances is now also affected by the feedback component of the

policy rule. The matrix R3, premultiplying the lagged disturbance term
                                1                  0
ei is a function of                 (as well as of Ge). As before we can derive the

unconditional asymptotic mean and variance—covariance matrix of z and the

conditional and unconditional single—period means and variances. For rea-

sons of apace this is left as an exercise.

                                Expectations     of the     future

       Rational    expectations models incorporating past or current expectations
of the future are significantly more difficult than ilioe incorporating only
past expectations of the present——the kinds of models considered so far.
The simplest case involves forecasts no more than one period into the future.
Such a model is given in equation (1"). Combining it with the poli.c.y rule
(3) we obtain:

         To find a unique solution for (33) therefore requires not only an

initial condition               for        but also a condition on the expectation forma—

tion process. With such a condition, which has frequently been chosen to
be a "terminal condition" on the asynptotic behavior of the forecasting
process, we can solve for z1_1 and thus also for            Substituting
these solutions in (33) we obtain the rational expectations solution of
the   model which can now be ured for policy simulation and optimization.
        To save space, I shall discuss the non—uniqueness issue in the con-
text    of the very similar model given by equation (1'"), which has economic

agents forecasting           more than one period into         the future.

        Combining   (1'") with the policy              rule (2) we obtain (35).

Siniply specifying an initial condition for        say z0, in (35) does there-
fore not suffice to yield a unique solution. (35) is a      second—order dif--

ference equation.      We need an additional set cf restrictions on the ex-

pectations formation process to yield a unique solution (see       Taylor [1977]
                                                                         formation
and Shiller [1978]). Sometimes the conditjon that the expectation
process be stable suffices to find     a unique solution, but thi.s is not   gen-

erally true. Another important aspect of the solution to         (37) has been
brought out by Shiller [1978]. Lead (37a) by k periods and take the con-

ditional expectation as of t—l. This gives:


(38)
       ZF1÷k t-l       IKK] [Kt+k+l+KKt+k]+ KKJKKzt1+kI t—l
                   + [I_K'K2]K2zt+2+kJ t—l

(38) is a partial difference equation in k and t.      It therefore requires an

infinite number of terminal conditions to specify the solution completely.

For each t, we. have a difference equation in k which requires an approprIate

terminal condition for its solution. For a different t, this whole process

needs to be repeated. In Shiller's words ". . .       . people   in effect change

their minds in each time period about terminal conditions"         [Shiller, 1978,

p. 26]. Clearly, the conceptual and technical problems involved here have

only just begun to be explored. Having found a solution for zt+llt_l we

 substitute it into (35)and obtain a model which no longer contains any

 expectations terms.

       A fairly arbitrary but simple way of cutting the Gordian knot of non—

 uniqueness is given by Chow [1978]. He assumes that for some sufficiently

 large T, ZT+lIT_1 is proportional or equal to              Substituting zT+l!T1 =

          into equation (35) for t = T, we obtain

of     will depend on the current response component of policy, C° and on

the stochastic components, Z and Z                          ,   but   not on the feedback component

G'. The asymptotic variance wiii however also depend on the feedback com-

ponent. The single—period unconditional mean and the asymptotic mean depend
                                  —20—



on the current response component , the iee(lb1f'k component and on the open—
1001) component, which i enibecided in K?.

     Conclusion
     The scope for policy in the four models given by equations (1) — (1'")
can be summarized as follows. The conditional and unconditional means of
the state vector z, whether single—period or asymptotic, will depend on

the three non—stochastic policy components, C0, G1 and x .      Through its
dependence on e' the conditional mean will also depend on the stochastic

component of policy. The asymptotic variance will depend on all four policy

components. The unconditional single—period variance will depend on the cur-

rent response component and the stochastic component, but not on the feed—

back component, except in the case of model (1') which incorporates several

lagged forecasts of the current value of z.

     If variability of z, whether anticipated or unanticipated, is of con-

cern to the policymaker, the unconditional variance is the appropriate focus

of policy concern. If uncertainty about z, i.e. unanticipated variability

      is what matters, the conditional variance is the appropriate object

of policy design. In Poole's and Boyer's models the single—period

conditional variance of output is independent of the current response

component of policy. The design of optimal linearpolicy rules in

stochastic dynamic rational expectations models along the lines sketched

here, has applications in virtually all areas of macroeconomic stabiliza—

tipn policy.
